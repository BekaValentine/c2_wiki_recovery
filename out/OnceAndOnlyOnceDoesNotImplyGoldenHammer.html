        Once And Only Once Does Not Imply Golden Hammer
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page is created in order to counteract a fallacy being perpetuated by certain individuals... namely, that use of two or more existing mechanisms to do something is a violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> (which, taken to its logical extreme, implies that we should all wield a <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>).  It has been asserted:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That use of "eval" functionality (executing dynamic strings discovered possibly at runtime, and possibly sucked out of a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>) duplicates the functionality provided by such things as closures and lambdas.  (For that matter, what about plain vanilla functions?). {See <a href="DynamicStringsVsFunctional.html">DynamicStringsVsFunctional</a>} 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use of data structures which can be simulated (albeat poorly!) with a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a> duplicates the functionality provided by a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>. {<a href="AreTablesGeneralPurposeStructures.html">AreTablesGeneralPurposeStructures</a>}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Unfortunately for Top, that isn't what <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> is about.  <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> has to do with avoiding redundancy in what the  programmer specifies to the compiler (or interpreter).  In the world of databases, it's about keeping your tables in <a href="ThirdNormalForm.html">ThirdNormalForm</a> or better.  In the world of code, it's about <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> common behavior into classes, generic functions, or other polymorphic language features; it's about not duplicating code (or data) all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, it's about <a href="DontRepeatYourself.html">DontRepeatYourself</a>.  It's about the new code that <strong>you</strong> write--programmers are wasting effort (and inviting errors due to inconsistency) if they do the same thing more than once.  .  It's <strong>not</strong> about selecting among pre-existing mechanisms, and having to choose only one option.  If something already exists, using it is not a violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, even if its functionality  overlaps with something else that already exists.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if the application programmer was engaging in <a href="GreenSpunning.html">GreenSpunning</a> and inventing his own tools, Top might have a point.  But we're not talking about that sort of thing at all; we're discussing the reuse of pre-existing tools and abstractions.  And when something already exists, there is no harm in choosing more than one such tool for different parts of a problem.  That isn't a violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>; it's just good engineering practice.
      </p>

        <em>Well, </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> can apply to lots of things. It may not always indicate a catastrophic technical failure, but rather a smell. It could be a big smell or a small smell. The simplest-but-powerful tools are tools whose features are generally orthogonal each other. A compact tool kit would not include two hammers of similar size, for example. Databases and "complex data structures" fight over similar territory. So does string substitution and FP concepts such as closures and higher-order-functions. This overlap is not necessarily fatal, but takes points off of the "clean design" category. How many points? Well, that is where the debate lays. The trick is to have a <strong>high power-to-feature ratio</strong>. Overlaps of the kinds descussed here reduces that ratio. This does not mean that we burn everything with such smells, but rather think long and hard about them. -- top<em></em>
