        The context is often making a product that will have quite complex or unusual technical or functional constraints such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           High end availability and/or scalability,
        </li>
        <li>
           Mathematical complexity,
        </li>
        <li>
           Huge amount of data,
        </li>
        <li>
           Huge transactional throughput,
        </li>
        <li>
           Very complex business rules,
        </li>
        <li>
           Extreme parameterization,
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="NotTheAppropriateProtocol.html">NotTheAppropriateProtocol</a>,
        </li>
        <li>
           NotTheAppropriateTechnology,
        </li>
        <li>
           etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For sure, you can make a big fuss about this product which honestly has incredible features. The project that follows is generally reviewing objectives far lower.

        I think of this as "Design by Contract."  The contract is signed, so we've got to write these features!
