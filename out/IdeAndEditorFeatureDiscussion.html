        Ide And Editor Feature Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Things you like, hate and/or want in an IDE or code editor.

        <strong>Intellisense (auto-guess)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes pop-up auto-guess is annoying, distracting, and/or it hides information you want to see. I'd like an option to put auto-guess info in a <strong>side</strong> code panel box, and either make the list selection happen in the side panel via a function key or the like, or only pop the selection list near the text cursor if a special key is pressed. Often I'd prefer it not covering the code text until I actually want to select a guess from the list. For example, when I'm typing the code, the auto-guess panel on the side displays the current candidate guesses; it's not covering any code. If and when I wish to select a guess, I can either mouse over to the panel to select a guess, or hit a certain easy-to-press key, perhaps a function key (and/or maybe right-click), to put the selection list near the text cursor.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a slightly different note, if a code editor <strong>does not recognize a given language</strong>, it should still optionally offer the ability to index and display (to auto-guess panels) the tokens or names in the current document and/or a selected folder branch. The ability to parse the code in a language-knowledgeable way is not necessary for some degree of auto-guess. (Perhaps a priority file could be optionally specified so that one can tell it which tokens to favor.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifying "split" characters/tokens may also be helpful. Typically a token like "123.$foo.bar" would be indexed both as the complex string "123.$foo.bar" and as split into each of "123", "$foo", and "bar". By default a period would probably be a split character/token but a dollar sign not, but this may be user configurable to tune per language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Meander and Return</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Often times I wish to go look somewhere else in a code page and then return. One approach is a book-mark, but often one has to remember to remove them or else they don't work as intended. Instead, I'd prefer a pop-up sub-code-browser that allows me to scroll around in the same file, in read-only mode, and then close it when done.

        <em>Not that anyone asked, but I wrote an </em><a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> function that does what I believe is being described:<em></em>

      <code>

        (interactive)<br/>
        (clone-indirect-buffer-other-window (buffer-name) t)<br/>
        (view-buffer (current-buffer)))<br/>

        In my observation, Emacs has everything, and that's part of its problem: it overwhelms one via feature OD. --<a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a> (who does not wish to elaborate on this comment)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>An extensive and powerful toolbox is only overwhelming "feature OD" if you prefer tedious editing to learning features that will save you significant editing time and effort.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To get power, I'd prefer something that's fairly simple out of the box, but comes with a good kit/API for building what one needs by programming event handlers. Ideally it would use smartly-designed packaging with common but flexible editing idioms. A "fractal framework" similar to "Dealing with Deviations from Framework" in <a href="HelpersInsteadOfWrappers.html">HelpersInsteadOfWrappers</a> is the kind of thing I like. I know Emacs is highly programmable, but I'm not sure I'd agree that API is well-designed; plus I'd prefer an <a href="AlgolFamily.html">AlgolFamily</a>-style language, not Lisp, due to familiarity (at least). A well-designed API is the key. Maybe it's not possible and I'm dreaming. But I'm hopeful a clever API designer will come with something great. 
      </p>

        <em>If you're not happy with </em><a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a>, why not use it to create an Algol-like parser that works with the built-in <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> capability?<em></em>

        <strong>Easy theme creation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to right click on a comment, keyword or other language construct and be able to change color, font and other syntax highlighting settings. I should be able to save either universally or per-language/mode.
      </p>

        <strong>Search dialog and exceptions to the rule/norm</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A reoccurring annoyance is the "Search" dialog box remembering my last scope setting. If I last did an "entire project" scope, it brings that up again, but that's often not what I want and I forget to set it back because usually I only search current file. I'd prefer if it forgets the prior scope and defaults back to "current file". At least make that an easily discoverable option. Or perhaps highlight with a yellow border those settings that deviate from the normal or user-defined standard, including the others like case sensitivity. That way I don't have to read every attribute to make sure it's not in a rare setting that trips me up or sends the machine on a wild goose chase.
