        Save Lots Of Money
      </h1>
      <p>
        To get <a href="SimpleDesign.html">SimpleDesign</a> adopted, suggest that you'll be saving a bundle by not spending as much on big, expensive, useless "tools", "frameworks", or "solutions".
      </p>
      <p>
        Applies to all aspects of development, even - and maybe first and foremost - to the development infrastructure. Compare <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> to track the few bugs (only they're just defects) versus some expensive <a href="BugTrackingSoftware.html">BugTrackingSoftware</a> - even if it's an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> product, it's going to cost a bundle just on people-time - installing, configuring, and getting used to it. PERT tools versus <a href="IndexCard.html">IndexCard</a>s.

        No, it's much simpler than that:
        <strong><em>"If we use a simpler design, we won't have to write and maintain as much code."</em></strong>
        Less code = less money.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This seems to be a common </em>benefit<em> of </em><a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. Perhaps this <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> should relate to the persuasion tactic, and that 'LessCodeLessMoney' is a different or related <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is there any evidence that this persuasion tactic works? -- RH</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I tried the "won't have to write and maintain as much"-approach, but people simply don't believe it's possible to write less. My guess is that the "no expensive tools" approach can work better.</em>
