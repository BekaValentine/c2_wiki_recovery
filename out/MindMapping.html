        The process of creating a <a href="MindMap.html">MindMap</a>.  Obvious, really, and perhaps this shouldn't exist as a separate page.

      <p>
        If you think that, perhaps you can search for <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s and "fix" them.  Alternatively, put more content on this page to justify its separate existence.
