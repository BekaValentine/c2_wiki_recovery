        Financial Planning
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are several types of financial planning processes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One process is personal financial planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal financial planning is a systematic series of specific steps to make sense of many complex and separate components of a person or family's economic wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Major areas of focus include but are not limited to retirement planning, estate planning and estate tax, state and federal income taxes, investments and securities planning, employee benefits and insurance. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course, the above is an ideal rarely found in reality.  "Financial planning" is usually a "service" offered by a bank to encourage its customers to give more money to the bank.</em>
