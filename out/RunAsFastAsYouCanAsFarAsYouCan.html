        Run As Fast As You Can As Far As You Can

        <em>Run as Fast as you can and as Far as you can </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's impossible to run as fast as you can, as far as you can.  At some point, you make the tradeoff and either: a) pace yourself, so you can go farther, or b) sprint, so you can go faster. That's only two variables. Now consider the <a href="FourVariables.html">FourVariables</a>.

        What do you do when you're expected to write code that is as high quality as possible, as cheap as possible, as feature-complete as possible, and as quickly as possible?  
      </p>
      <p>
        You do the same thing as problem-solvers have been doing for centuries:  You burn yourself out trying to fulfill <a href="IncompatibleGoals.html">IncompatibleGoals</a>.  It's completely up to chaos to decide which goals, if any, that you successfully fulfill.

        Solution: (discussed elsewhere, but worth reiterating):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Explicitly choose your variables.	
        </li>
        <li>
           Pick a distance, and run it as fast as you can.  Or, 
        </li>
        <li>
           Pick a speed, and run as far as you can.  Or, 
        </li>
        <li>
           Pick a quality, cost, and deadline, then allow yourself some leeway by varying scope.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="RunAsFastAsYouCanAsFarAsYouCan.html">RunAsFastAsYouCanAsFarAsYouCan</a> from the project/employer. Or,

           Use <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> techniques to balance these business values. That is called <a href="BusinessValueOrientedProgramming.html">BusinessValueOrientedProgramming</a>.
