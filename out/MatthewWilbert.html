        I am a sometime programmer, previously procedural, working on becoming more objective, but not more objectionable.  My current means to this end is working
        with Java on small projects.

        Found this site while browsing for pattern information sources--it is extremely 
        interesting, and the hypertext environment is also pretty cool.

        Although at this point is hard to imagine why anyone would want to contact
        me, I can be emailed at <a href="mailto:mwilbert@alum.mit.edu.">mailto:mwilbert@alum.mit.edu.</a>

        Probably about a day after I wrote this, I switched almost completely to Python.
        Just got around to mentioning it!  9/21/2002
