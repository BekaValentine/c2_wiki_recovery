        No Need For Column Names
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have been thinking, true relational databases (following the <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> recommendations) would have language with strong capabilities to create domains, and therefore, they would have no need for column names.. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well in SQL you need column names because you define a table like this: Person (FirstName:String, LastName:String, BirthDate: Date), but, with a language that makes it really easy to create custom domains (user defined types) a relvar could be defined as: Person (FirstName, LastName, BirthDate), with FirstName and LastName deriving from String, and BirthDate deriving from Date.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unless you're planning to reference columns by position, you haven't eliminated column names.  You've imposed a requirement that a column's name be the same as its type name.  It might be a useful shorthand for defining </em><a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>s that simultaneously enforces the appropriate use of types, but I don't see it changing anything else.<em></em>
