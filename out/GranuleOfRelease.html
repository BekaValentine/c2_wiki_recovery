        Granule Of Release
      </h1>
      <p>
        A software <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a> (or <em>unit of modularity</em>) is a collection of software with the following attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Performs, or contributes to, a specific functionality
        </li>
        <li>
           All software within the <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a> is necessary for completion of that functionality; it would be difficult to use only part of the <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a>.  (It may be possible for specific such granules; but you shouldn't depend on that).
        </li>
        <li>
           May depend on other GranuleOfModularitys (bad plural, I know); however <em>the dependency graph among </em>UnitsOfModularity should not contain any cycles<em>. Cycles among classes (etc) </em>within<em> a </em><a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a> are generally OK, though they should be short (no more than 2 or 3 participating entities); anything larger indicates that <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> may be necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a> is the granule of reuse - see <a href="ReuseReleaseEquivalencePrinciple.html">ReuseReleaseEquivalencePrinciple</a>.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Names given to granules of release in various languages and various works in TheLiterature include: class, module, package, cabinet, library, component, etc. Unfortunately, this is one area where the terminology could use some harmonization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The phrase <em>granule of release</em> is chosen to avoid collisions with any of the above.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Many practitioners of various languages/paradigms insist that a particular language feature (such as the "class" or "module") is the proper granule of release. Languages which force the <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a> to be a particular size usually result in maintenance/configuration headaches. That said, the <a href="UnitOfModularity.html">UnitOfModularity</a> generally shouldn't be smaller than a single class or stand-alone function. (Some languages require the <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a> to be a class or first-class object; but allow other classes which do not have this functionality; that's OK. What is objected to is the notion that <em>all</em> classes should be releasable components).
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to be confused with the <a href="GranuleOfDeployment.html">GranuleOfDeployment</a>. The <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a> should be smaller than the <a href="GranuleOfDeployment.html">GranuleOfDeployment</a>.
