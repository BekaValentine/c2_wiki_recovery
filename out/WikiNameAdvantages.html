        Wiki Name Advantages

      <p>
        Although <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> have limitations, the constraint they impose is helpful in a few ways.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Syntactic constraints encourage creative thinking.</em> Why do poets write sonnets and haiku? Because working under artificial constraints forces you to think better. (See <a href="DouglasHofstadter.html">DouglasHofstadter</a>'s <a href="LeTonBeauDeMarot.html">LeTonBeauDeMarot</a>. See also <a href="WikiWordsAreConcepts.html">WikiWordsAreConcepts</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Constrained names reduce the need for guesswork.</em> When you're writing or editing a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>, you don't want to waste time wondering whether you should say "<a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>" or "Wiki nature" or "Wiki-nature" or "Nature of Wiki" or "The nature of Wiki" or what. So, in practice, you're going to guess. Which means that half of all <a href="DanglingLink.html">DanglingLink</a>s will probably be gratuitously broken. It's like the <a href="WikiNamePluralProblem.html">WikiNamePluralProblem</a>, only worse.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Short names help concept formation.</em> Someone said somewhere that <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> create concepts. I think that's an important insight. It's not just the fact that they're short that helps <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> to get associated in your head with particular ideas, though; it's also that...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Typographical distinction helps instant recognition.</em> Sure, links are likely to show up in blue (or whatever) anyway. But the fact that they all have that <a href="WikiCase.html">WikiCase</a> look helps.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None of this means that the existing scheme is perfect. There might be ways to make it better. But don't underestimate the possibility that <a href="ThatsNotaBugItsaFeature.html">ThatsNotaBugItsaFeature</a>. Any possible change should be considered in the light of issues like these.

        Over use of <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>s can lead to <a href="WikiNameInRealLifeSyndrome.html">WikiNameInRealLifeSyndrome</a>.  See also <a href="WikiNameDisadvantages.html">WikiNameDisadvantages</a>.

        The advantage of <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> is that it brings about distinctions and definitions of concepts and ideas that are valued by the namer. "To describe is perhaps to value"
