        Resource Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        What subjects and concepts go into resource management in an <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> (the most general case)?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> of every resource (see comments in <a href="DeterministicResourceManagement.html">DeterministicResourceManagement</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The most important is probably resource allocation, meaning quotas and scheduling. Unfortunately, quotas are rarely if ever implemented. And the few places they are implemented, they're extremely coarse-grained. For example, quotas for entire filesystems or for users. What's really needed is fine-grained quotas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people may question the need for quotas, but then again, they've never used a system which allows sharing of objects between users. Unix doesn't and neither Mac nor Windows are even multi-user. And then there's the rarely considered fact that scheduling is a form of resource allocation, and that process priorities are a form of quota. Bad quotas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proper way to do quotas is to make them dynamic and event-driven. The essential features of the system are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           each node of the graph has a size, an allocated quota and a reserved quota
        </li>
        <li>
           each node's size + reserved quota can't be greater than its allocated quota
        </li>
        <li>
           each node can ask its parent nodes for more reserve
        </li>
        <li>
           a node can grant requests to its children
        </li>
        <li>
           a node can unilaterally revoke reserves granted
        </li>
      </ul>
