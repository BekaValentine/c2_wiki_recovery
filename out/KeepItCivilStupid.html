        Keep It Civil Stupid

        Use civil language and maintain a civil tone. Don't write in email what you wouldn't say face-to-face in front of your own mother ;-)

        This, of course, works until you find an ass willing to say -- unabashed -- the most uncivil things in any company.  You know, "<a href="ChronicallyRight.html">ChronicallyRight</a>" and "must have the last word" and "brutally frank" and "for your own good" sorts of asses. (<em>Some people </em>'would<em>' say these things face-to-face to their own mother.</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        From their viewpoint, civility is the refuge of the hopelessly stupid, so why bother?  I have a participant (on an e-List that I manage) who is a shining (blinding?) example of this.

        The admonition to be civil only works with those already inclined to be civil.  For those outside this set, a <a href="TwoByFour.html">TwoByFour</a> adjustment tool may be required.
