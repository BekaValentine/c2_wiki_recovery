        Hi, I am Jawad Akhtar.  I am currently working as part of a team on the LifeAware™ project (<a href="http://www.LifeAware.net)in">http://www.LifeAware.net)in</a> my spare time.  We are honored to have been selected by the judges as one of the top 50 finalists.  We did not win or place in the final 20 but very interestingly, Google just released Latitude which is suspiciously similar to the LifeAware application (including some text for features).  So I guess, imitation is the best form of flattery, but it confounds us that our app did not place in the top 20 apps by Google judges.

        During my regular work hours, I am an Enterprise Architect (contractor) at Farm Service Agency of the US Department of Agriculture in Kansas City, Missouri. I am employed by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).  I worked on a project with Ward Cunningham a few years ago at Sprint.  I am a Smalltalker at heart and have experience with Object Studio (ENFIN), <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a>, and <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>.    I am actively involved in the study of patterns in the stock market.

        Due to LifeAware™, I don't seem to have much time for additional extracurricular projects anymore. I do have several other ideas for mobile apps that will eventually get implemented. Yet, with my focus on solving the big picture enterprise problems, I have not had much time to write code.
