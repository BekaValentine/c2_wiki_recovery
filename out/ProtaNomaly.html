        Protanomaly is the second most common type of colour weakness (a mild type of so called <a href="ColorBlindness.html">ColorBlindness</a>). Like most people, they have three channels but their red channel is shifted towards green. As with <a href="DeuteraNomaly.html">DeuteraNomaly</a>, protanomaly causes red-green color on background combinations to jump out less and reduces distinctions between small hue differences in the red-yellow-green region, but instead of deep greens appearing black, there is instead a darkening of the red end of the spectrum. This can cause browns and dark reds to be mistaken for black.
