        Hell Raiser
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Hellraiser series (with the exception of the third) are great horror films.  Yeah, they've got the over-the-top violence and gore standard in this genre, but get past that.  There is an underlying story throughout the whole series that ties it all together and gives it far more life than the standard horror film.

        Clive Barker's vision of Hell in the second film is a refreshing change from the usual Christian themes you see.

        The series contains the famous Lemarchand's Box.

        Classic horror.  Though things have really gone down hill since #3.  I see that #5 is out direct-to-video.  I dread to watch it (even though Doug Bradley is back as Pinhead). --<a href="StuCharlton.html">StuCharlton</a>
