        Dont Build With An Ide
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some companies release software by having one the the developers compile the product on their development computer by manually operating an IDE like <a href="VisualStudioDotNet.html">VisualStudioDotNet</a>.  If they press all the right buttons and have all the components correctly installed, a successful build results and is shipped to customers.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Level 2 of <a href="BuildSystem.html">BuildSystem</a> maturity.  On a special build box a BuildMonkey presses all the right buttons to produce a build, which is then shipped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Level 3 is including all the needed components, compilers, linkers, headers and libraries in the code repository. Then you have one big build script (Makefile) build it all!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>All of the IDEs I've used for the last 7 years can invoke the same build scripts that produce the production deliverables.  There's only one "right button" to push and it's clearly labeled.</em>
