        Hello there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a seasoned project manager and software engineer with many years of experience in embedded and mobile software development, processes, and team management. I currently work for PerfectMind in North Vancouver, BC, Canada. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My main focus for the last ten years or so has been R&D management, project & portfolio management, process improvement, and quality. I have used many different methodologies and prefer the agile way of thinking. Simple is better.
