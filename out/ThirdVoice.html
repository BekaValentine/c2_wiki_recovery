        Third Voice
      </h1>
      <p>
        Third Voice was <a href="WebAnnotation.html">WebAnnotation</a> software: a way to "post sticky notes" with your comments on any site on the Web.
        Others in your group, or everyone using the Third Voice product could see them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a kind of "usenet news group" enabling people to talk about the content of sites, and point to the content they're talking about.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No changes were made to the target sites.
        </li>
        <li>
           Users could only see the notes if they obtained the Third Voice plugin for <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 4.0.
        </li>
        <li>
           Users could "turn off" the notes when they got tired of looking at them.
        </li>
        <li>
           Users needed to register (free membership) to post notes.
        </li>
        <li>
           Notes may (or may not) have been deleted at any time, based on unclear policies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="ThirdVoice.html">ThirdVoice</a> was unpopular with many Web site owners, who were disturbed by the idea of people posting critical, <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, or obscene material that would be presented on top of their site. Legal action was discussed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people felt the plug-in was too intrusive, or the content too sparse. It was similar in style to the SmartTags <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> added to <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> (and soon withdrew due to widespread criticism).
      </p>

        Third Voice stopped its service in April 2001. Its Web site, <a href="http://www.thirdvoice.com/,">http://www.thirdvoice.com/,</a> is defunct as of 2002-11-30. Amusingly, the Web site of the "Say NO to Third Voice" campaign outlasted it by several years before disappearing itself. [<a href="WaybackMachine.html">WaybackMachine</a> copy of the latter: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050204121018/http://www.worldzone.net/internet/pixelsnttv/]">http://web.archive.org/web/20050204121018/http://www.worldzone.net/internet/pixelsnttv/]</a>
