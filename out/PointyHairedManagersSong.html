        Pointy Haired Managers Song

        Being that <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is about <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a>, <a href="AntiPatterns.html">AntiPatterns</a> in particular, here is a G&S parody about that personification of the <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> (or in this song, the PointyHairedManager.  That's Haire'd, with two syllables.  Otherwise the meter doesn't fit.  So sue me).  This parody isn't the equal of the masters (nor of KevinWalds fine opus), but here goes anyway.

        I'll dispence with the surrounding dialogue from the libretto... as the libretto has yet to be written.

        I am the very model of a PointyHairedManager<br/>

        I've read the works of Deming, Brooks, Taguchi, and Phil B. Crosby<br/>
