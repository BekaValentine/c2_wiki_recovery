        Certainty Isa Smell
      </h1>
      <p>
        Certainty in one's conviction about complex IT tools, definitions, and options is probably a sign that one is full of it. If there where a sure-shot proof that X was always better in all aspects and situations, somebody would have discovered and written down the mathematical proof already. (If you have a new mathematical proof, please do provide it.) I will staunchly defend my positions using my knowledge, experience, and reasoning as best I can articulate, but accept that I may be flat wrong on my opinions and welcome strong and hopefully objective contrary evidence. I don't belittle others for not accepting my opinions as if the other person is <em>defective</em> for not accepting my beliefs. (Admitted, I might be rude in <em>other</em> ways.) -t

        Your high degree of certainty with such little presentable evidence about what those "stacks of books" say about variables, types, and value is frustrating. It seems to be an aggregate opinion where the <strong>details</strong> that made up that aggregate opinion <strong>are lost</strong> or not presented. If I were so certain that bunches of pieces of evidence "added up" to such a strong position, I would be obligated to provide those DETAILS, not just the summary. It is technically possible to save a sufficient sample of book definitions, and analyze each one to make sure your interpretation is the only realistic one, but let the readers see both the quotations and your uniqueness analysis so that they can verify your aggregation-to-certainty logic and calculations. (Note that it's still possible to cherry  pick samples. Verification of their selection randomness may still be needed.) -t
