        Separate Io From Calculation
      </h1>
      <p>
        A special case of <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a>.

      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Methods are not reusable because they have too much responsibility. In particular, they do IO and they also calculate, so whenever you want to do one of those things, you end up doing both.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Separate IO and calculation as much as possible. Methods which do either IO or do a calculation are considered reusable. Methods which do both are not considered reusable, because whenever you want to do one of them, you end up doing both..

        <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> is a rule you can't follow all the time. Somehow, you must glue together I/O and calculation. For better reuse though, having functions that do I/O and functions that do calculation is better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: You have a method that calculates sqrt and prints sqrt at the same time. It is called from several thousand places in your program. Then you need to calculate sqrt but you don't need to print it. Or you need sqrt of the same number several times, but you don't want to calculate the expensive operation several times.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is better to separate this method into calculateSqrt and printSqrt. printSqrt is so similar to print that probably it is better to just use print. Then calculateSqrt() can be simply called sqrt().

        Some of the <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> definitions on this page are naive approaches that only work with data sets that always fit in available memory. They fall apart when you can't read and write all the data at once.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>See </em><a href="ResultSetSizeIssues.html">ResultSetSizeIssues</a>. "Fit in memory" is somewhat of a system-specific issue because in many modern operating systems and/or languages, they cache RAM to disk automatically when actual RAM gets tight. However, it still may be a significant issue in some domains that deal with more imposing hardware constraints. Also, in interactive applications, it may be prudent to prompt the user with a warning about potentially large result sets before continuing. For example, "Do you really want to see a screen-report with 10,000 rows?"<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           All systems have memory and only some of that is available to any given application, so this isn't a "system-specific issue". Consuming multiple gigabytes of virtual memory will get a "doesn't play well with others" comment on your app's report card.
        </li>
        <li>
           [He beat me to it...I agree, and in more detail:] It's not even a little "archaic". Most machines have 32 bit address spaces. Most nontrivial databases are considerably larger than 2^32 bytes.
        </li>
        <li>
           You appear to have in mind "demand paged virtual memory", invented circa 1962 by Burroughs and popularized circa 1964 by IBM - not really "modern", it just seems that way to people who cut their teeth on recent but stone age systems like DOS and Windows 3.1 on 8086s and 80286s.
        </li>
        <li>
           Even on systems with a more comfortable 64 bit address size, they never actually have 2^64 bytes of RAM, and paging is far from transparent; it causes what's known as "thrashing" to constantly cause things to be paged to and from disk.
        </li>
        <li>
           So, from the beginning of computing history up through the current day, it's been extremely common to have data sets that won't fit in working memory, and that shows no sign of changing at all.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The idea behind caching is </em><a href="GracefulDegradation.html">GracefulDegradation</a>. Things just get slow if many apps cache too much. If it keeps happening, either rewrite the apps or add more RAM.<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               [There's nothing graceful about thrashing a disk. You can't keep adding RAM if the solution has no memory bounds, and it's rare that you actually have time to rewrite the app <strong>after</strong> memory usage becomes a problem for the users.]
            </li>
            <li>
               If you simplify your software by using <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a>, you will have more time to deal with such issues. In practice, I don't find it a common problem if you understand the trade-offs.
            </li>
            <li>
               [I don't hear anyone arguing in favor of mixing IO and calculations. My problem is with the idea that they should be segregated in time, so that there is a single input phase, followed by a single calculation phase, followed by a single output phase. Writing code like that (that assumes all of the data can be read in a single input phase) doesn't give you more time to figure out a bounded memory solution. It just delays it.]

                <li>
                   That rings a strong bell... last year, I tried to clean up and improve <a href="CohesionAndCoupling.html">CohesionAndCoupling</a> - would you check and see if anything there is in alignment with your point? (Please note, I don't mean that to start an <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> on the page in question, I'm hoping to find points of agreement, that's all).
                </li>
                <li>
                   [I suppose my point is that <a href="CouplingAndCohesion.html">CouplingAndCohesion</a> are measures of how software is logically organized. That logical organization is (or should be) independent of how execution flows. It's good to reduce coupling between IO and calculation. That doesn't mean it's good to do all of the IO at once.]
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I think we're all aware of what to do. The point is that I'm disagreeing that it no longer matters whether something fits in memory. It always has mattered, and as long as we have secondary store larger than primary store, always will.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Perhaps "matters" is not Boolean.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               And come to think of it, that was an odd response. Ok, I've got a 100 terabyte database. I do a query which needs to step through every row. The virtual result set does not fit in memory. There's nothing wrong with the app, so I won't change it, and I can't add 100 terabytes to my machine. Sometimes things just don't fit - that is quite different from saying it doesn't <strong>matter</strong> whether they fit. It makes a huge difference.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Separating IO is a rule of thumb, not a mandate. If a specific </em><a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> cannot use it, then so be it. Don't use it.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               In this context, I don't think there's a problem or a nuance with the word "matters", I think that you need to refine the claim you're making some more. Sometimes an app must be aware of IO issues - but I certainly agree that there's nonetheless a <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> issue. <a href="CouplingAndCohesion.html">CouplingAndCohesion</a> <strong>still</strong> says that little bits of IO code shouldn't be randomly intermixed throughout the app, even in this kind of situation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Given the most recent responses above (</em>"then you will have more time to deal with such issues", "rule of thumb"<em>), we may have finally reached violent agreement on the matter - if that truly is the summary.</em>

        The above seems to arguing on different <a href="LevelOfAbstraction.html">LevelOfAbstraction</a>. By focusing on a single implementation, reading to memory then calculating, one may miss the point is to separate by code module and not by time. The use of <a href="ContinuationsAndCoroutines.html">ContinuationsAndCoroutines</a>, streams or other forms of <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> could work around the memory issues here. -- <a href="TylerMac.html">TylerMac</a>

        In the OO world, a similar separation is applied on methods: Some are mutators and others are inspectors. Creating a mixed method is considered bad practice, since then it becomes harder to use and reuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider, for example, a class used for creating XML documents. You can add new nodes (addNode) and you can obtain the resulting XML (getXml). If getXml() performs the document construction, it is underperforming and probably it won't maintain correctly its invariant, unpleasantly surprising their users.
      </p>

        This is probably the most familiar abstraction in computer science, right before <a href="DataStructures.html">DataStructures</a> (<a href="AbstractDataTypes.html">AbstractDataTypes</a>).

           The first abstraction maybe was punched cards. Then assembly language. Then Fortran, which had data types, but they were not abstract yet. By around the same time, Fortran instructions were for IO or for calculation, not both at the same time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           By <strong>this</strong> definition, it then isn't even possible to do both at the same time, so there would then be no need to make an effort to separate them, so this seems to confuse your intended point rather than clarify.

      </ul>

        <li>
           It is not possible if you follow this rule 100% of the time. <a href="TheyreJustRules.html">TheyreJustRules</a>. Somehow, you need to connect the two (IO and Calculation). Make as few of those methods as you can.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The idea is that I/O must not be performed by the same methods/functions that perform calculations.

        The most basic example of this is the original BASIC keywords LET, PRINT and INPUT. Then when you wrote your first structured program in Pascal to calculate the square root of a number, you could functionally decompose it in: Input number, calculate root of that number, print number.

        The code above is the wrong way to separate the code because you transformed 1 loop into 2 loops. At first glance it may look correct, but it is performing slower and using additional storage. Besides the first function does IO and calculation, while the second does the same, it is only separated by a blank line. That is not what I was trying to imply. <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> is about a function or method doing either IO or doing a calculation.
      </p>
      <ul>

           <em>What is your proposed alternative? The "blank line" was only to indicate different "code units". Whether those units are functions or something else is immaterial, perhaps a debate left to </em><a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a>.<em></em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I can't show an alternative to code that apparently does nothing. Can you show an example we can understand?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        More code doesn't means worse. In the above code, where IO and Calculation is done in one method, it is less clear about the purpose of the method. When you see "get x" in a line of code, it's name doesn't tell you any thing. You could change the name from "get x" to "getAndPrint x". But what would you do if you only want to print all the value in x? You can't call "get x" because that would alter the content of x. So What would you do? The solution you use in separate method solution is not the correct way. The purpose of the original method is to "modify and print" so you should have
      </p>
      <code>
        modify x<br/>
        for each i in x<br/>
        alter i to j<br/>
        end for<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        print x<br/>
        for each i in x<br/>
        print i<br/>
        end for<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I assume the modified i is stored back to corresponding place in x. If not, it means you probably do that calculation just to do the output formatting; that way, the calculation may be ok. Or you could have done
      </p>
      <code>
        print x<br/>
        for each i in x<br/>
        print format x<br/>
        end for<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        format x<br/>
        return altered x<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>What if we wanted to save the altered thingies, but also print them?</em>
      </p>

        for each i in x<br/>
        alter i to j<br/>

        I'm quite unconvinced that 'saving' a value is fundamentally different from I/O. It is just output to memory rather than to the UI. However, saving a temporary, where that temporary is used and discarded as a purely computational side-effect (a side-effect of calculation), would qualify as different. If, however, you're provided an address or reference to someplace to save data, then requesting or sending information from or to that address (whether it be to a printer or elsewhere in memory) is definitely I/O.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a>, taken fully, means <a href="ReferentialTransparency.html">ReferentialTransparency</a> for calculations... since the calculations neither receive input (except to initiate their computation) nor provide output (except to report their result).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The profit of <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> is that the calculation logic is independent of the IO logic or the data source. For example, there is sin(double) function that is used to calculate sin value of a double. What if its signature is changed to sin(File) which can calculate the sin value of the first 4 bytes double from the file?
      </p>
      <p>
        Separate IO from Calculation makes your code more reusable. usually the IO/GUI code changes when you are polishing your software (improve program looks, support new format). As long as your calculation code is separate from IO code, you can be sure the calculation is always correct, whether or not you change the IO part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely not all calculation can be separate from IO. For example, how would you write FileWriter or ExcelFileFormatReader if you shouldn't be interacting with the file? The point is to keep the IO code to the low-level class. Only the class then really needs to know its source of input.

           I think he is trying to make the following point: IO should be low level, so that the upper levels of the programs only deal with abstractions and do not care where the data is taken from or put to.

        The other alternative would be to write a lot of calculation functions without IO. Then when IO is needed, upper level functions would link them together.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been my experience that the first choice (low level objects print themselves) gives you better <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> systems, in which you really do not care about the IO. All IO is resolved in lower level classes: UI, database, etc. The program is just a bunch of rules. I would say construction rules. For example, to get a doctor you need a person that has a medical "speciality". So you can either go get a "speciality", then the list of doctors appears (persons), the user selects in the UI which doctor he/she will prefer. Or perhaps you are inputting a new doctor in which case you select its "speciality" and then add the person related information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second choice (upper levels in the system connect the model and the UI) is exactly like <a href="StructuredProgramming.html">StructuredProgramming</a>. This leads to systems that are very hard to change. -- <a href="GuillermoSchwarz.html">GuillermoSchwarz</a>

        I was astonished that there was even any debate on separating I/O from calculation, but then it occurred to me that most of us have never programmed in <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You completely misinterpret. Most of the early criticism was from me, and my complaint was that there was, originally, not one single little bit of explanation for the <strong>why</strong> of separation, merely a proclamation that it should be done. The page overall still suffers badly from this fault. Way up above you can see a hint I tried to drop, that one way to explain the "why" has to do with cohesion. No follow up. This is also pretty low level advice, that potentially is subsumed by other principles.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The separation is very obvious in early programming languages and it remains so today in most modern programming languages. But when writing your own <a href="DataStructures.html">DataStructures</a>, you may end up mixing IO and calculation, because of your lack of experience. This page is just an advice for novice programmers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To someone coding in assembly, the question, "should I mix the I/O with the calculations" would never be asked: it's absurd on its face.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It depends. You can create subroutines in assembly as in any language. Subroutines should not do IO and calculation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most general thing that is immediately apparent is that, while calculations are essentially abstract concepts, I/O is (in lower level languages) quite married to the platform of the moment.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That was not the point I was trying to make. Simply that to achieve reuse you need to separate those.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Consider:
      </p>
      <code>
        LOAD POINTER REGISTER WITH LOCATION OF BUFFER<br/>
        LOAD ACCUMULATOR REGISTER WITH "FETCH" API CODE<br/>
        CALL OS API LOCATION  ; OS returns number of bytes in COUNTER REGISTER<br/>
        JUMP TO BOTTOM OF LOOP IF COUNTER REGISTER ZERO<br/>
        TOP OF LOOP<br/>
        LOAD BYTE REGISTER WITH BYTE AT CURRENT POINTER REGISTER<br/>
        (do something useful [calculation] with the byte)<br/>
        INCREMENT THE POINTER REGISTER<br/>
        DECREMENT THE COUNTER REGISTER<br/>
        JUMP TO TOP OF LOOP IF COUNTER REGISTER NOT ZERO<br/>
        BOTTOM OF LOOP<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        so, where did the byte come from?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What's this? COBOL for Pentium X? <em>Cute, thanks. No, just verbose ASM mnemonics for non-ASM programmers.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The OS owns the I/O for this routine, and <strong>we don't want to have to know how it does that</strong>, we just want the bytes to arrive in our buffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In those instances where we *must* write an I/O driver to fetch or put data, we certainly don't want the code that does the meaningful calculations tangled up in it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, in a higher level language, since "Boy, bring me another byte" handles I/O as a fairly abstract concept, we may see no real need for separation but, trust me, you want the nuts and bolts of I/O done away from your pure-bred algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, don't get me wrong, I have nothing against I/O routines as a whole - heck, some of my finest code is I/O routines - but I wouldn't want one to marry my data.

        A better way to describe this may be to move from this:
      </p>
      <code>
        loop {<br/>
        x = highRiskRead()<br/>
        process(x)<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        To this:
      </p>
      <code>
        loop {<br/>
        x = highRiskRead()<br/>
        insertIntoStructure(myStruct, x)<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        loop {<br/>
        x = getNextItem(myStruct, ...)<br/>
        process(x)<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This can simplify error-handling because other than running out of disk space (assume data structure is cached), we should not have to do heavy error-handling in the second loop because we can just conclude that something is too messed up if there is a problem and suddenly stop without worrying about cleanup. However, the first approach may need complex error-handling to undo half-done processing because we know the IO is full of risk. I find error-handling is just simpler when high-risk processes are separated from low-risk processes. Ideally, all errors should be handled gracefully, but I find that complex error-handling for rare systems-related problems is not worth the code volume and tough to test, so displaying an error message and closing down is often sufficient. For example, I don't put disk-full error-handling on every structure "insert" command because if the disk is full there are probably far worse things to worry about. It is usually not an application's job to monitor disk or cache space, except maybe in life-support systems or bulk-load batches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, a language would have a central handling routine for system errors so that we can give a message and perhaps write to a log if there are problems, but otherwise don't worry about graceful recovery. If task-specific graceful recovery is needed, apply specific handling code to only those critical sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be true that in resource-sensitive domains that separation may be too costly because it tends to require an intermediate buffer structure. It may be a trade-off between developer productivity and machine productivity.

           A lot depends on the transaction semantics of the I/O and calculations involved (if any). If the calculation part is "pure" in that it has no effect on (observing) system state other than returning a result - in other words, halting the calculation mid-stream does not leave the system in an inconsistent state - then intermingling the two is a good idea. If, OTOH, the processing must be done wholly or not at all (requires transaction semantics), Top's approach may be better. (Of course, it could be argued that anything requiring transaction semantics should be itself considered "I/O" rather than "calculation"; I agree completely).

               <em>I don't understand this comment. Transaction scope is a separate issue from memory requirements.

            </li>
            <li>
               An argument for top's solution (where a buffer is interspersed between the I/O and calculation phases) is that in the latter solution, any I/O errors can be caught before a (potentially destructive if not completed) calculation operation commences. Otherwise (when I/O and calculation are interleaved) an I/O error halfway through the file can leave the system in an inconsistent state. That's what I was referring to. (I'm assuming that process(), if destructive, is not operating on transactional memory of any sort; so rollback-on-error isn't possible; if it is then the interleaved solution might be better).

        I've encountered a situation where <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> and data-driven-programming (perhaps a variation of <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>) seemed to <strong>reduce the need for HOF</strong>s (<a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a>). I had this domain-specific report presentation engine. It provided formatting and did optional row and column totals. However, each report cell needs custom formatting for different usages (instances) of the report engine. Either I copy-and-paste the report engine for each instance to customize it, or I find a nice way to apply situation-specific formatting rules to the cells. A bunch of domain factors could be involved in how a cell is formatted. One approach I started with went something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        function reportEngine(dataStruct, cellDisplayHOF, ...) {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        while (R = rowLoop(...)) {<br/>
        while (C = columnLoop(...)) {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        cellDisplayHOF(dataStruct[R,C].value, factorA, factorB, factorC, etc...)<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }  // next C<br/>
        }  // next R<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The problem is that the report engine had to track and pass all the situational factors that could affect cell formatting, such as cell colors, alignment, value formatting with things like "$123,456.00" for some dollar amounts, etc. The situational logic would go something like, "If this is in region X and is one of the special product categories specified by person Y after date Z, then make the cell red".
      </p>
      <p>
        Some factors that affectted formatting came from parameters passed to "reportEngine", and some were attached to the data structure because they were more cell-specific. Different situations would use different factors such that for consistency I had to assume the widest number of factors. I was shuffling around too much info through the report engine. It was a middle-man that shouldn't have to care about all this situation-specific info.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided that a better solution would be a data-driven one that separated the format calucation from display. A structure/table like this was more useful:
      </p>
      <code>
        struture: reportCells<br/>
        ---------------<br/>
        rowID<br/>
        columnID<br/>
        rawValue  // needed for totals calcs<br/>
        cellFormatString  // TD attributes<br/>
        displayValue  // may have formatting, such commas in big numbers.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        One routine generates the reportCells table/structure, and the other simply displays it. The display routine no longer has to care about domain factors that may affect the display. Here is a rough idea of how the display portion works:
      </p>
      <code>
        function displayReport(reportCells, ...) {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        while (R = rowLoop(...)) {<br/>
        print("{tr}");  // HTML row start<br/>
        while (C = columnLoop(...)) {<br/>
        print("{td %1}", reportCells[R,C].cellFormattingString");<br/>
        print("%1{/td}", reportCells[R,C].displayValue);<br/>
        }  // next C<br/>
        print("{/tr}");  // HTML row end<br/>
        } // next R<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
        // (Braces used in HTML tags instead of angle-brackets to not confuse wiki.)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The "computation" of the cell formatting no longer has to pass through the display portion. It is already done in a prior step. (This is an oversimplification, but gives an idea of what is going on. For one, the data structure may have had other columns used in other calculations and stuff, but it didn't matter because the display routine ignored extra columns.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The downside is that some of the looping structure is duplicated in the format calculator and the display portion for many usages (but not all because the order of calculation depends on usage-specific issues). But it is worth it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, use of data-driven programming and <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> avoided the need for HOF's, and simplified the app.
