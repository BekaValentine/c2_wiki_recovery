        Work Product
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <em>work product</em> of an activity is the essential outcome of the activity; what the customer (or whoever) ultimately desires and what authorities mandate.  (By "authority", I mean external authorities outside the control of the organization; just because some manager has a process requiring a certain document for internal consumption; doesn't elevate that document to <a href="WorkProduct.html">WorkProduct</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        In many software projects, the work product consists of working, functional software (deployed in whatever manner) that does what the customer wants.  Many customers don't care about <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, design documents, version control archives, defect tracking records, QA logs, schedules, etc.  (But some do, in which case these items become <a href="WorkProduct.html">WorkProduct</a> and should be enumerated in the requirements).
      </p>
      <p>
        Production of things other than the <a href="WorkProduct.html">WorkProduct</a> should, in general, only be done if they assist the team in developing the <a href="WorkProduct.html">WorkProduct</a>.  Anything else is wasting time and money.
