        Didn't Yourdon just stick his name on the front? And <a href="PeterCoad.html">PeterCoad</a> had all the actual <strong>ideas</strong>? -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

        I believed those rumours too. But see <a href="MarkTwainAgeismStory.html">MarkTwainAgeismStory</a>. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        Peter didn't have ALL the ideas.  In 1990, shortly before I came to work for <a href="KnowledgeSystemsCorporation.html">KnowledgeSystemsCorporation</a>, both <a href="PeterCoad.html">PeterCoad</a> and <a href="EdYourdon.html">EdYourdon</a> visited <a href="KnowledgeSystemsCorporation.html">KnowledgeSystemsCorporation</a> to hear about <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>s from <a href="SamAdams.html">SamAdams</a>, <a href="KenAuer.html">KenAuer</a> and the rest of the gang.  This experience fed into the book, which I understand was a communal effort.  Ed just didn't collaborate any more on moving it forward. -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>

        I took Peter's OOA course in 1991 after hearing him speak at SCOOP East. He told us that when he went to talk about getting his book published originally, he asked for (was recommended to have?) a co-author and the publisher suggested <a href="EdYourdon.html">EdYourdon</a> to give the book credibility. So the original ideas were Peter's, but Ed contributed experience, reputation, and probably writing ability. -- <a href="RussellGold.html">RussellGold</a>
