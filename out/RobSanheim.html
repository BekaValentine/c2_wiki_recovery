        I'm a software developer by trade and by choice.  Currently working for a consulting firm in Madison, Wisconsin doing java web development.  I also strive to be a <a href="PragmaticProgrammer.html">PragmaticProgrammer</a> and keep things agile as much as possible.  This year I've been slowly learning <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> lately along with <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a>.  I've also had a chance to do quite a bit with <a href="AjaxWebApplications.html">AjaxWebApplications</a> using DirectWebRemoting in Java.  Check my blog below for speaking schedule on ajax in the Wisconsin area.  Recently (as of 11/16/05) became co-editor of <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com.">http://www.ajaxian.com.</a>

        I sign my entries because I like to know who I'm talking with, but please don't let that stop you from editing/revising/whatever.
