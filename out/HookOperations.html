        Intent: The <a href="HookOperations.html">HookOperations</a> design pattern defines interfaces and mechanisms by which software is engineered to be flexible and extended by people other than its creators.

      <p>
        Listener, in my understanding, is about being told about state changes. This is about getting a chance to intervene before or after an operation.
