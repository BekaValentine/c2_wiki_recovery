        Letter Spirit
      </h1>
      <p>
        Letter Spirit is a project started by Cognitive scientist
        <a href="DouglasHofstadter.html">DouglasHofstadter</a>.  It is documented in his book 
        <a href="FluidConceptsAndCreativeAnalogies.html">FluidConceptsAndCreativeAnalogies</a>.  Although Hofstadter
        makes no mention of <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>s (interestingly, his
        main research thrust is in studying pattern finding as
        the 'core of intelligence.'),
        I have found pattern languages emerge from his work,
        especially Letter Spirit.

        This project attempts to teach 'creative letter design'
        to computers.  One of his goals is to be able to give
        a computer program a few letters out of the alphabet and 
        have the program complete the alphabet using the style
        presented by the few letters.  In order for the computer
        to do this, it has to understand how the alphabet is 
        composed.  It needs to understand concepts about how letters
        are formed.

        For example: The letter 'b' could be described
        as a vertical post with a small cup attached to its
        bottom right.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this information, the computer would be able to look
        at a letter such as 'd' and/or 'p' and figure out how to
        draw a 'b' in the same style...

        Hmmm.... Could it be that Hofstadter is developing a
        <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> for the alphabet?
