        Open Standard
      </h1>
      <p>
        related to <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, but applied to standards such as TCP/IP protocols et al found in the RFCs published by the IETF. The very name of RFCs (RequestForComment) embodies the idea of <a href="OpenStandard.html">OpenStandard</a>s. The idea is that anyone that wants to can participate in the developing of a standard and eventually everyone knows the framework to work within for interoperability <em>and works within it!</em>. There is a group currently working on proposals for document standards, the OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) project.
