           The bot wars suck. At some point, it seems to me, that the "current" <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> has the same origin as the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>... Shows up all to conveniently, almost as to someone's beck-n-call...

           When all is quiet on this Wiki with the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, and the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> is harassing good loyal <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>s, and if anyone mentions the fact that the bot is abusive to <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>s, then suddenly, and with great force, the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> comes out of the woodwork.  Also, the bots author has taken the stance, that it is the <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>s that must change, not the bot.  Kind of like when there is an abusive, oppressive dictator damaging the people, the country, and the economy, and that dictator puts the blame on the oppressed and downtrodden people rather then where it belongs, on the dictator of course.

           <em><sarcasm> Yes, I am the </em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> in order to justify the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> so I can maintain control over <strong>you</strong>, dude, because your <strong>revolutionary views</strong> about <strong>late-night American television</strong> must be <strong>suppressed</strong>. </sarcasm>  <a href="FacePalm.html">FacePalm</a><em></em>

        Interesting page.  It does show what the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> will do, if it/she/he thinks that there is a shred of advantage to be had.  It also shows, however, that <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> is not very intelligent.  In the above case, the smart thing for the GV to have done, was to go into hiding for awhile to see if the community would indeed put the blame on the author of the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, but instead GV chose to try to make it look as though DV had written a confession (GV went into battle mode with the bot over trying to make it look so, and of course there is no way to win against the bot script. i.e. a useless childish tantrum).  Conclusion: GV is like a small child, either in reality or at least in the mind, and my choice is the mind.  Once again, I can reach only one final conclusion, and that is that <strong>GV is seriously mentally ill...</strong>
