        Benevolent Fascist
      </h1>
      <p>
        Another well-intentioned incarnation of megalomania, mixed with a healthy dosage of cynicism and attentive observation, sprinkled with optimism and humour (not too much) just for fun. Now with added vitriol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Woo!
      </p>
      <p>
        Quite the humourous term, to anyone who knows the etymology of <em>fascist</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Er, </em>fascist<em> comes from the Italian word </em>fascio.<em> A </em>fascio<em> is a bundle of wood.  Fascism is "bundle-ism": the theory that we're stronger when we band together as a unit, just as sticks are stronger when bound together into a bundle.  Given the etymology, I don't get the humour in </em><a href="BenevolentFascist.html">BenevolentFascist</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So, uh, does that mean that "fascist" and "fag" have similar etymologies?
      </p>
      <p>
        That's not the idea behind the name.  The bundle was actually something the Romans carried around as a symbol of authority (Latin <em>fascis</em>), and Mussolini decided to adopt it as one of his emblems because he wanted to be seen as a successor to their glory.  Both of them always included an axe in the center of the bundle.  It represented nothing so high-minded as strength in numbers, but rather the punishments that criminals could expect: beatings and executions.  So a <a href="BenevolentFascist.html">BenevolentFascist</a> is a well-wishing guy in charge of capital punishment.

           "It represented nothing so high-minded as strength in numbers" - <em>Absolutely untrue. Fascism's highest imperative was to spiritually unite all members of the State: </em><a href="http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm''">http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm''</a>

      <p>
        <em>Frankly, I'd rather a nice guy in charge of it than a surly one.</em>  Frankly, I'd rather not have 'a guy' in charge at all.  Never works out well for the rest of us.  <em>But if one has to have one, better a cheerful one</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems a shame to have good men doing such terrible things"
        "Oh no, your worship, if anyone must do it, better that they be good men!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd rather an executioner that is moral (in truth, as opposed to publically moral) then an evil one.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what's the etymology of the Italian first-name <em>Benito</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think it's the same as "Benny".</em>

          Extreme tiny benefit.  ;-)
