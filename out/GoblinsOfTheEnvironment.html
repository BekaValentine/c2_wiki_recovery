        Goblins Of The Environment
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is a theme I notice amongst "green" developers:  They want to blame the wrong thing every time when something goes wrong.  They want to blame the environment when the problem is obviously caused by an error in code; and, in turn, they want to blame code when there is something wrong in the environment.  I've seen many a developer waste <em>hours</em> trying to track down something that was related to an external system, that they couldn't fix.  This is something that should be recognized immediately and avoided.

        I call this <a href="GoblinsOfTheEnvironment.html">GoblinsOfTheEnvironment</a>, because that's what it feels like to me.  They're chasing ghosts, goblins, gremlins, etc.  Often times, instead of just adding a breakpoint (or even placing a print of some kind), they'll complain and say things like:
      </p>
      <p>
        - It was <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> (I hear this <em>all</em> the time)
      </p>
      <p>
        - It was <a href="WebLogic.html">WebLogic</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        - It was <em>your</em> code
      </p>
      <p>
        - It was <em>their</em> code
      </p>
      <p>
        - It was working a minute ago
      </p>
      <p>
        - It worked yesterday
      </p>
      <p>
        So, a question to the wiki community:  How do you guide developers into more sane and non-mythical debugging practices?  Besides just say, "You're chasing goblins, and they don't exist." -- <a href="JeffPanici.html">JeffPanici</a>

      <p>
        <em>"How do you </em>'know<em>' that it was "X"?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I say, "Show me a test that reproduces that error." -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

        The exact same thing happens in biology, which makes me think it's human nature, not unique to developers.  The theory usually goes something like:  It's the water... it has (too many ions / too much bacterial contamination / too many organic contaminants etc. etc. etc.).  In my experience it has <strong>never</strong> been the fault of the water.  There are times when the environment really <em>is</em> at fault, but it is encumbent upon the person blaming the environment to <strong>proove</strong> that this is the case. --<a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>
