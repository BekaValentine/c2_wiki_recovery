        Not to be confused with the <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> <a href="SamGentle.html">SamGentle</a>, though ironically enough I first found Wiki through a ReflexiveGoogle. I'm not entirely sure how well I fit into the collective <a href="WikiMind.html">WikiMind</a> as yet, but perhaps the point is that I discover this after a while in the community. I was a fan of <a href="EverythingTwo.html">EverythingTwo</a> for a while, but found that it had a very hostile attitude toward newbies and an often arbitrary disregard for the worth of information. Apologies if my writing style reflects that.

        I'm currently in my senior year of <a href="HighSchool.html">HighSchool</a>, struggling to keep interest in a system that seems so totally abstracted from my career aspirations as to be worthless. My plan at this point is to get into university and become a <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a>. In <a href="AustraliaCountry.html">AustraliaCountry</a>, that's equivalent to a programmer. My major fields of interest are <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> and networking, though I don't really know as much as I should about either. Hopefully Wiki will help with that.

        Currently I can be contacted at <strong>omet_11cay atay ail15may otday omcay</strong> or a billion other places with the nick "comet_11". Sadly, that handle is well past its use-by date, and I should find a new one. Hell, feel free to post suggestions if you're artistically-minded.
