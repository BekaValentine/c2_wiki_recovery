        Jackson Structured Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Jackson Program Design Methodology, sometimes called Jackson Structured Programming (JSP), is a method for program design and modelling "in the small". It begins with considerations about what is known and develops a program design that becomes more complete as the model is put through continued iterations. It emerged in the 1970's as a design method that concentrated on the structure of data using data-structure methods. Because it builds the program design from an incomplete model, it is termed a "composition type" method.

        In today's terminology JacksonSP was a method to split the iterator code and the application specific composite / visitor code. (<a href="JimCaprioli.html">JimCaprioli</a>)
