        Here's a lecture on putting yourself out of the "try" space and into the "do" space:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Creating A Blueprint From Your Imagination</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Q:  Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        B:  And to you, good day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q:  As I told the channel earlier, I am representing myself and
        someone else. So it's her question that I'll ask you first.
      </p>
      <p>
        B:  Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q:  Her name is Adrian, and she's been trying very, very, hard for
        the
        last year to make a job transition. She wants to become a TV news
        writer.
      </p>
      <p>
        B:  Oh, all right.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Q:  And she does have some limited experience, but she wants to
        get a
        more permanent job in that industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        B:  Oh, all right. Is that what is most exciting thing to that
        being? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Q:  Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        B:  Is that being acting like a TV news writer? Or is she still
        acting
        like someone who is trying to become a TV news writer? There is a
        vast
        difference in those attitudes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Q:  Well, she's going to hear this. I'm afraid she's going to kill
        me
        for saying this, but it's the truth. Yah, she's. I won't tell her
        there's a videotape of this. I believe she's still acting like
        she's
        trying to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        B:  All right. This, in no way, shape or form, is a condemnation
        or a
        blame. The idea simply is a matter of fact that your society has
        created so many definitions that sometimes they seem to be what
        you
        are doing; when in fact the definition you are doing is not
        anything
        like what you say you prefer.
      </p>
      <p>
        You think it is, because you think it's attached. But it is its
        own
        definition, that really has very little to do with the thing you
        actually want to be. All the trying in the world is not the doing
        of
        the thing. When you finally do something, it's because you finally
        did
        it, not because you tried to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the trying, usually, is simply the time you think or believe
        is
        necessary to allow yourself to really believe you can finally do
        it.
        The idea, therefore - to put it in very simple terms - is that
        your
        friend may simply not be paying attention to the fact that there
        may
        be many opportunities she is not allowing herself to take
        advantage
        of, because she does not necessarily think herself capable of
        acting
        on those opportunities. Because she is not yet the person she
        wants to
        be.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the only way she'll be that person is by starting to act like
        that
        person now, by doing the things that person would do. By being
        that
        person. As we have shared many times - and again this will be
        brief -
        the idea is to use the imagination as a tool in the following way.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is something you want to be that you believe you're not
        now,
        create the visualization of that person. See the you you want to
        be,
        and then see that you acting in the way you want to act, doing the
        things you prefer to do. Then connect with it, with all your
        senses.
        Feel what it would be like to be that person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taste, smell, hear, and touch everything! And have the attitude of
        what it would be like to be that person. Have the style of that
        person. Do things in the way that person would do them, not in the
        way
        you're doing it now. Then all you have to do, if there is any
        circumstance or situation in your life that you don't know how to
        handle as the you you are now, hand that circumstance and
        situation to
        the you in your imagination, in your visualization, in your
        picture.
        Give that situation - hand it over - to the person you prefer to
        be,
        that you have created yourself to be, in your image of yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then watch what that person does with it. See how their attitude
        is
        different from yours; see how they handle it successfully. See
        their
        boldness and their conviction. See the excitement and the gusto
        with
        which they do that idea. See them successfully transform it. Then
        do
        what they did, and you'll get the same result.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's what your imagination is for: to create a mirror image of
        the
        you you prefer to be, and then have the boldness and the
        conviction to
        act like that you, and you will create the same vibration. You
        will
        get the same life style, you will get the same result. That's how
        to
        use your imagination as a blueprint, as a template, in that way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But it takes a boldness and a conviction, and a willingness to
        understand that as soon as you conceive of that image, that is who
        you
        are. All you have to do is act like it to get the same results. If
        there is anything, any habit pattern, any attitudinal approach
        that
        you would be doing differently if you already were that person -
        differently than the way you are doing it now - do it the way you
        would do it if you already were that person, and you will be that
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you put out is what you get back. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Q:  Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        B:  Individuals - always, always, always - are a 100% energy. No
        more,
        no less. If you are doing something that you really want to do
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          %,
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        and something you do no prefer 50%, you cannot expect any further
        manifestation of the thing you really want to do, more than 50%.
        It's
        simple mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are hanging on to something just to play it safe, to have
        something to fall back on - just in case - then you are not really
        trusting the you you say you prefer to be. You are not really
        putting
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          % of the idea in the direction of the flow you want. I
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        guarantee as
        soon as anyone does, you will get it; if you believe you are ready
        for
        it. That's another idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        All it takes is an examination, as we have already done to some
        degree. But now I will put it in its original linear form: What is
        the
        clear intention? What is the clear definition of what you want?
        What
        is the clear desire? Do you really want it? What is the clear
        deservability? Do you believe you deserve to get it?
      </p>
      <p>
        If all of those are clear, then act with clear action upon
        whatever
        opportunities present themselves that excite you the most at any
        given
        moment - whether they appear connected to what you want or not.
        The
        excitement tells you they are, and they will get you where you
        need to
        go. That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q:  Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        B:  Thank you.
      </p>

        <em>I agree with the idea that if you want to change who you are, you have to act on it, not just think about it or wish for it or imagine it.  I disagree that it's as simple as described.  In many cases it requires a lot of work plus access to resources such as money, education and opportunities to advance.  Sometimes it depends on characteristics that not everyone has.  It doesn't matter how much you want to be an Olympic gymnast if you have a poor sense of balance.</em>
