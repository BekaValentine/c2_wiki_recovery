        Micro Decision Awareness
      </h1>
      <p>
        Which decisions are important?  It's not just a question of size.  Sometimes crucial 'decisions' are made by default late at night by someone too tired to realise they made a decision at all.  <a href="MicroDecisionAwareness.html">MicroDecisionAwareness</a> asks only that when making a decision, however small, you are aware of the fact.  Other attributes such as integrity, experience and self discipline (or self preservation) then kick in to ensure that the ramifications of the decision are appropriately handled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe 80% of the time, the ramifications are local in extent and minor in degree:  congratulations, you just made a good micro decision.  The other 20%, you need to nail that decision to some principle, standard, assumption or other higher level decision.  If you can't do that, you have an issue:  resolve it!

        If the author wouldn't mind, a few words more specifically on how this relates to <a href="DocumentWork.html">DocumentWork</a> would be great.  The general implication seems clear enough -- an awareness of micro-decisions is necessary to know when and what to document as a bug is worked -- but examples and additional context would be great. --<a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>
