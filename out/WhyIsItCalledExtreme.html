        <strong>It takes practices further than before</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        By analogy with the <a href="HistoryOfExtremeProgramming.html">HistoryOfExtremeProgramming</a>'s "turn all the knobs to ten", perhaps a practice is extreme when you take it further than it's previously been practiced. For example, rather than working toward a handful of alpha and beta test milestones, you practice <a href="SmallReleases.html">SmallReleases</a>. Rather than integrate weekly, you practice <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>. Rather than periodic code reviews, you practice <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>.

        <em>Indeed. An un-cited entry on Wikipedia suggests it's called "Extreme" because it "takes 'best practices' to extreme levels."</em>  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming</a>

        <strong>It borrows the term from "Extreme Sports" to attract the young</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        My suspicion is that it borrowed "extreme" from the "extreme sports" movement as a buzzword gimmick to attract young people to the movement.

        <em>Naw. XP didn't just borrow from "extreme sports"; it </em>'is<strong> an extreme sport: </strong><a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming.''">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming.''</a>

        The term has been so over used by marketing that it is rapidly loosing meaning.  I saw an Extreme Toothpaste at the grocery store.  The same store was holding and Extreme Sale (the mark-down was 25%.  Now, maybe 25% was extreme for this particular store, but it certainly wasn't extreme in context of normal sales.)  It is a term addopted by the X and/or Y Generations.  They are the prime buyers, now, so marketers have gone overboard using the Extreme label to get their attention. -- <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>
