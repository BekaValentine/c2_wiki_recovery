        Reword Flamebait Please
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is always an obtainable formulation of words that is superior to <a href="FlameBait.html">FlameBait</a> in increasing signal and decreasing noise.  And preventing needless <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We request that you find that formulation.  You will be more pleased with the result, as well.

        <em>Note: Please use this tag judiciously... applying indiscriminately or unwisely can also be construed as Flamebait.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why use this tag at all?  Just fix it and move on.  <em>Revising has been considered the ultimate </em><a href="FlameBait.html">FlameBait</a> by some.  As is deletion.  So we end up with a Wiki 80% of which are thoughts poorly thought _out_, often knee jerk reactions to insidious <a href="FlameBait.html">FlameBait</a> (and, let's be honest, <em>never</em> refactored).  A modest 21-character request like this seems to serve well as an alert, a challenge, and a marker.<em></em>
