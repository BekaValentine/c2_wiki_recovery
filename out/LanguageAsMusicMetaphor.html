        Language As Music Metaphor
      </h1>
      <p>
        Inspired by <a href="LanguageAsFoodMetaphor.html">LanguageAsFoodMetaphor</a> and by a line from the second Spanish translation of <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/</a> (a PDF which is basically an annotated, extended version of the original). Quote in English from page 12: <em>"PHP's great crime is its complete banality. Its popularity is the living proof that quality is irrelevant: cheap, popular and everywhere always wins. PHP is the reggaeton of programming languages."</em>

        I would rather compare <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>, based off that description, to a teen pop superstar, like Justin Bieber as of 2014. If you're 13 or younger and just discovered music you'll find it accesible, pleasant, and you'll buy into the millions of dollars they spend on PR that says they're pretty-looking and cool. Their merch (web hosting) is also everywhere and dirt cheap. If you know a little bit about music or are 15 or older, you'll find out their music is complete garbage made with minimum effort for maximum profit. But everybody likes them because it's cheap, accessible and popular, and every now and then it's a little guilty pleasure.
