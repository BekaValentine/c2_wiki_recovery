        UMLet is a small (54 k), <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, pure <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> tool for quickly sketching out small class and use case diagrams - nothing more, nothing less, and thus not meant as a complete <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a> tool. Diagrams can be created very quickly because the tool uses a kind of simple text markup for editing the diagram elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's up to version 1.8 now and is available at: <a href="http://www.umlet.com">http://www.umlet.com</a>

        Example for the markup for one package:
      </p>
      <code>
        Package 1<br/>
        --<br/>
        -Content 1<br/>
        +Content 2<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Another example, this one for a class:
      </p>
      <code>
        <<Singleton>><br/>
        HelloClass<br/>
        --<br/>
        --<br/>
        +HelloClass<br/>
        #run<br/>
      </code>

      <p>
        Simple, Nice and Fancy!! But I'm afraid that it's too simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Too simple for what? As a replacement for a complete UML tool? Yes. Too simple to quickly sketch out a class diagram? No.</em>

        As a wise man said:
      </p>
      <p>
        "There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make is so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult." 
      </p>
      <p>
        Too simple? Perhaps. But the approach of at least trying to "make is so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies" is something that the UML world really needs.
