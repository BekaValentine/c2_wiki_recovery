        Avoid Complexity
      </h1>
      <p>
        Software design paradigms tend to ignore the idea of limiting complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is <em>too much</em>, and <em>just enough</em>?  When should we <strong>not</strong> integrate?  The correct answer is only as much as needed to get the job done, and AvoidIntegration if unnecessary.

        What this means in practice is using a lot of existing wheels (not <a href="ReinventingTheWheel.html">ReinventingTheWheel</a>).  As a result, this sometimes means not coding at all. 
        In many cases the need for a unique solution outweighs the off the counter solutions - in which case we make sure that we exhaust all standard APIs 
        and data representation/encoding options before inventing our own.  At each level, we ratchet up the complexity only as needed, and no more.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems to fly in the face of traditional practices where process, regardless of the complexity involved, rules the day.

        Another way of expressing this, at first blush, is <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.  However, this only approaches obliquely <em>what is the right solution</em> versus <em>what is the simple solution</em>.  I believe these are two different things that may or may not coincide over the lifetime of a project.  -- <a href="MalcolmCampbell.html">MalcolmCampbell</a>  (I didn't like the way I said that - but it will have to do until I can come up with something better)
