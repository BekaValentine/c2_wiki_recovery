        Simple Interpreter Contest
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am proposing a <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>-style contest for <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> that may actually result in something useful: a tiny interpreter that is easy to read and customize. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a simple-as-possible stand-alone C program that interprets a "scripting" language of some sort. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Interpreter points awarded for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Size of the code (libraries not allowed other than "base" C)
        </li>
        <li>
           Readability of the interpreter code
        </li>
        <li>
           Grokkability of the interpreter algorithms used
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Resulting Scripting Language Factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Expressive power and utility of the resulting scripting language
        </li>
        <li>
           Familiarity to developers of "common" languages (Generally something close to the "Algol-style")
        </li>
        <li>
           Descriptiveness of error messages (perhaps belongs under "interpreter")
        </li>
        <li>
           Speed and performance of the scripting language. This will not be heavily weighted and is mostly included to avoid atrocious cases.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> will grade the results which will be recorded in a format similar to the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        Factor 1: Fred:B+, John:C, Lisa:D+ (Names would be Wiki handles)<br/>
        Factor 2: Fred:A-, John:D+, Lisa:B<br/>
        Etc...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Of course somebody can re-score the totals using weightings of their choosing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I'd lean toward something like <a href="TopsHomoiconicScriptingLanguage.html">TopsHomoiconicScriptingLanguage</a>. Other things to consider include skipping stacks and recursion. Variations on <a href="ReversePolishNotation.html">ReversePolishNotation</a> is also an interesting possibility. Keep in mind that most scripting uses involve strings far more often than math. Explicit function/subroutine parameters may not even be needed, but something at least like BASIC's "GOSUB" should probably be available.

        <em>Top, you aren't trying to get us to, er, do your homework for you, are you?  I know you've sometimes expressed an interest in implementing your language designs, so you're not trying -- in a roundabout way -- to get us to show you how to do it, are you?  If so, that's not a bad thing, but there are probably easier ways to learn language implementation.</em>

        I'm mostly just curious about the kinds of trade-offs people would make and why. If you don't wish to participate, you don't have to. Don't think about me, do what you feel like.
