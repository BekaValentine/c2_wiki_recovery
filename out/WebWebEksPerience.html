        We are now organizing a large Perl programming project using WebWebX (see <a href="WebWebTwo.html">WebWebTwo</a>) as the sole tracking mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each release, we track everything through it. Requirements, design documents, code reviews; reported problems, bugs found, and fixes made; current and future plans; the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary thing seems to be getting everyone convinced that they can stake out their own corner and make it whatever they want. After that, the speed at which you can get things organized is astonishing.
