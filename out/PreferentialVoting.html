        Preferential Voting
      </h1>
      <p>
        Voting with 1 against your most preferred candidate, 2 against the next and so on, instead of just an X, or punching a single chad, or whatever.

        Why would you vote against your preferred candidate?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Say your preferred candidate is X, but you know he's an underdog and likely to take a bath. Rather than totally wasting your vote you have a second preference, Y, which has a much better chance against your hated non-preference Z. There is a slim chance that X will get in, so you vote for him first. If he fails, your vote has a fallback plan.</em>

        This system is more likely than a single vote system to result in a consensus being formed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Take, for example, a situation where:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ,000 voters love candidate A, but failing that would like C. They hate candidate B.
          <ol>
            <li>
              ,000 voters love candidate B, but failing that would like C. They hate candidate A.
            </li>
            <li>
              ,000 voters love candidate C, but failing that would like B. They hate candidate A.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In preferential voting, candidate C would be elected. 8,000 very happy voters and 19,000 mildly satisfied voters.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a <a href="FirstPastThePost.html">FirstPastThePost</a> system, candidate A would be elected, resulting in 10,000 very happy voters and 18,000 very disappointed voters, though if the voters are aware of the likely voting pattern, the candidate C voters would manually switch their votes to candidate B - a best case situation resulting in 9,000 happy, 8,000 satisfied and 10,000 unhappy. Vote switching tends to only be partial though - possibly resulting in a victory for A despite knowledge of the system. This will have a greater effect where B and C have roughly equivalent popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more realistic situation would be:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          % candidate A (ie. Republican)
          <ol>
            <li>
              % candidate B (ie. Green)
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          % candidate C (ie. Democrat)
        </li>
      </ol>
