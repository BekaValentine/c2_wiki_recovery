        <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>s were originally introduced as a technique for teaching object-oriented concepts; they have also been successfully used as a full-fledged modeling technique. Scott W. Ambler feels that CRC models are an incredibly effective tool for conceptual modeling as well as for detailed design. CRC cards feature prominently in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> (XP) (Beck 2000) as a design technique. See also <a href="AgileDevelopment.html">AgileDevelopment</a>.

        A Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) model (<a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> & <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> 1989; Wilkinson 1995; <a href="ScottAmbler.html">ScottAmbler</a> 1998a) is a collection of standard index cards that have been divided into three sections. A class represents a collection of similar objects, a responsibility is something that a class knows or does, and a collaborator is another class that a class interacts with to fulfill its responsibilities.
