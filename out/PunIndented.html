        Pun Indented

      <p>
        I like to use this phrase to acknowledge puns in comments to source code at nesting levels of second or deeper.  (However, although it may seem called for, I've found that following <em>this</em> phrase with a "<a href="PunIntended.html">PunIntended</a>" looks rather silly.)  Does anyone else do this? -- <a href="DanielBrockman.html">DanielBrockman</a>
