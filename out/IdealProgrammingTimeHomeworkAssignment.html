        I have been working in an environment ripe for taking up XP for just over 2 months, in that time I've been involved in one project. This being my first project in the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> I knew I was naive and so when I looked at the requirements and estimated 7 days' work, (the <a href="MarketingDroid.html">MarketingDroid</a>s had already provisionally talked about 5 days the customer) I knew that I would need to add a pessimism factor (<a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a>, it might be called). So I thought "It'll probably take a couple of weeks". I showed my estimate to an old friend who worked here already and he laughed a condescending little chuckle and said "You should double your estimates" before he even looked. I figured that, being an inexperienced <a href="CodeMonkey.html">CodeMonkey</a>, I should add a little to that again to allow for learning on the job. Then we added a bunch of things into the estimate that I hadn't thought to allow time for. Then the customers wanted a couple of features we didn't expect, then there were issues implementing a feature that looked trivial at first.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, the project was delivered 7 weeks after I officially started working on it.

        I make that a <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> of 5 for my first estimate...
