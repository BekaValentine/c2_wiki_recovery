        Traditionally, here on the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, people use their <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a>s. Thus, we generally expect you to use your real name too. See <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki will accept a cookie that specifies a user name to be used in place of the host name in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can set your username cookie with <a href="http:wikiOptions">http:wikiOptions</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that you should not simply type your name there, but a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>, which means you do not put a space between your first and last name. (Although a string with a space will be accepted, it won't work. Anything other than a valid <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> causes your machine's DNS name to be used instead.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>To see if it worked:</em> go to <a href="WikiWikiSandbox.html">WikiWikiSandbox</a>, edit it, view it again, and click the 'last edited' link. If your name is listed, it worked. If not, try one of the other ways listed. If you can't find the 'last edited' link, scroll down to the very bottom of the page. The actual link is today's date, preceded by 'last edited'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that you've set up your user name, you may want to create a <a href="WikiHomePage.html">WikiHomePage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to <em>disable</em> your <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>, enter a single space character into the box (leaving it empty doesn't work).
      </p>

        There is also a <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> <a href="UsernameBookmarklet.html">UsernameBookmarklet</a> that you can use.

        <strong>Warning</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie as described above, there is a strong chance your edits will be reverted by the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> if <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> spoofs <em>your</em> <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> and uses it to edit pages you've edited.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> automatically merges all consecutive edits under the same <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> into a single edit. If you make an edit under your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> and <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> later spoofs your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> and edits the same page, it will appear as a single edit. If the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> recognises that the (last) edit was made by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, it will revert the whole thing. <strong>As a result, your contribution will be lost.</strong>
