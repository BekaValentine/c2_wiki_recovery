      </h1>
      <p>
        Industrial Sociology is the study of the motivations and behaviors of people at the workplace.  Many descriptions in this field tend to be nearly anthropological in presentation, as if an outside observer from Mars visited and objectively observed the workings in an office or assembly line.

A Pattern is a map of where we have been, and may be used by other analysts to retrace our steps, but they are created fresh and sparkling new from people with foresight who enter into UnexploredTerritory.
