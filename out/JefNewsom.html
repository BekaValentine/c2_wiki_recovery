        I am currently a founder and Managing Director of Improving Enterprises, LLC (<a href="http://www.improvingtech.com),">http://www.improvingtech.com),</a> an enterprise improvement consultancy. With Improving, we focus on helping organizations transform and streamline their application of technology through guided activities in the form of mentoring, formal training, and consulting. We specialize in Risk and Opportunity-focused approaches to architecture and development, in the spirit of Agile approaches to software development. We are based in Dallas, TX. I have a beautiful wife Aimee, and wonderful daughter Eva, and an underappreciated, very friendly dog named Coal. I love guitars, music, software, and all things internet. I strive to practice agile development.
