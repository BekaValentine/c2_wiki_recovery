        I'm a C++ programmer with a wicked sense of humour who wants to get into Oracle development one day.  I work for a company called Open Telecommunications (was
        Open Technology) in Sydney, Australia.  <a href="JamesCrawford.html">JamesCrawford</a> also works there.

        I am an Ex-Kiwi (a New Zealander) who moved to Australia in December 1994.

        Resume:
      </p>

        </li>

           Seven years in Telecom New Zealand, mostly switching planning and design, Wellington NZ
        </li>

           Bachelor of Information Technology for two years in Brisbane, Australia
        </li>

        Thoughts on C++ development
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I call an 'int' an 'int' and a 'double' a 'double'.  That means if it's a number use 'int', and if it's got a decimal point, use 'double'
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm impressed by the material in <em>C++ Report</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm a proponent of Resource Management - not just for memory, but for all resources in a program - even opendir(3) & closedir(3)
        </li>
        <li>
           Garbage Collection is garbage - most garbage collectors only handle memory, leaving you to handle resources like thread locking and opendir(3) & closedir(3), and possibly making life <em>harder</em> in garbage collected languages that don't have destructors.
        </li>
        <li>
           Memory leak detection software is also garbage, for similar reasons.  I would only spend time and money on this software if it was <em>convenient</em>, and only to check that my reference counting was working properly, and that no-one was subverting ref-counting somehow.
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm interested in a large scale version of <strong>lint++</strong> - that will check for issues of significance in a large scale C++ project - such as levelisation at file & package level, component organisation, and other stuff from Lakos, Meyers, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm concerned about the flood of Job Unready Graduates.  Please let the Universities know what employers really need: those who can read and write English, and those who can read and write good code, and those who will unit test.
