        The <a href="TokenSystem.html">TokenSystem</a> is a very light <a href="RolePlaying.html">RolePlaying</a>System. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is based on the idea that a <a href="RolePlaying.html">RolePlaying</a> session is something like a narrative. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The structure of <a href="RolePlaying.html">RolePlaying</a> narratives tend to be pretty similar. The protagonists get involved in some mystery or action, they make a few gains, some some defeats, encounter UltimateEvil and defeat it. It's a series of ups and downs through which our heroes learn from their mistakes and progress to their eventual triumph.
      </p>
