        My neighbor, Warren Tyler, is an architect who studied at the University of Oregon. I asked him once what he thought of <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>. He laughed and then related the <a href="BusStopExperiment.html">BusStopExperiment</a> and the fiasco that ensued when he was in school.

        He claimed to have no use for Alexander. Then he stopped. It seems that just the week before he had been out at the construction site. The staff of the new medical center were walking around the half-finished building when they came to a stairwell. They asked if there couldn't be a large window installed in the stairwell so that people could enjoy the view of the northwest countryside. Warren had suggested that a small window might work better. And he knew that he had learned of the idea from Alexander. Alexander called it <a href="ZenView.html">ZenView</a>.
