        Its How It Works When It Doesnt Work That Counts
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Anybody can build a system that works when it works, but it's how it works when it doesn't work that counts.", or some variant thereof, is a classic engineering aphorism.

        I have heard this called Nebel's law. Might that be correct? -- <a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a>

        <em>Probably no, google shows up no relevant hits except for this one. Spelling of Nebel?</em>

        I'll note that a system that never works qualifies vacuously as a system that "works when it works".  How shall these 'count'?

        Note that we're not necessarily talking about failure states (although this applies to them as well).

        It's a case of "What happens when this _isn't_ such a good match?", or "What happens when a <a href="HappyCollision.html">HappyCollision</a> _doesn't_ occur?".

        Perhaps a discussion of <a href="GracefulDegradation.html">GracefulDegradation</a> would be appropriate?  But that applies mostly to load-bearing and partial failures, I think.  I suppose you'd need to look into the different services and systems built upon them to see what counts as good or bad.  How should a security system work when people forget or lose passwords, or lose their smartcards?
