        Definitive Cee Plus Plus Books
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some C++ books are not just good; they're the definitive works, the books <em>everyone</em> refers people to. Some of them are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a>, <em></em><a href="TheCeePlusPlusProgrammingLanguage.html">TheCeePlusPlusProgrammingLanguage</a><em>. The Book, written by The Man. Considered not an easy read by some who, let's face it, probably shouldn't be programmers. The third edition describes standard C++ as defined in ISO/IEC 14882 (Standard for the C++ Programming Language). The Special Edition is the 3rd edition plus errata, appendicies on locales, </em><a href="StandardTemplateLibrary.html">StandardTemplateLibrary</a> exception safety, and a hard cover.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Lippman and Lajoie, <em>The C++ Primer</em> (ISBN 0-201-82470-1). The most commonly recommended introduction to C++. The third edition describes the ANSI/ISO draft standard.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>I learned C++ from the second edition of this book. I was really looking forward for the third edition describing the ANSI standard but I found it a huge disappointment. It's rather large (but so is the language) and lacks structure. What really ruins it is the horribly bad index.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        (Anyone else worried about a twelve hundred page primer? Lippman may be; his more recent book, <em>Essential C++</em> (<a href="EssentialCpp.html">EssentialCpp</a>) (ISBN 0201485184) is only 304 pages. -- <a href="PaulChisholm.html">PaulChisholm</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        (The fourth edition of <em>The C++ Primer</em> is now available, adding <a href="BarbaraMoo.html">BarbaraMoo</a> as coauthor.  It is significantly shorter than the third edition (about 900 pages) and is completely rewritten, reorganized, and reindexed.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="AndrewKoenig.html">AndrewKoenig</a> & <a href="BarbaraMoo.html">BarbaraMoo</a>'s <em>Accelerated C++</em> (ISBN 0-201-70353-X) may overtake this Lippman eventually.  "The first part, through Chapter 7, concentrates on programs that use standard-library abstractions.  The second part, starting with Chapter 8, talks about defining your own abstractions".  I had good success handing this book to juniors who had some programming under their belt already.

        Most C++ books assume you're very familiar with C, but completely new to objects.  I haven't found a superb book for people who are in the opposite situation.  I liked Steve Oualline's <em>Practical C++ Programming</em> (O'Reilly, 1995, 557 pp.) (ISBN 1-56592-139-9) better than the Lippman/Lajoie primer that's most commonly recommended.  Oualline is full of useful tables like "The meanings of static" (5 possible meanings; can you list them off the top of your head?) that warn about obscure features of the language. It does introduce objects far too late. (<em>Probably because this book shares a lot of content with his </em>Practical C Programming<em>. I must say, I've been underwhelmed by this book. Maybe I'm unique in this.... -- </em><a href="PhilGroce.html">PhilGroce</a><em>)</em>
