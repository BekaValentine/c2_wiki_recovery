        Hyper-rapid testing consists of those test ideas that can be employed for low cost, with no preparation, and no deep knowledge of the technology or problem domain. Unlike rapid testing, hyper-rapid testing is not a complete test process. But with hyper-rapid testing, I can walk up to any product and find problems in it immediately. I like to demonstrate hyper-rapid test techniques when I give testing talks just because they are the sort of things that can be demonstrated in only a few minutes. -- <a href="JamesBach.html">JamesBach</a>
