        I once saw this in someone else's code:
      </p>
      <code>
        //Kludge it till it works...Grrrrr!<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        referring to the next section of code below. Sometimes when stuck, nothing else works and you just need a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>, this mindset can at least get a first draft, which can be 
        <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a>ed later. Not that I am advocating kludges or lack of planning. But after trying all other <a href="DecisionRoutinesWhenStuck.html">DecisionRoutinesWhenStuck</a>, <a href="KludgeItTillItWorks.html">KludgeItTillItWorks</a> helps to start tame the problem. Just <a href="DoSomeThing.html">DoSomeThing</a> instead of getting trapped by <a href="AnalysisParalysis.html">AnalysisParalysis</a>.

        I once contracted on a system where they tested against testing/staging sub-systems and production sub-systems in odd unpredictable phases. I couldn't predict what production part and test part they'd match up on any day, and they wanted it to <strong>self-detect</strong> its production state based on the ever-changing environment it was in, so the code I added eventually looked something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        // section X<br/>
        If <criteria> then  // adjust criteria accordingly<br/>
        x = production_version_of_this_section()<br/>
        else<br/>
        x = testing_version_of_this_section() <br/>
        end if<br/>
        ...<br/>
        // section Y<br/>
        If <criteria> then  // adjust criteria accordingly<br/>
        y = production_version_of_this_section(x)<br/>
        else<br/>
        y = testing_version_of_this_section(x) <br/>
        end if<br/>
        ...<br/>
        // section Z<br/>
        If <criteria> then  // adjust criteria accordingly<br/>
        z = production_version_of_this_section(y)<br/>
        else<br/>
        z = testing_version_of_this_section(y) <br/>
        end if<br/>
        ...<br/>
        // section etc..<br/>
      </code>

        I feel sorry for the poor maintainer hired after I left. I felt bad about leaving such a mess, but did my best per circumstance. I would have lobbied for formal config flags, but the person I would be lobbying to had recently quit, and non-technical managers were all that were left.
