      <p>
        A <strong>stakeholder</strong> is any person or representative of an organization who has a stake -- a vested interest -- in the outcome of a project. A stakeholder can be an end-user, a purchaser, a contractor, a developer, a project manager, the marketing lead, or anyone else who cares enough or whose needs must be met by the project.
