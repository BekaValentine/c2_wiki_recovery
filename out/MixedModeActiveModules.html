        Mixed Mode Active Modules
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <em>Mixed Mode Active Modules</em>
        level combines features of the <a href="InteractiveScreens.html">InteractiveScreens</a> and the next level <a href="LaboratoryPrototype.html">LaboratoryPrototype</a> which is a form of <a href="FullFunctionalSimulator.html">FullFunctionalSimulator</a>.  The idea behind mixed mode is that you have a stubbed prototype and are populating it with data driven interactivity so that in the computer you have the actual data models that will be used in the real application, but they are fed with canned data files.  The canned data can be real (which is the best case) but collected at another time and place.  Thus the fidelity of the active modules is quite high at the data level but it finesses the issue of how did the data get into the computer in the first place.  --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>
