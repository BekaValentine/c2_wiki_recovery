        I'm a Distinguished Engineer at IBM Corporation. Somehow I was conned into being the Program Chair of <a href="PlopTwoThousandTwo.html">PlopTwoThousandTwo</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently interested in <a href="JavaPatterns.html">JavaPatterns</a> and especially <a href="JavaIdioms.html">JavaIdioms</a> since the definitive set of these has yet to be written. Since I have an intense interest in distributed Object systems I'm also interested in <a href="MessagingPatterns.html">MessagingPatterns</a>, DynamicMessaging, <a href="DistributionIdioms.html">DistributionIdioms</a> and <a href="ComponentDesignPatterns.html">ComponentDesignPatterns</a>, a project in which I'm working with <a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a> and <a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a>.  The first fruit of this collaboration is <a href="http://members.aol.com/kgb1001001/Articles/PLoP99/brownfinal.pdf.">http://members.aol.com/kgb1001001/Articles/PLoP99/brownfinal.pdf.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I've started to think about the <a href="FutureOfJava.html">FutureOfJava</a>, the <a href="FutureOfSmalltalk.html">FutureOfSmalltalk</a> and the <a href="FutureOfObjects.html">FutureOfObjects</a>. I'm an author (with <a href="BobbyWoolf.html">BobbyWoolf</a> and <a href="ShermanAlpert.html">ShermanAlpert</a>) of the <a href="DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion.html">DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion</a>.  I'm also a co-author of <a href="EnterpriseJavaProgrammingWithIbmWebSphere.html">EnterpriseJavaProgrammingWithIbmWebSphere</a>, which is only tangentially patterns-related.
      </p>
      <p>
        For years before coming to IBM, I was a Senior Member of Technical Staff at <a href="KnowledgeSystemsCorporation.html">KnowledgeSystemsCorporation</a> (KSC).  I can be reached by email through <a href="mailto:kyle.brown@acm.org">mailto:kyle.brown@acm.org</a>  I've been interested in Patterns since I was introduced to them by <a href="KenAuer.html">KenAuer</a> back in 1993.
      </p>
      <p>
        Way back in 1995 <a href="BobbyWoolf.html">BobbyWoolf</a> and I presented a Smalltalk graphics tutorial at 
        <a href="SmalltalkSolutions.html">SmalltalkSolutions</a> that drew heavily from the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> patterns,
        as well as some of my own patterns to explain the
        <a href="SmalltalkGraphicsFramework.html">SmalltalkGraphicsFramework</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also published a patterns experience report on using 
        design patterns in <a href="OrderManagementSystems.html">OrderManagementSystems</a> in the January '95 
        issue of Object Magazine.  Most of the articles that I've
        written for the Smalltalk Report have a patterns slant, as do the articles on Java that I've published in Eye on Objects, Distributed Computing, <a href="VisualAgeMagazine.html">VisualAgeMagazine</a> and the <a href="JavaReport.html">JavaReport</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="BruceWhitenack.html">BruceWhitenack</a> and I have been working on a set
        of patterns to describe how to connect relational databases
        to object-oriented systems we call <a href="CrossingChasms.html">CrossingChasms</a>.  We
        presented the first set of results at Plop'95.  We later presented a tutorial on the latest version at OOPSLA '97 and <a href="SmalltalkSolutions.html">SmalltalkSolutions</a> '98.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also written a paper in collaboration with <a href="RobertHirschfeld.html">RobertHirschfeld</a>
        and <a href="AmundAarsten.html">AmundAarsten</a> (still sadly unpublished) on <a href="PatternsOfClientServerArchitectures.html">PatternsOfClientServerArchitectures</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy tinkering around with <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s.  Finally I wrote my Master's thesis on Reverse Engineering Smalltalk code.  It features a search engine that will scan your design for uses of several specific GOF patterns like Composite, Decorator, Template Method and Chain Of Responsibility and document them along with more traditional diagrams and specs. If you're interested, see the entire thing at <a href="http://www2.ncsu.edu/eos/info/tasug/kbrown/thesis2.htm.">http://www2.ncsu.edu/eos/info/tasug/kbrown/thesis2.htm.</a>
