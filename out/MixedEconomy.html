        Mixed Economy
      </h1>
      <p>
        A mixture of a <a href="FreeMarket.html">FreeMarket</a> and regulatory controls, such as exists in the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a> at present.
      </p>

      <p>
        I understand a <a href="MixedEconomy.html">MixedEconomy</a> to be a <a href="FreeMarket.html">FreeMarket</a> where the State not only regulates but owns substantial
        pieces of the national economy.  As in, nationalized industries.  Different from a CommandEconomy in that
        prices are not regulated by the State and there is still freedom to contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        If regulatory controls were enough to make a <a href="FreeMarket.html">FreeMarket</a> into a <a href="MixedEconomy.html">MixedEconomy</a>, then <a href="FreeMarket.html">FreeMarket</a> can't be a
        useful term (to describe actually existing national economies) because there would be no such thing.  Every
        nation regulates commerce.
