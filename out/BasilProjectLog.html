        Basil Project Log

        This reflects a change of tack for the <a href="BasilProject.html">BasilProject</a>, previously, notes have been unpublished.

          08.04 - For a MastersThesis, I am looking at rolling out more of the BasilParserDevelopment component, and writing a thesis that focuses on the BasilTestStringApplication.  The bad part is I am using code I haven't worked with for up to seven years.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I'm also trying to figure out proper coupling between Basil parser integrations and Basil models.  I think I am going to keep AbstractSyntaxTrees as a separate tupling, but I'm going to need to standardize the <a href="AbstractSyntaxTree.html">AbstractSyntaxTree</a> format so you can build good handlers for the model.  I have defined a BasilGrammarModel as a DTD, and generated a factory for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a good example of how to use the model framework:
      </p>
      <code>
        % DTD2PyModel.py BasilGrammar.dtd > BasilGrammarModel.py<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Next steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Write adapters from the various grammar parsers that instantiate BasilGrammarModel instances.
        </li>
        <li>
           Write a handler that adapts the BasilGrammarModel to something the BasilTestStringApplication can choke down.
        </li>
        <li>
           Write a handler that creates <a href="AbstractSyntaxTree.html">AbstractSyntaxTree</a> model handlers.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use the tool previously mentioned to write a PythonBytecodeCompiler.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other recent developments include me moving the code base to a <a href="SubVersion.html">SubVersion</a> repository on CodeSpeak (which also hosts <a href="PyPy.html">PyPy</a>.)  I'll need to figure out how to do the proper indirection from <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>.  I wasn't able to get my pgen module into Python 2.3, but I've put it in my code base (along with the documentation I drafted for <a href="PyCon.html">PyCon</a>.)  What is more bizarre is that I've reimplemented pgen in the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ol>
        <li>
          18.03 - I would hate to say the project is dead, so I'm not going to do that.  About a year and a half ago, I pitched a proposal to expose the pgen parser generator to the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> interpreter (PythonEnhancementProposal 269).  After getting some interest in its completion from <a href="GuidoVanRossum.html">GuidoVanRossum</a>, I have finally got a prototype working that I don't mind releasing.  I have submitted an abstract to <a href="PyCon.html">PyCon</a> on the matter and should put the patch in <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a> in a day or two.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This reflects another change of tack, as I was previously working on the BasilMetamodeling component in the entries below.  Using a pgen module in <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, I think I should be able to sprint into development of parts of the BasilParserDevelopment component.  I found a UML tool for <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> (PyUt) and will need to look into sharing code.  They don't seem too far along in their XMI integration, and maybe they could help complete my work.  Python should only require one XMI module per UML revision.
      </p>

      </ol>
      <p>
        Python.  The basil.modeling.uml.NSMeta2Py module has come of age.  The primary
        thing left to do is the elment/attribute mapping component needs to
        be computed and add to the model factory class constructor (this also means
        that names of elements/attributes need to be mapped...it should also be noted
        that the BaseModelFactory capitolizes[zp?] the first letter of the element name
        when looking for a creation class in the factory so this needs to be reflected
        when the factory class is generated.)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ol>
        <li>
          26.00 - Need to bang out some of the details of the NSUML meta-model.  How
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        is the generated library serialized?  The easiest answer is to consult the
        NSUML library itself, but I have been avoiding this because of a bias against
        the TrendyLanguage that was Java (I wonder what the next hot language will be,
        not C#, I hope.)
      </p>
      <p>
        From what I have seen from NSUML 0.3.6, the meta-model is built and
        then processed in a similar fashion to the model elements in Basil,
        but it processes the model separately for each aspect of the library (import
        and export have their own classes.)  The library is built, and then the other
        serialization and factory classes are built in separate passes of the
        meta-model.  This is somewhat interesting, but there is a trade off between
        speed and keeping code generation functionality separate (and therefore
        somewhat easier to deal with.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Frankly, I dunno if this is making any sense since it is getting late,
        but I think I have some insight.  The factory class for the UML library will
        try to provide creation methods for each class in the meta model using only the
        class name (package containment is worried about behind the scenes, esp. for
        import and export reasons.)  In the event of name collisions, it will simply
        prepend the containing packages for both names, continuing this process until
        no more names are in conflict.  The rationale for this decision is to keep
        method names for the creation function from getting out of hand.
      </p>

        Example:
        package Spam:

      <code>
        class Egg;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        package Tonnage:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Sparrow;<br/>
        class Weight;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        package Velocity:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Sparrow;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        =================
        class modelFactory (...):
      </p>
      <code>
        def createEgg ();<br/>
        def createTonnageSparrow ();<br/>
        def createWeight ();<br/>
        def createVelocitySparrow ();<br/>

          21.00 - Reversed the order of the log; the newest log entry is at the top of the flat Wiki page.  Wanted to note that the underlying design of the model framework is now documented at: <a href="http://wildideas.org/basil/modelframework.html">http://wildideas.org/basil/modelframework.html</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Since I am now able to process the NSUML generator format, this implies that I now need to add the modeling framework into the Python code generator.  Then I would be able to do the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        % handle.py uml/NSMetaModel uml/NSMeta2Py uml/NSUML.xml nsuml<br/>
        % internalize.py nsuml <NSUML XMI file><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This will require that modeling/uml/NSMeta2Py.py be extended to add the IModelFactory interface and BaseModelFactory subclass into the root __init__ module.  Once this is accomplished, this will provide some rough XMI integration with NSUML. (Note that NSUML has released their model framework generator, NGEN. This needs to be looked at and patterns extracted for possible use in Basil.)  More work needs to be done in mapping the NSUML meta-model to the MOF, and the MOF model onto code (Python code specifically.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Another route to XMI integration is the following scenario:
      </p>
      <code>
        % DTD2PyModel.py uml/uml1_3.dtd > uml/uml1_3Model.py<br/>
        % internalize.py uml/uml1_3Model <IBM or Unisys XMI file><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This will require an improvement in element name handling that may have been mentioned in previous entries.  The part I don't like about this integration is that the model will be dumped into a flat file without any attention paid to packages (for example, using DTD2PyModel.py, X.Y.Z would be placed into the flat model as X_Y_Z.)  Perhaps a XMIDTD2PyModel.py may be in order, depending on the expected pay back of using the NSUML generator framework to gain access to the root OMG UML meta-model.  Other solutions may include a custom XML handler that maps over to the NSUML UML meta-model generated library.

      <p>
        current work in CVS, but current test files are owned by another project
        (NSUML, also on <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>.)  The tests that the checked in source pass will
        therefore not be in the CVS (I am working on this issue.)  For those unable to
        replicate my results, here is what you would do if you were me (once again,
        from the modeling directory of the basil repository:)
      </p>
      <code>
        % DTD2PyModel.py uml/NSMeta.dtd > uml/NSMetaModel.py<br/>

      <p>
        [Runs with no errors.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Note the interface to internalize.py is different from the one indicated in my
        entry for 7.13.00, the model module is specified without the ".py".  Dry run of
        the handler framework is as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        % DTD2PyHandler.py -b NSMeta2Py uml/NSMeta.dtd > uml/dummy.py<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now, using a more thought out interface to the handleModel objective:
      </p>
      <code>
        % handle.py uml/NSMetaModel uml/dummy uml/NSUML.xml<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        [Runs with no exceptions raised (but also with no visual feedback that
        the model was walked properly.)]
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of the day, internalize.py, handle.py were added to the CVS
        repository, along with the NovoSoft metamodel to Python code generation
        handler.  Able to generate Python using the following command:
      </p>
      <code>

      <p>
        mapping between the lexical conventions of XML and Python.  Specifically, XML
        allows attributes of an element to use the period character.  One strategy
        would be as follows: map lexical violations to underscore characters, then
        add a class attribute that maps from the Python class attribute name to the
        corresponding XML attribute.  This allows externalize as well as internalize
        operations on library objects. -- This is not needed.  The map could be stored
        in the factory class which already keeps track of element names and attributes.

        Ohh yeah, wrote the internalize.py script.  Currently I am not pleased
        with its behavior because the imp module does not split up the module

        chdir into the "uml" directory and then import "NSMetaModel".)

        The previous scenario determines the creation of two new scripts:
        internalize.py, and modelProcessor.py.  These scripts will accept
        IModelFactoryModule and IModelHandlerModule compliant Python modules,
        respectively. internalize.py will internalize an XML document into the model
        who's factory is passed (acting as a semi-validator???) modelProcessor.py will
        run a model handler over the XML document.
