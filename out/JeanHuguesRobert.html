        Self description:
        Jean Hugues ROBERT was born in 1965 and started programming at the age of 15. He feels he once had a success with a one million line project that was late by applying the <a href="FixBugsFirst.html">FixBugsFirst</a> principle (he had a failure too).
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributed the <a href="WorldWideWiki.html">WorldWideWiki</a> page (that was created before to describe the more specific www.worldwidewiki.net site) and the <a href="HyperWikiLink.html">HyperWikiLink</a> page too.h
      </p>

        But hopes to be remembered for this definition: "Ecouter consiste principalement ï¿½ se taire" which translates poorly into something like "To listen, one must, mainly... not talk". He somehow relates to the <a href="AspergersSyndrome.html">AspergersSyndrome</a> ;-)

        <a href="HowFastCanYouWriteCode.html">HowFastCanYouWriteCode</a>, well... about 100 LOC per day, over years. Some of it will be <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> sometime in 2004 or 2005 or 2006 or 2007, maybe.

        The <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> and JavascriptLanguage (used to be <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, for work) is what I use most at this time. I was an early adoptor of <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> but I gave it up when genericity was introduced, compiler support was just too bad and slow at the time and slim <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> is still fashionable while C++ seems huge and fat. I briefly switched to <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> keeping an eye on <a href="TclLanguage.html">TclLanguage</a>.

        But I believe that the future is for <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>/s, or <a href="AgileLanguage.html">AgileLanguage</a>/s as some people call them.

        In spring 2006 I founded d ^2^ lab with some good friends. <a href="http://www.d2lab.com.">http://www.d2lab.com.</a> It is not a success so far. I run some other experiments on <a href="http://virteal.com.">http://virteal.com.</a> Including a experiment on a strange simple text mode wiki at <a href="http://virteal.com/WikiExperiment.">http://virteal.com/WikiExperiment.</a>
