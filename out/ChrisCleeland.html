        I currently work with <a href="ObjectComputingInc.html">ObjectComputingInc</a> in St. Louis working on a team commercializing TheAceOrb. In past lives (recent and distant), I've worked with IonaTechnologies in Dublin, Catalyst Solutions here in St. Louis, <a href="DougSchmidt.html">DougSchmidt</a> in his research group, and consulted to Motorola on the Iridium project.  I seem to oscillate between Java & C++, though I seem to be spending a lot of time hacking perl code recently (for better or worse).

      <p>
        I became interested in patterns when <a href="DougSchmidt.html">DougSchmidt</a> first exposed me to them back in 1995.  Since then I've co-authored some patterns-related papers with him, including <a href="ExternalPolymorphism.html">ExternalPolymorphism</a>.
