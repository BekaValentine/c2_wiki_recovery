        <a href="MonkeyWiki.html">MonkeyWiki</a> is a <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> written in the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> by <a href="BarnabyScott.html">BarnabyScott</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does the world need <em>another</em> <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>? Well, maybe it doesn't, but I couldn't find one that fitted what I wanted to achieve with a website I run (<a href="http://www.designermakers.org.uk),">http://www.designermakers.org.uk),</a> so I thought I would write one myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>So here are some of the features that I tried to build in:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Can use templates to give total control of the way the pages look. Unlimited templates for different pages or actions. Template tags capable of including other pages or arbitrary content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Can use Rewrite, so that URLs look clean and like a normal website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Can cache HTML pages so that normal viewing is speeded up
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimal disk usage by sending backups to the wikimaster by email.
        </li>
        <li>
          Suitable for, and easy to install on a rented virtual server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Small (single file) and simple to maintain/improve.
        </li>
        <li>
          Easy to run within a simple wrapper to add such things as access control
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimal, intuitive mark-up suited to a non-technical audience (e.g. line-breaks <em>are</em> honoured). 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        The site cited above has some interesting exploration aids that are worthy of emulation. I particularly liked its implementation of like pages. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
