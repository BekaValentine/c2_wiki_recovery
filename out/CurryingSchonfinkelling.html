        Currying Schonfinkelling
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's really just called currying, but that's not a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>. Currying is a property of functions discovered by Moses Schoenfinkel in 1924. However at the time, <a href="HaskellCurry.html">HaskellCurry</a> got most of the good press about <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> so it was named after him. The term itself was supposedly invented by <a href="ChristopherStrachey.html">ChristopherStrachey</a>.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>If you read the FAQ, you'll see that the property described (the isomorphism of </em>AxB->C with A->B->C) was a "well known fact" well before Schoenfinkel and Curry. Their contributions were apparently in the area of the <a href="EssAndKayCombinators.html">EssAndKayCombinators</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Currying is the concept that functions of multiple arguments are really just <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s which take one argument and return functions. In a sort of Javaish syntax, Here are examples:
      </p>
      <code>
        // two arg version<br/>
        int sum(int a, int b) { return (a+b); }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // one arg version<br/>
        int sum(int a) { return int sum1(int b) { return (a+b); } }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // optimised multiplication<br/>
        int mult(int a, int b) {<br/>
        select (a) {<br/>
        case -1: return int neg(int b)  { return -b;  }<br/>
        case  0: return int zero(int b) { return  0;  } <br/>
        case  1: return int ident(int b){ return  b;  }<br/>
        default: return int std(int b)  { return a*b; }<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In fact you could write that in <em>legitimate</em> <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>:
      </p>
      <code>
        // two arg version<br/>
        var sum = function(a, b) { return (a+b); }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // one arg version<br/>
        var sum = function(a) { return function(b) { return (a+b); }}<br/>
        // Which would be used as, e.g.,<br/>
        var plusfour = sum(4);<br/>
        var six = plusfour(2);<br/>
        var alsosix = sum(4)(2);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // optimised multiplication<br/>
        function mult(a) {<br/>
        switch(a)<br/>
        {<br/>
        case -1: return function(b) { return -b; }<br/>
        case 0: return function(b) { return 0; }<br/>
        case 1: return function(b) { return b; }<br/>
        default: return function(b) { return a*b; }<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        var answer = mult(6)(9);<br/>
      </code>

      <p>
        <strong>But now I see an application of this:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea is used quite heavily in the <a href="SynthesisOs.html">SynthesisOs</a>. You see, if the value of "a" is known at one point in the run, and we intend to add lots of "b" values to it, then <a href="SynthesisOs.html">SynthesisOs</a> calls "sum(int a)", which generates the code to do "sum1(int b)" -- where 'a' is a constant. This is called <a href="PartialEvaluation.html">PartialEvaluation</a>. It gives <a href="SynthesisOs.html">SynthesisOs</a> a <strong>substantial</strong> performance boost, as it can do code optimization based on the value of 'a'. Like, if 'a' happens to be zero, it generates/returns the code "int sum1(int b) { return b; }", optimizing the addition right out. Likewise, if 'a' is one, it generates/returns the function "int sum1(int b) { return ++b; }". Fast. Very fast. (See the paper on <a href="SynthesisOs.html">SynthesisOs</a>.  It claims "10 times faster than Unix.") -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        Because it makes programming much easier and programs much easier to understand.  For example, here's a piece of Haskell code to double all elements of a list:
      </p>
      <code>
        double aList = map (* 2) aList<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That is, to double a list, apply "* 2" to each element -- the * operator has been curried.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this definition can itself be curried, so that:
      </p>
      <code>
        double = map (* 2)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        -- <a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is that really that much easier to understand than
      </p>
      <code>
        @alist = map {$_ * 2} @alist;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ...But that code does not define a new function.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But it does define a </em><a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> block, which, if I understand correctly, is a code object with a lot of the same properties as a scheme closure.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (No, it doesn't; it defines an array, "@alist". <em>But it does so in terms of the block '{$_ * 2}', which is in effect an anonymous function</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        To elaborate:
      </p>
      <code>
        double = map (* 2)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br/>
        list2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        double list1<br/>
        >[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        double list2<br/>
        >[20, 40, 60, 80, 100]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In the <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a> this particular (and many similar problems) can be reduced to 
      </p>
      <code>
        A = A * 2<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        where A is a arbitrarily shaped array. But that is not the point.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        You can curry objects too.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, instead of sending
      </p>
      <code>
        window drawCircleAt: 10@10 Colour: #red<br/>
        window drawCircleAt: 20@20 Colour: #red<br/>
        window drawCircleAt: 30@30 Colour: #red<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        you can curry away the Colour argument, making a new object called a pen.
      </p>
      <code>
        pen := window pen colour: #red<br/>
        pen drawCircleAt: 10@10<br/>
        pen drawCircleAt: 20@20<br/>
        pen drawCircleAt: 30@30<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <a href="CurriedObject.html">CurriedObject</a> is a generalisation of a number of other patterns, like AbstractSession, <a href="IteratorPattern.html">IteratorPattern</a>, as well as pens in graphics systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <a href="JamesNoble.html">JamesNoble</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Given historical precedent, </em>AbstractSession, <a href="IteratorPattern.html">IteratorPattern</a>, and graphics system pens are more like specialisations of, or at least attempts to emulate aspects of, curried objects.<em></em>
        Other patterns seem to be trying to hark back to currying; for example, is <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> much more than curried traversal?
        <em>I sometimes get the feeling that one of the things that has been forgotten (or at least, </em>was<em> forgotten: there seems to be some attempt to recapture the idea in recent times) by the designers of OO languages is that functions are objects, too. A lot of </em><a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a>s - <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a>, <a href="StrategyPattern.html">StrategyPattern</a>, <a href="DecoratorPattern.html">DecoratorPattern</a>, <a href="AdapterPattern.html">AdapterPattern</a>, ... - seem like techniques for transporting <strong>functions</strong> from one object to another. Currying recognises that functions can be <strong>constructed</strong> in a series of steps.<em></em>

        Thank you. There is quite a lot of information on this wiki about this. One starting point is the work of <a href="ThomasKuehne.html">ThomasKuehne</a> in <a href="FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign.html">FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign</a>. There is also the work FC++ (<a href="FunctoidsInCpp.html">FunctoidsInCpp</a>), an attempt to implement in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> a lot of things found in <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
