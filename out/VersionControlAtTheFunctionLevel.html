        Version Control At The Function Level
      </h1>
      <p>
        When I can, I version my functions.
      </p>
      <code>
        class <a href="FooBar.html">FooBar</a>:<br/>
        def foo(self):<br/>
        """ 1.3 fml 2002_04Apr24 """<br/>
        self._foobar = ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I think it is a good idea and would like one day to use a tool that allows me to collaborate with others using a system like this (ie: as opposed to file-based checkins).
      </p>
      <p>
        One issue I see right now as a barrier is that many languages use files as a base, not functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another issue is the fact that there are other things than functions, such as comments, access control (public:, private:, etc) and datamembers.

        This probably goes hand in hand with <a href="SourceCodeInDatabase.html">SourceCodeInDatabase</a>.

        Can't you already do this with something like <a href="GitVersionControl.html">GitVersionControl</a>? Git tracks code throughout the project, not on a file basis, and merges are easy enough that it's simple to commit or merge a function or two rather than a whole file. --<a href="MarnenLaibowKoser.html">MarnenLaibowKoser</a> 29 Aug 2011
