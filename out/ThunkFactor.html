        Thunk Factor
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="ThunkFactor.html">ThunkFactor</a> is a metric for judging the worth of a document, for example course notes. Since <a href="YouArentGonnaReadIt.html">YouArentGonnaReadIt</a> (or rather your students aren't), it's important that your notes make a satisfactory thunk when thrown on a desk so that the student is led to believe that there's value within them.

        Hmmm, I wonder how many projects suffer from this with their documentation?

        This brings us to the observation that, for a number of subjects, usefulness is inversely proportional to page count.

        <em>Oh. So this has nothing to do with how much you thunk when you made the document. Hmmm.</em>

        It takes an immense amount of thinking to produce a thin document.  Thick documents are thick because nobody thunk.  Which is why they go thunk when you plunk 'em.
