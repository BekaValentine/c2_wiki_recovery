      <p>
        "<a href="DbUnit.html">DbUnit</a> is a JUnit extension (also usable with Ant) targeted for database-driven projects that, among other things, puts your database into a known state between test runs. This is an excellent way to avoid the myriad of problems that can occur when one test case corrupts the database and causes subsequent tests to fail or exacerbate the damage. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "<a href="DbUnit.html">DbUnit</a> has the ability to export and import your database data to and from XML datasets. Since version 2.0, <a href="DbUnit.html">DbUnit</a> can works with very large dataset when use in streaming mode. <a href="DbUnit.html">DbUnit</a> can also helps you to verify that your database data match expected set of values."

        <em>Naive question: why don't you just ROLLBACK at the end of each unit test?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the tough part of AgileDatabases is not testing, it's refactoring? DBs are arranged so their innermost schema tightly couples to their performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that one may be testing processes that commit their own work.
      </p>
      <p>
        And even if you isolate tests by rolling back at the end of each one, there's still a need to set up the data at the start of each transaction.
