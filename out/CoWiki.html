        Co Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        coWiki is a dead project.
      </p>
      <p>
        coWiki is a collaboration tool (generally considered a <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>) programmed using the <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a> (PHP5).

        coWiki is a sophisticated but easy to use web collaboration tool that helps you and your co-workers to create and organize web documents, weblogs and knowledgebases or any other document structures directly in their HTML browser. You may evolve ideas and gain a concomitant XML documentation of your brainstorming without having to concentrate on complicated structural syntaxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many senses, it is very like a wiki but additionally provides an easy way to secure and discuss its documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few coWiki features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Editing of documents (web pages) in an HTML browser.
        </li>
        <li>
           Automatic resolving of document links.
        </li>
        <li>
           Possibility to rename any document at any time without leaving broken links. All links to other documents remain consistent even if you or someone else renames or moves a document.
        </li>
        <li>
           Hierarchical directory/document structure that can be nested as deep as you wish. You do not get lost, the breadcrumb navigation tells you where you are.
        </li>
        <li>
           Unixlike access management with owner/group/world access permissions (and restricted visibility) for each document or directory tree.
        </li>
        <li>
           Document revision control, comparing, colored diff'ing and recovery of documents
        </li>
        <li>
           Documents are parsed to XML for further export/transformation. PDF export is a good idea ...
        </li>
        <li>
           Threaded forums for registered users
        </li>
        <li>
           Plugin support through a defined API. Add your functions to coWiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           Template based and multilingual.
        </li>
        <li>
           Administration backend for complete management of this software and its users.
        </li>
        <li>
           ... and probably a few more things you will like.
        </li>
      </ul>

        "After almost five years of evolvement of the coWiki web collaboration software project, the development has been discontinued." This was announced December 13, 2006 on their website.

        coWiki is alive and well now. New maintainers have released 0.3.4 on February the 24th, 2005. -- Sy (27-Feb-05)

        It is aimed primarily at software developers (the name is short for Collaborative Wiki, I believe). -- anonymous
      </p>
      <p>
        : It's not aimed at a particular audience. The meaning of the name is still being discussed. ;)

        It is unfortunate that this project merely borrowed the term "Wiki". It cannot seriously partitipate in <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> and is probably more targeted at smaller commercial sites (it is not a real Wiki in that it is locked per default). The source code layout is fantastic, and it appears to be very extensible. But like most other GPL software it shipped almost documentation-free. Most unique feature is that <a href="CoWiki.html">CoWiki</a> internally stores pages in XML. -- anonymous

           I think it's wrong to assume that any featureset other than automatic linking makes an engine a wiki. Since spam is a horror wikis are only just beginning to realise, "secure by default" is probably not a bad idea.
        </li>
        <li>
           I will begin discussion of <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> support.
        </li>
        <li>
           No, coWiki is not targeted at a particular audience - we would like to see individuals using it for a weblog or notepad as well as for personal, community and corporate websites. It's already used very broadly by various different people and groups.
        </li>

           The documentation is my fault. Since this comment was made (some time ago) it has been greatly improved both on the website and will soon be significantly improved in-tarball.
