        Powerful Interpreter

        The <a href="PowerfulInterpreter.html">PowerfulInterpreter</a> pattern adds some power and reuse to

        There are two main improvements. First, it turns out that you can create new production rules as objects (instead of as classes). This means that in five
        programming statements you can define a language that has five grammar rules. Powerful! 
      </p>
      <p>
        The second improvement is the use of application-specific Stackers instead of visitors. Stackers are helpers that get plugged into production rules. When
        you write a production rule, you can hand it a Stacker that does whatever you want to have happen when the rule fires. For example, if you're parsing an
        HTML file, when you see some <BOLD> stuff, you can have a stacker set the text style to be bold.
