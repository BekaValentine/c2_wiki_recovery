        Jeremy Cromwell
      </h1>
      <p>
        Jeremy Cromwell is still a <a href="WikiNewbie.html">WikiNewbie</a> who is excited to read the many ideas represented here.  Many are unfamiliar (or even contrary to <em>everything I've ever been told I believe in</em>), but the ones he's seen in practice (especially <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>) are too exciting (and (more importantly?) work too well) to be dismissed easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Links he wants handy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http:quickChanges">http:quickChanges</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http:wiki?RecentChanges">http:wiki?RecentChanges</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/topten?do=counts&do=wiki&do=all">http://c2.com/cgi-bin/topten?do=counts&do=wiki&do=all</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http:wikiOptions">http:wikiOptions</a> (for <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        He jumped past <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and became an unrepentant <a href="QuickChangesJunkie.html">QuickChangesJunkie</a> (who does prefer to let the editors have their anonymity).  He also finds the aspect of typing in a URL that may or may not lead someplace interesting interesting.  He appreciated <a href="StartingPoints.html">StartingPoints</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He enjoys stories of <a href="HeroicDebugging.html">HeroicDebugging</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        His <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> is <a href="JeremyCromwell.html">JeremyCromwell</a> (Not<a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>), and hasn't (yet) assumed an <a href="AnonymousIdentity.html">AnonymousIdentity</a>. He isn't that interested in <a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a> discussions, even after giving them an honest try.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has an (unhealthy?), almost Lisp-(Scheme-?)like habit to (over)parenthesize (and make up words (to the delight of spellcheckers (including this one) everywhere))).
      </p>
      <p>
        He no longer chooses to work for those who simply want him to <a href="SweatMore.html">SweatMore</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He rarely reads (and plans on never again contributing to) <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> pages.  (So many one-line zero-content pages, so little time.)  He continues to lurk.
      </p>
      <p>
        He learned to use <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a> (that's tcl to you!) and found its abilities to be exciting, but its use demoralizing.
      </p>
      <p>
        He played with <a href="DolphinSmalltalk.html">DolphinSmalltalk</a> and wouldn't mind working with it, but got lost in his wandering.
      </p>
      <p>
        He discovered <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> and found <a href="TrueLove.html">TrueLove</a> (or, at least, perl without the line noise).  At this time, he as dismissed <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> without prejudice.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is an advocate of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, and is looking forward to putting the <a href="ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices.html">ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices</a> into practice in his new job.
      </p>
      <p>
        He knows the solution to the <a href="MontyHallProblem.html">MontyHallProblem</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        - And he taught it to <a href="MattSimpson.html">MattSimpson</a>.  Thanks!
