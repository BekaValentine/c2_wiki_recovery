        Click To Focus
      </h1>
      <p>
        Mouse movement is irrelevant to keyboard input focus in Windows and a configurable mode setting in X-Windows. You must click inside a window that you want to type into. -- <a href="JeffBay.html">JeffBay</a>

        In such a system, it is very difficult to work in another window without bringing that window to the front of the stacking order. It is especially painful to use several smaller windows floating on top of a big background window, since when you have to work in the background window, it is raised to the foreground and all your other windows vanish beneath it. -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>

        I think it might be the overloading of the clicking that is the problem: We have clicking as in "This thing here is what I'm talking (typing) about", and then we have clicking as in "I want to see this thing here in its entirety". Combining the two takes away a lot of useful flexibility; this is why some programs have the AlwaysOnTop option. -- <a href="WilliamUnderwood.html">WilliamUnderwood</a>

           In <a href="RiscOs.html">RiscOs</a>, the focus and "on top" issues are separated. A window can have focus and yet be partially or even fully obscured. Incredibly useful, and sometimes fantastically productive. Makes it frustrating beyond belief to move to other systems.

        <em>In </em><a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> <a href="CocoaFramework.html">CocoaFramework</a> applications, you can focus a window without bringing it to the front by Command-clicking (not dragging!) on its title bar.<em></em>

        Many years ago I used GUIs that allowed a window to have focus and remain obscured. It was hard to find them sometimes and was more complicated than most of the users I talked to were comfortable with. I got the impression back then that most folks like focus and z-order to be linked. I never think about it anymore because all of my windows are maximized all the time. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        <em>Yes, so the interface is deliberately hobbled to match the abilities of the masses, and potential generality is lost to those who could make use of it. Many of my colleagues laugh at me, claiming that I'm drowning in windows (I tend to have around 60 windows on 6 desktops) and then wonder how I programme so much faster, more effectively, and with fewer bugs than they.</em>

        I wouldn't say "hobbled to match the abilities of the masses". The users I spoke with were programmers and early adopters, so I wouldn't classify them as "the masses". They were able to use the GUIs, but they didn't like hunting for the active window under piles of inactive windows. I'd say the current interfaces are "giving most customers what they want". I usually have 30 windows on one desktop (all maximized, selected with alt-tab and shift-alt-tab) and many folks wonder how I program so fast. I've tried multiple desktops and GUIs that separate focus from z-order, and I don't see how they would speed up my programming. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        <em>They might not, but the system has evolved to prevent me from working in my most efficient way. I suspect that many others would find it efficient if only they could find it at all.</em>

        <em>I usually have 30 windows on one desktop</em>. What horror. I find that with more than about 5, my brain starts to hurt. Anyway, when I code, I generally have one important window - <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a>. Many people wonder how I program so fast. I don't think it's the number of windows I have open, but it's all down to me. :-) -- <a href="MatthewFarwell.html">MatthewFarwell</a>
