        Cruft Budgeting
      </h1>
      <p>
        Your users need functionality rapidly.  You can see what needs to be done to get from point <em>A</em> to point <em>B</em> and how to do it, but you know that it will not be elegant and you will have to <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> quite a bit to simplify.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you get the system running with the new feature quickly?  Should you?  You know that <a href="CruftMultiplies.html">CruftMultiplies</a>.  If you build on top of a portion of the system that is not well factored it will be that much more painful to refactor later.  What do you do?  
      </p>
      <p>
        Examine the <a href="ChangeVelocity.html">ChangeVelocity</a> of the portion of the system you need to modify.  Is there any reasonable chance that you will need to build there before you get a chance to refactor?  If not, then go from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>.  You have a budget for the work in that area.  If it is a high velocity area, <strong>don't do it!</strong>  You will incur serious pain later.  -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>
