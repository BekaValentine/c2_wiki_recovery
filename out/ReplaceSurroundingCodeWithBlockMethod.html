        Replace Surrounding Code With Block Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        A proposed refactoring, relevant to ruby, lisp-like languages, python (?), and could be badly emulated in PHP.  Name probably needs to be adjusted (to <a href="ExecuteAroundPattern.html">ExecuteAroundPattern</a> from <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>'s <a href="SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns.html">SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns</a>).  Thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
        Replace:
      </p>
      <code>
        def test_thing_creates_record<br/>
        before_count = record_count('foo')<br/>
        thing<br/>
        assert_equal before_count + 1, record_count('foo')<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        With:
      </p>
      <code>
        def assert_creates_record_in_foo<br/>
        before_count = record_count('foo')<br/>
        yield<br/>
        assert_equal before_count + 1, record_count('foo')<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        def test_thing_creates_record<br/>
        assert_creates_record_in_foo do<br/>
        thing<br/>
        end<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>

        <em>I think a rationale and explanation would be helpful, but perhaps I'm showing my lack of Ruby knowledge.  Is it obvious to Ruby programmers?</em> -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        It's obvious to a non-Ruby programmer having been exposed to Smalltalk, Lisp and Ruby. All you need to know is 'yield' means 'call functor'. This is ParameterizedExtractMethod, or something along those lines. Or maybe ExtractAllButMethod/ExtractFrame.
      </p>

        <em>Ah hah!  In my mind 'yield' was evocative of the Java platform's Thread.yield(), and confusion ensued.  Note to self: </em><a href="IwannaLearnRuby.html">IwannaLearnRuby</a>.<em> -- DV</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To me it was more evocative of 'yield' in the coroutine sense, probably because I didn't see any thread goo in the area.  <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a> has added a yield keyword to facilitate writing iterators as some sort of half-ass coroutines, transforming the iterator's frame into a heap-allocated object. -- JH
      </p>
      <p>
        Motivations to do so, off the top of my head (and I've just done this on a real live project, so some of these are real):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="SelfDocumentingCode.html">SelfDocumentingCode</a> - especially if the wrapping code is heavy, this is much easier to read.
        </li>
        <li>
           You can then PullUpMethod
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> - if you have multiple different "things" that you want to assert create a record in foo.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hmm, refactoring example was doing proposed refactoring <em>and</em> AddParameter.  Now fixed.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The really good news is intensive research, involving hundreds of programmer-years, has not yet found a way to abuse blocks in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>. If you are writing a method, and you don't know what to write next, you just write <em>yield</em>, and let the calling code figure it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furtherless, <a href="ExecuteAroundPattern.html">ExecuteAroundPattern</a> is a much, much better idiom for <a href="ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization.html">ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization</a> than destructors OR <em>finally</em> blocks. You just put the <em>finally</em> or <em>ensure</em> after the <em>yield</em>. --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        ExtractFrame is the best so far, I think, but not quite accurate.   ExtractDonut?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is this just a variation on </em><a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a> where the method gets a parameter that just happens to be a code block?  You could do basically the same thing in a lot of languages by passing a lambda / function pointer / subroutine reference / etc to the new function.<em></em>
