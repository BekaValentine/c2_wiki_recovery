        Var Arg Macros
      </h1>
      <p>
        Macros which accept a variable number of arguments. Now part of the <a href="AnsiCee.html">AnsiCee</a> 99 standard; long been a supported non-standard extension to various C compilers (GCC, for instance).
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the <a href="CeePreprocessor.html">CeePreprocessor</a> is still a SteamingTurd; and C99 doesn't change that. But <a href="VarArgMacros.html">VarArgMacros</a> are a somewhat useful addition - there are many times when I have had to write things like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        #define foo0() bar(x)<br/>
        #define foo1(a1) bar(x,a1)<br/>
        #define foo2(a1,a2) bar(x,a1,a2)<br/>
        #define foo3(a1,a2,a3) bar(x,a1,a2,a3)<br/>
        /* and so on... usually larger number of args <br/>
        aren't added until needed */<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        where bar() is a vararg function, and foo<em>n</em> are convenience macros.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not very convenient convenience macros ;) The other portable technique is as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        #define foo(PARAMS) bar PARAMS<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        foo((a));<br/>
        foo((a, b));<br/>
        foo((a, b, c));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note the double brackets. I think this technique is marginally better than the foo<em>n</em> technique above.
      </p>
      <p>
        For completeness, the C99 way is as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        #define foo(...) bar(__VA_ARGS__)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        foo(a);<br/>
        foo(a, b);<br/>
        foo(a, b, c);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It's amazing it took 20 years for this to make it into the standard.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        And to be fair, I missed the <em>x</em> parameter in the original comment. Although with respect to the original problem, the screamingly obvious:
      </p>
      <code>
        #define foo(...) bar(x, __VA_ARGS__)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        will only work if foo has at least one parameter. Unless you're using GCC, in which case
      </p>
      <code>
        #define foo(...) bar(x, ##__VA_ARGS__)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        will remove the comma after the x in the case of foo(), BUT THIS INNOVATION WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE C99 STANDARD, so the preprocessor will still emit something retarded in that particular circumstance.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were on the C standards board, I'd be pushing for adoption of C++ templates. (And that's not a throwaway comment - templates provide the C++ compiler with enough information to reason about the code it will emit, and template specialization allows the programmer to provide sensible defaults which can be overridden for specific types. The C preprocessor is still operating at the level of textual concatenation, anyway, I digress...)
