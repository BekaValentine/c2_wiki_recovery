        Have You Stopped Beating Your Wife
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a play on the way (real) reporters interrogate politicians - asking questions with almost no good answer.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Yes!" implies you formerly beat her
        </li>
        <li>
           "No!" implies you refuse to stop
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some good answers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           She won't let me
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I have stopped beating her, but that's because she's no longer willing to play bridge with me...</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
