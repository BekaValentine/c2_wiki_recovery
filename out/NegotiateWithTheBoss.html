        Sometimes, the other party in a negotiation will use an <a href="AbsentProxy.html">AbsentProxy</a> against you-- "I'm sorry, but the manager says I can't accept this offer".  One way of dealing with this is to demand to <a href="NegotiateWithTheBoss.html">NegotiateWithTheBoss</a>--say something like "If you can't approve a deal, then I'd like to deal with someone who can."  If they refuse to let you deal directly with someone who has final authority, consider leaving.

        Many years ago, I learned this the hard way.  During a long-weekend trip to interview in a city to which my wife and I wanted to relocate, the consulting/contracting company managed to get me in to see one more company.  Although I spoke with three or four persons, none was the hiring manager for the position.  Every one of those I spoke with described the new project work that was starting.  The account manager for the consulting company thought the prospects were good there, too.  Well, when I started, the work I was given was nothing like the descriptions from the interview discussions.  Two months later, I felt that I was at a complete dead-end.  <a href="NegotiateWithTheBoss.html">NegotiateWithTheBoss</a> wasn't really an option at that point because the consulting company had no incentive to change my deal (hey, they were getting paid, right?) and I was more than capable of the work I was doing.  I always have to wonder if I would have been better to choose the other one when I had <a href="MoreThanOneOffer.html">MoreThanOneOffer</a>, but it was just a different client of the same consulting company. --<a href="RobBiedenharn.html">RobBiedenharn</a>
