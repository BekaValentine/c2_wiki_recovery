        Easter Egg
      </h1>
      <p>
        An Easter Egg is something that cannot easily be found.
        Usually the reward for finding it is a bit more interesting than plain text.

      <p>
        As we are not little children, we are supposed to hide Easter Eggs and not find them. 
        So an Easter Egg is something that shows up, when the user of a program performs a predefined action.

        Term coined by an Atari executive upon discovering <a href="WarrenRobinett.html">WarrenRobinett</a>'s secret room in <a href="AtariAdventure.html">AtariAdventure</a>, considered by most to be the first Easter Egg.

        <strong>Objection.</strong> This term has been used by technicians for <em>at least</em> thirty years that I know of. If one wants to find a defective board in a rack one swaps them out one at a time. When the failed board is replaced, the rack comes alive. This was referred to as "Easter Egging" for a fault. The same idea applied to any kind of Easter Egg hunt for some solution when the hunter knew not his stuff. Duh! -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>

        I think "Easter Egging" has been done at the Easter time for even longer than that. :-) The term in trouble hunting probably has the long history stated above and in computer program's <a href="HiddenFeatures.html">HiddenFeatures</a> the history stated above that. -- <a href="TomiBgtMantyla.html">TomiBgtMantyla</a>
