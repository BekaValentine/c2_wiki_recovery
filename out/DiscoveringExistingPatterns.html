        Discovering Existing Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        Looking for patterns in old software architectures can
        prove very useful for not only understanding the thought
        processes of the original design, but can make it easier
        to design new components within that architecture.

        I have found that this is especially true for <a href="ClientServer.html">ClientServer</a>
        architectures where there were never any decent documentation
        which described HOW to develop a good client for that server.
