        <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> (AI) comes in two varieties: <a href="SymbolicProcessing.html">SymbolicProcessing</a>, which is all about playing with set theoretic datatypes, and <a href="NeuralNetworks.html">NeuralNetworks</a>, which is all about acquiring stochastic datatypes. Regrettably, neither proves terribly intelligent except in the most limited domains, in which they're nothing more than fancy searching/sorting devices - really no more intelligent than a sieve. The trouble is that the moment you try to make 'em more than that, you hit a <a href="CombinatorialExplosion.html">CombinatorialExplosion</a> that kills you.

        I've never seen a satisfactory explanation of fuzzy logic having descriptive power beyond (a subset of) what you can do with statistics. It may be a different way of looking at things, but doesn't seem to do anything new, really. It also doesn't seem to be a big win as a way of looking at things, either. So I've always been a bit puzzled by its popularity. It certainly isn't any gain in the direction of `artificial intelligence'.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="FuzzyLogic.html">FuzzyLogic</a> and BayesianLogic (probability-logic) are orthogonal, and both can be used simultaneously in an inference system. That which can be described with <a href="FuzzyLogic.html">FuzzyLogic</a> cannot be described with statistics. However, <a href="FuzzyLogic.html">FuzzyLogic</a> is of questionable semantic value... saying that something (a bar stool) is '40% chair' is far less meaningful than saying 'it has 3 legs in a tripod formation supporting a single disk-shaped surface horizontally to the ground at a height slightly higher than has been recognized as suitable for a chair'. The latter allows a great deal more -correct- inference, whereas '40% chair' has semantic issues (what does 40% chair mean to you?) and doesn't lead to any sort of meaningful inference. I'll certainly agree with your statement that it is hardly a big win. Its primary examples are prototype-words (tall, short, warm, cool, fat, thin), but even these have semantic issues (60% warm???) and may be better handled by bayesian logics (I'm 90% confident that Bob would say it's 'warm', and I'm his thermostat, so I'll say it's warm.)<em></em>

        This <em>should</em> be called ArtificialHumanIntelligence.

This is an anthropocentric view of the world - not that this is necessarily a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>, but is is somewhat limiting. Would Bacteria classify the humans they live in as intelligent? Probably not. Would we classify the earth we live on or our SolarSystem as being intelligent?

        While chatting in the office today we came to an interesting conclusion: AI is doomed to failure, because every apparent success is immediately written off as "conventional programming". To play chess as good as a human does was once an AI goal, who's impressed now? To prove theorems was once an AI goal, now theorem provers appear as the solutions to problems in programming textbooks. And so on. Poor old AI community, every time they get something right, it gets taken away from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the IT community demand miracles, that is, seemingly impossible things, from the AI folk (who do themselves no favours re managing expectations), and so anything that turns out to be definitely possible after all is reclassified as "not a miracle" and so doesn't count as "real" AI. The Ai community is, therefore, never going to be able to produce anything that other will look at and say "Yes! <em>that</em> is artificial intelligence". It'll always be: oh yeah, well that didn't turn out to be so hard after all, then.

        Interesting stuff, but I wouldn't describe anything it reports as "constructing novel sentences according to a grammar". Would you?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Being able to talk at all is pretty much forming novel sentences according to a grammar, isn't it? In any case, the chimps were capable of forming new compounds - eg "cryhurtfood." I can't see what more you might need.</em>

      <p>
        I think it has already been proven that apes/monkeys (Don't know the difference, sorry) can understand and use human language (Koko the gorilla anyone?). So I don't think it is much of a stretch to assume it is possible for apes to develop their own languages. I think it is rather arrogant to imply that Homo sapiens are the only species of sentient animal - the fact is we don't know to the extent most animals are intelligent, and quite a few have been shown to be self-aware. Heck, my dog can understand quite a few words (close to a hundred). Sorry if I sound angry. -- <a href="TimothySeguine.html">TimothySeguine</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, but it is ludicrous for apes and monkeys (apes are big, monkeys are small) to develop their own language. Don't you think that if it were at all possible for them to do so, they would have done it in the last tens of millions of years?
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact is that apes and monkeys simply never <em>create</em> words, they don't expand its vocabulary. This is in sharp contrast to human beings, who will create entire new languages when young if the ones they're exposed to don't suit their needs. How did you think sign languages were invented? Well, they were invented multiple times by children who had been born deaf, without any exposure to any pre-existing sign language.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing human beings require to learn a language (creating it if necessary) is exposure to sounds or signs. Not words, just <em>sounds</em> or <em>signs</em>. That's pretty freaking remarkable when you think about it. And it's infinitely more than those stupid apes have ever amounted to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Homo sapiens <strong>are</strong> the only species of sentient animal on this planet. That's not arrogance, it's well-investigated, well-documented <strong>fact</strong>. I think it's pretty arrogant of you to devalue our species just because you don't like it. -- rk

        <em>Seems like I have hit on a sore spot for most people here. Well first of all, I'd like to remark that the comment about apes creating their own languages was mostly a for-instance -- I never meant to imply that was an actual fact. As for sentience in animals, we can look to a standardized definition of what sentience is. I checked my handy-dandy dictionary and the primary definition read something like this: "Having sense perception; conscious." I then looked up the word conscious: "Having an awareness of one's environment and one's own existence, sensations, and thoughts." So sentience breaks down to being self-aware. It has been shown by scientists that a few species of primate(chimpanzees, bonobos, and orang-utans most notably) are in fact self-aware - I have read about it on multiple occasions and have seen it on television more than a few. The science books you grew up reading in high school and college and such probably would not agree with me, but most of those are outdated.

        You chose to mention consciousness, so sorry, you lose. Because consciousness is very well defined above and beyond what you'll find in a stupid dictionary (see <a href="WhatIsConsciousness.html">WhatIsConsciousness</a>, under psychological consciousness) and it's very likely that human beings as little as 3000 years ago did not have consciousness (<a href="OriginOfConsciousness.html">OriginOfConsciousness</a>). So the chance of a lower animal having it? Yeah, right!
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and forget self-awareness because <em>that</em> is not well-defined <em>at all</em>. I don't see why having a model of oneself in an environment matters so long as you're not aware that you <em>are</em> that model. And I just can't imagine <em>that</em> happening short of full-fledged consciousness, which we know that some humans don't have ....

        I can see that this is going to be difficult than I thought (I respect that). In reference to point 1, spatialization: sorry I don't have a link at the moment but there was a study with orang-utans involving a square room that was fully furnished and an exact model of that room. An object was chosen and hidden somewhere in the room. Then a miniature version af the object was shown to the ape and then they placed it in the same place in the model. The ape was then sent in alone to find it and was able to find it with the same accuracy as a 4-year-old child. You have provoked some great thought in me as to the nature of this issue. I don't have any knowledge regarding any scientific study of any of the other items on the list. But also to point 6, narratization: I am not sure if my memory serves me correctly, but I believe that Koko often told stories about things she did. I will look into this issue more deeply in the recent future. As a footnote, I would like to mention that my original post on this thread was about a previous fallacious post stating that apes cannot use language. This conversation has been interesting but I don't believe I have all of the necessary information to proceed.

        There's more than just <a href="OriginOfConsciousness.html">OriginOfConsciousness</a>. JohnMcCrone has written extensively on consciousness and one of his key points is that it's a learned ability which humans don't possess naturally and can fail to develop if it isn't instilled by the age cutoff.

        The inner-voice is something I had not thought of as a hallmark of consciousness. It makes a heck of a lot of sense though. In most of my early memories, I distinctly remember my the voice in my head. I believe that the inner-voice would be at least partially separate from actual thought though. I have memory (maybe backfilled by my older brain, I dunno) of not being able to express what I was thinking tangibly and being frustrated by it. Not sure how this relates to the common experience or how much of my memory in this matter is purely imagined. I thought it might be of note to mention (Please Delete if too off topic), but perhaps this is the wrong place for this discussion <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>.

        I've been doing a lot of thinking recently that perhaps people ought not be trying to invent artificial intelligence so much as reverse engineer natural intelligence. You figure most real systems of behavior have five or six simple rules of operation and all components are made up of collections of those rules. A perfect example is AND, OR, NOT, XOR (and even this set can be reduced to AND and NOT). <em>{Actually just to one: NAND}</em> So if someone can figure out the few basic rules of operation, you could effectively duplicate neural activity in silicon. Add a few million input lines and boom, you've got a human brain. This is my theory, which is mine, and it's my theory. :) -- <a href="SteveSparks.html">SteveSparks</a>

        One thing that's always stopped me cold about that level of approach is how, even if you got the underlying uber-kernel exactly right, likely would one then be to be able to hit on the precise instructional sequence giving rise to human-like intelligence? Seems about as likely or on the order of the complexity of coming up with the human genome to be fed into that little chemical assembler called DNA (or the double helix, or whatever the little engine itself is called - my biology is about as good as my Spanish: I had a couple years of it in school. :) -- <a href="BillKelly.html">BillKelly</a>

        <a href="ArtificialNeuralNetwork.html">ArtificialNeuralNetwork</a>s are based on the idea of <a href="ReverseEngineering.html">ReverseEngineering</a> natural intelligence. Not at the level of making things <em>exactly</em> the same as human brains, though (I don't think we have the technology to do that, for a start). But the principle is to try building things that work in the same sort of way as real brains. Incidentally, Bill: DNA is the medium in which the genome is recorded. There are actually lots of "little engines"; they're called ribosomes.

        <em>Like everything else, it is not the fundamental units that really count, but how you put them all together. The thing about the brain is that we pretty much know the big picture and the small picture, but no way to understand the link between them.

        I think that there are (at least) three fundamental questions about AI. They are all based on the assumption that we will eventually figure out how to make artifacts with an average human level of intelligence. For example, I think either of RodneyBrooks's grand projects of slow progress in AI via ontogeny (i.e., start with a computer with the intelligence of a human fetus, and gradually work through development one day at a time) or via phylogeny (start with a computer with the intelligence of a bacterium and work through our evolutionary branch) would/will work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first question is then: <em>what short cuts are possible?</em> Strong symbolic AI, the idea that human intelligence was largely a matter of logic-like conceptual processing that did not fundamentally depend on (for example) interaction with the external world, would be an example of a (potential, possibly already failed) short cut.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second question is: <em>will we ever build artifacts that greatly exceed human levels of intelligence?</em> Arguably we have already done so, but of special interest is whether we will ever construct a robot that is better than humans at all of the things we think of as typically human: telling stories, raising families, cooking food, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final question is: <em>to what extent will we understand the artificial intelligences that we create?</em> In my line of work, we train and use statistical models all the time without in any real sense understanding what they do, which is not to say that such understanding is impossible: sometimes we do decide to go and try to figure out how such and such <a href="NeuralNetwork.html">NeuralNetwork</a> is doing its job, and sometimes (depending on the size and complexity of the neural net) we even succeed. We almost certainly won't understand everything about the first AIs that we create, but the scientist in me hopes that asymptotic complete understanding is possible (and if we should be so lucky as to continually create ever more complex and intelligent intelligences, that the lag between our understanding and creation be bounded by a constant or sub-log function of time, amen.) -- <a href="ThomasColthurst.html">ThomasColthurst</a>

        It would be interesting to try create an <a href="ArtificialNeuralNetwork.html">ArtificialNeuralNetwork</a> with subsections for major parts of the brain (ArtificialBaby?) to see what would result. Train a subnet to do simple language understanding, a subnet to generate the same (as text like an <a href="ElizaProgram.html">ElizaProgram</a>), a subnet to do basic problem solving, a subnet to simulate basic emotions, and a subnet with some basic knowledge about the world (which could be modified by the language subsystem), and interconnect them. The advantage would be you could incrementally increase the "knowledge" of the system by training from examples. Could even be like a Wiki where the topology, weights, training would be arbitrarily specified and modified by many users over internet. Even if each person added a few neurons/connections and test inputs/outputs once a week, or NnVandals scrambled it, most would want to see it grow it would become more and more intelligent over time. Perl has AI::NeuralNet modules available with the standard distribution for free it would be relatively easy to set up a cgi interface to create this (use mysql to store the topology and weights).

        I thought of a similar idea recently that I wanted to fling into an open forum. I don't know the exact feasibility of this as I couldn't think of an acceptable algorithm. It involves seeding a relatively small net with values, then using quasi-realtime evaluation of inputs and neuron firing. Training would involve sending strings of characters (or other desired information) and a self-organizing learning mechanism. The learning algorithm would not only alter weights but connections and simulated cell growth(strategic addition of neurons). Decaying unused connections, strengthening commonly used ones, and sprouting new ones when localized activity seems to suggest it should happen. The web interface would be used to provide input from the masses. It seems to me that (only in theory) this is like the biological process in more ways than traditional forward and back propagation nets. I have know idea of various implementation details, even certain parts of the math. There is also an issue with continuous input being required to run the net. I don't know if it would even provide interesting results even because it relies on the ability of the input values to induce patterns in the net (of what variety I couldn't be sure). Haven't gotten very far in trying to implement anything of this nature as I completely break down when it comes to deciding on solid learning rules. -- <a href="TimothySeguine.html">TimothySeguine</a>

        <em>That's identical to asking if there are systems that crawl the web and create data structures based on statistical analysis. Probably, almost certainly, but the question is too vague to have much meaning. Neural nets are building blocks, not solutions. Look at them as bricks. You can make a building out of bricks, but there are an unlimited number of kinds of such buildings. Or non-buildings. You can make a nice pathway in your garden with bricks. You can use bricks as paperweights. There are many kinds of bricks, made out of many materials, but to most people bricks are not interesting, it's what you make out of them.

        <strong>Integration Lacking</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the biggest problem with AI is lack of integration between different intelligence techniques. Humans generally use multiple skills and combine the results to correct and hone in on the right answer. These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Physical modeling
        </li>
        <li>
           Analogy application
        </li>
        <li>
           Formal logic
        </li>
        <li>
           Pattern recognition
        </li>
        <li>
           Language parsing
        </li>
        <li>
           Memory

        <li>
           Temporal Simulation
        </li>
        <li>
           Others that I forgot
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It takes connectivity and cordination between just about all of these. Lab AI has done pretty well at each of these alone, but has *not* found way to make them help each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are things like Cyc, but Cyc has no physical modeling capability, for example. It couldn't figure out how to fix a toy beyond the trivial, for example. At best it would be like talking to somebody who has been blind and without a sense of touch all their life. Even Hellen Keller had a sense of touch to understand the physical dimensions of something. Cyc was designed to give something basic common sense about life, not about novel thinking or walking around a room. Thus, it lacks the integration of skills listed above. There are AI projects that deal more with physical models, but nobody knows how to link them to things like Cyc so they can reinforce each other. That is the bottleneck. We can build specialists, but just don't know how to connect them to make a generalist who can use a variety of clues (visual, logical, deductive, inductive, case history, simulation, etc.).

        <strong>Is Hardware or Software the Bottleneck?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Related to the question of whether the bottleneck is hardware or software, the answer perhaps depends on what stage we are looking at. I suspect that the hardware technology currently exists to build an expensive demonstration *if* we knew how. We have the technology to have the same hardware power as a human brain: it just costs many millions. If such did happen in a big lab, it may still require too much hardware to be practical in the field. But for a proof-of-concept, I don't think expensive hardware is actually the bottleneck to building a smart machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, another view is that experimentation on a wide scale is needed to explore ideas. And, this will probably only happen if the hardware is relatively cheap so that small universities and home tinkerers can also play around. In short, we need to distinquish between powerful hardware needed to make it practical, and powerful hardware needed to test the ideas in labs. The answer will probably depend on whether the needed breakthroughs are related to theory or to experimentation. The more they require experimentation, the more hardware will be a factor to at least make a prototype. At this point we don't know what the magic solution will look like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once it happens in the lab, companies will find a way to make it cheaper for commercial use in a relatively short time. It is too big an opportunity for investers to ignore. If they dump gazillions of bucks into pets.com, then real AI seems a no-brainer (bad pun). Thus, I don't think hardware is a big bottleneck to wide adoption of real AI.

        <em>As a person who studies AI, I can definitely say that if you give me a terabyte of memory, I'll use that entire terabyte and probably want a few more. However, the software needs to advance quite a bit, too. To have AI, we need to design algorithms that steadily </em>reduce<em> the computational cost to solve problems and answer question (why? how? what?). This is especially the search-cost when dealing with many possibilities. It has proven that true experts do not process multiple steps forward with a combinatorial explosion... humans are very bad at thinking about that sort of thing! No, instead we just think of the few </em>correct<em> solutions, and move forward... spending time thinking about the wrong solutions is entirely wasteful.

        <em>I, personally, believe that we could build a reasonably intelligent machine on a modern desktop computer if we had a few terabytes of memory, a veritable ton of training material (also measured in terabytes), and software that will automatically develop and recognize useful patterns, learn associations between them, continuously optimizes and indexes, self-audits its learning, and 'forgets' those things that are too low-level to bother remembering. The ultimate task from this continuous process would be to go from low-level pixels and audio to high-level patterns (like recognizing apples vs. glasses of water vs. individual people, human vs. chair, etc.) with severe reduction of the </em>wrong search paths<em>. Something similar can be done with gaining higher concepts out of unprocessed text. Now, this process would be </em>slow<em> (possibly taking over a year), and the final intelligence would only be moderately snappy... but the depth of one's intelligence isn't really associated with the </em>speed<em> of one's intelligence; use of a massive HDD will do just fine for memory in the presence of the right sort of indices.</em>

        I have to disagree with your apple analogy. As a thought experiment only (hopefully), suppose we took an infant and severed their nerves such that they could not feel nor taste nor smell, and also blinded them. They would basically be an ear + brain + mouth. I beleive that such a child could grow up to still answer common-sense questions if given a decent education. In fact, I bet you could hold a phone conversation with them and never know there was any problem as long as certain senses (color, feel) weren't mentioned. Studies and evidence of injuries and birth defects show that the <strong>brain makes the best out of the information channels it has</strong> available to it. It does not depend on all the senses, or even most working in to function on an every-day level. In fact, I would bet that they only need <strong>just one</strong> of the following senses: Hearing, Sight, Touch (perhaps this is stretching it) -- top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That unfortunate child would be unable to draw an apple, remember the taste of an apple, know how an apple feels in one's hand, the crunch, the spray of juice, the scent of citrus. Further, she would be unable to even imagine these things; she'd have no frame of reference to learn things like red, shape, taste, etc. Placed in a situation where she must learn on her own (without educators providing artificial senses), the most she'd ever learn is that apples crunch between the teeth, and do so with far less effort and damage to one's teeth than do rocks. The concept of 'apple' as understood by other children includes a vast array of associated patterns including color, size, taste, stiffness, and more... all concepts that they </em>understand<em> through their senses. That is, they have </em>learned<em> these patterns by experiencing and remembering them, and they can synthesize -- </em>imagine<em> -- these patterns, reproducing a facsimilie of them in their own minds: imagined taste, imagined weight, imagined crunch, imagined spray of juice, imagined scent of citrus. Given the proper media, they might be able to draw an image, offer a verbal description, write down a description, shape clay as an apple - all are forms of expression; all are art. But, no matter what top's unfortunate child does </em>'on her own<strong>, she'll lack any true understanding of the apple. She'll be unable to learn these patterns. She'll be unable to imagine them. </strong>On her own,<em>' she'll be unable to ever gain that understanding or produce that art...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Thus she had best not operate </em>'on her own<em>. Her understanding will depend on the understanding of others, who sense with their own eyes and hands, who can offer some summary of what they see. It may also depend on secondary tools, instruments, to measure signals that don't reach the brain directly and present them by some means through the remaining systems. By speaking into her ears, an educator can tell her of the taste of the apple, of the color, of the weight and shape. She will be unable to </em>intuitively<em> comprehend what </em>weight<em> and </em>shape<em> mean, but the educator could teach her that </em>heavy<em> things cannot be lifted by one man, that </em>light<em> things can be lifted easily, and that objects between one and ten stones can be lifted by men of varying strength. She'll gain a symbolic understanding of 'weight'. The educator can teach that apples grow on trees, then busy themselves for a few weeks teaching the concept of 'tree'. They can make a long list of 'features' for apples... and when later describing some subset of those features, the child may learn to infer (correctly) that they discuss an apple. Ultimately, these educators aren't inherently different from any other sort of sensor. What are eyes but instruments of high-bandwidth visual information that translate to higher-level patterns (people, places, objects) in one's mind? If someone speaks into your ear of the objects that are near, is not one providing a somewhat lower bandwidth, somewhat higher-level </em>eye<em>? Educators can speak even of things that are far beyond your own experience, bringing understanding and patterns and associations back to you would never fathom on your own. And about everything they teach, they can go into smaller detail or greater detail... perhaps at request.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the other hand, perhaps you cannot gain details at request, and lacking anything but a symbolic input sensor, you cannot investigate on your own. Perhaps, as for Cyc, you must wait for some arse to enter the detail -by hand- along with millions of other things that the arses who crippled you forget to tell you about.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Suppose, for a moment, that through some miracle of modern medicine, we were able, at the age of twenty, to restore this child's eyes, sense of smell, sense of taste, and her somatosensory system (collectively 'touch'). Suddenly, she'd have all the senses of another human. However, she'd still be unable to recognize an apple, or draw an apple... she'd know a lot about apples after she is taught to see, of course; she has a lot of high-level knowledge on apples that won't just go away... but nothing in her education has prepared her for handling visual inputs. It will be a long road to learn what people commonly understand about 'apple' and 'tree'. The same goes for Cyc. You cannot just add mics and cameras to Cyc and expect -any- gain. Sight will need to be learned entirely and associated with higher-level concepts through pattern-recognition... invertible to allow for synthesis. (Not that Cyc is capable of automated pattern-recognition in any case. The limits based on dependency for higher-level symbolic information from other sources will hold true for </em>any<em> intelligence.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It would have been much better to just have the senses to begin with, to have some </em>perceptual understanding<em> of color, weight, size, shape, etc. when first learning about apples. This is not harmful, at the very least... excepting that it adds to the software burden (e.g. translating visual input to meaningful data).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't disagree that an AI </em>'can<strong> learn the concept of 'apple' in the same manner as this crippled child... symbolically, with massive aid from educators. I only believe that it is absolutely the wrong way to go: that the AI </strong>ought<em>' to know it through sensor-fusion just as we do: what does it look like, how does one sound when a person bites into it, etc. Only in this manner can the AI even begin to really understand the apple as </em>we<em> do, or with sufficiently similar resolution (e.g. as an anosmic does).

For the full range of reasoning, one needs </em>both<em> higher-level symbolic information (origin, destination, 'physical object', etc. -- associations of patterns communicated by use of words) and lower-level information (all the way down to recognizing (or analyzing) from raw sensory inputs, or imagining (synthesizing) the appropriate inputs for projections... e.g. imagining the weight in one's hand before predicting how far one can lob an apple.)</em>

        Couldn't an AI machine describe what an apple feels or tastes like based on a database of descriptions, say google and/or cyc?

You are not going to ask Stevie Wonder what a pretty girl looks like. (What one feels like is probably for a mature audiance only.)

I think it creates too big of a risk of a "summary savant". Or, at least I wouldn't put all my eggs in that one criteria. A <strong>multi-test score-card</strong> approach may be more effective. Summarizing would be one of many tests. If they flunk summaries but pass other tests, then perhaps they could be forgiven for such a flaw. This is generally how we evaluate human abilities also. Somebody who may be a great auto-mechanic may be crappy at descriptive summaries, for example.

Every proof to some other intelligence requires communication, so there is no getting around that. However, there are alternative, often weaker proofs of understanding... e.g. (from stronger to weaker) via asking of open-ended trick questions (tests recognition and rejection, and synthesis... same as full summary), via asking of open-ended leading questions (tests recognition and synthesis), via asking of multiple-choice questions (tests recognition only), via multiple-choice questions with some 'none of the above' answers (tests recognition and rejection), request for examples (tests synthesis only). The open-ended trick questions test all the same things as a full summary... if you can provide a complete summary or definition, you can answer those questions, and vice versa.

One could argue that you possess understanding so long as you have these characteristics... even if you never bother proving you have it, or lack the means to communicate a proof. The essence of understanding under the definition I provided is the ability to analyze data to a higher abstraction paired with the ability to synthesize an abstraction to facsimile data. When you can do both, you understand the abstraction. If you can look at the light reflecting off an apple and categorize (correctly) that the predominant color is 'red', and if you can later remember or predict about an apple that it is 'red' and you can synthesize a facsimile of low-level 'red' and attach it to the apple, then you understand 'red' as applied to objects (or at least apples). Understanding requires both synthesis and analysis; without both, semantic compression (low-level-data to 'red', 'red' to low-level-data) becomes impossible... you'd either be unable to produce or utilize a summary.</em>

        <em>I suppose this debate could not be settled unless such a deprivation experiment is actually performed.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a deprivation, at least in two sense vectors, has been "performed" and her name was HelenKeller. Obviously, the degree and nature of understanding is going to depend on the degree of sensory capability. An AI based purely on Cyc will exhibit (at least theoretically) only a symbolic and abstract "understanding". An AI with audition, vision, gustation, tactition, olfaction, thermoception, nociception, proprioception, and equilibrioception will be theoretically capable of human levels of understanding. An AI with all of these, plus electroception, broadband EM reception, magnetoception, and echolocation will theoretically be capable of "understanding" beyond human capability. That does not, however, diminish the value of AI systems built only upon Cyc; but they shouldn't be expected to be human in nature. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        My main issue with Cyc isn't the lack of ultimate capability... it's the AI's utter dependence on human input, which is both erroneous and incomplete. A system like Cyc will be largely unable to audit or extend its own information. It also has little or no use for the knowledge it does possess, and lacks much ability to make conclusions based on patterns of data. Now, perhaps that is my personal bias for <em>learning</em> AIs speaking. I won't hide it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you say, an AI with more sensory capability than we possess would potentially be capable of obtaining a much deeper understanding of the world than we currently possess... and we'll feel at a loss when it tells us of how (for example) certain patterns of echolocation and broadband EM reception are meaningful to (some predictions here) just as HelenKeller felt at a loss dealing with colors and sounds. Again, it isn't to say we couldn't learn about these patterns (should the AI deign to explain it to us, or should we study it), but we'd have far less use for that knowledge and understanding than would the AI, and we'd never gain the knowledge intuitively.
      </p>

        Of course, a broader range of sensors goes beyond just accepting a broader range of physical signals. Merely having sensors placed differently, while still providing sensor fusion, can create a world of difference (or at least a paradigm of difference). Having three auditory channels allows you to triangulate sound. Having audio and/or cameras spread over a massive area (e.g. a city) can provide access to broad-area patterns that humans have troubles seeing due to scale (e.g. traffic patterns, crime patterns).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I have to still disagree that dealing with a variety of sensory input is the key. It may be helpful, but not a requirement. Hellen Keller could read braile books about all kinds of subjects and "understand" once she had a teacher to get her started. Nor did I claim that Cyc's rules alone could produce sufficient AI. I agree it probably requires a multi-pronged approach that "triangulates" the responses from different tools/skills, but not necessarily involving lots of sensory info. For example, it may require temporal and/or physical modeling in addition to cyc's rules. Or at least proximity models, such as graphs with distance links (stick-figure if you will). A lot of human activity deals with temporarl and physical proximity. --top</em>

        There is no inherent difference between understanding temporal vs. spatial patterns. There is a great deal of -intuitive- difference, mind you, and some hard-wired differences in humans... but data is data, and such things as space and time are just dimensions that exert themselves in reference to the ordering of sensory input. Useful patterns in 'space' are usually viewed as 'objects' (or 'nouns') whereas useful patterns in 'time' are usually viewed as actions (or 'verbs'), but that's just based on what happens to be useful. Anyhow, your new tactic has some problems (let's add a bunch of <em>models</em> atop Cyc! Yeah!). A model incorporates an understanding, a paradigm; it's quite possible for models to be wrong or inadequate just like anything else you teach Cyc. More importantly, though, a model should be something you develop -within- the AI if you wish to claim any understanding is present... otherwise the AI is doing the equivalent of pulling out a simulator to answer the questions, and it will never learn where it can abstract, cut corners, speed up the process with low loss of fidelity... or even improve on the process, gaining more fidelity. If you're going to add existing models to an AI, it'd be better to teach them the models so they are truly part of the AI's knowledge and understanding. And, yes, this is another <strong>ought</strong>... I won't argue that you <strong>cannot</strong> hack together a functioning AI by plugging in third-party models. I'll only argue that it is an ultimately redundant and harmful approach to the progress of AI technologies, and that you <strong>ought</strong> to know better.

        That can't possibly be the royal <strong>we</strong>. When I started searching for the an internally consistent and <em>correct</em> set of formal abstractions and definitions for <strong>data</strong>, <strong>pattern</strong>, <strong>information</strong>, <strong>knowledge</strong>, <strong>intelligence</strong>, <strong>wisdom</strong>, and <strong>behavior</strong>, it was definitely for flexibility purposes. My goal is to build an intelligence that can learn anything I can learn, and systematically grow its own understanding over time (which is why I needed a measurable definition of <strong>understanding</strong> in the first place). Interestingly, though, my studies have shown that it's actually more difficult to make models 'modules' integrate with a good knowledge system than it is to make the good knowledge system integrate the models directly.

      <p>
        The Wright brothers didn't cobble something together and hoped it worked. They sat down with the pencil, the pad, and their brain... and worked on designs. They also knew exactly what they wanted: a machine that could fly and carry men while doing so. They also had access to plenty of literature revealing plans that failed in their past. They had a very decent chance at getting it... and, no, they didn't build machines that could 'walk' along the way. Their failures floundered about in the mud, just as yours will if you expect that cobbling together failing plans will get you Joe Average intelligence.

        <li>
           Testing is of course needed. The Wright brothers used wind tunnels (an apparent invention of theirs) and kite-like tests. They tested and tuned based on tests. Their first goal was flight, not necessarily far flight, fast flight, or even practical flight. They knew they had to get to stage 1 first in order to get patents and funding for stage 2. If they went for the whole kit-and-kaboodle, then the French etc. may have beaten them to the glory.

               Of course, tuning is a useless waste of time before the architecture has proven itself capable 'with just a little tuning'. I don't disagree that there are stages on the path to Intelligence, with plenty of patents and such on the way.

           Yes. Get it going and when it has commercial success it will generate more research funds and activity. The fixed-wing plane techniques we now take for granted were tested with money and activity around flex-wing models. You seem to want to find the equivalent of fixed-wing technology first. The Write's used a test-based synthesis of existing technologies: gliders, bicycles, piston engines, and kites. Maybe there is a magic shortcut, but history is weighted against that being the most likely trigger.
          <ul>
            <li>
               When a system has commercial success, it also has a great deal more momentum. Better to observe what has <em>already</em> had commercial success and improve on those.

        You should examine, for a moment, that earlier statement of yours: "We are going for average joe at this stage, not Dr. Codd." I'm quite dubious that Joe Average is somehow an 'easier target' than Dr. Codd. Joe Average can drive cars and taxis, can do dishes and laundry, can learn carpentry and architecture, can learn math and medicine. Dr. Codd doesn't have anything inherently different than Joe Average... just more patterns, more education, more knowledge... and, with time and effort, Joe Average could know everything Dr. Codd knows.

        <strong>Bot:</strong> In 2000 there was a great deal of controversy as to whether apples could bounce back. In 2006, Wall Street Journal reported that apples do bounce. I am led to believe that apples bounce.

        ... Ambiguity and communications context must be handled explicitly, and must seamlessly integrate with any searches to independent sources of information like google. That seamless integration costs a great deal for the hacked-together system consisting of many component parts - a cost that increases at least linearly (and more likely with the square) of the number of component parts. It ends up being the humans that pay this cost, that program in, explicitly, which subsystem to use, when, and how... and it can be made to work for specific applications. However, the code will be rigid. It isn't nearly so flexible or long-term efficient as it is to create a system that learns when and which subsystems to use and how to best utilize them (i.e. learn which queries are sensible); if all you do is help out on the 'how' (via provision of a component communications service), the human cost is guaranteed to be linear and significantly smaller with the number of different component interfaces.

        <em>If it has Cyc-like rules, which was stated as an assumption, then it could detect that "apple" may mean different things (distant nodes in multiple taxonomies with the same handle) and use the most appropriate context, or at least ask to clearify.

        Suppose, for the moment, that the Bot was tuned a little and now utilized its initial definition ('a round-shaped fruit' or 'A usually round, edible fruit of a small tree, Malus sylvestris, of the rose family.') and kept this in some sort of communications context for future conversation. Further, suppose that it was able to identify, in its Cyc-like ruleset, this particular form of the apple (e.g. by its attachments to 'fruit', 'tree', and 'Malus sylvestris'). That is, you've already integrated three components of the system: the dictionary, the Cyc-like ruleset, and a communications context management service. So far so good, right? Things are nicely integrated and working 'seamlessly'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you decide to mess with this fragile, rigid balance by utilizing Google as the experience record. If you use statistics and hits as you originally suggested you'll STILL get the sorts of responses I describe above because you would have not integrated the Google service with the human-fed cyc-ruleset, the dictionary, and the communications context. What you must do is, at minimum, filter web page results by subject prior to obtaining statistical hits. (Better would be to make the 'Bot' read the pages and 'understand' them, too, but this will lead you directly into that rabbit hole you were attempting to avoid by use of statistical hits.) In any case, to distinguish the subject you must 'read' some other parts of the page (even if it's just to filter out all pages containing the sequence 'apple.com'). Now, as the programmer, you have the opportunity to decide how you are going to make the Bot 'read' the page and perform the filtering, and how this will integrate (if at all) with the communications context, dictionary, and cyc-like rules set. Tell me, how will you distinguish 'apple' (the fruit) and 'apple' (the company) <em>in a systematic manner that extends to a great many subjects other than the apple?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider, also, the case where the rules-set isn't initially aware of 'apple' (the company) and must, therefore, <em>self-learn</em> to distinguish between them. Even if you take care of 'apple', this situation will show up again and again and again. Your apparent assumption is that humans have already hand-fed the machine all the answers it will need. I am <em>extremely</em> skeptical that such a thing would ever happen... that humans can hand-code anything like 'intelligence'. Even such 'simple' things as reliably recognizing and distinguishing faces is difficult, much less distinguishing behaviors (e.g. recognizing criminal activity, identifying error so one can suggest corrections), and pattern perception is only a quarter of intelligence: consequence prediction, behavior production, and planning are part of intelligence, too.

If something can "fake it" using combinations of google, wikipedia, and cyc to acheive its goal; so be it. On reviewing such a dialog, an AI engineer may add a new rule that says something like, "if the article 'an' is put before a word, it implies a physical object as apposed to people or organizations".

        This isn't relevant. Even if you can distinguish the two at the point of 'Describe an Apple', it isn't affecting the later questions: do apples fall, what color is it, etc. I.e. even if the Bot simply ASSUMES you mean 'fruit', you haven't sidestepped the problem. Did you misunderstand me, above?

        <em>Perhaps not, that is why I created a sample bot discussion so that problems can be shown instead of verbalized. Once the context of "apple" is established, that context stays locked until otherwise changed. You seem to be assuming that the bot forgets prior questions.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           I am making no such assumption. My assumptions above state the opposite: that Bot has this communications context nicely integrated with its Cyc knowledge base, that it is tracking the topic of discussion. Despite this, the fact that the Bot has this context is <em>completely irrelevant</em> if what you are doing is measuring statistical hits on the Google web pages. You need Bot to read, distinguish, and filter between the 'apple' types returned in the search. And that is one of the places where the problem gets <em>deep</em>... it's a pattern recognition problem. There are some simple approaches for any specific domain (e.g. filter out pages with 'apple.com' when searching for colors of apples), but you'll need to handle it for more generic domains. You seem to be assuming this rabbit hole will be something you just casually step over... but if you try, it will swallow you whole.

           <em>I was not assuming we tuned the system just for apples.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           I did not mean to imply you were making <em>that</em> assumption. What you're assuming, unconsciously perhaps, is that designing the Bot to distinguish relevant and irrelevant web-pages returned from a search will somehow be an 'easy' problem... or that it will be wholly solved for you by Google such that you can borrow off the intelligence already invested into the network organization. It is not an 'easy' problem, and the search will never reach that level of organization unless Google both solves this problem first and offers an unambiguous ontology for the searching (Web 3.0 quality stuff... it might happen). This problem is far deeper than you're giving it credit for... deep enough that accomplishing the task is, by itself, a very significant accomplishment. What I see you doing is either waving your hands to make the problem go away or (giving less credit to you) a complete ignorance of problem. I ask again: how will you distinguish web-pages about 'apple' (the fruit) and 'apple' (the company) in a systematic manner that extends to a great many subjects other than the apple? Think about it. Seriously.

You have not presented any scenario that demonstrates a bot would do worse on average than an average person. The bot has high-speed access to the web, unlike a typical human (we'll assume here).

        Humans are excellent at planning. We're so good that we reach <a href="UnconsciousCompetence.html">UnconsciousCompetence</a> and don't even think about how much planning we actually do. How do you plan to obtain dinner? to make yourself presentable for work? to drive home? to obtain your e-mail? to learn about the colors of apples? It is only when making plans that are well beyond our experience, beyond our ability to predict, into the realm of ConsciousIncompetence that we experience frustration and weakness in our planning. Humans are also excellent at consequence prediction. What do you predict will happen if you throw a baseball at a window? or at your boss? what are the likely consequences of a car accident? Finally, humans are quite capable at behavior production on average, and outstanding for certain individuals. I.e. after planning to throw the ring onto the bottle, many of us will at least get close when we make the attempt... but some people will get it every time. We do lack the precision behavior available to machines, though.

           I'm sad to hear you need a web page to make yourself presentable for work, and I suggest you push that skill to a level of at least ConsciousCompetence. (^_^ facetious). Anyhow, the point I'm making is that humans are very good at planning... we plan most of each day's activities without even really thinking about it. I plan the whole direction of my response to you with very little effort, the vast majority of it below the threshhold of conscious thought. When designing an Artificial Intelligence that can plan in most domains, however, things are not nearly so easy... they might, as you suggest, go find 'programs' to help them out in the form of 'How To' documents for dummies and robots, but even the effort to find such a guide is part of a plan (e.g. how might I dress for work? well, first I hit Google up with a request for pages on how to dress, then I read these pages, then I attempt to obtain clothing that is a close match to the suggested styles, etc...).

           (On prediction, baseball at window): <em>The answer can come from prior experience of others. If a person never saw a window before, they may have no idea what would happen. That comes from watching (TV or real). For example, it could bounce off, make a clean hole, or shatter the entire window, bend a dent, etc.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           I agree. Much of our learning can come from the experiences of others as communicated to us. And if a person doesn't even know what a window is (or a baseball, for that matter) it wouldn't be expected that they could make predictions about one, and they'd need to ask questions about these until they had a clearer understanding of the question. I can't expect you to tell me about Bose-Einstein condensates or Relativity at a moment's notice... you'd need to put some effort into studying up, first... the ability to make predictions arises directly from one's knowledge base. It doesn't seem you're challenging any point I made. A human is likely to very rapidly distinguish consequences of throwing a baseball at an open window, a closed window, a glass window, a shuttered window... and even the social consequences of throwing the baseball at one's own window, the window of a neighbor, the window of one's landlord. These consequences include the physical (sound, holes, debris, etc.) and higher-level patterns (difficult conversations, apologies, guilt and shame or arrogant snobbery and lawsuits...).

           Of course a bot will have a boss. ^_^ Or, at the very least, it will be a long time before we make bots 'free' entities that may pick and choose their own jobs of their own 'free will'. More seriously, physical 'simulation' (for prediction, planning, etc.) is NOT a separate issue. It's a separate <strong>domain</strong>. There's a difference. If you're going to handle prediction across generic domains, the physical domain is one of those domains. If you plan to handle every single effin' domain separately, you'll have quite the mess and it will take you a long time and a lot of money to build it. And Stevie Wonder was probably just fine at physical simulation, though he lacked the visual component. He might not be an expert at <em>physics</em>, mind you... but you don't need to be an expert at physics to perform a great deal of useful physical 'simulation' (synthesis, prediction of likely consequences). Even children can tell you a decent subset of what happens if someone bites your arm, jumping from a great height, the physical effects of lifting and slinging a baseball in the direction of a window, etc.

           <em>Children mostly learn these by experience, not physics simulation. Plus, we have not ruled out a physical simulation engine to suppliment the bot. It could triangulate info from all its potential sources of knowledge. Such a simulation engine would probably have to be initialized with common features from the human world, such as desks, dogs, cars, staplers, kick-balls, etc. A physical object encyclopedia, if you will. Yes, a self-learning bot would be nice, but at this point it seems stuffing it with pre-digested knowledge may be the better-understood route even if it does require some form of brute force. Brute force is sometimes the better solution (or at least more predictable) when you are struggling to get the brainier approach to work, which is what is currently happening. When they get self-learning to work and it overtakes knowledge-stuffing, fine. Until then, stuff it. It is similar to propeller planes versus jets. Jets had more potential (invented roughly around 1912), but they required much more R&D to get right (helped by Hitler's often wasteful appitite for "killer apps"). Propellers offered a more tame-able, visible, and incrimental path at the time. Same with transistors versus vacuum tubes. </em>'We are just not ready for the jet and transistor of AI yet<em>'. Knowledge stuffing almost works, while self-learning is pitiful right now.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           I guess that comes down to how flexible your definition of 'simulation' is. To me, a 'simulation' doesn't require a formal mathematical approach. Any system that represents and predicts the behavior of another system qualifies for the term. To me, a computer that ran a 'simulation' by simply making educated guesses as to the properties of desks, dogs, cars, and staplers and their behaviors is still running a simulation... just as much as a computer that runs using rigid and predigested object models with properties hand-programmed by /humans/ that essentially made educated guesses. 'Experience' alone doesn't produce the ability to predict consequences. A child use his or her <em>experience</em> to to <em>aide</em> in imagining consequences, but it is the imagination that constitutes a simulation. When the domain is physics, it's a physics simulation.

           <em>I am not sure there is a real difference between "imagination" versus "simulation".

        </li>
        <li>
           However, to avoid a <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> debate, I'll consider for a moment what you mean by 'simulation': an 'engine' fully preprogrammed that handles such issues as velocities, forces, energies, collisions, etc. in accordance with some popular physics model (classic, quantum, relativity). I think such simulators are of great utility for details beyond human imagination, but for a computer that is more questionable... the details are being handled one way or another. Further, now that you have your physics-engine, you need to add components to the AI so it can <em>use</em> the simulator; by the time you've made it so the AI can figure out <em>what</em> to simulate, you're only be a few small steps from requesting that the AI predict the results of the simulation. By taking away the simulator, you can also reduce the set of rules constraining 'what' you decided to simulate and broaden the set of domains your AI's simulator can handle... to handle such things as social consequences and the behavior of the dog (which a physics engine cannot handle).

           <em>May I request an example? I'm not sure I am following you. Note that there are also things like time-line simulations which may involve little or no location-based simulating. Ideally we would have both course-level abstract simulations and finer-grain ones.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               I'll provide an example, but I'm not sure whether you want an example of 'something to simulate' vs. an example of a situation where removing the simulator is an advantage (e.g. handling the behavior of the dog in response to the baseball) vs. an example of why just having the simulator doesn't build a bridge to using the simulator (which requires the AI build something of a 'scenario' and convert it into the simulator's language based on its own conception of the problem it wants to solve; building such a scenario is a constraints problem, and requires synthesis just like simulating would have in the first place).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           As far as knowledge-stuffing vs. self-learning: it isn't an issue of 'versus'. To learn fast, you need both. To advance to human levels, an AI must be able to learn even from what it is taught.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I am not against research in both; however, we are not ready to integrate them yet to provide the triangulation effect sought above. Thus, the one further along is the best place to invest time right now because we need its success to fund the jet engine of self-learning.</em>

           Attaching more and more components won't be profitable. If you can limit the additional components a great deal, you can reduce the explosive complexity increase on meaningful integration.

        Behavior production (aka behavior synthesis) is the production of a sequence of signals to an agent's actuators... and while it includes such things as entirely random behavior, the 'quality' of behavior production would usually be measured by the disparity between intent and effect (including 'side'-effects, such as expenditure of energy).

        <em>Different humans are better at different things. So why should a bot be good at everything?</em>

        The bot doesn't need to be good at everything. But if you're going for JoeAverage, the bot needs to be mediocre at an <em>enormously vast</em> array of things, and 'good' at a <em>merely 'vast' </em> array of things. The width of domains a typical human's understanding, predictive ability, reasoning, planning, and behavior-set touches is, quite apparently, beyond your comprehension... beyond your sense of scale. To truly understand it, you need to think about how you'd program a Bot to understand or perform things you consider 'trivial', like folding laundry, summarizing a letter, making lunch, and predicting the likely immediate consequences of throwing a baseball at the president's dog. People like Einstein and Feynman don't really have anything special except lifetime curiosity, a habit of thinking deeply, and a mind at least briefly open to alternative paradigms; they might be more creative, have more talent for recognizing patterns, making connections... but those are just power-ups on components everyone has. Even JoeAverage can understand Bose-Einstein condensates and Relativity if JoeAverage can be <em>motivated</em> to learn about them; the potential of even 'average' humans is vast. JoeAverage is not a significantly easier target than Einstein and Feynman.

      <p>
        I wouldn't be too surprised if we have 'Einstein' and 'Feynman' level bots of specific fields (capable of 'imagining' physics instead of using a rigid physics-engine) before we have the JoeAverage robot capable of handling the thousands of fields.
