        <strong>PL/S</strong>: the internal <a href="InternationalBusinessMachines.html">InternationalBusinessMachines</a> (IBM) <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>L</strong>anguage [for] <strong>S</strong>ystems.

        It was possible for an adept programmer to do almost anything systemish in an application using IBM PL/I--especially with mature versions of the PL/I Optimizing Compiler--that was possible in System/370 Assembler (<a href="IbmSystemThreeSixty.html">IbmSystemThreeSixty</a>): Data overlays? Dynamic program loading? Explicit multitasking? All no problem. But PL/I couldn't be used as a stand-alone systems-programming language. IBM PL/I implementations relied on PL/I run-time routines that interfaced to OS/370 system routines. So IBM couldn't write its operating systems using even its best PL/I compilers; the run-time routines necessary to the compiler wouldn't be available during operating-system development. Thus PL/S, which did not use a run-time library, but could easily embed whatever Assembler code was necessary using the "<em>@GEN</em>[<em>ERATE</em>]" and   "<em>@ENDGEN</em>" constructs, filled an important niche.  PL/S provided access to Assembler macros, and could specify that particular variables were to be assigned to particular S/370 registers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be argued that PL/S was used, to a great extent, for the structured-programming benefits of its PL/I flow-of-control statements, which prevented a whole category of potential errors, and produced a straightforward translation into S/370 Assembler. RealProgrammers at IBM favored the listing options that combined the high-level PL/S code, the Assembler  generated from the high-level code, and the explicitly coded Assembler embedded using "<em>@GEN</em>" and "<em>@ENDGEN</em>". It really was <em>not</em> practical to use PL/S as a high-level language whose loftiness excused the programmer from understanding the S/370 architecture and its Assembler.
      </p>
      <p>
        The straightforward approach to translating PL/S into Assembler code had one especially exasperating consequence: Each PL/S <em>structure</em> produced an Assembler <em>dsect</em> (<em>data section</em>), which meant that all field (<em>member</em>?) names across a single compilation needed to be unique, unlike in PL/I. That is to say, PL/S <em>structures</em> provided no <em>scope</em>. So every mundane  "size" or "length" field needed to have a unique spelling; if one <em>structure</em> had a field named "size", any other comparable-purpose field in any other structure needed its own unique spelling--or misspelling--for example: "siz", "sz", or "sze"--a great opportunity for difficult-to-detect errors caused by a programmer's eyes glazing over.

        [A request was edited in for clarification of "PL/S lines of source-code with 'interleaved Assembler code'"]
        <em>What does that mean?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please see expanded description above, unless the issue is the meaning of "interleaved".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The original wording was "with its interleaved"; if you'd simply written "with embedded", the meaning would have been clear, and the explanation unnecessary.</em>--anon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional explanation still seems necessary after all. What was "interleaved" was not just the <em>embedded</em> Assembler, the latter adjective describing only what was explicitly coded between "<em>@GEN</em>" and "<em>@ENDGEN</em>". The compiler also "interleaved" the <em>generated</em> Assembler code resulting from compiling the high-level PL/S code. As an admittedly contrived example code fragment, hobbled by my fading memory of S/370 Assembler:
      </p>
      <code>
        DCL (COUNT, LIMIT, SEMAPHOR) FIXED BIN(31);<br/>
        ...<br/>
        IF (COUNT >= LIMIT) THEN DO;<br/>
        L   R5,COUNT<br/>
        C   R5,LIMIT<br/>
        BLT *+8<br/>
        @GEN;<br/>
        TS  SEMAPHOR<br/>
        @ENDGEN;<br/>
        END;<br/>
        /* 'BLT' conditionally branches over 'TS' to here,<br/>
        absent an ELSE-part */<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        'TS' above is intended to be the S/370 atomic <em>test-and-set</em> <a href="MutualExclusion.html">MutualExclusion</a> instruction,
        for which PL/S had no high-level primitives that I recall. I don't recall whether the compiler would really substitute the compiler-allocated address for the variable name SEMAPHOR in the embedded 'TS' instruction. A more typical--but much longer and more complicated--example would have I/O-macro expansions between "<em>@GEN</em>" and "<em>@ENDGEN</em>".
