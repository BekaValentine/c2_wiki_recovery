        Ben Last
      </h1>
      <p>
        Research & Development Manager of a UK mobile software house.  Programmer since the age of nine, meaning that I got over the computer obsession thing well enough to have an actual life.  Technical enthusiasms; Python, the lore of software development, elegant design.  Technical dislikes; technology for the sake of technology, developers who let their personal enthusiasms get in the way of what's best for the project.
