        Wiki Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        The intent of these patterns is to suggest ways authors (and we are all authors) can, with a little discipline, make this hyperdocument easier to read and update. Please feel free to update, augment, correct, clarify, and reformat any of these patterns, or any of my articles. Just because they start out with my name on them does not mean I consider them mine. Please add to the list below too. (What the heck, I get more votes that way.)
