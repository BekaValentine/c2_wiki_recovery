        Ward Please Reinstate Recent Posts
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ward, will you please reinstate <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a>? I think that it is ridiculous that it has been taken down. It is one of the few tools we have to fight spammers, and it is really the only way to know who has been messing with what.

        [No. It has limitations that make it difficult to determine with certainty who has made the most recent edit.]

        <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> gets fouled-up/fooled too easily. If we had <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a> back, then we could tell who, what, when, a bit better. The way things are now, it is sometimes hard to tell who is a <a href="BlackHat.html">BlackHat</a> and who is a <a href="WhiteHat.html">WhiteHat</a>. Throw in that maddening <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, then things really get ugly (especially since no-one seems to update the bot to a better corrected version of pages it insists on restoring... although anyone can do that).

        Well... Without <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a>, this <a href="WikiSucks.html">WikiSucks</a>.  Watching what is going on, and tracking changes made by certain IP addresses, and with the spoofing of user cookies, without <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a> this Wiki has become the WildWildWest of a mess.  No way to track who is really doing what.  The one thing that I can say, is that there is a whole lot of funny business, and not necessarily by the bad guys.

           Yes, I see GV as definitely being a bad guy.  As far as "funny business" goes, I have noticed some interesting patterns (which I am keeping to myself for now) that need further investigation, and <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a> sure would help [Am I mistaken, or was it EarleMartin who took down <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a>, and if so, can't it be fixed?].

        Oh my!  I had an epiphany today, and I can't believe that after all of these years, I have been so SlowToLearn.  Of course Ward is not going to turn <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a> back on, because he is a minimalist, and a strong advocate of doing <a href="TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.  It's not about what would be best, or perfection, but about what is the least that will work.  He now has <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> which sort-of shows who's IP address has been doing what, in a round-about way that can easily be fooled and fouled, but that's good enough I guess...

        It has now been 3 years since this request was made, and the problem has only grown bigger.  There is this <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> that spoofs anyone's UserCookie and <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> that they find useful, and this has caused much confusion.  The conditions now are very similar to that of when <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a> was first implemented, and I fail to see why reinstating this tool would not be in the best interest of everyone on Wiki (except <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> and other such reprobates/delinquents).  Please reinstate this tool!!!
