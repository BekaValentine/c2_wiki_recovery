        <em>I have to ask - can one juggle while trampolining?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way I've been able to do so is by synchronising the two so that all throw and catch pairs happen near the top of the bounce.  Trying to do anything under acceleration is extremely difficult.  To the best of my knowledge, no one has juggled in arbitrary phase to their bouncing.
