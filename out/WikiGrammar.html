      <p>
        Wiki's <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a> lead to some contortions of English morphology, to wit: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I am one of the PeopleWhoRefactorWiki. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>s
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>(obviously, sometimes it is easy to restructure a sentence more like "I am one of the PeopleWhoRefactorWiki.")</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SixSingleQuotes.html">SixSingleQuotes</a> is a clunky solution when the plural form of a page name is not simply an extension of the singular form, e.g.: <a href="StrawMan.html">StrawMan</a>, <a href="StrawMen.html">StrawMen</a>; Radius, Radii; Diagnosis, Diagnoses; Tooth, Teeth; and (according to Shelly Berman) Jackii and Kleeneces, Octopus and Octopi. (Note: Octopi is correct plural form (along with octopuses!) according to The American Heritage? Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition).
      </p>
      <p>
        [<em>Ugh - some dictionaries are just too accommodating!</em>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Even worse: FolkWithFeet, FolksWithFeet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Possible solutions</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           A <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> page that redirects (perhaps automagically) to <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Switching to <a href="QuechuaLanguage.html">QuechuaLanguage</a>, which has a <em>very</em> regular morphology. To wit: <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>, <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>kuna.
        </li>
        <li>
           Modifying the engine so that one chooses each word and its definition that make up the link from a dictionary and then chooses the form appropriate for the context <em>(Explained below)</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Adding a new page alias feature to the wiki engine (Explained below).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The first solution seems somehow simpler, though I can't quite put my finger on why. On the other hand, the second solution would encourage participation by Greedo the Bounty Hunter and the others from his planet.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Alternative perspective: the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> mechanism isn't perfect, but it's usually <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>.
      </p>

        <em>Explanation of the 'choose words' solution in the list above</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        When entering a link such as <a href="StrawMen.html">StrawMen</a>, one would find the word 'man' in a wiki dictionary, find the appropriate definition (a male person) and choose the desired form (the plural form 'men').
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, this would be a painful process and would detract considerably from the nature of wiki.

        <em>Explanation of the 'page alias' solution in the list above</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is to allow the creation of multiple PageAliases for a page (e.g. <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> and <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>). The <em>new page creation</em> page is a good place to propose such alias creation: if existing page names lexically close to the new page are found in the repository, these existing names could be proposed in some way to the user as candidate aliases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technically, this feature is a good opportunity to dissociate page names and page ids, and unleashing new features such as 'page renaming', 'page alias' and 'page (names) internationalization', aso.

        Before: "You sound a bit insistent for somebody who allegedly found the secret to true happiness."
      </p>
      <p>
        After: "You sound a bit insistent for somebody who allegedly found the secret of true happiness."
      </p>
      <p>
        Somebody made the above alleged correction. I am curious to know the rule for why it is "of" instead of "to". One would say, "key to the door", which is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are many words in English that always take a certain preposition, but without any particular reason; they just have to be memorized. In this case, "secret of" and "key to" are both correct. For help on a specific word, consult a dictionary; similar words are often used differently.</em>
