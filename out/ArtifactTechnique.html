        There is a difference spelled out in the short quip above, between <strong>thinking</strong> (the notion) about how to do something (the action), and <strong>forming</strong> (the process), of something that works.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When designing or utilizing a process  Artifactory, one may find a good, a better, and perhaps even a best usage which becomes the object
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a> a great degree upon knowing what kind/type object/artifact) you are to make
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is the kind of problem one arrives at when the question comes up:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="HowDoYouKnowWhenYouAreDone.html">HowDoYouKnowWhenYouAreDone</a><strong>?</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Raising this question is an indication of a shortcoming in the <strong>technique</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The ultimate goal in this scheme is to form an artifact that is <a href="UsefulUsableUsed.html">UsefulUsableUsed</a>
