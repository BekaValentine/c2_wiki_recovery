        Software Crisis
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is a lot of excellent software development being done by programmers, and there are a lot of unhappy users who can't find software that works the way they think it should.  But as somebody said a decade or so ago, it's not a crisis because it's been going on too long.  Every now and then, someone comes up with a cure, but it usually results in programmers being able to do bigger and better software that does things that the users don't want, or fails to do what they do need.

      <p>
        It is arguably a complexity crisis rather than a software crisis. Software gets blamed because software is our best tool for handling complexity.

        I mumbled something about this on <a href="EntropicLawOfComplexity.html">EntropicLawOfComplexity</a>. It was later munged, but I think there may be something still there worth reading.

        XP includes some techniques designed to fix some of the problems that lead to the idea that there was/is a <a href="SoftwareCrisis.html">SoftwareCrisis</a>. Like: get something that user asked for running and back to the user fast. Like: get two brains working on a piece of code. Like: test test test test. Like: Don't re-organize when you add something new, instead add the new thing, test it, then reorganize, then test...

        I believe the term was coined by <a href="DougMcIlroy.html">DougMcIlroy</a>, while presenting his paper on mass produced software components to the NATO Conference in Software Engineering conference in 1968. The crisis turned around the management of three dimensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           number of programmers
        </li>
        <li>
           complexity of the applications (demand)
        </li>
        <li>
           productivity (plagued by the mass of existing software)
        </li>
      </ul>

        Particularly in the context of in-house information systems, I blame stovepipe applications and a lack of reusable information system services. Try <a href="DoItFramework.html">DoItFramework</a> for a suggested cure. -- <a href="JimRussell.html">JimRussell</a>
