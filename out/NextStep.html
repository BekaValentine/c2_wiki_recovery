        An OS that was cool from <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a>. Got bought out by <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a> and was turned into <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>.

        <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> took OO programming and implemented it in almost every corner of the application development layers. They created ObjectiveC. When Quake was first written, to my understanding, they wrote it on <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> running on <a href="HewlettPackard.html">HewlettPackard</a> <a href="PaRisc.html">PaRisc</a> workstations, and then ported it to dos.

        <em>id Software wrote the "world builder" for DOOM on </em><a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> before <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> was available for <a href="PaRisc.html">PaRisc</a>.  The game itself did not originally run on the Next, because the game engine was tuned for VGA bitplanes.  DOOM was eventually ported to <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> due to cries from the community, but it did not run well on the NeXTdimension.  Not sure where Quake got its start, but <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> ran on Intel by that time.<em></em>

        NeXT computers (the original machines that <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> ran on, aka the "black hardware") are one of those things that I'm always fighting myself over buying. On the one hand their cheap, on the other cheap is not free. On the one hand, they are darn cool, on the other, they only use a 68040 CPU. Plus, space is limited for me, and I don't know that I'd have the time to ever use the thing. The history of <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> is just one of those sad things that we have to get over, kinda like the death of the <a href="PixarImageComputer.html">PixarImageComputer</a>.

        Actually, not all HP workstations use the 68040 CPU. They originally did when HP had bought out Apollo (which was working on the Prisim RISC architecture at the time). Most of my <a href="HewlettPackard.html">HewlettPackard</a> workstations use the <a href="PaRisc.html">PaRisc</a> processor.

        Actually, <a href="BradCox.html">BradCox</a> created ObjectiveC.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's quite true. </em><a href="JeanMarieHullot.html">JeanMarieHullot</a> chose ObjectiveC (with others) as a more dynamic object language than C++ for implementing the influential <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a> on top of the Mach kernel. Jean Marie (who almost worked with me before Jobs came along, shucks!) told me at ECOOP in 1989 that the core team for <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a> consisted of Jobs, a graphics designer and himself as programmer. He was enjoying it. Jobs sounds a fun person to work with. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a><em></em>

        <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a>, and the <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> graphics framework, was designed by BillParkhurst with lots of help from BudTribble, BruceBlumberg, and a crew of developers and graphic designers.

        ObjectiveC was created by <a href="BradCox.html">BradCox</a>, and <a href="ProductivityProductsInternational.html">ProductivityProductsInternational</a> (PPI) was the name of the company under which it was first marketed. PPI was later renamed to "<a href="StepStone.html">StepStone</a>". The VultureCapitalists who invested in PPI forced PPI to adopt the brilliant strategy of going head-to-head against AT&T (ObjectiveC versus C++). <a href="BradCox.html">BradCox</a> and the other cofounders tried very hard to persuade their investors and customers to view ObjectiveC as a "module-level" language - Brad's metaphor went something like this: "Choosing between C++ and ObjectiveC is like choosing between photolithography and solder. You need both." Unfortunately, Brad did not own a controlling interest in his company and the rest is history.

        A family of related pre-processor based "OO" languages emerged in the early eighties, as the ideas of Smalltalk penetrated the CS world. At its core, the fundamental idea under each of them was to model an "object" as a struct, a method as a "procedure", and a "message" as an indirect call to the address of the procedure, passing a memory reference to a "receiver" as an argument on every method invocation. Apple called it "<a href="ObjectPascal.html">ObjectPascal</a>", PPI called it "ObjectiveC", Bjarne called it "C++", and several of us (yours truly included) just did it (in both C and assembler) without calling it anything. It was primarily AT&T's willingness to give away C++ licenses and compilers, while misleading the market about its capabilities, that resulted in AT&T's utter domination over more principled competitors such as PPI and Apple. Such is life. ObjectiveC had C syntax and appearance, and Smalltalk semantics (for message sends). It was a perfect choice for Next.

        <em>Actually, AT&T was barred from competing in markets unrelated to telecommunications at the time, due to some consent decree (only four years after the introduction of C++ to the world, AT&T was forced to divest its local telephone business - which has nothing to do with C++, other than to illustrate the rules they operated under). Hence, they couldn't have made C++ a commercial product if they wanted to.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And I'm curious - how precisely did AT&T "misrepresent" C++? Did they (or someone at AT&T) out-and-out lie about its capabilities? Throughout the 80s, those capabilities were very much in flux - even throughout the nineties this was true. (Or do you claim that because AT&T didn't publicly announce that "C++ is crap and we therefore repudiate it", that this amounts to misrepresentation)?</em>

      <p>
        <em>If any vendor(s) has been instrumental in making C++ commercially important, it's been Microsoft (and Borland, until they dropped the ball), not AT&T. The Unix community long resisted C++, preferring to stick with the combination of C for low-level stuff and scripting languages for high level. It's the PC where C++ became the "preferred" language for software development - especially shrinkwrap software. By that time, the biggest role AT&T continued to have in C++ development was to provide </em><a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a> with a laboratory and a paycheck.<em></em>

      <p>
        <em>Yeah, but the </em>NextCube was cool, and the AppleCube isn't as cool. I just don't like the looks of the new Apple gear at all (except for the new iBook and Titanium <a href="PowerBook.html">PowerBook</a>).<em></em>

      <p>
        And the cubes don't resemble each other in any way aside from having the same number of roughly 90 degree angles and proportions close to having w = h = d. Such designs have been seen elsewhere. At least the Cobalt Qube(sp?) and several small clone micros (uATX) come to mind.
