        I was an independent consultant, but am now employed by <a href="ThoughtWorks.html">ThoughtWorks</a> with the imposing title of Chief Scientist. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to carry out any experiments yet.

        Martin keeps more thoughts under less hair than anyone I know. My first introduction to him was at a workshop of luminaries. His first words were, "I'm the only person here I've never heard of." That and his habit of gently imposing civility have endeared him to me.

        <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>'s name on an article that says "Unit tests lie, but the compiler doesn't."?
        It can't be!

        I find myself fascinated with Martin's ability to keep an entire 1 1/2 hour presentation in his head. (and on topic!)

        Martin made a combination Wiki and Blog which is referred to as a Bliki aka <a href="BloggedWiki.html">BloggedWiki</a>. Oops. The URL for his Bliki is above.
