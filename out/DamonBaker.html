        long time wiki lurker. one of those people who's biography involves lots of slashes, mostly focused on combinations of computer technology and various cultural pursuits (programmer/musician, audio engineer/installation artist, etc) currently working at brown university's CAVE virtual reality environment on real time 3d immersive audio systems and hunting for phd programs in between ceaselessly reading wiki. This is my first attempt at making my own home on wiki.
