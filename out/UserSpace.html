      <p>
        In <a href="OperatingSystemsDesign.html">OperatingSystemsDesign</a>, <strong>user space</strong> is where applications are run, outside the kernel and protected by it from memory and program corruption by other processes. Applicable to <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>s that are <a href="MultiTasking.html">MultiTasking</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it not the kernel which is protected from corruption by any process? Are you intending a distinction between protection provided by hardware such as different address spaces, and protection provided by software?
