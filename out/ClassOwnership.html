        Class Ownership
      </h1>
      <p>
        One idea is that class ownership is an organizational 
        mechanism for use with a team of lesser experienced 
        developers.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The assertion is that a team of highly skilled individuals
        tend to be highly collaborative and will develop a good 
        understanding of their problem space.  Consequently, each
        has the ability and understanding to alter, re-factor or
        modify classes within their problem space as required. 
        Whereas a team of lesser skilled developers can make use of
        class ownership to help manage their development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there a pattern here of diminishing returns for class
        ownership as development teams become more skilled?
