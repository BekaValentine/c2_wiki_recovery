        Scrum Is Not An Acronym
      </h1>
      <p>
        The name of the <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a> is not an acronym.  It (inaccurately?) comes from Rugby.
      </p>
      <p>
        The authors of Scrum don't spell it SCRUM.  It doesn't really matter, but SCRUM implies an acronym, whereas Scrum doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        From scrum or scrummage 1 : a rugby play in which the forwards of each side come together in a tight formation and struggle to gain possession of the ball when it is tossed in among them 2. British : MADHOUSE or a badly organised queue.
        .
