        'The point to this applet is to explore the consequences of a fall in costs on the market.
        Specifically, this applet would be useful to a startup ecommerce company which was attempting to predict what affect its own existence might have on the market it participates in.
        markets are based on negative feedback loops. High prices attract suppliers, but the resulting competition drives the prices back down.
        There isn't really any good theory of economic growth, but it's clearly based on positive feedback loops, like viral marketing and the network effect.
        That mixture of positive and negative feedback loops is more or less the definition of "interesting" dynamic systems. In this context, "interesting" means "hard to predict".'
