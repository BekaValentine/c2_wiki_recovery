        Super Card
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Mac-only <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a>-like RAD-come-multimedia development environment based on 'screens' arranged like a stack of cards. Better colour integration than <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> (HC), but separate coding and interface environments are awkward.
      </p>
      <p>
        More complex and less Rapid a RAD to use in practice, but makes prettier-looking applications than HC can out of the box.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uses <a href="SuperTalk.html">SuperTalk</a>, the same kind of scripting language as HC, and will accept the same range of XCMDs and XCFNs as <a href="HyperTalk.html">HyperTalk</a>.
