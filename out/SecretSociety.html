        Secret Society
      </h1>
      <p>
        Secret Society is a development anti-pattern that occurs as a consequence of poor abstraction. The methods of the poorly abstracted objects are insufficient to engage in a conversation and so a new function or method is added (a secret society) whose purpose is to process the conversation. That function/method takes as its arguments all of the participants in the conversation and any other controls. The secret society function/method then becomes responsible for maintaining the state of the participating objects, hence breaking encapsulation. When this anti-pattern is widely applied, the definition and maintenance of each classes state becomes distributed through a collection of secret societies.

        Isn't this more of a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>? It looks like a specific instance of <a href="GodClass.html">GodClass</a>. It doesn't seem like it justifies the <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> label, especially since the <em>problem</em> is the poor abstractions being covered, not the method of covering them up. -- <a href="JesseMillikan.html">JesseMillikan</a>

        Every thing is a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> - just some are specific enough to call names.  I have seen this one but it's very rare. - ATM
