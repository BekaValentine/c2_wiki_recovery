        On coding standards:							  
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Let them evolve during the first few iterations.				
        </li>
        <li>
           Let them be team specific instead of company specific.			
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't write them down if you can avoid it.  Rather, let the code be the way the standards are captured.				
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't legislate good design.  (e.g. don't tell people not to use goto)								
        </li>
        <li>
           Make sure everyone knows that the standard is about communication, and nothing else.							  
        </li>
        <li>
           After the first few iterations, get the team together to decide.
        </li>
      </ol>
