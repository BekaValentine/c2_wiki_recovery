        The Grateful Dead
      </h1>
      <p>
        Cathartic blues country rock band.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lead singer: Jerry Garcia
      </p>
      <p>
        Their greatest talent: They made their music psychologically addictive, on the manic side of a <a href="ManicDepression.html">ManicDepression</a> neurosis cycle. Specifically, traditional Blues music entertains you with the singer's troubles. GD music entices you to feel like you yourself are healing & recovering from some terrible grief.

        <em>...</em><a href="TheGratefulDead.html">TheGratefulDead</a> took chances in every one of their 2nd sets over the 30 years. They could either be a big miss or hit the big one. When they hit the big one, their music transcended all musical boundaries and transported one somewhere. It became a religious experience or Dionysiac ritual. The brutal stereotypes exist: their fans smell, their all on drugs but that's crap. There were a lot of us professionals that neither did drugs or drinking (not a drop in the last 12 years) but were able to find something in those explorations to keep us coming back night after night hoping that this would be the night for one of their masterpieces. Their explorations actually were more rooted in jazz improvisation and that's why they played with Branford Marsalis and Ornette Coleman. Fans of <a href="TheGratefulDead.html">TheGratefulDead</a> included Peter Jennings, Walter Cronkite, Bill Clinton, and many others who regularly attended concerts. We found the music engaging, not depressing. They were one of the only bands that could go from a Merle Haggard song to a wild jazz-infested jam in seconds. That's why I own 2200 hours of live tapes.<em></em>

        I'm sure they have a large collection of songs. But is there <em>that</em> much variation? I'm somewhat obsessive about bands I like and will collect live versions, remixes, and whatever else the band has done. But not 2200 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, there is actually a huge variation. 1974 GD is a whole together different band than 1977, than 1980, etc. The GD adapted and changed many times. In 1974 they were a jazz fusion band for instance. In 1972, they were a psychedelic space band. In 1977, they were a straightahead rock band. It don't matter. I'm on a Led Zeppelin kick now (and Metallica).

        I'd third that, however, I don't have good enough net access anywhere to listen. Perhaps if he'd put them up as MP3s.

        <em>Ripple, one of the most meaningful songs I know by Hunter/Garcia:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine<br/>
        And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung<br/>
        Would you hear my voice come through the music<br/>
        Would you hold it near as it were your own?<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken <br/>
        Perhaps they're better left unsung<br/>
        I don't know, don't really care <br/>
        Let there be songs to fill the air<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (Chorus)
      </p>
      <code>
        Ripple in still water<br/>
        When there is no pebble tossed<br/>
        Nor wind to blow <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Reach out your hand if your cup be empty<br/>
        If your cup is full may it be again<br/>
        Let it be known there is a fountain<br/>
        That was not made by the hands of men <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        There is a road, no simple highway<br/>
        Between the dawn and the dark of night<br/>
        And if you go no one may follow <br/>
        That path is for your steps alone<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (Chorus) 
      </p>
      <code>
        You who choose to lead must follow<br/>
        But if you fall you fall alone<br/>
        If you should stand then who's to guide you?<br/>
        If I knew the way I would take you home<br/>

        The Canadian reggae musician AndruBranch has a very well-reviewed cover of Ripple. See <a href="http://andrubranch.tripod.com/">http://andrubranch.tripod.com/</a>
