        Shared State Concurrency
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Shared State Concurrency</em> is concurrency among two or more processes (here, a <em>process</em> is a flow of control; rather than a particular type of kernel object) which have some shared state between them; which both processes can read to and write from.  See also <a href="MessagePassingConcurrency.html">MessagePassingConcurrency</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SharedStateConcurrency.html">SharedStateConcurrency</a> has the following advantages...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Can be very fast.
        </li>
        <li>
           Makes <a href="GlobalConsensus.html">GlobalConsensus</a> much easier to achieve
        </li>
        <li>
           Makes passing around <a href="ReferenceObject.html">ReferenceObject</a>s that much easier, especially if a pointer/reference valid in one process is valid in another.
        </li>
        <li>
           Can be used to model <a href="MessagePassingConcurrency.html">MessagePassingConcurrency</a> fairly easily.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ...and disadvantages
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Much more difficult to model and prove a system correct.
        </li>
        <li>
           Requires lots of synchronization primitives (<a href="SynchronizationStrategies.html">SynchronizationStrategies</a>) to prevent race-conditions
        </li>
        <li>
           Does not scale well to distributed systems, especially in the presence of unreliable connections between processes (i.e. over a network).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Criticisms of the "advantages" above:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's not particularly useful for a system to be fast but incorrect, and in any case the speed advantage relative to message passing is small.
        </li>
        <li>
           The point about <a href="GlobalConsensus.html">GlobalConsensus</a> is refuted at <a href="MessagePassingConcurrency.html">MessagePassingConcurrency</a>. In a nutshell, this depends on the actual reliability of communications, not the concurrency model.
        </li>
        <li>
           Passing <a href="ReferenceObject.html">ReferenceObject</a>s is also easy in most message-passing models.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you use <a href="MessagePassingConcurrency.html">MessagePassingConcurrency</a> implemented in terms of shared state, then depending on how well the shared state is hidden:
          <ul>
            <li>
               its disadvantages leak into the message passing layer, or
            </li>
            <li>
               its disadvantages don't leak, in which case it is an ImplementationDetail and you should describe the system as using message passing.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
