           Karen Schneider, the Freerange Librarian, has an article in the Library Journal on the ethics of librarian blogs that begins promisingly: "Blogging is turning information into a conversation..."

She recommends transparency, linking to sites with which you disagree, being accurate even postponing pressing the Publish button until you're sure, a pretty drastic step for some of us and admitting your mistakes.
