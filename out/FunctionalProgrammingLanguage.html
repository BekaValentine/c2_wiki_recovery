      <p>
        A <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> is called functional if it supports and/or encourages <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>. <em>Dysfunctional otherwise. *Arr arr arr*</em>

        A list of <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a> descriptions and links:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Haskell [<a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>] - the archetypal FPL in the 1990s, it is lazily evaluated (as opposed to strictly or eagerly evaluated, see <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>), <a href="StaticallyTyped.html">StaticallyTyped</a> and supports input/output, GUIs, animation, databases, COM and ActiveX, etc. I.e. all the usual "side effects" that are not usually considered to be practical in functional programming are practical in Haskell with <a href="ReferentialTransparency.html">ReferentialTransparency</a> (See <a href="OnMonads.html">OnMonads</a>). There are several open source systems. See also <a href="TemplateHaskell.html">TemplateHaskell</a>.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Erlang [<a href="ErlangLanguage.html">ErlangLanguage</a>] - the champion FPL in the 1990s, it is <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a>, mostly functional (i.e. supports some imperative side effects that break <a href="ReferentialTransparency.html">ReferentialTransparency</a>). Erlang applications are composed from <a href="CommunicatingSequentialProcesses.html">CommunicatingSequentialProcesses</a> (shared nothing message passing). This is the champion FPL for the 1990s because was developed by Ericsson and is used in several released products (switches, etc.) for soft real time distributed telecommunications. There is one open source system that includes a CORBA ORB, Naming service, Event service, a distributed soft real time database with nested transactions, replication, and a query language, among other goodies like SNMP, HTTP, etc.

           m4 (the macro processor), which is available in almost any <a href="UnixLike.html">UnixLike</a> environment, is largely functional even though it supports imperative features.  It has an exotic LevelOfQuoting concept, and allows all kinds of quirks by being ultimately text-based.  Implementations often have undocumented limitations which causes your macro expansion to fail in spectacularly bamboozling ways.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           FP - an interesting twist on functional languages -- no variables! You write programs by composing functions into new functions.  Mostly a proof-of-concept language, little real use, but interesting to play with. It is described in <a href="JohnBackus.html">JohnBackus</a>' ACM <a href="TuringAwardLecture.html">TuringAwardLecture</a> "<a href="CanProgrammingBeLiberatedFromTheVonNeumannStyle.html">CanProgrammingBeLiberatedFromTheVonNeumannStyle</a>" (1977).  This is the functional language that made functional programming an (academically) household name.  Succeeded by FL.

        <em>What are the criteria for inclusion above?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be different opinions. I would include any language that	
        encourages a functional style of programming. So ML and <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> and 
        Scheme could be in this list.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What about Lisp? Too old? Too many side effects? Too many dialects?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Lisp should be listed on its own since they are so different especially
        in how they encourage functional programming. Clojure is the most "functional purist" of them, followed by Scheme and Common Lisp (in that order), which like to think of themselves as being multi-paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What about Pizza? Too young? Too short-lived? Too close to Java?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would include Pizza since it extends Java by adding first-class functions,
        and so encourages a functional style of programming. Much more so than the
        anonymous classes of Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What about Prolog?  Too old, too academic?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You cannot define a function in the <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a>, or apply a function to its arguments. Prolog is not about functions, it is about predicates; it is a <a href="LogicProgrammingLanguage.html">LogicProgrammingLanguage</a>.  However, both Erlang and Mercury were developed from Prolog.

      <p>
        <em>What about </em><a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>?...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Guido seems to have spent a lot of breath convincing us that Python is <em>not</em> a functional programming language.  Guido even wanted to remove lambdas; however, public outcry ultimately forced him to keep lambdas in the language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Guido wanted to remove lambdas in the belief that named functions are easier to read, not out of any particular dislike for functional programming. Python contains functional features adopted from many other languages, such as Haskell's list comprehensions and LISP's map/filter/reduce (= Haskell foldl). Use of first-class functions is common in the standard library's API.</em>

        There is some discussion about the relative advantages and disadvantages of <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> and <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> and about the degree that <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> and <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> can be used in the same language.

      <p>
        Most newer <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s support static type-checking, so if you have a function f of type A->B i.e. f takes an arg of type A and returns a result of type B, and an expression x of type A then you can apply f to x to get something of type B.
        Since functions are first class citizens the x could it self be a function. E.g. suppose I want a function dot which takes two functions and returns a function which applies the second fn then the first fn , its type would be:-
      </p>
      <code>
        dot :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (using Haskell syntax - x :: T means x is of type T. Identifiers in types starting with lower case are TypeVariables and denote arbitrary type. That is called <a href="ParametricPolymorphism.html">ParametricPolymorphism</a>). It could be defined as:-
      </p>
      <code>
        dot f g = \x -> f (g x)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (The "\x -> .." part is an <a href="AnonymousFunction.html">AnonymousFunction</a>.) This would be another way of defining dot:-
      </p>
      <code>
        dot f g x = f (g x)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (The dot function is actually defined as an infix "." operator in <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>)
        Another example is the curry function from the Haskell prelude :-
      </p>
      <code>
        curry	  :: ((a,b) -> c) -> (a -> b -> c)<br/>
        curry f x y	= f (x,y)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        i.e. it takes a function which takes it arguments as a pair and returns an equivalent function which takes it arguments in a curried form. (See <a href="CurryingSchonfinkelling.html">CurryingSchonfinkelling</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence functions can be manipulated in a quite sophisticated fashion. Try to do this in C++/Java and you will probably have to write an FP interpreter. -- JonHanson
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder if you could write an <a href="FpInterpreterUsingTemplates.html">FpInterpreterUsingTemplates</a>?

        <strong>[</strong><a href="CleanLanguage.html">CleanLanguage</a>]<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To do I/O in Clean in a functional way, you pass the world around, and compute new values of the world. Because Clean has <a href="UniqueType.html">UniqueType</a>s, the Clean compiler can guarantee that there is always only one live copy of the world around. Therefore, it can mutate the world in-place, rather than having to copy it entirely, which would be computationally costly, to say the least. ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        Haskell doesn't have <a href="UniqueType.html">UniqueType</a>s, so it cannot take this approach.
        Therefore it uses monads. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is a subject of </em><a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>s, but <em>I</em> prefer using monads to <a href="UniqueType.html">UniqueType</a>s. Monads are at least native functional constructs and don't need specific language support. Besides, you get rid of the explicit passing of world - which has no benefit anyway, because you can't copy the world.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="UniqueType.html">UniqueType</a>s aren't used just for IO, other uses include arrays with destructive updating. Also <a href="UniqueType.html">UniqueType</a>s are easier to use when you want to write code that has two kinds of effects (e.g. read a file and put the contents in an imperative array). In Clean you can freely mix the two kinds of <a href="UniqueType.html">UniqueType</a>s where in Haskell you need to write some specific monad transformer to let you mix IO and State monads. Also you can have monads (modulo syntatic sugar like <a href="DoNotation.html">DoNotation</a>) in Clean, but the inverse isn't possible in Haskell. Saying that <a href="UniqueType.html">UniqueType</a>s can be very hard to grok.

        I've been peeking at J, from <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/,">http://www.jsoftware.com/,</a> and see the ad phrase that says "OOP is easy with J4!".  But reading the documentation, I can't see that "locales" can be constructed as variables, so I can't see how to implement polymorphism or inheritance.

        It doesn't look OO at all to me, it looks like Backus's FP revived.

        PHP programmers may want to check out this library that adds some functional programming abilities to PHP4.

        "Aleph is a multi-threaded functional programming language with dynamic symbol bindings that support the object oriented paradigm. Aleph features a state of the art runtime engine that supports both 32 and 64 bits platforms. Aleph comes with a rich set of libraries that are designed to be platform independent"

        The last release is from mid-2001 but the language is kinda interesting, and the compiler is really cool (written in C++, it compiled without errors on gcc 2.96.x and just two unprotected #define's in a couple of header files in gcc-3.2. No warnings.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a shame they don't seem to be developing/supporting it further. Maybe it can be saved if we manage to get a community effort (licenses providing, the compiler was <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a>).

        That would be reasonable, but I would consider ensuring there is a list naming the most 'mainstream' FPLs at the top (Haskell, ML, Erlang). Other orders that are okay would be order of creation.

        What kind of programs do you think are written more easily in FP languages? Specifically for people who use FP and non-FP languages - what situations do you find yourself using FP languages for? For example, I'm an aspring academic. Are they especially suited to mathematical and/or logical thinking? Number crunching?

        Is <a href="LuaLanguage.html">LuaLanguage</a> a functional programming language?  
        I was just debating this with someone who claims it is not.  But if not, what disqualifies it (that does not also disqualify <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>?)
