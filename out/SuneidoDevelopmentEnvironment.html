        <em>Andrew, would you agree that Suneido still lacks a full-blown form/subform editor?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that a visual "form" designer is something Suneido should have. One of the reasons it doesn't have one is that I'm not a big fan of them - I find it just as easy to do the layout in the code. But that's just me :-) Currently, Suneido's user interface (and report) layout is all relative, using a boxes and stretch model. Whereas, a lot of form designers use absolute positioning, which is pretty brittle and inflexible. For example, when one of our users, RobertoArtigas added some language translation to Suneido, all the forms and dialogs automatically adapted to the different text lengths. So when we add a visual form designer to Suneido, I'd like to retain the same relative layout, which will be a little trickier to do than simple absolute positioning. -- <a href="AndrewMcKinlay.html">AndrewMcKinlay</a>

        Currently, the development environment is made up of several separate <em>tools</em> (e.g. Work Space, Library View, Query View, Schema View)that each open in their own window.  We've been considering consolidating these tools into a single window (probably based on the existing Library View) making it more of an <em>integrated</em> development environment.  I'm still undecided on which I prefer, so I'd appreciate any feedback people might offer. -- <a href="AndrewMcKinlay.html">AndrewMcKinlay</a>
