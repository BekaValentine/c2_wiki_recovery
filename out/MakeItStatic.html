        Make It Static
      </h1>
      <p>
        In object-oriented programming, "make it static" usually means "add the <em>static</em> keyword to that method definition".
      </p>
      <p>
        In web design, "make it static" means "pre-render that page once and cache it, rather than dynamically re-creating it each time someone asks to see it".

        <strong>static method</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Make methods that do not influence the state of the containing class or its derivatives as static. This shows the user, that this method should not have been there, but exists there due to ease of access, convenience or lack of a better place. This helps in refactoring, as it shows where to start. -- <a href="VhIndukumar.html">VhIndukumar</a>

        <em>What is meant by "this method should not have been there"?  I usually start out a </em><a href="FactoryMethod.html">FactoryMethod</a> as being static on the class that is being created until there is DesignPressure to do otherwise.<em></em>

        The "main()" method is always static in Java.
        Typically <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> methods involve static methods.

        <strong>static web page</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many web pages are dynamically re-created each time someone asks to see it.
        Some people speculate that pre-rendering them would save time, although others suggest that may be <a href="PrematureOptimization.html">PrematureOptimization</a>.

        In particular, some people suspect that pre-rendering Wiki pages would make the wiki run better, somehow.
        (I seem to remember a page here discussing the advantages and disadvantages of trying to pre-render wiki pages. Am I just remembering <a href="FilesystemBasedWiki.html">FilesystemBasedWiki</a>, or is there another one?)
