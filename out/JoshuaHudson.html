        Contributer to <a href="BottomMind.html">BottomMind</a>. I really do think that way.

        I am a man who prefers to understand things from the bottom up. I seek out the truth and will use it. I will not operate based on someone else's BeliefContraryToReality for political expediency. I won't always call the person on it, but requesting something based on that is not really a good idea. I am not afraid to tell the hard truth, and not afraid of how many people's toes I have to step on to get work done.

      <p>
        Usually I support good <a href="CodingStyle.html">CodingStyle</a>, but I have and will violate all principles of good <a href="CodingStyle.html">CodingStyle</a> when necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        I preach bottom-up understanding of the machine, <a href="BottomUpDesign.html">BottomUpDesign</a>, DeepUndertanding of the consequences of the <a href="VonNeumannArchitecture.html">VonNeumannArchitecture</a>, high levels of abstraction, and the consequences of unmanaged memory model (PowerfulAtomics).

        I developed techniques for writing <a href="CrashOnlySoftware.html">CrashOnlySoftware</a> from only the first two sentences of the definition and practice this kind of development when possible. It cuts down on support calls by a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        I demand <a href="RootAccess.html">RootAccess</a> to my development workstation. I will do what is necessary to get the job done, up to and including <a href="AspectOrientedTheHardWay.html">AspectOrientedTheHardWay</a>. I think at MultipleLayersOfAbstraction at the same time. I code in languages from <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> to DotNetFamily at will. I can and will use FunctionPointers and/or delegates. I am a <a href="ThreeStarProgrammer.html">ThreeStarProgrammer</a> (or worse) as need be.
      </p>

        I am a <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a>. Get used to it.
