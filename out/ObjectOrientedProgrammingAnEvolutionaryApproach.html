        One of the first published books to talk about object oriented programming. It also heavily pitched code reuse. It discussed some practical language constructs (using <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> to demonstrate) which would help make <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> and reuse possible (at a time when neither really was).

        This book was my introduction to OOP, and served for a long time as the model in my head for how code reuse could be attained. Although some of its precepts were naive and are now somewhat dated, it was an excellent introduction and a worthy carrier of the OO banner until better treatments came along. -- <a href="StephenHumphrey.html">StephenHumphrey</a>
