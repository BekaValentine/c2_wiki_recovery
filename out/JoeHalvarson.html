        This is me. You can find me on Google by searching my name, I'm the only one out there; at least the only one on the internet. I'm here because I've been trying to learn programming for a while and came across this site as someone (unfortunately the window is closed and I can't recall the name of the programmer) gave advice to a novice program to come here, among other advice. So, I'll leave my mark here, then have a look around.
