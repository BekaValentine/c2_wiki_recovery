        <a href="ToyotaProductionSystem.html">ToyotaProductionSystem</a> (TPS) is a BusinessProcessImprovement mechanism. Also known as Lean Manufacturing, it addresses problems and opportunities that are too big for <a href="KaiZen.html">KaiZen</a>, or too tedious using <a href="SixSigma.html">SixSigma</a>.

        Although rooted in the engineering and manufacturing fields, the practices have been extended to improving work processes at the offices. <a href="TheHeartOfChange.html">TheHeartOfChange</a> of TPS is "eliminating waste"; it is also very much about <a href="LeaderShip.html">LeaderShip</a>, and <a href="CulturalChange.html">CulturalChange</a>.

        There are starting to be reports about companies going about "transplanting" TPS and running into obstacles. Time will tell whether it will fare much better than the <a href="BusinessProcessReengineering.html">BusinessProcessReengineering</a> efforts of the 1990s.

        A recent landmark write-up on TPS is a 2004 book, <a href="TheToyotaWay.html">TheToyotaWay</a>.

        <a href="TheToyotaWay.html">TheToyotaWay</a> is not always palatable for workers in the western societies.

        Just beware of "high voltage power transmission lines", then you might be OK in a modern Toyota, but then again, maybe not...  It seems such an obvious thing to me, so why isn't the system shielded or protected from outside rogue voltages?  The problem was to big for <a href="KaiZen.html">KaiZen</a>, apparently, just as with employee benefits and reasonable wages are...  Bottom line, "Get dat dolla!!!" (dollars = <a href="AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs.html">AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs</a>! (Japan & China)).
