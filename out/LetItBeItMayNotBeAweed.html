           I mispelled the word to extend the meaning of the original word "garden", which applies to what people do to keep (usually their own) garden free from weeds and pests, to that of one who stands guard to keep (usually not their own) guarded place free from weeds and pests.
        </li>

           Not satisfied with letting others share in a team effort, these responsibilities via shift of persons (and views, and the gift of human evaluation and interpretation), during a period when they may be otherwise employed,  a 24/7 task of "guardening" the target space, some have even gone so far as to construct robots to take their place. 
          <ul>

           Some new <a href="WikiPages.html">WikiPages</a> and some modifications to <a href="WikiPages.html">WikiPages</a>, may appear to be weeds or some of the insects in it may take on the appearance of pests, when they are not. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               My greatest concern when gardening is that when I use the Hoe to take out the weeds from the garden, I might mistakenly take out what is not a weed. In its infancy, any plant may be mistakenly identiried as weed.

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        As number 4 - So, it may be wise to "Let it be, Let it be, .. Let it Bee! " (another play on words)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It may not be a weed
        </li>
        <li>
           It may not be a pest
          <ul>
            <li>
               So let it grow until you know for sure
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ---
        Let it grow for a little bit. Let others who may have made it, and others who know it is ok, continue in their work of
        gardening, water it, and nuture it into its full flowering.
