        Almost Never Delete Humor
      </h1>

        I'm serious. Once a constraint to <a href="RefactorFasterDeleteMore.html">RefactorFasterDeleteMore</a>, now a guide to <a href="GoodTasteInDeletion.html">GoodTasteInDeletion</a>.

        The idea is that jokes help a lot with readability.  If we're refactoring a page we don't simply want maximum density of signal but a balance between signal and readability. <a href="ImproveSignalAndReadability.html">ImproveSignalAndReadability</a>. So the rule of thumb suggested here is: if you find a good joke, try to keep the essence of the joke in the refactored version.

        <em>And the corollary is - if you want your content to stay as is, make a good joke about it.</em>

        You cannot be serious?

        <em>That's right.</em>

        I'm not convinced. <strong>Good</strong> jokes are good content, and should be preserved. Done well, they can help people understand and remember the content. But I've observed many clever but off-topic comments that were somewhat humorous, but not a valuable contribution to the page. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        Something that I find really interesting is the effect that good humour can have on a subject or an explanation. For example, teachers (or at least good ones) will often put in a joke, or some other ridiculous comment into the explanation, at the time, the lesson will be broken up, and it may well take a while for 'order' to be restored. But as they always say afterwards: at least you'll remember it. -- <a href="MatthewTheobalds.html">MatthewTheobalds</a>

        <em>Great point Matthew. And there are many business meetings where the only way the social and decision making logjam is finally broken is through an inspired piece of humor. I have seriously argued - successfully argued even - to people that one thing that proves that Wiki is a really great idea for business is that you can tell such good jokes in it. -- </em><a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a><em></em>
