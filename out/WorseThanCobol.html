        For production purposes, I'd say the kinds of <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a>'s packaged with most 8-bit computers.  No named procedures, short variable names, few control structures, few data structures.  Of course, most people didn't do anything important with them, so I suppose they don't count either.  Also, some in-house languages used by specific corporations can be somewhat excruciating to use. -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        <em>Some of us think </em><a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> falls into this category as well, especially when you come across <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a>, but usually whenever someone tries to do something useful within the confines of its syntax.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>However...</em>' keep in mind that </strong><a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> promulgated the use of <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a> in VB when it foisted the "Microsoft Consulting Services Coding Standards for VB" upon an unsuspecting population. Even people who knew better wound up using it because their <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> said things like "It's from Microsoft. Do it that way or you're fired."<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also keep in mind that <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a> didn't start with VB.

          -bit BASICs are bliss compared to the hair-pulling agony of IBM's RPG (<a href="RpgLanguage.html">RpgLanguage</a>). RPG was just one of a number of so-called 4GLs popular on IBM mainframes and minicomputers in the 70's and 80's. Most of them had a fixed column syntax (so you can't even indent your code for readability) and had very limited flow control beyond IF and GOTO.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        IF?  You had IF?  Luxury!  RPGII had only compare-and-branch semantics.  You had lines of code that would execute conditionally upon an "indicator" being set, said indicator being a boolean flag in memory numbered 1 through 99. You could set an indicator with a "compare" instruction or as a side effect of some other instructions such as a calculation or a keyed read.  It was just barely a <a href="HighLevelLanguage.html">HighLevelLanguage</a>, with none of the actual advantages of assembler. Amazing.

        <dd><em>I had a job programming in RPG-II for 18 months.  That was all I could stand, then I fled back to graduate school.  I hated the language -- it made </em><a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a> seem high-level (and I'm talking about FORTRAN IV, 1966 vintage).  But I kind of grooved on the indicators, perhaps because they reminded me of the "statement success/statement failure" semantics of a language I really liked, namely SNOBOL4 (see <a href="SnobolLanguage.html">SnobolLanguage</a>). -- <a href="CameronSmith.html">CameronSmith</a><em></em></dd>

        Long ago I heard about a guy who wrote a full working COBOL compiler in RPG! Obviously because...yes, COBOL is that much better than RPG. He must have been a <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a>.

        Using RPG (Report Program Generator) for anything other than generating reports is a misuse of the - er - language.  (Actually I considered RPG a utility.)  Also note that it's a generator, not a compiler. -- Gary

        <em>IBM also had a version of RPG called DE/RPG which was used to write data entry programs for 5280 terminals. It was apparently even worse than RPG, if that was possible.</em>

        I think SQL has been affected by similar design mistakes. <a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, obviously it suffers from the similar </em>LetsAllProgramInEnglish syndrome, but SQL can never be as bad as COBOL for the simple reason that SQL isn't a full language, you have to e.g. embed SQL in the midst of a real language. It also doesn't suffer from self-modifying code, which is part of the COBOL standard (at least in the old days, as the usual implementation of EXECUTE PARAGRAPH A THROUGH D.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, you do not necessarily have to embed SQL in the midst of a "real" language. SQL is a real programming language (and I have used it with such purpose; I use SQLite which is suitable both ways). Now it has a WITH command which can make it Turing-complete. It is much better than COBOL.

        If we are talking about programming environments, (language + standard functions library + IDE), then the worst I have seen since late 80s was the leading commercial automated testing tool. Probably explained by the notion that "it's just a scripting language for testers", and probably this notion is alive and well because most users of this tool don't know better.
