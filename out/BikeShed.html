        The term appears to have originated in the FreeBSD community, and now stands for any topic which causes heat out of all proportion to its importance.

        A bike shed is a shed that contains bikes (obviously).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What's a "bike"?  What's a "shed"?  In what sense do you mean "contain"?  What do you call an empty "bike shed"?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What do <em>you</em> mean by "mean", "sense", and "empty"?  <em>I've no idea, but then I'm not setting out to define the terms</em> :)

        Its colour is of no importance whatsoever and therefore is guaranteed to cause enormous <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>s  whenever the subject is brought up.

        <em>Personally, I prefer to use database tables to store my bikes in.  They just map more naturally to my mental processes.  I demand seven concrete reasons why you use a shed instead of a database table.</em>

        Huh...I was hoping to find some discussion of people's bike sheds. Mine is prefab plastic and holds five bicycles, old aluminum automobile wheels, a couple old dot matrix printers, some various electronics, and stuff for my rocket club. Did I mention that I am a packrat as well as a geek?  <em>The more accurate term is 'pacratist'.</em>

        <em>Well, welcome to wiki, where sheds are made of tables, reasons are made of concrete and assuming meaningful meaning means you don't understand what I meant.</em>
