        Larry Sanger And Lessons In Collaboration
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="LarrySangerAndLessonsInCollaboration.html">LarrySangerAndLessonsInCollaboration</a> is an attempt to understand the perspective of the participants in the largest collaboration project, namely <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> (includes its predecessor as well).

        Here's the key lesson for David Liu (and many others like him) quoted from <a href="LarrySanger.html">LarrySanger</a> (emphasis are mine -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>):

        <dd>Some of [<a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>'s] earliest contributors were academics and other <strong>highly-qualified</strong> people, and it seems to me that they were slowly worn down and driven away by having to deal with difficult people on the project. I hope they will not mind that I mention their names, but the two that stick in my mind are J. Hoffman Kemp and Michael Tinkler, a couple of Ph.D. historians. <strong>They helped to set what I think was a good precedent for the project in that they wrote about their own areas of expertise, and they contributed under their own, real names. The latter has the salutary effect of making the contributor more serious and more apt to take responsibility for his or her contributions.</strong></dd>

          <ul>
            <li>
               most Nupedia editors and peer reviewers were not persuaded that the Chalkboard was necessary or useful.

        <em></em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> and wikipedia are fundamentally different, so the general approach to dealing with conflicts at <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> should not be applied here.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a late comer to the wikis and have to take the above statement as the starting point for me to understand similarities and differences. I can see <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> is focussed on producing encyclopedia and have various mechanism debated and tested, including those for ConflictResolution. However I also understand both C2 and <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> are wiki based collaboration mechanisms, with <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> being orders of magnitude bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
        So does that make experiences on <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> (e.g. dealing with <a href="WikiTrolling.html">WikiTrolling</a>, competition for <a href="EditorialControl.html">EditorialControl</a> ) completely irrelevant to C2? Are there not principles we can abstract from their (successful) processes and reimplemented here with local adjustments?
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe people like <a href="ClayShirky.html">ClayShirky</a> has already done comparative analysis, and commented on issues and opportunities? Or done so here at C2 (or <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a>)? If so, I appreciate references.
