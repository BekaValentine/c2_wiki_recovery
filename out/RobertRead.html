        Hi, I'm interested in using something like <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> for project idea I'm working on.

        <strong>07 February 2001:</strong> Wow, I just noticed that the first time I created this was June 10, 1999.  Now I wonder how long it will before the next update?

        <strong>02 February 2003:</strong> Actually, I'm Robert M. Read, and not associated with hire.com.  I seem to have a habit of visiting this page every 2 years or so.

        Robert L. Read works at hire.com?

        June 2005: Actually I'M Robert M. Read, and not associated with hire.com or this webpage. My M stands for Mclean. This is my first time visiting this page, and hence, it's not yet a habit for me.

        <em>This is confusing - if the previous sentence was your first visit, why make it so similar to the sentence dated 02 February 2003?</em>

        <strong>09 January 2006:</strong> The original Robert M. Read (the one that created this page way back when) this time, and it appears I'm about a year late. I honestly don't remember what project I was working on in 1999, but I've since used wiki's with several other projects. And so have we all, I suppose.
