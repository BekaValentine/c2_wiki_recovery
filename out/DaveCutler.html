        Prime Architect of both Digital VAX/VMS (see <a href="VmsOperatingSystem.html">VmsOperatingSystem</a>) and Mica, which was later bought by Microsoft and further developed to become <a href="MicrosoftWindowsNt.html">MicrosoftWindowsNt</a>.

        <em>A respected Operating System designer.</em>  The Digital folks didn't seem to have much respect for him when I worked there in 1996-1997.  And it was not just about his jumping ship: there were criticisms of his management style and technical achievements. --<a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>

        And in case that isn't enough don't forget the <a href="DaveCutler.html">DaveCutler</a> fan club, which was online at <a href="http://home.wt.net/shannonh/">http://home.wt.net/shannonh/</a> and is still retrievable via
        <a href="WaybackMachine.html">WaybackMachine</a> at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010907185753/http://home.wt.net/shannonh/">http://web.archive.org/web/20010907185753/http://home.wt.net/shannonh/</a>

        And I spent 6 happy wonderful years at <a href="DigitalEquipmentCorporation.html">DigitalEquipmentCorporation</a> in the eighties (not the MBA influenced 95-96 version when most of the talent had left) and I can say with most certainty that most of our engineers regarded him as a God. VMS had things 20 years ago that most operating systems still haven't achieved. Abrasive, yes, but most geniuses are. Rashid (the <a href="MachMicrokernel.html">MachMicrokernel</a> guy) respects him as do most heavy OS designers. That's good enough for me.
