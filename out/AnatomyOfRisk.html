        Anatomy Of Risk
      </h1>
      <p>
        A risk is a possible problem that has yet to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a risk we have identified becomes a problem, we say "the risk has <em>materialised</em>." The cost of dealing with the problem is called the <em>impact</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each risk has two variables: probability, and impact. The combination of probability and impact is known as <a href="RiskExposure.html">RiskExposure</a>:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="RiskExposure.html">RiskExposure</a> = probability * impact<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Both probability and impact vary over time. Therefore our exposure to risk is usually not a constant. Each risk has a lifespan which begins when the exposure becomes more than 0 and ends when it drops back down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most risks are not atomic, but aggregates of many risks. A common example of an AggregateRisk is the facetious case of a meteor strike on your office. Although managing the risk of a meteor strike itself is foolish, it contains many component risks which we should manage. For example, a meteor strike would almost certainly cause a destruction of all the data held at an office. But a meteor strike is not the only risk that could cause this. There are many others with a much higher probability: a simple computer virus, theft, an office fire, and so on. Managing the risk of data loss, such as using an off-site backup, automatically accounts for this portion in all its aggregates; even a meteor strike.
