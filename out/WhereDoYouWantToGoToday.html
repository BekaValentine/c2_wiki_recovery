        Tagline of a <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> advertising campaign in the mid-1990s.  The implication was that no matter what your answer, Microsoft software would help you get there.

        <strong>Humorous answers</strong>

        <em>"To a gun store!"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time this advertising campaign was popular, our canonical answer was, "To Redmond, with a flamethrower."

        <em>To Linux</em>

        Where do you want to go today? ... <em>It doesn't matter, you're coming with us!</em>

        Note the clever embedding of "<a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a>" in this message, and the demonic inferences that follow.

        A software package that spoofed <a href="WindowsNinetyEight.html">WindowsNinetyEight</a> (the name of the package I can't remember) had the following variation:  "Where do you want to go, toady?"--<a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the term used by the now defunct microsnot.com, though it may have also been used by others.

        "Your potential. Our passion." was the new tagline in use by <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> as of early 2005 - an attempt at integrating (physically?) the user with the software.

        <em>Presumably "You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile." didn't go over well in focus groups.</em>

        Man, those ads are gagworthy. Maybe they play ok in the US, but not down here. Just that opening line: "We see you. We see your potential." raises my hackles - what, they have me under surveilance now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They're also saying you haven't reached your full potential yet, which is another way of calling you an underachiever. :P</em>

        I remember one magazine add (<a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a>, perhaps?) that said something along the lines of "Where do <em>I</em> want to go today?  <em>Home</em>.  Before <em>midnight</em>.  And I'd like my word processor to pitch in, too."
