        One Out Of Five Tech Fads Stick
      </h1>
      <p>
        In my observation, roughly one out of every five software engineering fads/trends "sticks", meaning that 4 out of 5 times the fad/trend fades into oblivion or into narrow niches. Do others agree on this? Sure, there are a lot of grey areas; this is just a general rule of thumb, kind of the <a href="MooresLaw.html">MooresLaw</a> version of tech fads. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that "sticking" does not necessarily imply that it takes over, but may merely become one tool or technique among many. The "takes over" rate is more like one in thirty, by my thumb.

        Perhaps it should read "kind of an <a href="EightyTwentyRule.html">EightyTwentyRule</a> of tech fads."?
      </p>
      <p>
        And the distinction between "sticking" and "takes over" seems like another round of the <a href="EightyTwentyRule.html">EightyTwentyRule</a>.
