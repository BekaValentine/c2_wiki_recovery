        <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> has other ways of saying <strong>car</strong> and <strong>cdr</strong> that, according
        to taste, either wreck that joke or clarify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        [<em>For example:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        (eq today (first (rest your-life))) <br/>

      <p>
        You can still say <strong>car</strong> and <strong>cdr</strong>, though... I think, by the way, that
        I prefer
      </p>
      <code>
        (eq today (car (cdr (life you))))<br/>

        <strong>Q:</strong> How many Lisp programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?

        <strong>A:</strong> A whole CAR full.

        When my first wife left me, she took everything. The kids, the house, the car. She didn't even leave me the cdr!

        One day a student came to Moon and said: "I understand how to make a
        better garbage collector. We must keep a reference count of the
        pointers to each <em>cons</em>."
      </p>
      <p>
        Moon patiently told the student the following story:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"One day a student came to Moon and said: `I understand how to make a better garbage collector ...'"</dd>
      </dl>
