        Pavlov Strategy
      </h1>
      <p>
        f your opponent cooperated with you on the last round, repeat your last move; otherwise, switch. PAVLOV's biggest advantage was that, like TFT, it assumed cooperation. However, if cooperation failed, like TFT, it would automatically punish its opponent. But then, unlike TFT, once both sides were defecting, it would try to switch again to cooperation. If both players were PAVLOV, this behaviour acted like error correction, and both players would resume cooperation. TFT on the other hand, when playing against TFT, would slip into mutual defection.
