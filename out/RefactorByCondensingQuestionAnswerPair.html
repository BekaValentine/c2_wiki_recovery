        Refactor By Condensing Question Answer Pair
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Often you will see a question and answer pair posted in the "thread" of a Page</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One could easily refactor by combining the question and answer into a single statement or a single <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>, followed by one or more statements in the new <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>. After this is done, it might be a good idea to move the statement closer to the top of the page, perhaps adding it to the initial description or immediately following it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Score extra points for integrating the answer into other text on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can also be used when writing the original answer, preventing the thread from getting <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>ed and needing refactoring in the first place.  Instead of responding to the question, delete it and replace it with the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person refactoring may wish to retain the signature of the answer (and possibly the question) by adding "contributor(s): " at the end (<a href="RefactorWhileRespectingSignatures.html">RefactorWhileRespectingSignatures</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        If the person refactoring wishes to ensure that the contributors review the changes, they may try to catch their attention by adding a note and a link on each contributor's page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This refactoring comes in two major forms: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Question + Answer => Explanation
        </li>
        <li>
           Statement + Question + Answer => Statement with explanation
        </li>
      </ul>

        You could just turn off the syntax awareness feature. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Use ':syntax off'.
