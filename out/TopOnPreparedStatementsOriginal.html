        Re: "and aren't hackable like [direct strings]"
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you mean absolutely not hackable, or just less hackable? Wouldn't this depend on the RDBMS implementation? Buffer overflow attacks have been found in graphics and HTML. I agree though that the concept appears safer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's not hackable for what it does make data be just data. If you bring Implementation flaws into this, no code is absolutely non-hackable. And if to bring implementation is desirable, then I suggest that home made "sqlString" function will be even less stable and secure than implementation provided inside DB engine when you use PS. They have thousands of clients using them every day, correct?</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I wonder if PS's don't make building API's a bit more difficult. For example, from app developer's standpoint it is often nice to have a clause-building operation that looks something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        myClauses.addAndClause(theVariable, theType, theComparison theValue);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // example with values<br/>
        myClauses.addAndClause("salary", const_float, "<", 60000);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The direct string implementation of such can simply create the variable and the value at the same time, but using the question mark approach requires some trickier accounting to match the positions with the values.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Prepared statements don't make API's more difficult; ignorance does. If you'd quit thinking of the sql statement as a string, you'd realize when you add a predicate to it, you could store them in memory as a tree, and only collapse it to a string when it get's executed. You'd then have no problem knowing what order to set the params in, and you'd be able to handle "any" predicate expression, of any nesting or grouped combinations easily. Strings suck as structures, use something else when building expressions, and collapse it into a string on execution.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That *does* sound like a more difficult implementation of API. I am certainly not saying it is impossible, but far more involved than the string approach. The string approach just does some basic checking, quote escaping, and then appends. If the clause is anything beyond linear, then it could get messy to reposition properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't understand the problem. You can build prepared statements from strings if you like. Matching the variables with their values is trivial. Use an array, a list, whatever you like.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes multiple clauses are created rather independently such as a WHERE clause and a HAVING clause. But it appears with PS's the separate lists have to be merged in the right order in the end. Order-sensitive merging is not something string-based appending had to worry about. Now we almost need a RDBMS just to process and create a properly-ordered parameter list. Perhaps if PS's had a named-parameter option those kinds of things would go smoother.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Prepared statements are vendor-specific, but at least some have named parameters, I use them all the time. Instead of "?", just put "%name".
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Prepared statement aren't vendor specific. They're part of the SQL'92 ANSI standard.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Perhaps the person meant that the name-based extension is vendor-specific. Note that being part of the SQL standard does not necessarily mean vendors implement it fully. There are a lot of things in the standard that vendors ignore.

      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>You don't need an RDBMS to process and create a properly ordered list. All you need is a list. If your SQL statements are so complex that the parameter list confuses you (the author) then you should consider simplifying them for future maintenance with views or stored procedures.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not necessarily a matter of confusion, but of making a generic list/tree merger thingy that does not have to keep being tweaked and retested when we find SQL it does not handle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You don't need a "generic list/tree merger thingy". Give each clause a list of parameters. As you append clauses, append their parameter lists. You already have the code to concatenate clauses. Concatenating lists is just as easy as concatenating strings.</em>

        Perhaps PS are best for public projects and critical applications, and string wrappers for department-specific intranets that need RAD, small budgets, but lots of complex queries. Complex queries are generally more common in department-specific apps anyhow, because techniques such as <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> can be too resource-intensive to allow a wide user-base.

      <p>
        <em>"This is a fact, a rule, a law - use prepared statements EVERYWHERE. Use STATEMENTS almost nowhere." -- </em><a href="ThomasKyte.html">ThomasKyte</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps a <strong>compromise</strong>: use PS for writable tables and strings for read-only. Thus, those portions of the app that use string wrappers login under as a read-only DB user. Almost all complex queries for production are read-only anyhow in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not in mine.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how hacked the string is, it wouldn't be able to change or delete data because it does not have write permissions. If some of the readable data is sensitive, then perhaps 3 or more logins can be created. However, this gets burdensome for the DBA also. The approach depends on the nature of the app and cost-vs-risk assessments.

        <em>You're making a mountain out of a molehill. If you have the code to put clauses together then you can use the same code to put parameter lists together.

           Nonsense. Again you argue from ignorance and to cover for your ignorance. Prepared statements should be used everywhere a query has input values. It's as simple as that. There's no need to 'compromise" between knowledge and ignorance. PS can handle queries as complex as you want just fine.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Un-nonsense - It is pretty clear that the API's for dynamic clause creation are more complicated for PS, and we don't yet know the upper limit of complexity of SQL that they handle.

           Are you listening to the answers? Because people are quite willing to help you out, but not if you're going to insist that your solution is correct in the face of overwhelming evidence. Anyway, absolutely anything you can do with complex dynamic queries can be done with prepared statements. The prepared statement is just an SQL string like any other, it can contain multiple predicates and subqueries, and you can construct it in similar ways. With some APIs (eg. PEAR DB), you can put unescaped strings into the prepared statement exactly like any other placeholder; with others, you can build the prepared statement dynamically and then fill in values. The primary benefit is security: prepared statements ensure that data values are interpreted as data, and code values are interpreted as code. You don't <em>have</em> to do it this way - you could hardcode unvalidated data into the prepared statement SQL - but I don't see why you'd <em>want</em> your system to be taken down by an SqlInjectionAttack. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

        <li>
           Oh, I see your concern. Yes, the positionality of prepared statement arguments can be a problem when dynamically building complex queries. It's not insurmountable, however: you can just push arguments onto the array as you build the appropriate SQL. If you construct phrases out of order, you can maintain independent arrays and then splice them together using eg. PHP's array_merge. Heck, for really complex stuff, the simplest approach may be to create an SqlClause object that functions like a closure in Scheme (i.e. SQL code + parameter array). Whether or not this is simpler than simply escaping strings and building them into the SQL depends on the application, but I can tell you that I'm planning to retrofit the database app I'm currently working on with prepared statements in the manner above. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

      <p>
        Do you mean named-based insertion? The string-based approach would seem more vendor-neutral if that is the case: you could switch vendors with less worries about PS features. People don't switch DB vendors that often so it is not a big factor, but still something to weigh.

      <p>
        [They do not, it's true, but although experience can vary, mine is that it's frequent for clients/management to request as much vendor independence as possible, just in case - although of course performance tends to conflict eventually, if not at first.]

      </p>
      <p>
        Wait a second here. If it is not the DB vendor but the libraries, that would imply that the libraries are actually sending strings to the DB as their final product anyhow. Thus, the libraries may be doing no more than the sqlNum and sqlString-like functions are. I don't really see the difference then from a security standpoint. With that factor removed, the direct function approach would then seem better for complex queries IMO because we don't have to do accounting for positional ordering issues. (I suppose it is possible that the libraries send direct values if the RDBMS supports them, and strings if it does not.) -- top

      <p>
        We don't know if and what vendors actually use the standard. They may be sending strings. Besides, if it is "syntax", it seems the standard is all string-based communication anyhow. Is there anything in the standard that defines machine code or byte-level? If not, we may be back to square one.

        If it is a matter of my string validation libraries versus a commercial library writer's string validation libraries (see above), then would it change your mind about my suggested solution IF there were commercial versions of my functions? -- top

      <p>
        [It's not necessarily a commercial library vendor. If you had a widely-deployed, well-designed library, I wouldn't care who you were or if it was commercial. In fact, I generally consider such support to be part of the minimum requirements for a database abstraction layer. But you don't have such a thing and a library of SQL quoting functions provides too little functionality compared to the safety (and convenience) of prepared statements.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that is not how I interpreted the original claim. I interpreted the claim as the values being directly sent thru some conduit such that values are always treated as values, never as part of a larger command string with embedded/quoted values. (I am at a loss for a better way to describe this. Any suggestions?) I suppose one could compare it to star athletes entering the arena through special gates instead of having to go through main door with fans. Instead, it appears Prepared Statement libraries sometimes, perhaps always, convert stuff to SQL command strings anyhow. Thus, one could potentially hack those commands also (by making data that escapes to commands when interpreted). It turns out the athletes have to come thru the same gate as the fans anyhow. <strong>The difference is the alleged quality of the value inspection libraries, not prepared statement technology</strong> itself. That is the key. In our arena analogy, the difference is really the skill of the security guards, not the existence of a special gate.

           Top, please keep in mind that multiple people contributed here. I read the above, and didn't draw anything like the same conclusion that you just did, although one person may have implied it. Prepared statements are described by the standard at a logical level, as most standard do. The implementation details can vary. I didn't know the term "prepared statement" until recently, but even the lowly MS Jet DBMS, which I am familiar with, has something similar called parameterized queries. Even in the case of this low-end DBMS, it's not just a matter of the DBMS pasting strings together for you. Parameterized queries are pre-parsed and pre-optimized, saving processing time. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>

           <em>It was the security issue that I was most interested in. I did not make an issue here about performance claims. But you bring up a good idea for dividing up the pros/cons categories if/when we ever clean this topic. -- top</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The security issue is implicitly addressed by what Jet does. If the SQL has been pre-parsed, then it won't be re-parsed. Parameter values supplied at invocation are in no danger of changing the interpretation of a query's structure; they're distinctly seen as scalar values. (If you think about how this might be implemented, you'll see that it relates directly to some discussions on DynamicStringsVersusFunctional, regarding the consequences of using strings or more structured data types for representing code.) I suspect that most vendors have an implementation of prepared statements that follows this model; it seems the sort of thing that the concept was intended for. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>

           If you think like a functional programmer, you can view your SQL as being compiled to a function which you can then call at any time with parameters of your choosing.

        </li>
        <li>
           First off, it's not necessarily true, as you can create and generate quite complex dynamic queries with prepared statement. Secondly, the queries where there are the most opportunity for reuse are the ones which will also benefit the most from the performance gains. Thirdly, the fact that there may be corner cases where a prepared statement isn't usable in no way detracts from the power and usefulness of them in general. It's the 80/20 rule you love so much, except there's *no penalty* for the cases that don't match.

I have faced some hairy dynamic SQL, partly because of poor schema designs we are stuck with, and partly because my skills in this area tend to get me "volunteered" for the dynamic SQL portions of projects. I already agreed with PS's for the simpler statements. You have my word it is a legit concern. -- top

        <li>
           <em>Okay then. I'll </em><a href="AssumeGoodFaith.html">AssumeGoodFaith</a>. The vast majority of queries are *not* these hairy beasts, or even when they appear to be they can be refactored to simpler ones, if you work from the assumption that prepared statements are valuable. You didn't know about them a week ago, now you do, so do yourself a favor and experiment a bit. There will be a slight curve as you overcome your habit of composing strings in favor of using parameters (I had the same experience). In the rare cases of truly hairy queries that cannot be reduced any further, and cannot be translated to prepared statements, you are no worse off. Nobody would disagree here. It's not just "simpler" statements here - it's all but the most extremely complicated. *Prepared statements are objectively better than string munging, as has been repeatedly shown on this very page, and you should make every attempt to use them*. I'd also recommend that even though it gives you a chance to prove your worth and your cleverness that you go to great lengths to avoid these hairy query monsters, through views and stored procedures if necessary. A programmer who can reduce complexity is many times for valuable than one who can merely work with complexity.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Again, I agree they are fine for simpler stuff. That is not the issue of the debates. And, I do challenge your "objectively better" claim from a security standpoint. I already described why views and stored procedures are sometimes not a viable option. In many places getting those requires red tape. A better solution for complexity reduction may be to replace SQL with a better query language, but that won't happen any time soon. In general you seem to be contradicting yourself (or someone with similar claims). If one has to <strong>alter the way they write queries</strong>, then this implies that my suggestion is indeed more flexible. I don't have to bend to PS's flavor. My approach is then the superset: I can do it my original way AND your way, but PS's cannot do it my way (without a lot of fiddling). I don't want to sound smug, but you are indirectly agreeing with me. -- top

           <em>No, I am not agreeing with you. Your way is *objectively worse*. Sometimes you may be forced to use it as a fallback. Of course you have to change the way you write queries - you don't use prepared statements now. Using them is a change. Any change requires overcoming mental inertia. You are claiming that because your preferred approach may be required in extenuating circumstances, it should be used in all cases, including the ones where it's inferior. That's like claiming that we should write all our programs in C because a toaster doesn't have a Java runtime. A fallback approach is exactly that - it's a less preferred approach that may sometimes be required. Like writing code in C. Or assembly. Or, for you, not using a database. You're too caught up in defending yourself to take a step back and realize that what you're defending is actually the worse position.

        Let's look at a simple example in PHP using PostgreSQL.  Assume we want to select all customers from a customers table with a specified name, which has been obtained from the user and stored in a variable $userInput.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we don't use prepared statements, the simplest case could be this:
      </p>
      <code>
        <?php<br/>
        // Connect to a database named "mydb"<br/>
        $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mydb");<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Create a query for execution<br/>
        $qry = "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = '" + $userInput + "'";<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Execute the query.<br/>
        $result = pg_execute($dbconn, $qry);<br/>
        ?><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If $userInput is, say, "'; delete from customers; --", we're potentially going to be in trouble.  This simplistic example invites SQL injection.  Of course, we should sanitise user inputs, but this requires discipline and assurance that the sanitisation has been successful.  That adds complexity and risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using prepared statements, the above would be:
      </p>
      <code>
        <?php<br/>
        // Connect to a database named "mydb"<br/>
        $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mydb");<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Prepare a query for execution<br/>
        $result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "myquery", 'SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = $1');<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Execute the prepared query.<br/>
        $result = pg_execute($dbconn, "myquery", array($userInput));<br/>
        ?><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The pg_prepare function sends the query string to the DBMS for compilation, and identifies the parametric query with the name "myquery".  It is now prepared, i.e., compiled, for execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pg_execute function invokes "myquery", passing only the data for the parameter identified by '$1'.  It does <strong>not</strong> construct a new query string from "myquery" + $1 for parsing, planning and execution.  It merely passes the argument to 'myquery' -- which has already been parsed and planned (compiled) via pg_prepare -- in the same manner as passing a argument to a pre-existing stored procedure.  If "userInput" consists of "'; delete from customers; --", all it will do is harmlessly try to select a customer whose name is "'; delete from customers; --".

        You aren't reading what I'm writing. Create an object that contains one string and a list of its parameters. You can concatenate those objects as easily as you concatenate strings. The parameters will be in the same order as the strings. This is obviously as simple as appending.

        You act like it's difficult. If it isn't, why are you saying all of this about "rigmarole" and "Splice-A-Tron" and asking a project manager? It doesn't violate <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. Each of your string concatenations is replaced with a single object concatenation. You can't change the order of the strings without also changing the order of the parameters because the same concatenation applies to both of them. I have no idea what you mean about "directly automated". You can use this approach to build any SQL, no matter how many parameters it has.

           Prepared Statements implementations can be expected to prevent string <em>values</em> from being misinterpreted as other syntactic query elements, thus improving security by preventing hacks based on user input, as compared to typical programmatic composition of string values.

           One should not rely on Prepared Statement drivers and/or RDBMS to always support hard separation of commands and data. It is a bonus if they do.

               Agree:
            </li>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        I probably should clarify what I mean by <strong>hard separation</strong> of commands and data. Hard separation is when there is some conduit to send data such that it can never be interpreted as a command. The distinction between command and data would be based on context rather than content. For example, if the client issues a command that says, "The next two bytes I am sending is integer data and only integer data". The server then knows what to do with the two bytes. However, if there is any way to "escape" the value such that it can be interpreted as a command, then we no longer have hard separation. Example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Client: "I am now going to send you a data string to be put in slot X"
        </li>
        <li>
           Server: "Go ahead, I am ready"
        </li>
        <li>
           Client: "This is a string"
        </li>
        <li>
           Server: "I got the string and put it in slot X"
        </li>
        <li>
           Client: "I am now going to send you a data string to be put in slot Z"
        </li>
        <li>
           Server: "Go ahead, I am ready"
        </li>
        <li>
           Client: "This is another str/^delete all;"
        </li>
        <li>
           Server: "I got a special /^ sequence which I assume means a command follows, which I carried out. 4227 records deleted."
        </li>
        <li>
           Client: "No you stupid server. A hacker snuck that into my list. You deleted my life's work. Waaaaah!"
        </li>
        <li>
           Server: "Do not understand command 'stupid'. Please try again."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is not hard separation because there are ways to "escape out" of any string. In hard separation <strong>every possible bit combination</strong> of the input could be only interpreted as data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that just because one cannot currently envision how to escape out, does not mean that it is not possible. Hackers, have a tendency to try tricks we have not thought of. -- <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In other words, if the programmers working on the database server and client driver are less competent than </em><a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> is when he writes those sqlEscapeXXX() functions (that <strong>nobody has seen yet, anyways</strong>), then it's possible that poor unsuspecting programmers are at risk when using prepared statements. And <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> does not really know but he suggests the possibility that other folks are not quite as competent as he is. Nor does <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> try to find out whether that's really the case because from a position of ignorance he can always throw more crap into this irrelevant discussion.<em></em>
      </p>

        (Trolling ain't helping. Top asked a coherent question, even if I agree that he's stretching.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're using APIs that accept data as data, not as query source, then you <em>should</em> be able to trust them. Whether you <em>do</em> trust them or not depends on how much you trust the vendor/implementor. There is not much you can do to further sanitize the data, unless you can identify a class of data that you know is patently wrong (for instance escape characters in strings). Rejecting anything that "looks like" a query fragment may or may not work for you, depending on whether it could be legitimate data for your database - so we're talking about here about additional checking that may have to be customized for your application.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the API implementation includes escape sequence like your example above, this would erode my confidence in the implementation. Certainly, if you know of such things but still have to use that implementation, it would make sense to check for them. However, if no such are documented, then I would trust that they don't exist. In that sense, I <em>disagree</em> with your statement.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Note that it is not just explicit escape sequences, but perhaps odd use of quotes and other gimmicks. For example, if PS's send a command such as "PREPARED PARAMETER FOO HAS VALUE OF 'Zork';", It may be possible to use a combination of quotes or quote escapers in the value to "break out" of that command. <em>See comment below about broadening the scope of discussion. This is an argument against using </em>any<em> third party software, not against prepared statements. Do you really trust the string manipulation functions of your language's run-time library?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Basic sanity tests, like checking for excessively long strings, are always a good idea. In that sense, I <em>agree' with your statement - although that isn't exactly what you were stating. (Long strings are used by hackers to corrupt the stack and seize control, which really has nothing to do with scalar data versus query code.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need query composition capabilities that the API doesn't support (for instance, queries that vary in ways that can't be handled with a prepared statement), then of course you'll have to deal with these issues. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is there any indication whatsoever to believe that major vendors have such flaws in the protocol? If there's no such indication, what would be the purpose of bringing it into discussion? The sqlEscapeXXX() is </em>'not<em>' how most client drivers bind values to prepared statements, but is Top's proposal for binding values (that he himself didn't follow-- but whatever), and we haven't seen such a fine collection of Top's code at work yet.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Now how about you present us with some "compositional capabilities"(sic!) or puzzle queries that one "can't be handled with prepared statements", rather than handwave together with top about them?

So unless you're talking about a brain dead driver for a brain dead database (</em>'in which case you'd have to be specific<em>'), you're both worrying in abstract about problems that are a figment of your imagination. Aka arguing just for the sake of arguing, aka trolling. -- Costin</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Is there any indication ... [of] such flaws in the protocol?"</em> No, of course not. What I wrote: "If the API implementation includes escape sequence[s] like your example above, this would erode my confidence in the implementation." Let me say it in stronger language for you, since you prefer strong language. If a vendor's implementation deliberately included such things, I would consider it a bug, and <em>I</em> would not use such an implementation willingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        However. <em>All</em> APIs have the potential for bugs, so raising this question is not as <em>entirely</em> ridiculous as you make out. What <em>is</em> silly about it is simply that it has nothing to do with prepared statements per se.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, as to the limitations of prepared statements. I'm quite willing to be further enlightened here. But from what I've seen so far, and experienced with Jet's querydefs (which unfortunately may fall in the "brain dead" category you mention), you can only parameterize on scalar values. I <em>have</em> had occasions when I've wanted to parameterize on <em>table names</em> or <em>view names</em>. No figment of my imagination, this has occurred. (Ideally, what I'd actually like here is to substitute an arbitrary <em>relation value</em> as opposed to a scalar value.) This has only come up a very few times for me, and it was sometimes an indicator of lousy schema, but it did occur (and we don't always get to choose everything about the schema we work with). Obviously, there are ways to work around it - among them, composing the query from strings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, it's easy to think of situations where you might want to replace an entire <em>scalar expression</em>. You certainly have enough imagination to recognize that this can be helpful - it's the entire raison d'etre of higher-order function support in general programming languages, isn't it? -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Obviously, when table/view/stored procedure names are selected at runtime, they cannot be bound to parameters for many technical reasons. Prepared statement take input parameters for </em>'values<strong>, not any other part of SQL (like we can decide at runtime whether the query is an UPDATE or INSERT, but this is not the subject of prepared statements and bound parameters). But then you wouldn't let the user to supply the name of the table, would you? There will be a fixed number of valid choices and those will be used to compose the query string, but </strong>still<strong> you'll use a </strong>prepared statement<strong> to prepare it, bind the values and execute it. So while your case might be interesting, it has no relevance for the current discussion, and you'd still be using prepared statements. You will be composing (or choosing from a handful of alternatives) strings for a </strong><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>. <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, I do not have enough imagination, just wow me. Why would I not use a prepared statement whether or not I need to replace an entire subquery is well beyond me. -- Costin</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes it would be useful to substitute relation values as readily as scalar values. (Parameterizing on table names, or working through a dedicated temporary table, being a poor substitute for this.) <em>"... but this is not the subject of prepared statements and bound parameters."</em> But of course, that was exactly my point -- there <em>are</em> limits to what you can parameterize with prepared statements.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That there are limits to what you can parameterize with prepared statements is not a valid argument that you should not use prepared statements nevertheless. It's as simple as that.
        </li>
        <li>
           OK, point taken. The discussion below clarified this also. My focus was on what you could parameterize, however.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Maybe I'm missing something, but if you have to compose a query from strings to work around such limitations, and then you execute the query only once, is there a difference in simply executing it versus first "preparing" it? Wouldn't treating it as a prepared statement actually add <em>additional</em> overhead, at least in some implementations? -- DanM
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, the difference you're talking about is as good as nonexistent for one query, and if you run the query several times the difference will be reversed as the DBMS will be using cached execution plans (which it doesn't do for regular statements because of many reasons). To quote TOM, from the reference above, the rule is: "use prepared statements </em>'always<em>'" (yes, you can even use PS to send a sequence of statements. There's only one real exception for this: if your statement is a DDL or contains a DDL in a sequence of statements (like create/drop/alter table, etc) then trying to prepare it will throw an exception. -- Costin</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for the confirmation. In fact, the software I've worked with pretty much follows this rule (insofar as Jet's 'querydefs' are essentially prepared statements), with one exception that I can think of. That's in our schema update module, where hundreds of one-shot queries get run. (I work on shrink-wrap software that has to update users' database automatically in the field.) -- DanM
      </p>
      <p>
        Look, what's so damn hard to understand... prepared statements "are" strings, you can build them just like you build any dynamic statement, the only difference is that you separate the user supplied data from the sql statement, and bind them to parameters, it's safe, simple, and completely ignorant not to do "every time". There is no case where prepared statements are less functional that regular statements for standard application queries, you build the the same way, it's the same string, just without user data. The database can then cache the prepared statement, without data, if you wish, but if it's a one time dynamic statement, then it's not necessary. User data is then parameterized, some db's, SQLServer for example, allows named parameters to the statement, making the order of appending the params irrelevant. "SELECT * FROM USER WHERE ID = @UserID AND NAME = @Name", so it doesn't matter how you stick values in. Uppis Yoursis, aka Top is an idiot, and needs to be treated as such, assume good faith was disproven for him a long time ago. Costin, love the effort you're making to label his idiocy, keep up the good work, he's ruining this wiki! I'd also suggest we quit allowing him to hide behind that idiotic name topmind, which he obviously isn't, maybe slapping his real name over his spam will discourage him a bit.

        Very simple Query building api using Prepared Statement.
      </p>
      <code>
        class Query{<br/>
        ..sql = ""      # sql string<br/>
        ..values = {}    # hashmap string->value<br/>
        ..def toStatement()<br/>
        ....st = new <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>(sql);<br/>
        ....values.each do | key, value |<br/>
        ......st.bind(key,value)   #bind named parameter KEY to VALUE.<br/>
        ....end<br/>
        ....return st       #return the prepared statement.<br/>
        ..end<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        To add a clause, you simply do
      </p>
      <code>
        ..query.sql += added_clause  #append the query clause with named parameter.<br/>
        ..query.values[name] = value #add the binding<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        As simple as that. The name can be auto-generated to guarantee uniqueness (heard of Math.random?). The above I assume you will only add clause at the end of statement. But it also add complexity to hand String building approach if you want to add clause to middle of statement also. I don't see why using PS would make Query building API harder to use.

It isn't rocket science.<em></em>

I agree that it may make pre-compilation of some SQL statements more difficult, but such is not the bottleneck for the more complex queries in which NSB approachs would be more effective anyhow. Real SQL tends to use IF statements to make certain clauses optional anyhow, such as <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a>. That is the advantage of dynamic techniques. Cater to the humans, not the damned compiler. It should be my slave. --top

        See example at the very top. These validate values and escape any quotes. They are self-standing little functions. (However, I am not sure quote escaping is standardized across vendors, so mixed vendor querying needs to be done with care.)

        How does one submit a variable-lengthed IN statement list using prepared statements? Example clause:

      </code>

        <em>With a variable number of variables.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do the commas get in? If the kit does not add them, then they must be dynamically generated as part of the SQL, bringing us back to the original problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, we aren't back to any of the original problems. The variables can only contain values, not entire statements or procedures. They have to match with the values provided. Try it and see.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, but we won't know ahead of time how many commas will be needed. Thus, either the PS kit generates the commas, or the app developer has to dynamically add it to the SQL. I don't see any third option.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You only need one option. The software adds a variable number of variables to the prepared statement. That doesn't bring us back to the original problem. Try it and see.</em>

      <p>
        Before I do, I want one question answered, if you don't mind: what or who adds the variable number of commas? Remember, there may be one or dozens of IN clause items and we don't know how much before the program runs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The software adds them. Didn't I just say that? Why would our lack of knowledge of the number of variables "before the program runs" matter?

        By "the software", I assume you mean the Prepared Statement API's. This would imply that the PS-API's need to interpret the SQL in order to know where to insert commas. I am not doubting you that it works, I am just trying to figure out the internal mechanisms and limits of PSs.

        <em>Prepared statements have far, far fewer security flaws than raw SQL string construction.  This is an accepted fact.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Raw" is not what I proposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you're not using LINQ or prepared statements, you are sending raw SQL strings.</em>

        How are you measuring "rawness"?

      <p>
        <em>Whatever string is constructed is precisely what the DBMS will attempt to execute.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        LINQ ultimately sends strings to the DB (at least non-MS DB's). Whether malicious data gets cleaned up or not depends on the power of detection algorithms. It's a <strong>very similar problem what anti-virus software has to address</strong>: "What byte patterns are malicious/suspicious?"
      </p>
      <p>
        [No, that's not how LINQ works. It uses prepared statements to separate values from the query string. It doesn't need to detect malicious data, because there's no way malicious data can be misinterpreted as part of the query commands. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        That's what my opening example did also.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Your opening example didn't use prepared statements. It sent a raw SQL string to the database. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is malicious data, then when it gets put back together at the DB, injection can occur. Data and commands are only <em>temporarily</em> separated.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Data and commands <em>remain</em> separated when using prepared statements, because the database recognises prepared statements directly; it doesn't just concatenate the values back into the query string, as though you'd done it in code. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Which it receives as one big command string, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        [No.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Hold on a sec. We were talking about LINQ, not PS. Somehow we got switched. LINQ does not necessarily translate to PS (it may be vendor/driver dependent).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>LINQ translates into prepared statements.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn't confirm this, at least in a general sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Even if LINQ did translate into ad-hoc SQL, LINQ is parsed and syntactically and semantically validated by the compiler, rather than being a run-time assemblage of arbitrary strings.  The former is very different from the latter, which is nothing more than sending a raw SQL string -- possibly with SQL injection, of course -- to the DBMS.  With LINQ, SQL injection is no more possible than it is with prepared statements.</em>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Now, I agree that if this is turned into a PS, then the value at spot 77 may get processed ONLY as a value internally at the DB such that the escape injection probably won't take place because it knows to process that value only as a value in isolation because that's what it's expecting at the moment it traverses that spot in the element/token tree. (There are still potential ways to cause other problems that I won't go into here.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But in LINQ's usual case, it would simply put the statement back together for the DB pretty much <strong>like the original</strong>, with the same breach in place. Parsing won't catch it, at least not any better than the "value check" approach shown at the intro (using sqlString(...) function). It's not an improvement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The only claim to improvement I see is that with LINQ you can't forget to check values, whereas the approach I showed requires the programmer to remember to explicitly wrap the values with the verification functions. But we could get the same kind of thing if the checker/parser was at the ODBC driver level. It's not necessarily specific to LINQ. (The parser would have to know the syntax for different vendors, but so would the LINQ drivers, unless they pre-limit the kinds of statements allowed, which can be limiting either way.)

        I don't know any value string that would get by the parser but mess up the DB. I'm not a professional hacker. The parsers probably already check the values for the low-hanging-fruit of injection attacks. E.I. known attacks are already taken care of by the value inspector algorithms (which an "sqlString" function could in theory likewise have access to).
      </p>
      <p>
        [Even ignoring that LINQ, unlike arbitrary string concatenations, is parsed and verified by the compiler, consider this: LINQ <em>can</em> use prepared statements to send queries to the database. It could hypothetically instead be building up a query string. Here's the important thing: There's absolutely no difference to the way queries are written, whether they use prepared statements or not behind-the-scenes. Therefore one can switch from potentially-compromisable strings to impregnable prepared statements, with <em>no changes made to any queries</em>. Isn't that valuable? -DavidMcLean]

      <p>

        [That wasn't my point. Assume that there's a string that cracks both your sqlString() function and LINQ's query-string builder. (It's extremely unlikely that there's any string that does break LINQ, but that's why we're assuming.) If you're using sqlString(), to secure yourself against such a hack you would need to replace all your queries with prepared-statement versions. If you're using LINQ, securing against that hack by switching to prepared statements will only need changes to the IQueryable implementation and not any of the actual queries. -DavidMcLean]

        For one, <strong>I don't trust Microsoft to work honestly</strong> or thoroughly with other DB vendors. There may also be features/commands of specific DB's that Linq doesn't understand and/or it's not intuitive to figure out how to get Linq to access the feature. The API pretty much has to <strong>know all SQL syntax in advanced</strong> to do what you suggest, and that's not a trivial language. I and other colleagues have had similar problems with their HTML wrapper API's.

The proper "anal" way can be resource-intensive and maintenance unfriendly. It's not a free lunch. Not delivering fast enough is just as much a brick on one's career as a security breach, if not more because <strong>delivery slowness is almost always visible</strong> while security breaches are relatively rare in comparison, especially for small shops or intranet. It's a sticky balancing act. Plus, Linq does <strong>not currently</strong> do it. Most managers focus on "now", not 2 to 5 years out.  It's their job to make such decisions; the developer can only recommend and present the pro/con's. Hell, Microsoft may be dead 2 to 5 years out.

        And I am still skeptical that a "full" token-based analyzer is significantly superior to a value-only analyzer. "Because I say so" is not good enough evidence. For a solid case, I would expect actual specimens of hacks that are beyond value-detectable. If there is no known specimen, the manager/owner may again say, "Why are you speculating based on remote what-if's? Get me an actual case first; I'm not going to bet my business on fucking unicorns when there are <em>real</em> horses outside my door who want their hay here and now!" (Yes, some do talk like that, especially small biz and start-ups.)
      </p>
      <p>
        [I'm a little confused as to why you keep discussing value "detection". LINQ doesn't "detect" suspicious values. I doubt your sqlString() function would do that, either. What do you mean by "detection" precisely? -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Injecting a command or extra expressions into data. A typical example is supplying a string such as "5 OR 1=1" in an "idno" parameter of some kind. Then the expression " WHERE ID=$idno " will return all records of the table instead of just #5 because it injects an extra expression that is always True, which may help a hacker get all account records instead of just his own, for example. An sqlNumber() wrapper would detect it as "bad" because it has non-numeric characters such as "R", and probably the same with Linq-like tools. sqlNumber analyzes numeric-intended value elements for stuff that shouldn't be there. (There are fancier versions of such functions that I won't go into here.) By "value analysis" I mean the function wrapper only "knows" the value and it's intended type, but nothing of the value's context in an SQL statement. An expression-builder API can potentially know the context. But I'm not sure of a case where it actually uses that extra context info to detect bad data. It has the potential to be a better injection detector, but it may rarely or never be realized in practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        And API's that mirror SQL syntax may have differences from actual database implementations that cause other problems. The API would have to carry around SQL grammar knowledge for different venders and versions of DB. Or, be limited to a sub-set, which means we may hit a wall if we have to expand to something fancier than plain-jane SQL. We may have to even start over outside the API to get the necessary power or features of a given DB. -t

        [Yes, as acknowledged above, these problems exist. They're problems with <em>any</em> specialised syntax, however; they're hardly unique to LINQ, and in fact they're not even unique to SQL queries, so they're hardly a criticism of LINQ.

        I wouldn't be surprised at all if one day MS puts out a notice saying something like, "We no longer directly support Linq for vendor's X, Y, and Z because we are moving to fooBaser instead as our prime database interface tool. While the existing libraries will be supplied, we no longer update the grammar pattern libraries to reflect vendor changes and fixes, including security fixes. For this reason, we suggest that any new application development use fooBaser instead." (Meaning you go out and buy fooBaser to fill MS's pockets.)

        Excess abstraction and indirection can be confusing for typical developers. Like I said elsewhere, even factoring via old-fashion functions has brought complaints about my code at times in multiple orgs. <strong>Duplication rarely gets somebody outright stuck</strong>, it's just more busy work and perhaps more little bugs caused by missing one of the repeating segments accidentally. However, heavy abstraction can get developers outright stuck. <strong>Businesses often value consistency more than average higher productivity. We are drifting off topic.</strong>

        <em>The notion that abstraction can be confusing for typical developers is an assumption and a myth, not a truth.  My experience with new, average developers learning higher-order functions is that they pick them up with no difficulty.

        <strong>Compiling Step and Resources</strong>
        Prepared statements are often not recommended for dynamic queries because they involve an extra compile step. If the compiled version does not get reused later because it's so situation-specific, then we are wasting time on compiling. <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> is such a type of query because the criteria clause can be different for every query. Only a combinatorial explosion of factors could be compiled to cover all, which would also fill up RAM and pull that resource away from other PS's.

      <ul>
        <li>
           [In every database I've ever used (including Oracle and <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a>), every query has to be compiled. Prepared queries allow you to skip compiling if you issue a similar one later, but not preparing queries doesn't allow you to skip compiling.]

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Compiled? Are you sure? My resources say that "new" queries take more resources to prepare for PS's than "regular" queries. Any savings comes from repeated use of the same query with different values (if it happens).

        <strong>Filter Scope Question</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If it were discovered that the string "$[[exec:7;", for example, allowed hackers to inject commands into some RDBMS brands, wouldn't it be better and simpler to filter/ban that string from the <strong>entire</strong> SQL clause rather than specific values? Or at least consider it as a design choice or shop practice? Field-value-level is perhaps too specific. That way you only have to wrap or scan a single SQL string rather than each and every field. You get wider protection AND less code bloat at perhaps the cost of slightly more false alarms. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No. You actually get less protection that way. You are only protected from those things you don't use. If you need to be able to delete rows, you can't remove the delete command from all queries. You get false alarms. You have more code bloat. You have to write the code to search for instances of your banned string. Unless that's only one or two fixed values (and it won't be), it will be more code than the code needed to accumulate objects that close over the statement and its parameters.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {Exactly.}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you filter for key-words only, then you will have too many false alarms. It's perfectly normal to have words like "delete" or "drop" in a book title, for example. You pretty much have to focus on the escape sequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Exactly my point, you have to leave the "delete" keyword available for misuse if you also have to allow it in the data portion of your entire string if you are just searching the string for instances of the word "delete" and banning all such strings. Obviously you can use a more sophisticated algorithm to determine whether or not a particular use of "delete" is a problem. Doing so bloats your code even more though. Regarding the escape sequences, can you give any actual examples of such? The escape sequences that I know of in SQL are all entirely unproblematic. They do things like treat the next character as a literal in a like phrase even though it would normally be a wildcard, etc.</em>
