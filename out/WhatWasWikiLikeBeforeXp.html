        <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: should probably be moved back there.

        I'm a newcomer here. <a href="WhatWasWikiLikeBeforeXp.html">WhatWasWikiLikeBeforeXp</a>? It sounds like it was a fun place. -- <a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>

        Before the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> community moved in, this place was known primarily as the <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a>.
        Discussions about <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> were predominant, and a number of members of the patterns community were regular contributors.
        But the volume of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> discussion quickly obscured the purely pattern-oriented discussion, and a number of the pattern contributors gave up on this wiki, moving off to form their own wikis (e.g. <a href="PatternStoriesWiki.html">PatternStoriesWiki</a>) or email/usenet discussion groups.

      <p>
        I'm not saying that this has been bad.
        One could say that <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> has made this wiki more successful in terms of volume and variety of content than the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> discussion.

        I first came here in 2000, when <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> was filled with interesting discussions on XP. I kind of miss Wiki <em>during</em> XP. -- <a href="AndersBengtsson.html">AndersBengtsson</a>

        <em>Yes, remember how interesting Wiki was when it was about software development!</em>

        That means its time to start talking about something else
