        Defect Tracking
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here's how to use a tracking system like <a href="JitterBug.html">JitterBug</a> or <a href="BugZilla.html">BugZilla</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone associated with the project, including its end users, are permitted
        to add bug entries. You cannot "get in trouble" by adding the wrong one.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, contrarily, anyone permitted to add bugs must have a unique account
        (their e-mail address), and instructions to use the Query system to seek
        their bug before adding it. A Bug can be marked as a Duplicate of another
        Bug, by number.
      </p>
      <p>
        All initial entries must contain three sections, without exception: The
        "Steps to Reproduce", "Observed Behavior", and "Expected Behavior". A
        successful bug entry helps programmers reproduce the exact problem as
        closely as possible, and this format forces the bug report author to focus
        on "just the facts" and not say things like "well, the engine makes a funny
        noise under load..."
      </p>
      <p>
        The bug author sets the "Severity" rating, from "Blocker" thru "Critical" to
        "Enhancement".
      </p>
      <p>
        Use this life-and-limb scale:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Enhancement - a feature request
        </li>
        <li>
           Trivial - the bug only makes us feel bad
        </li>
        <li>
           Minor - the bug has an obvious work-around
        </li>
        <li>
           Normal - the bug prevents access to a feature
        </li>
        <li>
           Major - the bug damages the end-user's property
        </li>
        <li>
           Critical - the bug damages the end-user
        </li>
        <li>
           Blocker - you risk losing a customer
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each bug comes with a set of attributes, such as the product and owner
        fields. Set them as best you can - on a large modularized project with a
        conjoined team there should be much overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Executives review the bug stream, adjust the details, owner & severity, and
        then set the Priority, from P1 at highest, to P5 meaning "after the Sun
        burns out".
      </p>
      <p>
        In a supermarket, eggs may come in "Medium", "Large" and "Jumbo", but your
        bugs' average Priority should be "P3".
      </p>
      <p>
        It cannot be emphasized enough that the Priority rating is the executive's
        single most important "knob" on the team's activity. Do not direct
        programmers via screaming e-mails, and do not make them try to rate who is
        screaming loudest about what. Set the Priority such that each team of
        programmers sees a collated stream of feature requests, in order by <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For best results, give that knob to a real customer. Don't make >them<
        scream loudest at executives just to get things done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Executives should not play god and add a "time estimate" to any bug report. There is simply no benefit whatsoever to this uniquely insulting and damaging practice. Anyone who estimates the time a bug should take must be prepared to fix the bug within that time estimate. And proper use of a bug tracker makes real project time estimates very easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each bug has a Resolution and a Status. A bug goes from NEW and VALID to
        ACCEPTED to FIXED or INVALID. Programmers start by trying to reproduce the
        bug; if they can't they mark it WORKSFORME and take no further action until
        receiving clarification.
      </p>
      <p>
        At whim a programmer may add a note to the system and set the ownership to
        another programmer. You cannot "get in trouble" by sending the bug to
        someone else, because they are expected to know how to at least send it
        back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your default Query into the Bugzilla system should display your current
        assigned and non-CLOSED bugs sorted by Priority, sub-sorted by Severity.
        Your job under this system is to walk the list from top to bottom. Don't
        pull items at whim, or based on what looks most fun, and never do more than
        one item at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reproducing the bug and witnessing its symptoms, set the state to
        ASSIGNED, then research each symptom until you can write an automated test
        that will only fail if the symptom is alive, and only pass if the symptom is
        dead. See <a href="CaptureBugsWithTests.html">CaptureBugsWithTests</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For each symptom, and afterwards for the whole bug, ask each question in
        this list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           could better automation have prevented it?
        </li>
        <li>
           is it a member of a category of similar issues?
        </li>
        <li>
           is my fix robust against similar bugs?
        </li>
        <li>
           did my fix increase any risks?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Collaborate and work the system until good answers are built-into the code
        base.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's an old joke about a man sawing on a tree. A passer-by comments the
        saw's blades are very dull. "Yessir, they are dull." "Maybe you should take
        time to sharpen the saw before.." "No, sir! I don't have time to <a href="SharpenTheSaw.html">SharpenTheSaw</a>. I'm too busy cutting down this tree."
      </p>
      <p>
        Take time to ensure your tools are adequate for the job, and as you fix make
        sure you leave code quality and clarity better than when you found it. Do
        not accept any module's current bad state as an excuse for a fix that
        violates good design rules, such as "short methods". That bad design is
        among the forces that created the bug. Try to avoid the need to ever visit
        this module again!
      </p>
      <p>
        Comment the new tests and code with the bug's URL. Then integrate the fix
        with your team's code repository, and comment that check-in with the bug's
        URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a commentary to the bug report including the fix's technical details,
        modules affected, and answers to its question list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Run all your modules' tests every 1 to 10 edits, and run your entire
        project's tests at each critical juncture during the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mark the bug FIXED, and return it to either its owner or a Quality Control
        assignee.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new owner will pull each daily build, then automatically and manually
        test that the bug is dead. If they are satisfied, they mark it CLOSED.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bug tracking system can name and store queries. Executives should build
        a small suite of queries that examine things like each programmer's current
        load, or any orphaned or abandoned bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        To track, executives should count the number of bugs and feature requests
        fixed in each iteration (1 to 3 calendar weeks). Don't change iteration
        length in the middle of a project just to provide the illusion of velocity.
        But that number of bugs fixed is a very accurate way to predict future
        performance. Nobody should enter whopper bugs such as "play chess", so an
        even granularity of bug sizes should help provide a very stable <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a>.

        In a discussion last week about the importance of defect tracking, I was referring back to the point that <a href="GeraldWeinberg.html">GeraldWeinberg</a> makes in <a href="QualitySoftwareManagement.html">QualitySoftwareManagement</a> about the distinction between <em>failures</em> (observable problems with the software's behaviour) and <em>faults</em> (the underlying problems in the code). A single fault can certainly cause multiple failures; likewise, I suppose, an observed failure might be tied to multiple faults.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think Weinberg goes further in that he distinguishes a System Incident (an unexpected piece of behaviour in the system) that may or may not have its source in a Fault (i.e. it may be a feature and training might be the solution).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the ideal case, your <a href="DefectTracking.html">DefectTracking</a> system would actually correlate the two, so that as you went through and marked faults resolved, it would map back to the failures that should have been resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question is, does such a <a href="DefectTracking.html">DefectTracking</a> system exist in the real world? -- <a href="BillBarnett.html">BillBarnett</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        It would probably be sufficient to have a system that allows to mark a problem report as a duplicate of another. Less administrative overhead (i.e. you don't have to write a separate "fault description"

        Perhaps we should separate these two ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Change Control / Problem Tracking / Request Tracking = keeping track of and resolving customer / tester issues.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DefectTracking.html">DefectTracking</a> = historic tracking of errors / defects / limitations / misdesigns / etc. in code, over time -- to identify "problem areas" / common errors / "bad practices" etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="DefectTrackingPatterns.html">DefectTrackingPatterns</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It makes sense that a development team might use two separate systems, one (issue tracking?) to track the status of (and record information about) failures/system incidents. Ideally, multiple incidents of the same basic issue would be logged as such (rather than as a bunch of separate incidents). External users might need visibility into this database. Once a system incident has been diagnosed as related to a fault in the code, it moves into defect tracking, whether in the same or a separate system. Defect tracking is almost an internal workflow for the development team, tracking the state of a fault (who has it been assigned to, has a fix been applied, has it been tested, approved, implemented, etc). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The trick would be to allow the system(s) to correlate between faults and their associated system incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Has anyone seen a system (or set thereof) that provide this functionality? -- bb

        Bugzilla allows bugs to be marked as duplicates of other bugs, putting a reference to the "first" bug in any duplicates.  Often in the Mozilla project's bugzilla base you'll see entries saying "This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 65121".  You can also mark bugs as "dependent" on others, such that you can't close a bug until all its dependences have been closed.  Using the terminology of failure and fault from above, with diligence, it would be possible to create a "fault" bug as dependent on the bugs for each tracks "failure" incident. Not the other way around, though it might seem logical at first glance, because you want to ensure that the fault doesn't get marked resolved until all the failures are addressed, or you might discover that a failure isn't caused by the fault you thought it was, so you can move the dependency to the correct fault.  --<a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>
