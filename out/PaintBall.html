      </h1>
      <p>
        A sport combining HideAndSeek, CaptureTheFlag, and compressed air.  The teams are equipped with airguns that fire a .68cm diameter gelatin ball filled with nontoxic water-based paint.  If you are hit with a paintball, you are out of that game, and the object is to eliminate the other team, and/or capture their flag.  Other variants of the game exist, both indoors and out, to suit nearly any taste.
