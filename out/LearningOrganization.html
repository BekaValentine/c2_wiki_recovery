        A <a href="LearningOrganization.html">LearningOrganization</a> is an organization that 
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>
           where all staff are empowered to instigate change.

        <li>

        Modifications to processes

           propagated to other parts of the organization.

           <em>The description offered above does not pretend to fit what popular books proclaim. It is a description of the structure and processes which will help an organization "learn".</em>
