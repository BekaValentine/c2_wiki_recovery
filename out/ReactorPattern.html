        Reactor Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Reactor architectural pattern demultiplexes and dispatches requests that are delivered concurrently to an application by one or more clients. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Reactor is one of the patterns documented at:
        <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/patterns/patterns.html">http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/patterns/patterns.html</a>
        <em>however, it's not easy to see </em>'where<em>' there-in it's documented. How about a quick summary for those of us unwilling to mine the WUStl page?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The reactor pattern itself is documentent in "Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects, Volume 2". The above top-level link is still relevant because the reactor pattern can't easily be considered in isolation (especially in isolation of the other Event Handling Patterns <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/POSA/POSA2/event-patterns.html)">http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/POSA/POSA2/event-patterns.html)</a>
