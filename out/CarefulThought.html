        Careful Thought

      <p>
        This is something that takes time and concentrated effort. One can observe that there are many occasions where <a href="CarefulThought.html">CarefulThought</a> should have been employed, but was not. Especially when things go badly as a result of the lack of the use of it.

        The next time you are being pressed to complete a task, job or assignment, and you feel you need more time and resources to do so:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Take a deep breath, use the mind you have to examine where you are and just how you will get to the next point. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't let the pressure succeed in causing an emotional or reactionary response which will result in sub-standard performance and task fulfillment. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't take things personally and fall into the 'kick the dog' response. What you have to do is less a personal task than it is a professional one. You may have to rely upon the help of peers, subordinates and superiors in getting things done. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't make an immediate 'consider-it-done' satisfaction statement unless you are 100% sure that it can be done.
        </li>
        <li>
           ...

        Statements about: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Ancient: "Give careful thought to your ways. You have planted much, but have harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it."
      </p>
      <p>
        Contemporary: "Careful Thought To Our Ways - The motivational speakers of our day want us to set great goals for our life: Where do you want to be in two, five, or ten years? What type of lifestyle do you want when you retire? We are encouraged to set goals slightly beyond our reach, and then instructed how to create a plan to accomplish these goals. The implication is that a more focused effort will yield superior results and lead to greater 'success.'"
