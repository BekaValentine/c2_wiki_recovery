        Don't

      <ul>
        <li>
           touch pages that you don't care about.
        </li>
        <li>
           categorize stuff that you don't expect people to be eagerly looking for. 
        </li>
        <li>
           remove your signature from every page you've edited for the last five years. 
        </li>
        <li>
           make the same meaningless cosmetic change to hundreds of pages at a shot. 
        </li>
        <li>
           try and make all of Wiki look just the way you think it should look.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Let things not be perfect. Especially let things not be perfect according to arbitrary standards that the Wiki community changes its mind about every three months (fortunately you won't be able to go back and <strong>add</strong> your signature to everything you've written for the last five years -- your signature was the only way you had to find it and it's gone now).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you touch only things that you care about then you will draw the attention of people who care about similar things. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you touch everything you found doing some search then you've done nothing but create a bunch of useless noise.
