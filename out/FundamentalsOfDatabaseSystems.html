        My favorite book to cover all of these topics is <a href="FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystems.html">FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystems</a> by Elmasri and Navathe. It covers the math, as well as SQL. -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>

        Why are database reference books often close to 1000 pages?  The topic has a well-formed theoretical basis (compared to Operating Systems, say) and very well-understood role.  It should be possible to distill this into something more like <a href="KernighanAndRitchie.html">KernighanAndRitchie</a> or Iverson's book on <a href="AplLanguage.html">AplLanguage</a> or Allen's Probability, Statistics, and Queueing theory (talk about covering a lot in a short, readable book).  If I were to deconstruct most DB tomes I would conclude

        (A) authors have an inferiority complex about their field
        (B) authors condescend to their readers (O'Reilly T-SQL book is an example)
