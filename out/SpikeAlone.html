        Spike Alone
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> is a great way to reduce ambiguity, and for little ones - one-liners and maybe a little bigger - there's no harm in pairing on a spike.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for longer investigations - the ones requiring real skullsweat - don't try to pair. It's a matter of bandwidth; your corpus callosum is an information bus that enables you to assemble completely new ideas much faster and much easier inside one cranium than by discussion between two cranii.
