        Ordered Locks

      <p>
        <strong>Intent:</strong> Avoid <a href="DeadLock.html">DeadLock</a> between concurrent tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="DeadLock.html">DeadLock</a> can arise between two concurrent tasks when one task holds resource A and is waiting for resource B, and another task holds resource B and is waiting for resource A.  For more than two tasks, deadlocks can arise whenever there is a cycle in a directed graph representing which tasks are waiting on resources held by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, establish an ordering of the resources, and require tasks to acquire locks on the resources in order.  This prevents the possibility of a dependency cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In a concurrent program with many locks (especially ones hidden from the user), enforcing this can be </em>'very<strong> difficult.  Determining whether or not a locking order violation occurs via static analysis is undecideable--computationally equivalent to the </strong><a href="GeneralHaltingProblem.html">GeneralHaltingProblem</a>.  You could use "order aware" sempahores (or whatever locking primitive you like) that can check at runtime if they are taken out of order, but this is a) expensive; and b) what do you do when the locking order is violated?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>While maintaining a locking order will indeed prevent </em><a href="DeadLock.html">DeadLock</a>; this technique does not scale well, unfortunately.  <a href="OrderedLocks.html">OrderedLocks</a> are useful; but far from a <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a><em></em>
