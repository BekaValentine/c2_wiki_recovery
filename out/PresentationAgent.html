        Presentation Agent
      </h1>
      <p>
        the <a href="PresentationAgent.html">PresentationAgent</a> is the "clever" part of the <a href="IntelligentBrowser.html">IntelligentBrowser</a>, which guides one over that <a href="SeaOfContent.html">SeaOfContent</a> (you know -- the one chock-full o' <a href="MoreSophisticatedReferencing.html">MoreSophisticatedReferencing</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="PresentationAgent.html">PresentationAgent</a> will monitor the user's actions.  Ideally, it would somehow understand those things the user found most interesting, least interesting, or of passing interest. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The agent would then decide for itself what information to present -- if someone quoted a book/paper that you've read, the agent could present simply the title.  If you've not read it in a while, or if you probably won't care about it, it could present a turbo-quick synopsis, and a ref to an abstract.  If it thinks you want/need to learn more before continuing, it could present a full abstract and reference the whole work.  <em>(someone please flesh this out for me)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be nice if we could also "spike" interest in a topic area, thus giving our <a href="PresentationAgent.html">PresentationAgent</a> a mission, searching for relevance in the <a href="SeaOfContent.html">SeaOfContent</a>, effectively acting as a search engine, finding and <em>presenting</em> those things of current interest.

        Ah, the fallacy of the <a href="ExplicitUserModel.html">ExplicitUserModel</a>, beautifully skewered in <a href="BrendaLaurel.html">BrendaLaurel</a>'s <a href="ComputersAsTheatre.html">ComputersAsTheatre</a>.
