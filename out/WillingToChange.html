        Willing To Change

        From Kent Beck in <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a> on working as a consultant for a company in order to help them...
      </p>
      <p>
        I ask two questions before starting with a team:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1) Is there a problem? If no, forget it.
        </li>
        <li>
           2) Do you want to change? If no, forget it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm amazed how often the answer to one or the other of these questions is
        "no", even in obviously screwed up situations.

        (<a href="WillingToChange.html">WillingToChange</a> is an example of an XP analogy to <a href="AlcoholicsAnonymous.html">AlcoholicsAnonymous</a>.  You have to admit you have a drinking problem, and be willing to try to overcome it, before the program can help you.  See also: <a href="TwelveStepProgram.html">TwelveStepProgram</a>.)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A possible paraphrase for that may be:
      </p>
      <p>
        If a team do not realize there are problems and/or do not want to change then it is really hard or impossible to have them change their process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or: someone can not really help another one if that help was not really asked for and if the person are not willing to change.

        I couldn't agree more emphatically. On a related note, when interviewing a team candidate I always ask <em>What would you do differently?</em> in reference to their most recent project or the project they were most happy with. If they respond that they wouldn't do a thing differently, I end up loosing interest right there as it indicates an unwillingness to change or, just as bad, they didn't learn anything on that project. --<a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        I have erred in the consultant role by trying to take too direct an approach to problems when the client was unable to do likewise.  "Forget it?"  Too bad I failed to find a workable middle ground.  Others perhaps would succeed.  Conclusion: Be gentle and stick around for a while if you can afford to, even if that's a change for <em>you</em>. --<a href="WaldenMathews.html">WaldenMathews</a>

        This is a mistake I have also made. Well put. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        This is a mistake I am still making, I am willing to change. --<a href="PaulCaswell.html">PaulCaswell</a>

        I am still trying to highlight the need for change by gently raising dissatisfaction with the current situation.  I am inspired by the declaration of independence <em>(and I'm English!)</em>, it builds the conflict to a point where the people want to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        How long do you stick around?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I haven't a clue.  But I think if you say you're willing to change, that means you are willing to be patient and accepting, in which case you're not looking to set time limits.  I could be wrong.</em>
