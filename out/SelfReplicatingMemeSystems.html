        Self Replicating Meme Systems
      </h1>
      <p>
        These ideas are from DonaldGoing, of Oxon Hill, Md, and cited in <a href="MetaMagicalThemas.html">MetaMagicalThemas</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, consider Sentence A:
      </p>
      <code>
        A: It is your duty to convince others that this sentence is true.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Sentence A, if believed, is a self-replicating meme. Taken alone, it is not compelling. Consider, however System S:
      </p>
      <code>
        S:<br/>
        S1: blah<br/>
        S2: blah blah<br/>
        Sn-1: blah blah ... blah<br/>
        Sn: It is your duty to convince others that system S is true.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <a href="DouglasHofstadter.html">DouglasHofstadter</a> calls Sn the "hook" of S. The system S1-Sn-1 and Sn are symbiotic; neither survives long without the other, yet taken together they are persuasive, especially when Sn is logically implied by S1 to Sn-1.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why does {S1,...,Sn-1} not survive long without Sn? It might not, but what makes its survival necessarily dependent on Sn?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are three examples:
      </p>
      <code>
        X:<br/>
        X1: Anyone who does not believe in System X will burn in hell.<br/>
        X2: It is your duty to save others from suffering.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Y:<br/>
        Y1: The whales are in danger of extinction.<br/>
        Y2: It is your duty to persuade others of Y (implicit).<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Z:<br/>
        Z1: The bourgeoisie is oppressing the proletariat.<br/>
        Z2: It is your duty to protect the proletariat (implicit).<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        System Z is an instance of the <a href="ExtremistMassMovementPattern.html">ExtremistMassMovementPattern</a>.

        There is an (out of place) discussion about Viral memes and Religion on <a href="PatternsAsMemes.html">PatternsAsMemes</a>. However, I contend that it misstates the connection between viral memes and religion. For a better (or at least more fun) description read <a href="SnowCrash.html">SnowCrash</a> by <a href="NealStephenson.html">NealStephenson</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephenson's viral religion meme has the following three attributes:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) It can be spread through words (reproduce)
        (2) It has a beneficial effect on the "infected".
        (3) The beneficial effect encourages the "infected" to pass on the "infection".
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, Stephenson's notion introduced a whole ecology of viruses and anti-viruses, but I won't go into that here. This just seems like a more reasonable statement than the one on the other page.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you take this particular set of statements as the "reproduction strategy" of a viral meme, then patterns sure do fit the bill.

        JohnBarnes's KaleidoscopeCentury has a remarkable description of the Meme Wars, or what happens when memetics truly take off, with the help of computers.

        I'm confused. From reading these pages, it seems a meme is like a gene, and a meme system is like blue-green algae. Yes, self-replicating blue-green algae ruled the world for a while, but it wasn't until nature's invention of mutation and sex that things got interesting.

        <em>Contrary to popular impression, there was a tremendous amount of evolution going on with single-celled organisms prior to the evolution of multi-celled organisms, which is precisely why modern cells are so remarkably sophisticated and complex. Chloroplasts and mitochondria, for instance, are symbiotes that used to be independent single-celled organisms; today, every plant and animal cell (respectively) depends directly on that symbiosis. Yet that symbiosis predates multicellular life.</em>

      <p>
        <em>The addition of sex does make things more interesting, but evolution doesn't depend on it.</em>

        Is <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> a meme? Or is it a meme system? A meme set?
