        Such a page should <strong>not</strong> automatically be deleted. The page <strong>may</strong> be a candidate for deletion. Upon discovery, add an <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> tag to it to alert the 'owner' and to put it on the <a href="ToDo.html">ToDo</a> list for the next <a href="WikiSpringCleaning.html">WikiSpringCleaning</a>.

        <em>A home page that says no more than "gee this really works" isn't really a home page and is a candidate for deletion. However, if there is even just enough information to consider saving it here then I would suggest leaving the page in place. -- </em><a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> on <a href="DeleteAbandonedHomePages.html">DeleteAbandonedHomePages</a><em></em>

        If a page has contact information or a link to a homepage, it's probably best to leave the page, or at least attempt to make contact and giving a fairly long timespan in which to respond.
