        Formal Review Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Formal Review Process</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Problem:</em> Code and design inspections are not happening often enough to be effective, or the inspections are not rigorous enough to be effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Context/Forces:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are doing code and/or design reviews
        </li>
        <li>
           You may or may not have <a href="FormalStandards.html">FormalStandards</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           There is no clear idea of what to inspect and how to review designs and code
        </li>
        <li>
           Some developers don't "get away from coding" unless they are forced
        </li>
        <li>
           Some things are being reviewed, and some aren't
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Solution:</em> Institute a formal review process.  Document and enforce how designs and/or code is to be reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        (I have even seen employee performance scores affected by their adherence to a code standard, which was enforced by the review process)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Resulting Context:</em> Code and/or design reviews are being done according to known guidelines for everything produced by a development team.

        I've read (and firmly believe) that <a href="CodeReview.html">CodeReview</a>s are near-worthless without good <a href="CodingConventions.html">CodingConventions</a> and that it is impossible to maintain <a href="CodingConventions.html">CodingConventions</a> without <a href="CodeReview.html">CodeReview</a>s. --<a href="JeremyCromwell.html">JeremyCromwell</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of Smalltalk groups maintain <a href="CodingConventions.html">CodingConventions</a> without formal code reviews.  The code gets read a lot by everyone on the team, but not in a
        review.    So, I don't think the second half of this statement is true.

        What is a <a href="FormalReviewProcess.html">FormalReviewProcess</a>?  This pattern says "have one", but it
        doesn't say what one is. --<a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>

        I think for most people <a href="FormalReviewProcess.html">FormalReviewProcess</a> = "It's written down".  Sort of like ISO9000. --<a href="JasonYip.html">JasonYip</a>
