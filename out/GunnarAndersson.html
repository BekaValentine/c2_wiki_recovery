      <p>
        I have been a lurker on this Wiki web for many years, contributing a line on one page, a link on another, and so on. I now hope to put more effort back into this community that have sparked my interest so many times.

        My main computer-related interests revolve around OO-design and programming in Java, C++, development processes (where <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is an example), and everything else that is involved in creating exceptional software.
      </p>

        I spend a lot of time thinking about using the right tool for the job, which often lead me to hack up little helper tools. I used to do it in Perl but now definitely prefer <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>. I strive to always keep my curiosity and keep thinking that there "should exist a better way to do it..." Sometimes it leads me to ponder over the expressiveness <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>, which I would love to come back to someday.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, I also have an extensive background in Real-time systems.
