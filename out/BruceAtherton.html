        It all began in a little 1000 Watt radio station in Fresno... No wait, that wasn't me.

        I am many things to many people.  For those who define people by their job, I can tell you that I currently work for an <a href="ApplicationServiceProvider.html">ApplicationServiceProvider</a> that provides <a href="HumanResources.html">HumanResources</a> services to US federal government agencies, improving their processes as much as I can.

        My interest in patterns began when I read the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> book many years ago, and discovered that they had articulated a lot of the things which I had understood intuitively but could never explain to others.  Even better, I learned many more things that I hadn't known, but that made sense to me.

        I believe that there is a clear distinction between <a href="ProgrammingAsArt.html">ProgrammingAsArt</a> and <a href="ProgrammingAsEngineering.html">ProgrammingAsEngineering</a> and I consider myself far more in the <a href="ProgrammingAsArt.html">ProgrammingAsArt</a> camp.  I don't think metrics are useful, and with rare exceptions I don't find <a href="ProcessPatterns.html">ProcessPatterns</a> nearly as interesting as other types.  I may be wrong, but there seems to be a belief outside the <a href="PatternCommunity.html">PatternCommunity</a> that Patterns are for the engineer types.  I consider Patterns to be a way to enhance the art and get the most elegant solutions in the easiest way (I'm also lazy).
