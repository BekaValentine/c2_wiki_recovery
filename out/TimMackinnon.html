        A nice guy to have a drink with in the pub! In fact some of my best ideas have come from "The Rugby" sitting with colleagues by the fire, a pint in one hand and a pencil and scrap of paper in the other.

        I work for Iterex, a company I started to develop my ideas around light weight project planning, focused teams and iterative development. Through Iterex I have developed some card tracking software (Iterex Planning Cards) and more recently some iPhone applications (ReDo). I also continue to provide consulting for teams using agile development.

        I used to work for <a href="ThoughtWorks.html">ThoughtWorks</a> who supported my work on <a href="ProjectRetrospectives.html">ProjectRetrospectives</a>, MockObjects and AgileProjectManagement.  Previously I founded the XP team at Connextra [<a href="http://www.connextra.com/],">http://www.connextra.com/],</a> and previously worked at Dashboards Software [<a href="http://www.dashboards-sw.com/].">http://www.dashboards-sw.com/].</a> A long time ago, I worked for OTI [<a href="http://www.oti.com/]">http://www.oti.com/]</a> in their London lab.

      <p>
        Having mulled over XP, I pioneered its use at Dashboards with <a href="OliBye.html">OliBye</a> and <a href="PaulSimmons.html">PaulSimmons</a>. I proved its worth at Connextra for 4 year, as way to deliver browser technology that gives useful information that is contextual to whatever you are looking at. I have now shown it working in a large corporate environment with several different teams, who when they really put their minds to it, delivered amazing results.

        Our team is now definitely <a href="TestInfected.html">TestInfected</a>, and there is truth in getting satisfaction from seeing your tests run clean (I was pleased when Kent Beck talked about programmer satisfaction, at OT99. Happy developers are healthy developers - the heads nod around me).

        A long time ago I wrote <a href="JunitCreator.html">JunitCreator</a> but modern IDE's have now replaced its usefulness. I also wrote a paper with <a href="SteveFreeman.html">SteveFreeman</a> and PhilipCraig on <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s (presented at XP2000) which I have recently updated with Steve, <a href="JoeWalnes.html">JoeWalnes</a> and <a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a> for Oopsla2004.

        <em>Tim was the first person to tell me about </em><a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> over lunch last year.  Thanks for drastically impacting the rest of my life, Tim - quite possibly for the better! --<a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a><em></em>

      <p>
        Any chance of creating a version of <a href="JunitCreator.html">JunitCreator</a> for JBuilder?
