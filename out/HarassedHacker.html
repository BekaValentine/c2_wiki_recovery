        Harassed Hacker
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="HarassedHacker.html">HarassedHacker</a><strong>'s are developers who care about their work, but find that the forces of money* and "established technology base" are forcing them to work with irredeemable technology and practices.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           institutions that never hesitate to introduce a manual process where they could use UbiquitousAutomation
        </li>
        <li>
           Systems that are very difficult to test (Something that could be avoided with a little thought... if the original author had heard of <a href="TestDrivenDesign.html">TestDrivenDesign</a>, or had cared.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Institutions that love expensive commercial tools but don't really "get" design. (The tools help them generate more rubbish, faster, and with new layers of complexity.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Institutions that are driven to fix** cosmetic bugs first, and make testing and "fixing broken windows" low priority. (** "Fix" in this context often means "kludge".)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="HarassedHacker.html">HarassedHacker</a> isn't being allowed to be a <a href="PragmaticProgrammer.html">PragmaticProgrammer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a nutshell, a <a href="HarassedHacker.html">HarassedHacker</a> is a <a href="PragmaticProgrammer.html">PragmaticProgrammer</a> who is being screwed by sheer force of money*. 
      </p>
      <p>
        (* Not that the developer is receiving the money - only that those with power over the project insist on the status quo - apparently due to short-term economics, and that the developer can't change jobs easily...)
