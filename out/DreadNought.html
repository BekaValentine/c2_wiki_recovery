        Dread Nought

      <p>
        Nightly
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle of the night, thoughts are less painful. The night covers and softens the hard impressions from the day, but the punishment for this behaviour is painful eyes... Have you ever worked through the night, as I regularly do, and then faced the new day? The eyes tighten and you can see less by day than by night. Too bad we never had the choice at birth. Another disadvantage is the pale skin you get from too many nightly activities. It shows. Darn.

        So who is <a href="DreadNought.html">DreadNought</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A </em><a href="RealName.html">RealName</a>, or something like it, would be better.<em></em>

        What's in a name?
      </p>
      <p>
        This name is all I am not. It's just a word among many, like a name is a name among many. Only the psychological satisfaction of a name seems to give a familiar sound to it. It's the basis for trust. That's so wrong! It is deceptive.
