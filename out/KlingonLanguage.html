        See <a href="http://www.kli.org.">http://www.kli.org.</a> Their translation of "Gilgamesh" has just
        come out in book form, & "Hamlet" is now in paperback...

        Klingon letters are in the <a href="ConScriptUnicodeRegistry.html">ConScriptUnicodeRegistry</a>.

        In fact there are probably more <em>native</em> Esperanto speakers (at least a couple hundred people who learned Esperanto from birth, along with a local language) than fluent <a href="KlingonLanguage.html">KlingonLanguage</a> speakers.  Klingon was deliberately designed to be as unlike human languages as possible. <em>Well, in the way in which Klingons are designed to be as unlike humans as possible.</em>

        <em>But what they came up with looks like a mix of Arabic and Turkish, which goes to show just how difficult the task is.</em> (But what do Arabs & Turks think of Klingon? Do they find it familiar and comfortable? Or is it simply our own unfamiliarity with those languages that makes it seem that way?)
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly enough, the grammatic structures used by Klingon are rather similar to the structures used by the KingJamesBible, and to a lesser extent, similar to Shakespeare.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course it's similar to Shakespeare!  Everyone knows that Shakespeare cribbed Hamlet from the original Klingon...</em>

        Perhaps what the <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> people wanted was just something unlike a European language, which is what their audience was familiar with, and the linguists had to get a model someplace. Don't forget, <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> is OnlyaTelevisionShow.
        <em>blasphemer! ;)</em>

        <em>Maybe there was a precedent for this, such as when </em><a href="JrrTolkien.html">JrrTolkien</a> used Finnish as the basis for one of his Elvish languages, and Welsh for the other.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Both FinnishLanguage* and <a href="WelshLanguage.html">WelshLanguage</a> are examples of <a href="IndoEuropeanLanguage.html">IndoEuropeanLanguage</a>s, just like <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a>.
        (*Protest: the Finnish language isn't at all an <a href="IndoEuropeanLanguage.html">IndoEuropeanLanguage</a>, but belongs to the FinnoUgricLanguage family - together with HungarianLanguage, <a href="EstonianLanguage.html">EstonianLanguage</a> and a couple of other idioms spoken in the Siberian regions.)
        <em>An objection to both of those. I don't believe there is any consensus on this, and it has borrowed from both so we can't really be sure.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a very strong consensus about the placement of Finnish and Hungarian in their own family, separate from <a href="IndoEuropeanLanguage.html">IndoEuropeanLanguage</a>s.  Debate comes in over whether the two families are more distantly related.

        We keep talking about "they."  The person who created Klingon as a (more or less) complete language is Mark Okrand, a linguist.  I don't know what the ST people asked him to do, but he has explicitly said that <em>he</em> wrote the grammar to be as unlike terrestrial languages as possible.  Ie, since SVO (subject-verb-object) is the 
        most common <a href="WordOrder.html">WordOrder</a>, Klingon is OSV (?) -- the <em>least</em> common <a href="WordOrder.html">WordOrder</a> for terrestrial languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is it? Object, Subject, Verb is not at all unthinkable in Japanese. Of course, it's a particle language, not primarly obsessed with word order in any case, but OSV is quite common.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's not the point. The point is that one of the few widely used methods of categorizing language is by which order of S, V, and O they prefer. English is primarily an SVO language, but you can find examples of any of the other orderings in some more-or-less legal utterances. Japanese, also, is primarily subject-first (when forced into such a mold), as a primary category (or similarly topic-first, when forced into a different mold). In other words, statistically the order SOV is found far more often in Japanese than is OSV.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ordering OSV is the very least common <strong>primary</strong> category for known human languages; quite a different question than whether the order OSV <strong>ever</strong> occurs as a secondary ordering. Sure, it does, in many languages. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        No, Klingon is OVS, which is impossible in Japanese (but, though rare, possible in German if the subject and object are masculine singular).  It can seem OSV if the subject is a pronoun, because both subject and object are indicated by a verbal prefix, but if the subject is explicitly stated it comes after the verb.  In fact it's close enough to the reverse of English word order to make a complete mockery of the <a href="UniversalTranslator.html">UniversalTranslator</a>s.
