        Umm... I think it's a better definition than "time-sharing over the internet where the support and maintenance concerns are not those of the users". It's the extrapolation of the central IT function out to another organization completely. But it can also be more than that where the service being provided is developed and extended by another organization as well (like ShrinkWrappedSofware).
