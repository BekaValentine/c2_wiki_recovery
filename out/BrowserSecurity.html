        <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a>s are used in most <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>s and therefore <a href="BrowserSecurity.html">BrowserSecurity</a> is an important issue. This page does not apply to the small number of <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>s without use of <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a>s that are directly exposed to the net.

        I am currently running <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> in a sandbox, and this sandbox is located in a RamDisk.  For years I have had <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a>'s Temp, History and Cookie folders in that RamDisk, but now I also have <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> there too!  Let me tell you, it is Great!  Malware can not make changes to the system, registry, or any other part of the computer, only to the virtual environment in the sandbox!!  I have chosen SandBoxie <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/">http://www.sandboxie.com/</a> as my sandbox program, but there are other good programs out there too.  The main reason I chose this program, is because it has a free version.  Running programs in a sandbox seems to be one of the last pieces of the Internet Security puzzle for me.  I am just a newbie at this, but I can already tell you that it will solve mucho problemos for me!
