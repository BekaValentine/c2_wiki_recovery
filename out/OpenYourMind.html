        Open Your Mind

        Some people like to think one way. Others like to think another. There's no limit on the number of ways it's possible to think, so let's not get hung up on just one or two. <a href="MeaningDependsOnContext.html">MeaningDependsOnContext</a>, so try to accept that others have a different perspective to yours, not better nor worse, just different.

        "An open mind is really a mark of foolishness, like an open mouth. Mouths and minds were made to shut; they were made to open only in order to shut."
        -- GK Chesterton (Illustrated London News. October 10, 1908)

        "The object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid."
        -- ditto (Autobiography. Collected Works Vol. 16, p. 212)
