        Organizing Acceptance Test Cases
      </h1>
      <p>
        Something not being discussed on <a href="OrganizingTestCases.html">OrganizingTestCases</a>, though the XP books clearly push in the direction of automated acceptance tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, a straw man: if you are going to code acceptance tests with xUnit too, keep them in a different package hierarchy from the rest of the code. I dont mean a different directory, I mean organize them differently. There is no requirement for acceptance tests to access non-public methods so feel free to organize them differently, eg grouped by iteration. Secondly, consider having one test class per <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>. User stories are intimately tied to their acceptance tests, so this seems natural. Javadoc the class with the user story. A little less XP (folk prefer cards) but it doesnt smell that bad. Finally, for all acceptance tests that can't be driven automatically, record the results in a file with a simple format (eg csv from excel). A standard acceptance test class for non-automated tests can then be written to grab the pass/fail statuses from the file, so that all results can be tracked together. 
      </p>
      <p>
        (nb this isnt all my idea, you can see some of this organization in <a href="AcceptanceTestExamples.html">AcceptanceTestExamples</a>. I think the emphasis on using the framework to pull all test results together was <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>', but I can't find the reference. Anyone? I think if you want to take these 'tool supported stories' a little further though, it would be worthwhile using an '@story' javadoc thingy to allow you to pull together estimates from the acceptance test classes)
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok it does smell a bit. It discourages some of the flexibility in user stories that you get by using cards. But hey, its a straw man. Anyone got a torch?

        This page has been dormant since 2001, and I think we've discovered a bit more about <a href="OrganizingAcceptanceTestCases.html">OrganizingAcceptanceTestCases</a> since then. We've certainly got more tools for writing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't recommend <a href="OrganizingAcceptanceTestCases.html">OrganizingAcceptanceTestCases</a> by user story or grouped by iteration. These are both artifacts of the implementation process, not of the resulting system. I would group them by feature, which is a construct related to how we think of the system we're building (or, eventually, have built).
