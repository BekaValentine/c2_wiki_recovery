        European Ms Dos Four
      </h1>
      <p>
        As far as I remember, MS-DOS 4.0 was specifically made for the European/German Siemens corporation. Was some weird mix of DOS and the later DosShell (itself almost like the Windows 3.0 standard mode kernel). It provided Unix-like foreground and background processes, and so somehow resembled a multitasking environment.

        Just wondering, because someone said on <a href="TheTwelveSimpleSecretsOfMicrosoftManagement.html">TheTwelveSimpleSecretsOfMicrosoftManagement</a>, that it was a big flop.

        Yes, I was wondering about the flop part too. In Sweden we all had MS-DOS 4.01 (4.0 had some extremely stupid bug, going to look up what that was) until MS-DOS 5 came out. The DosShell was really cool. Used it quite often on computers lacking <a href="NortonCommander.html">NortonCommander</a>, when I wanted a file manager and didn't have the patience (or available lowmem...) to start Windows. Some installations even booted into DosShell, using it as a menu program. I seem to remember playing with some config files for that. --<a href="ClaesWallin.html">ClaesWallin</a>
