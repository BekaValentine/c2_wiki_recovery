        <em>Object-Oriented Software Composition</em> is a new book [1] about
        object-oriented technology and its application to the development of
        flexible, composable systems. The book is edited by <a href="OscarNierstrasz.html">OscarNierstrasz</a>
        and DennisTsichritzis, and is published by <a href="PrenticeHall.html">PrenticeHall</a>.

      <p>
        <em>Object-Oriented Software Composition</em> adopts the viewpoint that
        object-oriented technology is essentially about composing flexible
        software applications from software components. Although object-oriented
        languages, tools and methods have come a long way since the birth of
        object-oriented programming, the technology is not yet mature. This
        book presents the results of a series of research projects related to
        object-oriented software composition that were carried out within the
        Object Systems Group at the University of Geneva, or by partners in
        collaborative research projects, during a period of about ten years. As
        such, this book is an attempt to synthesize and juxtapose ideas that
        were developed by a group of people working closely together over
        several years.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book should appeal to researchers and practitioners familiar with
        object-oriented technology, who are interested in research trends
        related to software composition.
