           <em>Guides that lead you tiny step by tiny step only give you someone else's solution. It is often better to have a discussion of the problem, understand the big ideas involved, and quickly learn some of the "gotchas" that aren't obvious from first principles.</em> -- <a href="LearningByTryingSolutions.html">LearningByTryingSolutions</a>

           <em>The Context-Driven School of software testing (</em><a href="http://www.context-driven-testing.com)">http://www.context-driven-testing.com)</a> eschews the notion of <a href="BestSolutions.html">BestSolutions</a> or <a href="BestPractice.html">BestPractice</a>s; these terms are simply meaningless, an attempt by people with various axes to grind to pretend that they have the One True Way to do things.<em> -- </em><a href="BestSolutions.html">BestSolutions</a>

        <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: I find this title a bit general and vague. Half of all topics at least are about (attempted) solutions. If it's in the context of a given methodology, then that methodology should be part of the title.

        <em>That's what you do in naming pages within a category. A Category is meant to be general and shaped so as to become a grouping mechanism. Pages within the category can specify something of the context, methodology and results in their title.</em>  -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> 20080123

        Usually if a topic name covers 50% of all topics, it needs to be refined or split. I see no reason why this topic should be an exception to this useful rule of thumb.
