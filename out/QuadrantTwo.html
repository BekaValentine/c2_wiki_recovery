        The important thing to remember here is that humans tend to spend very little time on <a href="QuadrantTwo.html">QuadrantTwo</a> activities, but they should make <a href="QuadrantTwo.html">QuadrantTwo</a> activities high priority.  So, concentrate on <a href="QuadrantTwo.html">QuadrantTwo</a> activities, because you'll tend to ignore them (because you "don't have time" while taking care of all the urgent work), even though they're truly important.

        Some humans spend way too much time in <a href="QuadrantTwo.html">QuadrantTwo</a>, for example myself.  I believe it is one of the primary qualities of people with <a href="AttentionDeficitDisorder.html">AttentionDeficitDisorder</a>.
