        The Dragon Book

      <p>
        Another name for the book <em></em><a href="CompilersPrinciplesTechniquesAndTools.html">CompilersPrinciplesTechniquesAndTools</a><em> by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman. This book is also referred to as the </em><a href="RedDragonBook.html">RedDragonBook</a>. There is also a <a href="GreenDragon.html">GreenDragon</a> book, <a href="PrinciplesOfCompilerDesign.html">PrinciplesOfCompilerDesign</a>, which <em>used</em> to be referred to as the (generic) Dragon Book; the term now refers to this one in most contexts.

        From reviewer on Amazon: "An essential reference on lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and code generation. I think it does a particularly wonderful job of introducing the formal details of finite state machines, grammars, and regular expressions. Sadly, errors and bad writing turn a joy into an ordeal."

        As an alternative, I found <em>Crafting a Compiler</em> [ISBN 0805332014] a more readable introduction to the same concepts.

        According to <a href="JeffreyUllman.html">JeffreyUllman</a>s home page (<a href="http://www-db.stanford.edu/~ullman/ullman-books.html)">http://www-db.stanford.edu/~ullman/ullman-books.html)</a> there will be new edition of <a href="TheDragonBook.html">TheDragonBook</a> in 2005.  It is (tentatively) entitled TwentyFirstCenturyCompilers (ISBN: 0321131436), and will (quoting from Ullman's webpage) "include an updating of our favorite topics, and material on such subjects as compiling for parallel machines, garbage collection, on-the-fly compiling, support for objects, compiler technology in verification and security, for example."

        No idea what color this particular dragon will be.

        <strong>Update:</strong> Addison-Wesley is now re-issuing the first edition of the <a href="TheDragonBook.html">TheDragonBook</a>, and providing online access to the new chapters which will (supposedly) be contained in a forthcoming second edition (no date has been specified for when the second edition will go to print).  This appears to be the material referenced above.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be available for purchase 2005-12-15, according to the publisher.  It is unclear if you have to buy the new printing of the first edition to receive access to the extended material; or if those of us who have copies of <a href="TheDragonBook.html">TheDragonBook</a> on the shelf (whether bought new or second-hand) will get access.
      </p>
      <p>
        My suspicion is that plans to publish a completely new book called <em>Twenty-First Century Compilers</em> have been abandoned; instead it will simply be packaged and distributed as a second edition of the red dragon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Update:</strong> In 2006, the second edition was published with a purple dragon on the cover.
