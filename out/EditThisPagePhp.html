        <strong><em>Edit This Page PHP</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        At the fundamental level, EditThisPagePHP basically just let you remotely edit a single page. There are many situations where existing Wiki or Blog software is too complicated, or imposes too much structure. EditThisPagePHP lets you have total control over the HTML - you can use sophisticated CSS layouts, or very simple HTML - the software does not get in the way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet in spite of this simplicity, EditThisPagePHP also uses ideas drawn from various Wiki, Blog, and CMS (content management system) technologies. Like Wikis, it supports an edit-this-page button, page history, page diffs, and can email users when pages change. Like Blogs, it supports optional user comments, trackbacks (both send and receive), and delivers two RSS feeds - one for the current version of the page, and one with diffs. Like a CMS, it supports multiple roles, by default a reader, an editor, and a super-editor - each with different privileges. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is useful for standards documents, lists, game rules, and home pages or anytime a group of people want to maintain a publicly accessible page together that needs full control of the HTML. 
      </p>
      <p>
        EditThisPagePHP is a PHP script that let's you edit the HTML content of a page by following a link on that page. Only two files are required: the core PHP script (editthispage.php) and a data file for your page. The core file can support as many pages as desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        It currently works with PHP 4 and 5, and does not require SQL. Every revision makes a backup of itself, so no data can be lost. PHP is not allowed in the HTML text itself, to minimize security risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future goals are to support more Wiki-like features, without losing the elegance of the one-script/mutliple-page implementation. This may include simple Wiki <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>, RCS, etc.
