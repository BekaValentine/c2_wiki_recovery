        Exploratory Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        The process of writing programs by trial and error, in order to explore new concepts and find new solutions and algorithms. It is rarely amenable to conventional <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> principles and tools, since the final result is not known in advance. Careful documentation and laboratory notes, and frequent <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a> check-ins, are important to ensure that the results are fully understood.

        <a href="ExploratoryProgramming.html">ExploratoryProgramming</a> is primarily a technique of <a href="ResearchAndDevelopment.html">ResearchAndDevelopment</a> (R&D), that may also be used in <a href="RapidPrototyping.html">RapidPrototyping</a> if the target involves untested design principles. Like with prototype code, exploratory code should never be moved directly into production, though in practice it all too often is.
