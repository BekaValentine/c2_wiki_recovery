        Myers Briggs Search

      <p>
        <a href="MyersBriggs.html">MyersBriggs</a> classifies people as either of two extremes on four different dimensions resulting in 16 distinct <a href="MyersBriggsTypes.html">MyersBriggsTypes</a> identified by four letter codes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This script searches wiki for pages with type codes and reports them in groups. It doesn't handle the ambiguity of pages with multiple codes particularly well so read it with caution.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/mb">http://c2.com/cgi/mb</a> -- search wiki for mb codes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In fact the classification itself should be used with caution as it is intended to be administered and interpreted by professionals. See also <a href="http://skepdic.com/myersb.html.">http://skepdic.com/myersb.html.</a>

        The search looks for words matching the regular expression (e|i)(s|n)(t|f)(j|p). Sometimes people substitute an x for dimensions where type is not strongly indicated. I tried including x as an alternative in each position but found I often matched xxxx, a term that is used on wiki just about as often as any type code. For extra credit write a <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> that permits a single x to appear in any one of the positions of the type code. Entries to be judged on clarity and elegance. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
