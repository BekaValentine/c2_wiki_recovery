        Water Based Computers
      </h1>
      <p>
        The idea that a (certain kind of) computer in the future will run similarly to human cells... 70 percent water?
      </p>
      <p>
        Electricity can travel through water based objects... low voltage too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Low power consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lots of water available on Earth (a renewable resource).
      </p>
      <p>
        And, can we find a way to grow computers?
      </p>

        Dune Mentats spring to mind, as do the slaves in <a href="VernorVinge.html">VernorVinge</a>'s <em>A Deepness in the Sky</em>.  Also, look up the etymology of the word "computer"; it used to be a profession.

        Sean McMullin has 3 novels about a post-apocalyptic Australia where convicts are used in a huge adding machine-like computer.

        There's also fluidics, building logic circuits from directed water flow.
