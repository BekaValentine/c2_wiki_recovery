      <p>
        <a href="MassMind.html">MassMind</a> is a Wiki-like technical reference for personal computers and embedded controllers. [<a href="http://techref.massmind.org/].">http://techref.massmind.org/].</a> It is maintained by <a href="JamesNewton.html">JamesNewton</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="MassMind.html">MassMind</a> engine provides editing features that combine parts of wiki, forum and blogs. HTML, rather than bbcode, is used as the input, storage and output format. This simplifies the process of serving the web pages, promotes a better standard (HTML) and allows advanced features (scripting, objects, xml, etc...) to be hosted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each page on the site can be owned by a registered member or left open for a member to take over. Only page owners or the site admin can edit the full text of a page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone can make comments on a page, and no captchas are required, but the comments of unregistered users are viewable to those users only until they are reviewed by the owner of the page or site. This encourages comments while not allowing spam or other negative posts to be damaging to the site as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comments are checked for possible spam content by keywords, source (via spamhaus), and pattern. Some suspect comments will be rejected instantly while others will be passed on for review before being posted. In either case, when spam is suspected, the user is blocked from further posting until the comment can be reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> in the comment form supports the easy entry of HTML code with buttons or keyboard shortcuts for bold, italic, underline, and links. Spell check is supported by googiespell.
      </p>
      <p>
        New pages are created by including a local filename in a separate field under the comment form. Only one new page can be created at a time. Only registered users can create new pages. For unregistered users, this field is an easy way to include a link and ensures that the link is checked and the HTML code will be correctly created.
