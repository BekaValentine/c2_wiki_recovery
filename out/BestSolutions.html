        Probably the most elusive concept in SoftwareIndustry
      </p>
      <p>
        That's because the term is silly, and entirely context-free.  The use of the term on its own fails to address two specific unknowns:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) "Best" by what measure?  On what scale?  According to whom?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) "Solutions" to what problem?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Context-Driven School of software testing (<a href="http://www.context-driven-testing.com)">http://www.context-driven-testing.com)</a> eschews the notion of <a href="BestSolutions.html">BestSolutions</a> or <a href="BestPractice.html">BestPractice</a>s; these terms are simply meaningless, an attempt by people with various axes to grind to pretend that they have the One True Way to do things.  Yet companies are diverse; the tasks that they undertake are diverse; the people that make up companies are diverse; the products that they produce are diverse.  Practices can be more or less appropriate in a given context, but without knowing the context, no practice can be considered "best".

        In essence, patterns are the result of <a href="BestSolutions.html">BestSolutions</a>. They are descriptions of methods and structures which have been found successful in addressing certain specific tasks, stated in terms abstract enough to be of GeneralUse:

      <ul>
        <li>
           "Each pattern is a three-part rule, which expresses a relation between a certain context, a problem, and a solution. "

               <em>I'm sure that because he wrote this many feel that the rewording above is a fair copy. I don't think it is. Alexander is capable of writing simple sentences when the thought he wishes to express is simple. He could easily have said "a pattern is solution to a problem in a context" - he uses most of these words already. But, instead he wrote the paragraph above and he went on to explain:</em>

        <li>
           "As an element in the world, each pattern is a relationship between a certain context, a certain system of forces which occurs repeatedly in that context, and a certain spatial configuration which allows these forces to resolve themselves." 
        </li>
        <li>
           "As an element of language, a pattern is an instruction, which shows how this spatial configuration can be used, over and over again, to resolve the given system of forces, wherever the context makes it relevant."
