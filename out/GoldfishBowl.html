        This is a technique for a large number of people (max I've done successfully is 50) to have a good discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put five (or so) chairs in a circle in the middle of the room, and all the rest concentrically around it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          One of the chairs must remain empty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only someone in one of the chairs may speak.
        </li>
        <li>
          Anyone may sit down in the empty chair.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You will need some light facilitation if people don't get the rules immediately.
        You MUST have a good topic, otherwise people just come into the circle to air their views, not to take part in a discussion. This means a topic where there are clear conflicting views.
        About an hour is usually enough.
