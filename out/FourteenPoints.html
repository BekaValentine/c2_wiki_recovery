        <a href="WilliamEdwardsDeming.html">WilliamEdwardsDeming</a>'s management philosophy can be best summarized by the <a href="FourteenPoints.html">FourteenPoints</a> for good management, from his book '<a href="OutOfTheCrisis.html">OutOfTheCrisis</a>', ISBN:0911379010.

        Actually, when I re-read them, I find many of the points consistent with the philosophies of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> - continuous improvement, end useless inspections, ensure quality as part of the process, bid work on best value rather than lowest cost, drive out fear, down barriers between departments, etc. -- <a href="SteveCline.html">SteveCline</a> again

        What Deming meant by inspection is closer to the idea system test than what we mean by code inspection.  <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> does not eliminate code inspection, rather, it attempts to move inspection closer to to the time of defect injection by the practice of <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>. -- <a href="CoreyLadas.html">CoreyLadas</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        As Deming's ideas took hold in Japan, they were refined by the people who created the Toyota Production System, particularly <a href="ShigeoShingo.html">ShigeoShingo</a>.  They had some principles that converged even more to XP:  just-in-time production (do nothing until it is needed); and <a href="PokaYoke.html">PokaYoke</a> or mistake-proofing, which meant techniques to prevent bad work from being produced.  I think XP unit tests would be the software equivalent of <a href="PokaYoke.html">PokaYoke</a>. -- <a href="BobHaugen.html">BobHaugen</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Deming was actually very critical of <a href="PokaYoke.html">PokaYoke</a> methods, arguing against them in terms of the TaguchiLossFunction.  Like inspection, <a href="PokaYoke.html">PokaYoke</a> is an after-the-fact technique that masks root cause.  Deming clearly demonstrated why it is counterproductive to intervene in a process that is in a state of statistical control.  XP units are <a href="PokaYoke.html">PokaYoke</a> only if you think that the point of <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> is testing.  If you think the point of <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> is design specification, then unit tests have nothing to do with <a href="PokaYoke.html">PokaYoke</a>, and everything to do with OperationalDefinitions. -- <a href="CoreyLadas.html">CoreyLadas</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For some reason, I am always amazed at how the very Deming-esque ideas presented by XP (or even the ideas and proposals put forth in the <a href="CluetrainManifesto.html">CluetrainManifesto</a>) are considered "new-fangled" by a number of executives.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's too bad Deming himself did not live long enough to see <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> emerge and the various processes introduced (like XP).  It would have been interesting to hear his perspective.
