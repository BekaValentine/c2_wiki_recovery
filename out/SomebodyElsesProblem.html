        Somebody Elses Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        All the problems in the world can be classified into one of two categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           My problem
        </li>
        <li>
           Somebody else's problem
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A problem is "my problem" if it interests or affects me in some way or if 
        I have been assigned the responsibility to mitigate it. Otherwise it is somebody else's problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ignoring those problems that are <a href="SomebodyElsesProblem.html">SomebodyElsesProblem</a> is a good way to focus my 
        attention on those problems that are <em>mine</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ignoring those problems that are <a href="SomebodyElsesProblem.html">SomebodyElsesProblem</a> can keep me from becoming entangled in the political, social, and economic aspects of their solutions. Keeping ones nose out of other people's business is often a good idea. Fixing other peoples 
        problems 
        for 
        them 
        may 
        prevent 
        them from learning how to fix problems themselves or prevent them from 
        fixing them the way they want them fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be too easy to dismiss problems as being 
        <a href="SomebodyElsesProblem.html">SomebodyElsesProblem</a>. Just because a problem is 
        somebody elses problem doesn't mean it is 
        not mine as well. A problem that doesn't 
        interest or affect me today may do so tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refusing to help others with problems that are 
        <a href="SomebodyElsesProblem.html">SomebodyElsesProblem</a> often leads to resentment and lack of cooperation. People who explicitly say "That's not my problem" are generally viewed negatively. Diplomacy is 
        important.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a team environment, it is usually beneficial to consider all problems to be "our problems".
