        Form Encoding Over Http
      </h1>
      <p>
        SOAP and XML-RPC are still very heavy duty/complicated for what
        is often more simply done using CGI/HTTP/url-form-encoding.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Use any HTTP library to create data encoded as a form. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Use any HTTP library to send this to a URL using POST encoding.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        What's exactly meaning of <em>POST encoding</em>?<br/>
        <em>My assumption is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, as opposed to multipart/form-data</em><br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Install a webserver and install a CGI handler for the URL.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Use any CGI library to extract the data. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Implement the behaviour in your favorite language.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Return the results using form encoding.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Parse the results using any CGI library. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This is a very simple and relatively low overhead way of tying
        distributed tools. I wouldn't use this approach for
        a billion transaction a picosecond system, but a lot of applications
        aren't that tight. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The upside is enormous:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Attribute-value pairs suffice for most
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        applications. It's easy to add structure on top of the AV
        pairs when needed. No need for an XML processor at all.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Any platform can be easily used because web servers run everywhere.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           You can use any language you want because the one you want will probably
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        have a CGI/HTTP library.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           It's very quick to setup and understand.
        </li>
      </ol>
