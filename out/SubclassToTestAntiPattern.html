      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>: Need to fake, mock or stub methods in a <a href="ClassUnderTest.html">ClassUnderTest</a>, and/or classes it uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>: automated (xUnit) testing of one or more classes in a system
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>:  [forces]
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Supposed Solution</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Subclass the <a href="ClassUnderTest.html">ClassUnderTest</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Override method(s) that need to be faked/mocked/stubbed, for testing purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
           Extract object creation methods for classes that this class creates that also need to be tested or mocked.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Override these creation methods, creating fake/mock/stub subclasses, to override their methods.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Repeat for however many layers of classes needed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No class used in the test is directly, fully, completely a <a href="ClassUnderTest.html">ClassUnderTest</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's difficult to succinctly describe or reason about the various methods being overridden, for each test.
        </li>
        <li>
           It becomes more and more difficult to refactor production code, because any method not static, private or final, may have been overridden in one or more tests.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Seductive forces: why this is so popular:
          <ul>
            <li>
               It's quick easy and simple.
            </li>

        </li>
      </ul>

            <li>
               Reuse of test code is difficult.

      <p>
        Doesn't seem like <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a> would avoid the problem; rather, it might make it worse, by making it more difficult to see the tests that are overriding <a href="ClassUnderTest.html">ClassUnderTest</a> methods.

        In my opinion, <a href="SubclassToTest.html">SubclassToTest</a> is a bad idea. First, I think having a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> that needs to muck around in the implementation details of a class points to an encapsulation problem or maybe some problem with the abstraction. Second, <a href="SubclassToTest.html">SubclassToTest</a> inhibits one's ability to refactor. However, if I restrict <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing to public features, I am free to refactor the implementation and view the class from the <em>using</em> perspective. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong>, I always write <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s without violating the interface of the <a href="ClassUnderTest.html">ClassUnderTest</a>. After all, if you can't reach some behavior from the <a href="PublicInterface.html">PublicInterface</a>, why is it even in the class? 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>As a result</strong> of doing this, I get to see my class from the perspective of class <em>user</em> rather than class <em>provider</em>. If <em>I</em> end up feeling the desire to violate the abstraction, so will the <em>real</em> user.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong>, when you feel the desire to go beyond you public features, instead take the opportunity to revisit the design of your class interface. 
      </p>
      <p>
        FWIW, I <strong>do</strong> have a parallel package hierarchy (as described above) so my tests can access package-data without having to be shipped with the production code. This way, you don't pollute the package namespace. I use JBuilder, so I just change my source path from "project\src" to "project\src;project\test". All my <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>s go into the "project\test" directory but look as if they are all one project to the IDE. However, I rarely, if ever have actually used this feature to access package visible attributes -- it's more just a convenient way to organize my test cases. { This is also the way Maven organizes the sources by default. }
