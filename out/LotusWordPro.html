        <a href="LotusWordPro.html">LotusWordPro</a> is a word processing program made by LotusCorporation, which now belongs to <a href="IbmCorporation.html">IbmCorporation</a>. It's part of Lotus Smart Suite. I've been using it since 1999, since an OEM version came with the PC I bought then. It's not a bad word processor, though it's getting long in the tooth, and it doesn't seem that IBM is coming out with any updates or new versions. Importing newer Word documents is a pain, and I've resorted to using <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> for that. -- <a href="JohnWebber.html">JohnWebber</a>

        <em>Update, Dec. 2003: I'm now using OpenOffice1.1.0 for just about everything. Converting my 1-2-3 spreadsheets to the OO format wasn't easy -- exporting them as Excel sheets and importing them into OO. Most of the formulas, charts, etc. (i.e. almost everything) had to be redone. But now I can access them from Linux.</em>

        It handles complex page layouts better than <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a>, but it is harder to customize <a href="LotusWordPro.html">LotusWordPro</a>'s interface.
