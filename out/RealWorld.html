        Look out your window; the one embedded in your wall, not your computer screen, there you see the <a href="BigRoom.html">BigRoom</a>.

        It's somehow related to the <a href="BigRoom.html">BigRoom</a>. (<em>No, I can't enter the big room. It'll kill me!</em>)

        It's a mythic land where nobody gets too upset if a semi-colon or a parenthesis is missing. Where you want to go when you feel like <a href="GettingOut.html">GettingOut</a>.

        Also, a rather concrete land where theory crashes hard into realities, like the limits of today's computer hard- and software. Can refer to leaving the hallowed halls of academia, lured by the call of pre-IPO options.

        I always thought that <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> referred to an MTV show (MusicTelevision) about people who couldn't code their way out of a paper bag, but are being followed by cameras anyway.

        It seems to be folk wisdom in the industry. On <a href="http://www.webteam.cc/services/project_analysis.php">http://www.webteam.cc/services/project_analysis.php</a> it is claimed that the "average" (which is undefined) project comes in 90% over budget and 120% late.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>One way around this is to no longer define deadlines or budgets, but streams. You have some amount of money and some amount of time in order to do a stream of work. When either the work, money or time run out, the project stops. This is similar to the </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> way and the XP way (project can be terminated at any time). However, it is often in counterpoint to the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>, which is full of people with digital watches and <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a> calendars.<em></em>

        To quote JohnMayer again, "'Welcome to the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>', she said to me, condescendingly." This seems to be a feeling that comes across when I try out agile practices in any MonolithicCulture and fail for whatever reason. "It can't be done", they say. Well you know what I think? "Wake up! The <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> can become whatever you make it, stop accepting and start thinking!"

          % over budget and 120% late? Is that a real statistic? Damn. The folk wisdom I applied for my whole career was: "Ask the programmers at the beginning of the project, then double it.". I found it applies to all projects, even home construction/improvements. I wonder what human process makes this ratio so predictable.

        At one point, I had a new manager who had just come from an analyst position at a large company. At some point in an overmanaged project, they told me it didn't matter how much money we spent; the client did not have any kind of budget for the project, and would pay however much was charged. I knew the client better; I objected and told the manager that didn't make any sense, and he said,"Welcome to the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>." A few weeks later, the project was ended prematurely, partly due to overspending. -- <a href="JesseMillikan.html">JesseMillikan</a>

           <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> is a term mostly mentioned by people while they actually sit in front of their real computers, spending a part of their <a href="LifeTime.html">LifeTime</a> on communicating with mostly RealPersons in textual form (not VideoChat) being frustrated from the unfulfilling abstractness of its emotion stripped character. Then they pretend to have a <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> to which they want to return as early as possible, rubbishing their current activity, ignoring the fact, that all parts of their lives are real, including the too abstract or boring ones, spend in front of any screen. Actually <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> finds its short caesura only in the moment of death, until getting ReBorn. The only lives not real are those of fictional persons, persons not real. -- <a href="ManorainjanHolzapfel.html">ManorainjanHolzapfel</a>
