        Configuration Files
      </h1>
      <p>
        Configuration files are increasingly being used to control the behaviour of application programs. For a small program with a well defined behaviour, command line parameters can be used to alter the behaviour of a program without having to modify and recompile its source code. However, larger and more complex applications, like most of the existing business-critical web applications, carry out a large number of broadly varying tasks. These applications have lots of potential configurations and behaviours. Designers have resorted to using configuration files that are read during initialisation time or monitored during run-time to alter the application's behaviour. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Now, the drawbacks of this approach are as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The application program needs to write its own interpreter (which can become increasingly complex depending upon the complexity of the configuration) to interpret the configuration and control the application.
        </li>
        <li>
           The application may need to develop a new language to describe the configuration. The application programmer is then required to write a parser to parse this configuration. 
        </li>
        <li>
           All the source code that is needed to control these various configurations (i.e. to dynamically support the various permutations and combinations of features provided by the application) tends to be excessively large and hence is more difficult to maintain. (see <a href="ConfigurationManagement.html">ConfigurationManagement</a>, <a href="ManagementOfSoftwareConfigurations.html">ManagementOfSoftwareConfigurations</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are some ways to dodge these problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use a lightweight, simple, <em>proven</em> <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a> that comes with a lightweight embedded interpreter. This scripting language will call back into the application, configuring it procedurally, and will support abstractions by default. <a href="LuaLanguage.html">LuaLanguage</a> is a reasonable choice, but there are many others (<a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, etc.). It's important that the application can be selective about which capabilities it gives to the script. It's also <strong>really</strong> nice if the interpreter provides good error reports, and even better if an embedded debugger is readily available.
        </li>
        <li>
           Keep configurations to <strong>just one file</strong>. However, also support 'includes' or other form of composition, so that different configurations can 'share' a lot of code. Both of these simplify <a href="ConfigurationManagement.html">ConfigurationManagement</a>, and includes of scripts that allow <em>abstraction</em> supports a great deal more sharing (since one essentially can have parameterized configurations in the include files, and parameterize them from the root file).
          <ul>
            <li>
               Allowing configurations to spill into multiple files simply by virtue of their location makes <a href="ConfigurationManagement.html">ConfigurationManagement</a> for more than one configuration <em>combinatorially</em> more difficult. Essentially, one starts needing a directory-tree per configuration, and a shared file must carefully be duplicated to each branch. It's also painful simply by extension of <a href="HierarchicalFileSystem.html">HierarchicalFileSystem</a>s being painful. I've made this mistake. Don't do it!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           If your application has a <a href="PluginArchitecture.html">PluginArchitecture</a>, consider use of a <a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a> framework to help select between competing implementations. This form of abstraction can greatly ease <strong>portable</strong> configurations because configurations do not need to be 'aware' of exactly which implementations for a given feature are available. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Some will also suggest <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> (XML) or various other options like <a href="YamlAintMarkupLanguage.html">YamlAintMarkupLanguage</a> (YAML). I guess they've somehow made these succeed without feeling disgusted with the resulting product. Here are my feelings on these subjects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The result isn't reusable anyway, since the content is specific to the application.
        </li>
        <li>
           The schema verification is expensive, and rarely helps uncover real configuration problems.
        </li>
        <li>
           The syntax is inefficient, bulky, and repetitive. You can't abstract out the boring, repetitive stuff with loops over condensed data. The bulk factor adds to the <a href="ConfigurationManagement.html">ConfigurationManagement</a> burden. The lack of abstraction doesn't even offer useful features - for example, it doesn't really help you trace a configuration problem to a certain location. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Since you lack abstraction, you also need more <a href="ConfigurationFiles.html">ConfigurationFiles</a> for slightly different 'variations'.
        </li>
        <li>
           The interpreters are inefficient and bulky. Essentially, they need to 'remember' a lot of information about structure. There are variations on the parsers that are streaming, <em>but if you use them</em> you'll just be configuring your product by procedural commands reacting to the stream anyway. Might as well start with a language that is designed as a stream of commands that remembers only what is needed, and thereby keep everything really lightweight.
        </li>
        <li>
           Most application programming languages support the procedural paradigm (events with side-effects). Not so many support <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> or the more declarative approaches. By using a procedural scripting language to configure the application, you will be struggling with one less Framework.
        </li>
        <li>
           Most application-configurations need to support command-events anyway, e.g. so you can add a button and configure what that button does when clicked. So, if you do go with XML or YAML or a similar solution, you will <em>still</em> be including a <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>. The end result is a bulkier product than it reasonably could have been.
        </li>
        <li>
           Since you're going to have scripts called from the application, you'll end up adding them to the configuration somewhere. Scripts are a <em>pain</em> to work with in XML. Not only is it difficult to trace them to your source, but your code will likely be full of '&lt;' and '&gt;' and '&amp;' symbols. If your <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a> is capable of keeping 'function' objects around, a reasonable approach is to allow those to be attached to the application buttons (perhaps with capabilities provided through the input object to avoid <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s from 'events' before the application is fully built). 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you need 'declarative' <a href="ConfigurationFiles.html">ConfigurationFiles</a> (e.g. for <a href="GatedCommunityPattern.html">GatedCommunityPattern</a>), I happily suggest you start with <a href="DataLog.html">DataLog</a>. Alternatively, have the initial configuration build the declarative configuration as a large value or set of tables. It's what you'd have had to do with XML or YAML streaming anyway. Seriously, the abstraction that comes from a real <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a> will greatly help you avoid <a href="ConfigurationManagement.html">ConfigurationManagement</a> issues from exploding, and will allow a great deal of reuse. <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a>.

        In the course of developing a simulation app in Java the required many numeric configuration parameters, I developed the <a href="OverridableCodeConstants.html">OverridableCodeConstants</a> patterns, which I backed with an XML file accessed through the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/configuration">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/configuration</a> implementation, which provides a means to <a href="EasyFindMutableConfigFilesInJava.html">EasyFindMutableConfigFilesInJava</a>.

        What we need is a simple solution that would enable us to dynamically control and configure the behaviour of complex applications. The solution needs to be more reliable and less cumbersome than configuration files and should lead to a much smaller code base.

        After being repeatedly repulsed by <a href="ApacheTomcat.html">ApacheTomcat</a> configuration files I have moderated my praise for XML config files (though the encoding really doesn't matter) somewhat. If the config files are simple then it can work. But the Tomcat config files are anything but simple. There are billions of options and locations and poor documentation. I desperately need a GUI to help with the configuration. A GUI should encode all the things I need to do and could do, but don't know about. For example, how the hell do I turn on debugging so I can trace servlet requests? What magic context needs to be placated?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As you say, this has not much to do with </em><a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a>; a ConfigFileFromHell will be such no matter what format it's rendered in.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting Tomcat -- or any other app, for that matter -- config files in XML would at least make it easy to create XSLT translations and Schema to make sure the config isn't hosed from the get-go. Also, XML can be edited directly using a slew of available editors. Hmm. I might attack my Apache and Tomcat configs to move them into XML...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Editing is fine. Knowing what options are available isn't.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        When I saw this entry, my first thought was "Tomcat config files". And regardless if it is easy to edit XML files with any editor - a configuration program definitely is a must taking the 1000001 options of Tomcat into account. Having a configuration program which includes all options however, makes the file format, in which configurations are saved, unimportant. Although XML still has the advantage then, that you can edit it with any editor and don't NEED the configuration program.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well I am glad I have never had to configure Tomcat, but I still agree that XML config files can suck. Why are people so hung up on XML? Most config files have a few uniquely named properties that can be assigned values - nothing more. so why insist on firing up an XML parser for that? Simple properties files can even be accumulated into one if a bit of care is taken when defining namespaces. That is often impossible in XML.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As was pointed out XML isn't really the problem. I think XML is as good as any format. The problem is if it's not something you know intimately, complex configuration files for a complex product are virtually unusable. So regardless of the encoding a GUI needs to be available to encode the knowledge of what can be done.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But once you have a GUI to edit the config file, why bother with XML?  A less verbose format can do everything XML can do if you remove the requirement that humans will read and edit it by hand.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Though I prefer property files to XML, the real problem isn't that XML config files can suck; instead it's that badly-designed configuration mechanisms suck. A poorly designed GUI can be just as unusable as an obstruse XML file. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The best approach is to design the configuration mechanism, whether it's a file or a GUI, to be as intuitive as possible to the person configuring the system. You can always write code that converts the configuraton into whatever internal format is most convenient.
