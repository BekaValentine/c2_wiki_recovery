        Shell Variables
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Shell Variable is a variable part of a shell, of course. It also acts like a variable in shell scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        To refine this: A shell is a program that interprets commands using calls to other programs and a kernel program (hence the name shell). Many shells have statements that assign a value to a name, and allow this assigned value to be changed. The assignments (bindings) are stored as part of the shell program's data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that this means that when the shell program terminates or exits all its variables vanish with it. The shell encapsulates them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some shell variables are *exported* to the Environment Variables that are inherited by sub-processes. These variables and values are effectively pre-initialized for newly executed programs (by their parent processes or by the previous program that inhabited a given process space).
      </p>
      <p>
        In  many shell programs the command line arguments or parameters are numbered shell variable. There are always other special variable that are given values or supply data for multifarious purposes: TZ might indicate time zone and HZ the clock rate and $? an error number, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Syntactically, and in opposition to most programming languages, there is a special notation for the value of a shell variable. An explicit de-reference symbol. In UNIX shells this is the Dollar Sign.
