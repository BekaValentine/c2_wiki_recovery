        Continuation Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>, a continuation is a function C that is passed to a function F, where the result of F is C applied to some intermediate result produced by F (see <a href="ContinuationExplanation.html">ContinuationExplanation</a>).
        That is, F is defined to find some result then apply C to it.
        Hence, C tells F what to do with its result.
      </p>
      <p>
        In procedural programming, callbacks are an example of a <a href="ContinuationPattern.html">ContinuationPattern</a>.
        Once a method has produced a result, its task is to invoke the callback with that argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I thought calling a continuation blows away the current stack. Calling a callback doesn't. What am I missing?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        F is a <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a> in this example.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if all functions take a continuation C, then we don't have to pass a return address:
        a function call just becomes a jump with arguments. So in this view all functions are
        already higher-order, because all functions take a continuation (i.e. return address +
        local state ( = stack and registers and what can be reached from that.)) If we now
        additionally allow capturing of these ordinary implicit continuations, then we get
        (some variant of) <a href="CallWithCurrentContinuation.html">CallWithCurrentContinuation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But one does not have to use a language (implementation) that supports
        <a href="CallWithCurrentContinuation.html">CallWithCurrentContinuation</a> to be able to use <a href="ContinuationPassingStyle.html">ContinuationPassingStyle</a>.
        It's just a bit more awkward (read : 'explicit').

        And how does this compare with using monads (see <a href="OnMonads.html">OnMonads</a>)?
