        Ms Virtual Pc
      </h1>
      <p>
        Microsoft Virtual PC is a 2003 <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> acquisition. It has high compatibility with various late model MS Operating Systems, including addons required for <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a>. This is an example implementation of a <a href="VirtualComputer.html">VirtualComputer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formerly by Connectix, VirtualPC was and is the most popular x86 emulation environment for PowerPC-based Macs. In more recent years it's expanded into the x86-on-x86 virtualization market with a Windows host version, where it competes with <a href="VmWare.html">VmWare</a>.

        <em>"Lowest Base OS required"</em>

        MS said in its FAQ, amongst other things, that this product "...allowing users to run a Windows operating system and Windows applications on a Mac."

           an IT journalist who switched to using Mac in has attested (Sep05) to the usefulness of this software to provide a buffer to migration pains. See <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com.au/pp.php?id=1300371904&fp=4&fpid=4">http://www.linuxworld.com.au/pp.php?id=1300371904&fp=4&fpid=4</a>

        I assume it require some OS to start this <a href="MsVirtualPc.html">MsVirtualPc</a> environment, and that <a href="AppleMacintosh.html">AppleMacintosh</a> can be one of these. However I want to have <a href="WindowsNinetyEight.html">WindowsNinetyEight</a> as hosting PC, then run <a href="MsVirtualPc.html">MsVirtualPc</a> (2004 version), and within it call up <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> (or even <a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a>, windowsOrcas) as and when it is required. Is that possible? If possible, how would some device support be enabled (e.g. USB2) in the guest OS, if not supported by host OS (e.g. W98)?

        <em>"...including addons required for </em><a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a>"<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What addons are there, are you referring to the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> framework being embedded into <a href="MsVirtualPc.html">MsVirtualPc</a>? If so, it will be less attractive to people not wanting to use <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> yet. <em>You are not forced to use </em><a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> with Virtual PC.<em></em>

        A product such as <a href="MsVirtualPc.html">MsVirtualPc</a> allow multiple installation of the same, or different operating system on a single set of hardware. This can make the life of software configuration and testing easier. An example being comparing the behaviour of .NET 1.0 with .NET 1.1 applications.

        <em>An example being comparing the behaviour of .NET 1.0 with .NET 1.1 applications.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not necessarily a good example, though, since both .Net versions can be installed and run side by side :)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When running side by side, you are basically running a single .NET 1.1 environment, this can exhibit a different behaviour from running 1.0 application in a .NET 1.0 environment.</em>

        Anyone using the Microsoft branded <a href="MsVirtualPc.html">MsVirtualPc</a> yet? What are the experiences that can be shared?

        I'm using it to run QNX 4 (see <a href="QnxOperatingSystem.html">QnxOperatingSystem</a>) on my Windows XP box.  I had a separate QNX machine that I used for building embedded software, but now I can do it all on one machine.  It is faster than the dedicated box used to be, but that box was a 300 MHz Pentium II.  Installation of QNX was a breeze.  One tip: if you only need network connectivity between a virtual machine and the host machine (that is, you don't need the virtual machine to connect to other machines), use the loopback adapter as described in the documentation; it is much faster than using the real NIC. --<a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        I do all of my <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> development using <a href="MsVirtualPc.html">MsVirtualPc</a> and MsVirtualServer. Recommendations: Lots of RAM and run them on a separate hard disk from your host OS. --<a href="PeterProvost.html">PeterProvost</a>
