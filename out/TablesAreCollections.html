        Tables Are Collections
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> is often seen arguing about the inherent superiority of TOP to functional programming.  He claims that 'smart' tables are much better than 'dumb' collections.  However, I think that this is in fact a meaningless debate, because tables are merely a type of collection, and database queries are the higher-order operations that sort and filter and scan and update them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be most clearly seen in the LanguageIntegratedQuery [MS LINQ] project, essentially a <a href="LispMacro.html">LispMacro</a> in a language that doesn't have <a href="LispMacro.html">LispMacro</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance,
      </p>
      <code>
        from o <- someTable<br/>
        where o.FrozzBozz<br/>
        select o.FirstName + " " + o.LastName<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        translates to
      </p>
      <code>
        someTable<br/>
        .Filter( delegate (o) {return o.FrozzBozz()} )<br/>
        .Map( delegate (o) {return o.FirstName + " " + o.LastName} )<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In a language with a better syntax for anonymous functions, it would be:
      </p>
      <code>
        someTable.filter(o => o.frozzBozz).map(o => o.firstName ++ " " ++ o.lastName)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or (shock!) you could get away with writing it cleanly <em>without</em> the macro, as in:
      </p>
      <code>
        someTable filter (_.frozzBozz) map (o => o.firstName ++ " " ++ o.lastName)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        [this is <a href="ScalaLanguage.html">ScalaLanguage</a>, which is really d*mn good at making DomainSpecificLangauges without ever breaking out the macros.  <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> is also good for this...]
      </p>
      <p>
        Order by?
      </p>
      <code>
        (<some_long_query>).sort_by {|a| a.prod_num}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Even delete from:
      </p>
      <code>
        date = now()<br/>
        orderDB.reject! { |rec| rec.date < date - (7 years) }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Microsoft also offers a kind of "RAM table" type that allows one to do "regular" SQL on it. The advantage of this is that one can switch the implementation to a full RDBMS if the requirements grow without rewriting the queries. (I'm not sure if LINQ can do that for non-MS databases.) You are essentially reinventing a query languages with lots of "funny punctuation" in it. If we are going to start over, then let's plan a good query language this time (</em><a href="HowOtherQueryLanguagesAddressSqlFlaws.html">HowOtherQueryLanguagesAddressSqlFlaws</a>). Ideally the query language should be app-language-independent such that I don't have to learn/use one query language for Ruby and another for PHP, etc. Query languages and GUI languages should strive to be app-language-independent in my opinion. -t<em></em>
