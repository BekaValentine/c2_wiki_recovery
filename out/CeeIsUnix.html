        Cee Is Unix
      </h1>
      <p>
        Cee is unix because operating systems are languages and languages are operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course today's *nix operating systems such as Linux, OpenBSD, Solaris,  are more than just Cee.. but the metaphor still stands.
      </p>
      <p>
        As another example: UCSD Pascal was an operating system, but also a language.

           In his defense, the ANSI C standard library is a proper subset of the original Unix API, if I recall correctly.  Most people do not consider C to be "C" without it (more generally, most folks don't consider a language a "true language" without a standard library either; the failure of the Oakwood Conventions committee to settle on a standard library for Oberon probably did more to kill it than anything else, for example).  So, in some real sense, C really does imply Unix.

          <em>I'm not convinced that the origin of a language should be relevant to the question of whether a particular </em><a href="LanguageIsAnOs.html">LanguageIsAnOs</a>.  I'd point one more towards those languages that are defined along with large runtime frameworks that have concurrency and communication models.<em></em>
