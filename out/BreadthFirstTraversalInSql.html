        Breadth First Traversal In Sql
      </h1>
      <p>
        The 'obvious' representation of a tree in a relational database uses relations to represent edges in the graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is called out in <a href="SqlAntiPatterns.html">SqlAntiPatterns</a>, since a naive implementation of tree traversal then has to make many queries, typically one per node. <a href="TreeInSql.html">TreeInSql</a> solves this by changing the representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a procedural language driving the database then there is another way which does not change the representation. The trick is to process tree nodes in breadth-first order. After processing a level in the tree, the next level is selected en masse. Tree traversal can then be done with a number of queries proportional to the depth of the tree. Alternatively levels of the tree are accumulated into a temporary table for further processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This algorithm can be adapted to traverse <a href="DirectedAcyclicGraph.html">DirectedAcyclicGraph</a>s (but then needs SelectDistinct), or to traverse arbitrary <a href="DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a>s (but then needs an in-memory or in-database visited flag to avoid visiting the same node twice).

        <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: Merge with <a href="TreeInSql.html">TreeInSql</a>? Not sure about that - it might be better to move the bulk of <a href="TreeInSql.html">TreeInSql</a> to a new page FullPathStoredAtLeaves and have <a href="TreeInSql.html">TreeInSql</a> refer there and here and to whatever other schemes people have for dealing with graph representation in <a href="SqlLanguage.html">SqlLanguage</a>.
