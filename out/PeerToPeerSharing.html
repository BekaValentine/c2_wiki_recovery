        Peer To Peer Sharing
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="PeerToPeerSharing.html">PeerToPeerSharing</a> can be a useful model for collaborative development of software or other projects where the project information and files can be shared directly between two peers. While most of the attention in this area has been about the sharing of information which can not be legally shared because of ownership issues, there is still a vast area of sharing and collaboration which can be undertaken legally resulting in mutual as well as public benefit. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This area of open sharing which is legal will see rapid growth in the coming years and may even become commonplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software for legal sharing is available, but better and more flexible software is needed.
