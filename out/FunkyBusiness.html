        [ISBN 0273645919] An interesting, fun read. Lots of high energy motivational stuff about the nature of the new economy, the supreme importance of individual brains as the constrained value-driving resource, how organizations must change to be successful. As always with this kind of book, I had trouble telling how much was merely inspirational vs. actionable.

        There is a quotation here about failure that strikingly reminded me of a quotation I saw on wiki (but now can't find) about needing to fail faster:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Innovation requires experimentation. Experiments are risky. We can succeed or fail. So, an innovative environment must have an exceptionally high tolerance for mistakes...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        According to Deepak Sethi of AT&T, the organization of tomorrow will actually <em>demand</em> mistakes and failures. We have got to fail faster to learn quicker and succeed sooner." -- <a href="BillBarnett.html">BillBarnett</a>
