        Pair Pair Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="PairPairProgramming.html">PairPairProgramming</a> means two programmers, two machines, one desk, one goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is workplace practice where two programmers work side by side on one machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        One programmer drives, uses the keyboard and mouse, while the other navigates, reviewing each line of code as it is typed in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two programmers switch roles frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PairPairProgramming.html">PairPairProgramming</a> takes the essence of this, attempting to preserve the benefits, better design, fewer bugs, collective code ownership and understanding but preserves the traditional approach of one programmer per machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The approach works well with experienced Pair Programmers who understand the benefits of the Pair Programming approach and who enjoy the process of working together on a single task.
      </p>
      <p>
        When two programmers work on a single task or goal with two machines, sitting at a single desk the pair can quickly switch quickly between traditional pair programming with the driver and navigator on a single machine to split mode where the direction agreed upon, productivity can be gained by using an extra machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples include "you write the CSS, I'll write the HTML" and "Google up the fix for this bug, while I configure the XML file"
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important for the programmers to be able to check in and/or integrate their code often, if not immediately for this approach to be effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers should also always review each others split work as part of the process, reviewing and re-factoring as per the normal pair programming approach to ensure the benefits of Pair Programming are not lost.
