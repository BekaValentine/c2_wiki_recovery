      </h1>
      <p>
        Hanbing Liu graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Texas at Austin in 2006
      </p>
      <p>
        He works at AMD since graduation, verifying and (more recently) designing floating point data path unit.  He also maintains and develops the multiprocessor  coherence/consistency checker and memory model for x86 and arm architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        At UT, he used ACL2 (<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/)">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/)</a> 
        to formalize the JVM and its bytecode verifier. His current focus is on formalizing and proving 
        the correctness of the bytecode verification specification as described in JSR139. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also at UT, he also did some preliminary work in Java program verification by studying 
        the executions of the corresponding bytecode programs on their JVM models.

        I like the mods you did to <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a>. Did you use Usemod 1.0? Is your version available?

        <em>I did some hacks to the 0.92 that comes with Debian.</em>

        <li>
           <em>I changed upload.pl from Andrew Gray <andrew@andrewgray.uklinux.net> so that it posts an entry to the Uploads page</em>

        <li>
           <em>I changed wiki.pl to add an interface for me to write extensions (mostly in Python).</em>

        <em>I should say those are ugly hacks. It will take some efforts to adapt it to some other site. I don't know if someone still want it. I can make it available.</em>
