        "Famous Blue Raincoat" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. So is "Suzanne." Nice stuff. Sometimes funny. Sometimes sad. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Amen. Check out Robert Altman's film "Mc<strong>'Cabe and Mrs. Miller." The soundtrack is all Leonard Cohen."</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Totally agree as to "Famous Blue Raincoat," love the lines
      </p>

        and when she came home she was nobody's wife.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Also love "Suzanne".
      </p>
      <p>
        "...and as covered by Leonard's former back-up singer, Jennifer Warnes, also very beautiful."
