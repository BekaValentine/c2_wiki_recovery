        Naked Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="NakedCode.html">NakedCode</a> is that horrible feeling when you are afraid to reveal code to others because you are afraid of what they will think.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many <a href="ClosetProgrammers.html">ClosetProgrammers</a> stay in the closet too long and do not release their code. What will she think of him when she sees his naked code?
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the programmer comes out of the closet naked, revealing all code, he realizes it isn't that bad. Most users/other developers are happy just to have the code and don't even judge it as much as the programmer originally feared.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at other times, sometimes releasing the code can be partly dreadful <em>in the mind mostly</em> - judgmental, critical, and harsh she is - the other programmers. Usually it is not an <em>entirely</em> dreadful experience in actuality. Humans tend to fear public humiliation greatly, and exaggerate what <em>could</em> happen in their minds.  Some programmers tend to be obsessive compulsive and perfectionist - which doesn't help one bit.  At times the only power that can reveal the naked code is extremely high self esteem and confidence.
