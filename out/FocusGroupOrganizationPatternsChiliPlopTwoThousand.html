        The workshop builds on work we did together in preparation of a book on
        Organisation Patterns and on the results of our workshop at Oopsla '99.

        The series of focus groups on organisation and process patterns was

        <em>Abstract</em>:
        <strong>None of us is as smart as all of us</strong> -- <a href="GeraldWeinberg.html">GeraldWeinberg</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some software organizations serve their customers well, they deliver on
        time, deliver a profit to the stockholders and build a supporting
        workplace for the team. And
        some don't. Quality of the result of our efforts depends on the quality
        of communication between users, customers and developers, designers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patterns help us understand existing organizations. Patterns have
        everything to do with transferring knowledge. They are often associated
        with reuse. They provide transfer of concept, insights, and information.. Our software projects don't span generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we need short cuts, getting teams together that are able of learning
        and sharing a common language in a short time.
        A good pattern language for organization should give us both the means
        of expression and the freedom to tailor the solution to the particular
        environment and context of application of the patterns.
