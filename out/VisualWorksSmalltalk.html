        As stated near the bottom, VW 7 and up have the Refactoring Browser as the core browser.

        <em>I prefer 3.0 to 5i because the browsers work better. The 5i browser had to be completely redone and still has some problems. Moreover, the Refactoring Browser doesn't work yet for 5i. 5i has a lot of neat features, but I get the feeling that it is still beta software when I use it.</em>

        [re: VWNC5i] Does anyone else find the namespaces unintuitive? I spent 20 minutes today trying to find a class I had just added. I couldn't take it. Now I'm looking at Squeak. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        Just switch to 3.0. And download the <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a>. All will be well. --<a href="AnthonyLander.html">AnthonyLander</a>

      <p>
        Um, did you try "Find...". Finds any class in any namespace quite nicely. For that matter, use "Browse All Classes" and get a list by category irrespective of namespace. -- <a href="AlanKnight.html">AlanKnight</a>

        <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> works good with <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> 7.0, which also has non-commercial version. The whole environment was also improved and now looks better. Connectivity tools in <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> 7.0 shine. Notable addition is full support of <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>. OpenTalk framework seems very promising to me -- <a href="PavelPerikov.html">PavelPerikov</a>

        Are there any quickstart guides to VW? I'm playing with OpenTalk at the moment and there is a total of <strong>ONE</strong> useful example on the whole bloody damned web about it. The only guide I found was for 5i and starts by telling you to click on the OpenTalk Launcher, which doesn't exist as far as I can tell. And the PDF only works as an intro to the subject in general and reference, not a guide per se. This is endemic to all serious frameworks and tools near as I can tell. (Oh, and I know Cincom's <em>planning</em> to make quickstart guides but I'm not long on patience.) -- RK
