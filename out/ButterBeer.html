        Butter Beer
      </h1>
      <p>
        The frothy, buttery drink served in the wizard town of Hogsmeade in the <a href="HarryPotter.html">HarryPotter</a> books -- a favorite of <a href="HarryPotter.html">HarryPotter</a> and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some recipes:
      </p>
      <p>
        Ingredients:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Root Beer Soda
        </li>
        <li>
           Butter
        </li>
        <li>
           Cream 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Directions:
      </p>
      <p>
        Place 1/4 cube of butter in a microwave-safe bowl and melt it. Pour Root Beer soda into a tall microwave-safe glass and heat on 50% for 30 seconds or as needed so it is moderately warm. (Warning: If it is warmed too much, it won't be fizzy or taste good.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Pour 1 teaspoon of melted butter into the Root Beer a little at a time, stirring constantly. After butter and Root Beer is well blended, gently add a little bit of cream and stir. It may take a few times to determine the amount of butter and cream needed to make the perfect-tasting <a href="ButterBeer.html">ButterBeer</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        OR
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           12 fluid ounces of root beer OR cream soda (for American readers, 1 can) 
        </li>
        <li>
           1 tablespoon of honey 
        </li>
        <li>
           2 teaspoons of butter 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Directions:
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 1: Place root beer (or cream soda) into a microwave-safe glass and heat in microwave for about 30 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2: Remove root beer (or cream soda) and sit aside while you place butter into microwave long enough to melt it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 3: Now, add your warm root beer (or cream soda), melted butter and honey to the blender and blend for 5-10 seconds. (We recommend 5 as going past this may remove all the fizziness from your root beer (or cream soda) and it just won't taste the same!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 4: Enjoy!
      </p>

        <em>Reading this, it looks kind of sickening.</em>

        <strong>I agree. Then again, there are those who might say that about the entire </strong><a href="HarryPotter.html">HarryPotter</a> series ;) There's no accounting for taste.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think that I'll be ready to eat anything for a few hours after reading that, thank you...
        sounds good:)
      </p>
      <p>
        It does sound gross. Butter and soda?! Never tried that before. Kinda thought butterbeer was just a name for something nice to drink...didn't think it really contained butter. So how does it taste like, anyone tried it? Like some kinda smoothie or milkshake?
