        Yogi Berra
      </h1>

        Yogi had a way of making a tautology informing. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It ain't over til it's over.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not to mention contradictions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If people won't come to the ballpark you can't stop them.
        </li>
        <li>
           Never answer an anonymous letter.
        </li>
        <li>
           Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.
        </li>
        <li>
           (loosely quoted) You should attend funerals, because if you don't go to people's funerals, they won't go to yours.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On decision-making:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When you come to a fork in the road, take it.
        </li>
      </ul>
