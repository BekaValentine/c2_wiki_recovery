        ASP based on <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> and <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a>, has a unique difference engine. It is also XML based.  Released under a BSD license, developed by Laurens Pitt.

           The project appears to be dead. The developer(s) appear to be unreachable. Hopefully someone will fork this very interesting wiki.

        On trying an edit, got "Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e14' 
      </p>
      <p>
        The conflict occurred in database '<a href="OpenWiki.html">OpenWiki</a>', table 'openwiki_attachments'.

      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There has been a fix for this problem: attachment revisions mess up database relational integrity, at least in SQL Server.

        The implementation of <a href="OpenWiki.html">OpenWiki</a> is pretty interesting. Heavy use of XSL and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really like the formatting rules for <a href="OpenWiki.html">OpenWiki</a>. It seems extremely slow, though. Does anyone know any tips for speeding it up? Every page load seems to take several seconds, even with no load on the servers.

           I initially had some speed issues when I ran it on my dev machine with SQL etc, but it runs great on a real server.

        I've experienced the same problem with <a href="OpenWiki.html">OpenWiki</a>'s performance. We have 288 pages and 1713 revisions. I'm going to explore the indices with SQL Server's performance tool.  -- Daniel Tremblay

        what should we do to guard against people's inappropriate use of wiki?

           It polices itself: you need <a href="GoodWikiCitizen.html">GoodWikiCitizen</a> 's though. See: <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>. Also, with <a href="OpenWiki.html">OpenWiki</a>, you can see ALL versions through the links at the bottom of the page, so nothing is ever lost (barring an incompetent admin).

        The community has pretty much disappeared over the past six months.  Additionally, there's been a discovery of a major problem with the original code base which means the entire application needs reworked.  Not sure anyone is going to take up the project though - head over there and do it if you're interested!

        <em>Care to elaborate on (or provide link to additional resource regarding) this "major problem" you mention?</em>
