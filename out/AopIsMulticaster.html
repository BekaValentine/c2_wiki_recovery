        Aop Is Multicaster
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's just the static binding version. Annotations are just a flat and boring <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a> Address space. Interceptors are just a local-address-limited version of <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a> Agents. AOP is just a dumbed down <a href="PublishAndSubscribe.html">PublishAndSubscribe</a>. And AOP boffins are just selling another case of <a href="OldWineInNewBottles.html">OldWineInNewBottles</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not quite: a <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a> architecture makes explicit the relationships between publishers and subscribers.  Publishers must explicitly announce an event; subscribers must explicitly register for events.
      </p>
      <p>
        AOP hides those relationships.  When looking at a piece of code, there's no way of knowing what events are multicast and where those events go without looking at all the aspects of the system.  Therefore you need a lot of support from your development tools to make sense of the system.
