        A gem of a little program, which allows someone to type in a code or abbreviation and have it expand into any text desired.  An example of how I use it in <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           .1. expands to mysql_query(
        </li>
        <li>
           .2. expands to or die(mysql_error());
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An example of how I use it with support email:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           .sig. expands to my signature
        </li>
        <li>
           .blowoff. expands to:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hi %PROMPT:Name%,
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for taking the time to express your opinion. We are always looking for ways to improve our service, and I assure you that we will give your suggestion its due consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that the .blowoff. text is only for the most obnoxious and condescending of emails that we receive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do other programmers use it?  It's been a productivity boon for me in a lot of ways.
