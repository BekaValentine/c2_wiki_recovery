        I find the dearth of colleagues comfortable with even intermediate programming theory more unsettling than the dearth of magazines into the same. Who needs another magazine about "How to Stomp the Bugs out of <monopolistic vendor>'s Latest API"? You can get that on USENET... But another article about "Why Assertions Are Good and Typecasts Are Bad"? I'd pay for that just to prime my own ammunition. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        I am interested in the knowledge with the widest possible scope. In a magazine like C++ Report, that means <a href="LanguageLawyer.html">LanguageLawyer</a>-nuts-and-bolts, <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, and wide-scope solutions. From my point of view, the <a href="LanguageLawyer.html">LanguageLawyer</a> articles are <em>exactly</em> what C++ report should be doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MicrosoftFoundationClasses.html">MicrosoftFoundationClasses</a> articles may be nice, and may even apply to my job today (although I hope they don't), but they may not apply to my job tomorrow. Why would one invest in knowledge so narrow that it limits you to a specific and volatile ecological niche? Don't become a specialty feeder; the fossil record is full of specialty feeders that couldn't adapt to calamity. The <a href="LanguageLawyer.html">LanguageLawyer</a> knowledge will apply no matter what <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> job I get, and the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> and wide-scope solutions will apply no matter what language I program in. In any case, the domain-specific stuff can be picked up pretty easily if you have a solid background in the fundamentals.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're doing <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and you are afraid of learning and exploiting its power, change languages. C++ is a radioactive language, and it's only worth the danger if you have the skill to pull out the control rods and let the language go critical. Otherwise, all you get is radiation without much power.

        And as a confirmed academic, I often look at the articles and think they're covering things that were <em>abandoned</em> years ago (<a href="AutomatedCodeGeneration.html">AutomatedCodeGeneration</a> from object diagrams? how '91... [see <a href="ClassDiagram.html">ClassDiagram</a>?]). Producing a pratical programming magazine is a tough job. Look at what happened to the Communications of the ACM when they tried; they went from ground-breaking articles that blended theory and practice to gee-whiz-isn't-this-cool articles. They thought any mention of theory would kill them, so they committed suicide. Then there's <a href="DrDobbsJournal.html">DrDobbsJournal</a>, which tends to contain snippets of almost interesting ideas but with little to no unification. I loved it in <a href="HighSchool.html">HighSchool</a>, but then I outgrew most of it. To me, the <a href="CppReport.html">CppReport</a> is one of the best pragmatic magazines out there. <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is not far behind the cutting edge (in terms of theoretical research) of fully compiled, <a href="StaticallyTyped.html">StaticallyTyped</a> languages. The magazine does a good job of blending a touch of theory with actual use, often bridging the <a href="DifferenceBetweenTheoryAndPractice.html">DifferenceBetweenTheoryAndPractice</a>. -- <a href="JasonRiedy.html">JasonRiedy</a>

        We all know what happened to <a href="ByteMagazine.html">ByteMagazine</a>.

        The thing that gets me is that there doesn't seem to be a good language-independent magazine covering software design and engineering issues other than <a href="DrDobbsJournal.html">DrDobbsJournal</a>. I'd like to see articles about <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>, Patterns, <a href="ActiveObjectModel.html">ActiveObjectModel</a>s, <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a>, <a href="ValueObjectHypotheses.html">ValueObjectHypotheses</a>, <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s, etc. <a href="CppReport.html">CppReport</a> has done a good job of stepping into that realm a bit. I love the language-specific stuff, but there is a lot which falls between the cracks. -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

        I always thought <a href="JournalOfObjectOrientedProgramming.html">JournalOfObjectOrientedProgramming</a> was a good language-independent magazine.
