        <dd>[....] Concurrent Pascal is an abstract programming language for computer operating systems.  The language extends sequential Pascal with the <em>monitor</em> concept for structured concurrent programming.  Compilation of Concurrent Pascal on a minicomputer is done by dividing the compiler into 7 sequential passes.  The passes, written in sequential Pascal, generate virtual code that can be interpreted on any 16-bit minicomputer.  It has been running on a [DEC] PDP-11/45 computer at Caltech since January 1975.(Hartman 1977)</dd>

        Under <em>Further Work</em> (p. 68--69), Hartman criticizes the removal of <em>classes</em> from "sequential Pascal" as a "mistake": "The compilers would probably be smaller and simpler if they were written with classes."  Although his conclusion about compiler-implementation is sensible, his criticism about language-design is puzzling.  Classes are an object-oriented feature pioneered by <a href="SimulaLanguage.html">SimulaLanguage</a>; no such feature is documented in published sources on <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>, whether as a tentative feature later abandoned, or even as a feature intended for some other keyword or syntax[1].  Perhaps the criticism is to the Caltech "sequential Pascal" compiler, which was apparently <em>not</em> based at all on the Pascal-P "implementation kit" of early 1973, thus a "from scratch" effort that'd be amenable to any language extensions that nonpurist implementors could devise.

        [1] It wouldn't be <em>too</em> surprising if despite the absence of documentation for a (hypothetically) once-intended <em>class</em> feature in <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>, the original implementors of that WirthLanguage were gradually soured on it.  Consider some ambiguities, <em>ad hoc</em> solutions, and other vexations that survived:
