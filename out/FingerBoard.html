        Finger Board
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>The </em><a href="FingerBoard.html">FingerBoard</a> combines the functions of a standard keyboard, mouse, and multi-hand and multi-finger gesture in a single device that's not much bigger than a regular keyboard.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The familiar operations of typing, pointing, and clicking are combined seamlessly with multi-finger gesture in the same overlapping area of the <a href="FingerBoard.html">FingerBoard</a>'s surface. With the <a href="FingerBoard.html">FingerBoard</a> you never have to reach for the mouse - it's always under your fingertips. Switching between typing, mouse, and gesture is effortless and does not require you to move your hands or to input any special commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="FingerBoard.html">FingerBoard</a> was also designed to reduce the strain and injury associated with <a href="CarpalTunnelSyndrome.html">CarpalTunnelSyndrome</a> (aka repetitive strain injury or RSI). But the <a href="FingerBoard.html">FingerBoard</a> provides a lot more than safer computing. In addition to its ergonomic attributes, the <a href="FingerBoard.html">FingerBoard</a> gives you unprecedented control of graphical objects while providing you with the same functionality of the keyboard and mouse. The <a href="FingerBoard.html">FingerBoard</a> allows you to sit back in your chair and have complete control of your computer.

        Has anybody noticed how much it looks like the keyboard in <a href="TronMovie.html">TronMovie</a> (part of the badguys desk)?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It also looks a lot like the current round of </em><a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> (TNG, DS9, Voyager) control panels.<em></em>

        I, for one, would not like to type on a keyboard that doesn't give tactile feedback. -- <a href="MichaelSchuerig.html">MichaelSchuerig</a>

        I feel the same way. But they also have a version that is integrated into a normal keyboard. The ability to control with gestures from your hands/fingers seem really powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If they just made a version that fitted on the </em><a href="KinesisKeyboard.html">KinesisKeyboard</a> (there should be plenty of space in the middle), it would be perfect.<em></em>
