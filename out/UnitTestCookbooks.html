        >How do you invoke the unit tests?...
      </p>
      <p>
        It depends on your environment:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Java using JDK/emacs/bash/make
        </li>
        <li>
           Java using <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Python
        </li>
        <li>
           C++ using <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ApacheAnt.html">ApacheAnt</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Java using JDK/emacs/bash/make</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I use <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> for my unit tests.  For a class Foo, its source is in Foo.java.
        Its unit test lives in a separate class, with the source in TestFoo.java.  A
        command line invokes the unit test, in either console mode or with a GUI.  I
        use the console mode tester:
      </p>
      <code>
        java junit.textui.TestRunner TestFoo<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I build an "all-in-one" test suite for a package, which runs all of the unit
        tests in the package.  It's called TestAll.  This is usually the test I run
        when working on the package.
      </p>
      <p>
        I add a rule like this to my makefile:
      </p>
      <code>
        test: TestAll.class<br/>
        java junit.textui.TestRunner TestAll<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        when I run "make test", Test<em></em>'All.class gets built (through another rule) and
        then junit is run with the standard command-line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I have Emacs up for editing, and a command window (bash) open for
        compiling and testing.  The cycle is: edit, switch to command window, enter
        "make test" (or control-p and enter, the bash keys for "execute previous
        command"), and see what happens.  When using <a href="JikesCompiler.html">JikesCompiler</a> to compile this is a
        <em>very</em> fast cycle -- As fast as a few seconds.  I work hard to achieve this
        velocity for coding and testing because my experience shows that very fast
        test cycles encourage me to make very small edits, which makes all problems
        smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Java using </strong><a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I use <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> as above, but no emacs, make, or bash (<a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> substitutes its
        own
        ponderous bureauracracy for the productivity of my beloved tools).  Because
        I have no make file, I add a main to TestAll which does exactly what the
        command line for invoking junit does (except that in this environment I use
        the GUI test runner, not the console one):
      </p>
      <code>
        public static void main (String[] args)<br/>
        {<br/>
        junit.ui.TestRunner.main (new String[] {"TestAll"} );<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This lets me run the test by clicking on the silly little "running man"
        button on the toolbar (just what is he running from?).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Python</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I use <a href="PythonUnit.html">PythonUnit</a>.  If I have a file "foo.py," then I have a "test_foo.py" which
        contains the unit tests.  I mark test_foo.py as executable and put the
        python hash-bang at the top of the first line so I can invoke the test by
        just entering the filename at the command-line:
      </p>
      <code>
        test_foo.py<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I get test turnaround cycle times even faster than
        with my command-line Java environment because I don't need to compile first.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have yet to try making the <a href="PythonUnit.html">PythonUnit</a> equivalent of my java "Test<em></em>'All" which
        invokes all unit tests, but I don't expect it to be very hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. C++ using </strong><a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't done this for a few years.  It was a fairly successful environment
        for me, but very high discipline was required due to the rigors of
        design-by-contract.  I also never liked having all those asserts -- I
        routinely ended up with small methods that had 14 lines of asserts and 3
        lines of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> involves lots of asserts splattered throughout the code
        to check preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.  If I had a class
        Foo, it would live in a file Foo.cpp.  The unit test would be in the same
        file, but between #ifndef statements to make the unit test go away when the
        program was compiled for production:
      </p>
      <code>
        #ifndef NDEBUG<br/>
        void testFoo() {...}<br/>
        #endif<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Foo {...}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There was a master test unit (Test.cpp) which contained a single method
        called
        "selfTest" which invoked ALL of the unit tests in all of the files
        in the program.  Finally, the main
        method of my program would invoke that master unit test as the first thing
        that
        the program did:
      </p>
      <code>
        int main (int argv, char * argv[]  )<br/>
        {<br/>
        #ifndef NDEBUG<br/>
        selfTest();<br/>
        #endif<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This caused the self test to run every time the program run (unless it were
        compiled
        with NDEBUG defined to produce a production version).  I never decided if
        this was
        a good thing or not.  It sure made me keep the test time short, which is a
        good thing.
        In any case, I have put design-by-contract aside for now to study less
        strenuous
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could have used <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>, but it didn't exist at the time and
        I wasn't smart enough to invent it.

        <em>See </em><a href="UnitTestsDefined.html">UnitTestsDefined</a> for the recipe to keep the test code out of the production code, without extra goodies like *Unit.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. </strong><a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote a file unit.lisp with support functions (they do little other than removing a few small elements which were common to every test file; it's not strictly necessary), and the units I was testing were .lisp files.  For each file to be tested, foo.lisp, I wrote a file foo-test.lisp.  foo-test.lisp started by ensuring that unit.lisp was loaded, then loaded foo.lisp, defined and ran all the tests, printed their success status, and deleted the packages created by foo.lisp and foo-test.lisp.  Thus, using CmuCommonLisp, I could type '(load "foo-test")' to the listener, and the tests would run.
