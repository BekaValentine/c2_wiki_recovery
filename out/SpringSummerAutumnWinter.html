        Seasonal software development practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spring</strong>  A time to learn new things, new ways, in as many fields and areas of knowledge and consciousness as possible.  Books to be read, discoveries to be made, new languages to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Summer</strong> A time to choose a path and follow it.  Take the language or methodology found in the spring and practice.  A time to create, refine, and walk the way.  A time to live, to practice.  To code.  To be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Autumn</strong>  A time to reflect on the things made, the walk coming to an end.  Wrap up the tools and the work and prepare to put it away.  Reflection; where did the path lead?  Am I anywhere different than I was before?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Winter</strong>  A time of deep reflection and solitude spent contemplating the code, the methods, the work.  A time to be with people, to share what I have learned, to give, to love.  To put the way away and prepare for new things.  To start again.
      </p>
      <p>
        A year's time, a day's time, a project's time.  For everything a season.
