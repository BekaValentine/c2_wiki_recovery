        Ifdeffed Test Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        Years ago I started writing tests in the same file
        as the code they were testing, under ifdefs
      </p>
      <code>
        foo.c:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        int bar() { return 22; }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        #ifdef TEST<br/>
        int main() {<br/>
        assert( bar() == 22 );<br/>
        }<br/>
        #endif //TEST<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It is pleasant to colocate things like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it often created difficulties with makefiles, since you would have to keep the differently ifdeffed object files separate.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now prefer not to do this.

        Java supports this in a way that is more convenient.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        So do Perl, Python and Ruby.  Their mechanism is basically:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (the running program == this file name)<br/>
        run the tests<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then, to run the tests, simply invoke the module as if it were a program.  You can do this for all modules except the main one.
      </p>

        It's evil because you need to create two libraries, one test, and one not. That's too much overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You don't need to create two libraries -- just create one library with TEST not defined and a </em><a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a> that compiles and executes each of the modules.<em></em>
      </p>

        <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> lets you have the best of both worlds by allowing you to include the tests right in the class body (just like java) and also to exclude them during a Release build, using #ifdefs.  Having used <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> for some time, I find C#'s way much more convenient.

        I'm confused.  Are the things you're #ifdef'ing out assertions (in a <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> sense) or <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s (in a <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a> or at least xUnit sense)?  Or are they something else entirely?

        Assuming this is SelfTestPattern, it is what <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>'s book <em></em><a href="WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode.html">WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode</a><em> calls </em>InVivoTesting. It's very easy to retrofit, and it's harmless in small doses.

        But when featurizing, I (<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>) like to flip back and forth between the test and code files in an editor.
