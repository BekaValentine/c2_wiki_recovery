        Tyranny Of The Or
      </h1>
      <p>
        In "Habits that Block Conversation" (<a href="http://ica-associates.ca/Resources/Articles/habits.cfm)">http://ica-associates.ca/Resources/Articles/habits.cfm)</a> Brian Stanfield states:

        <strong>The Tyranny of the OR</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If ten people are conversing round a <em>(truth?)</em> table, the truth lies not with any one of them, but in the centre of the table, between and among the perspectives of all ten. They are together co-creating what is true (or real) in their situation. This is not good news for the more opinionated among us. In Built to Last, James Collins and Jerry Porras speak of "the tyranny of the OR". 
      </p>
      <p>
        This particular tyranny pushes people to believe that things must be either A OR B, but not both. For example, "You can make progress by methodical process OR by opportunistic groping." "You can have creative autonomy OR consistency and control." Instead of being oppressed by the "tyranny of the OR", visionary organizations liberate themselves with the "genius of the AND" - the ability to embrace a number of dimensions at the same time.

        I thought this was going to be about the Grand Mistake of giving AND a higher precedence than OR. 90% of the time in practice we want OR evaluated first. Somebody skipped practicality 101. F ancient notation.

        <em>Really? I always find conjunctive normal form much less intuitive and harder to get a grip on than disjunctive. Maybe I'm just fooling myself. Need to think this over.</em>
