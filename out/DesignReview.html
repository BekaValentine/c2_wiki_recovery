        Design Review
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Architectural analogy has some bearing here.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Schools of Architecture and in enlightened Practice 'Design Review' is an important part of the process of developing the design for specific projects.
        In the Schools Design Review is usually known by the more dreaded term 'The Crit' (Criticism).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Crit (Design Review) occurs when the student or practitioner has to 'pin up' the developing design work for comment/criticism/review by colleagues, teachers, and peers. In the best crits typical or actual clients are also present and able to give real user/non professional feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Crit is a very public event. For most tyros it starts out as a pretty intimidating process. I once saw an ex-RAF pilot Architectural student suddenly break up in tears over pretty minor comment of what was probably a fairly reasonable scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, those making the presentations gradually learn the rules of engagement and develop the necessary confidence and armour to stand up pretty well for themselves. Repartee, humour, occasional soap-boxing, are all essential ingredients! Some of the best Crits occur at the end of term when everyone has done pretty good work and its time to open the bubbly!

      <p>
        For Engineered Projects, this is a process of checking to determine if conventional and  acceptable design has been used to meet all design requirements. Only then may the project documents be "Released For Construction".
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes the review process is done incrementally by parts.
