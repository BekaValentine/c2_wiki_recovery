        Xp Versus Hacking
      </h1>
      <p>
        So, hacking finally gets respectable! Yeehaa! Ever since hacking as a term was bent to mean only hacking into systems, the uber-geek has not had a respectable, or marketable term for "what the heck it is they do that no-one understands but they let them do it anyway cause it seems to work most times". Extreme Programming it is then. Cool. -- Eric

        <em>Whoah! Slow down for a spell. This ain't </em><a href="CowboyCoding.html">CowboyCoding</a>! .... Sure, if <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> fits your picture of hacking ... call what you like to do <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> ... but I bet you'll find that it's far more disciplined than it seems at first glance. It doesn't look like hacking to me anymore at all. First off, the idea is <strong>not</strong> that no-one understands what is being done. <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>. I think that the more you get into XP, the less like hacking it will seem. XP requires higher discipline than many groups can manage. Give it a go, but I bet you won't feel like you're <strong>hacking</strong>. Unless you're recklessly adding new garbage ignoring refactoring, or testing, or evolving the metaphor, or any of the numerous things that an XP team needs to be <strong>continually</strong> doing <strong>a lot</strong> of. -- <a href="EricHerman.html">EricHerman</a> (different Eric)<em></em>

        Um, isn't that very much like saying ExtremeDriving versus Indy racing?

        <em>Also, try using the word "Cracking" when other people might use the word "hacking" ... maybe other people will start doing the same, and we can remove a little of the stigma from "hacking" .... which should still carry </em>'some<strong> stigma ... but not </strong>that<em>' stigma.</em>
