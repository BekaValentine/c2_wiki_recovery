        Wintek Corp
      </h1>
      <p>
        Wintek was founded by PaulWintz, a Purdue EE professor
        and one-time assistant department head.
      </p>
      <p>
        He hired <a href="GordonLetwin.html">GordonLetwin</a>, <a href="JimBesemer.html">JimBesemer</a>, <a href="HarryChesley.html">HarryChesley</a>,
        <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, DennisLeas, SteveBelter, 
        and others to develop software.
        <a href="JimWilson.html">JimWilson</a>, DanMoss and others worked on hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how many of these folks got involved in the
        Microprocessor Revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually Paul retired and sold the company to <a href="JimWilson.html">JimWilson</a> who merged it with SteveBelter.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while they sold a PC-based CAE package called HiWire,
        which was fairly successful.
