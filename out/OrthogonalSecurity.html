        Orthogonal Security
      </h1>
      <p>
        A concept whose time has long since come. Curiously never been implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security is an orthogonal property of individual objects, exactly like persistence. One achieves orthogonal security in precisely the same way as <a href="TransparentPersistence.html">TransparentPersistence</a>. By building it in at such a low level that programmers never see the damned thing unless they absolutely have to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just because security is orthogonal doesn't mean that a programmer can't go out of their way to screw it up. The same is true of any well-designed orthogonally persistent system. It must be possible for a programmer to disable persistence for certain special applications such as to keep passwords out of permanent storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does orthogonal security entail?
      </p>
      <p>
        It entails pervasive use of the <a href="FacetPattern.html">FacetPattern</a> and the <a href="PrincipleOfLeastPrivilege.html">PrincipleOfLeastPrivilege</a>. Of course, the only way to do that at a low-level, at a level lower than the programmer interacts with, is to put generic and extensible <a href="PermissionFlags.html">PermissionFlags</a> on all capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, nobody has done orthogonal security properly. In fact, there are even some people, much like the trogs who question orthogonal persistence, who question the need for pervasive permissions in a modern secure OS.

        Contrasted and distinct from <a href="OrthogonalSecurity.html">OrthogonalSecurity</a> is <a href="TrustedSystems.html">TrustedSystems</a>.
