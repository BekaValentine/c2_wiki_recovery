        Modem Bound
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ModemBound.html">ModemBound</a> is a phenomena whereby web sites have begun to introduce exclusive HighBandwidth versions or content. <em>(Fortunately Wiki is not one of them.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what does this mean for modem users?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, assuming that the content is mainly additional, ie a .mov of an interview when the transcript would probably be sufficient (and is included), it poses no real problem. However, if the high bandwidth content is integral to the site; naturally the site is cut-off from everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, not many sites have taken this route, those that have tend to be just for fun anyway; The X-Men support site springs to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question really is for how long will dual content be the case?
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as "take me to the html already" links are beginning to become more scarce, so perhaps will the "so sue me, I use a modem" option. It strikes me that authors will want to do this as soon as they consider it possible (when they consider there to be few enough users still using modems interested in their content to have any impact by cutting them off), since obviously it is far more econominally viable to run one site rather than two.

        Which, like a lot of things, brings me back to SimpleIsBetter.

        The modem bound problem might be returning as of 2012, for the simple reason that mobile data rates are way more expensive than land-line internet bandwidth, and thus you have to watch your internet consumption if you don't want to max out your data plan. -- DaNuke

        Until everyone has the appropriate hardware some users will still be cut off. In a few years when everyone has the suitable access medium this won't be an issue, but now, it is. -- <a href="MatthewTheobalds.html">MatthewTheobalds</a>

        If we are eventually charged for bandwidth used rather than for connect time the low bandwidth text-based applications like Wiki will be essentially be free while it will cost actual money to view all the Flash pages.  -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

        I read an analysis (sorry no link or reference) that showed the most popular sites have very lightweight home pages, at least. Take a look at yahoo.com or drudgereport.com. They could be school projects. -- <a href="RobertField.html">RobertField</a>

        High bandwidth allows compelling content. This makes a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        But web publishers didn't abandon 640x480 until the market share dropped below 10%. I expect the same will happen with modems.

        With proper site building technologies, the interface and the content can be almost completely separated. Meaning that a modem and a high-speed version of the site are doable with reasonable ressources. So are multiple resolutions. The problem comes from web designers that think frontpage is the only required software to create web pages.
