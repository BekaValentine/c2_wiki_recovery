        [ISBN: 0201877120] The book is, as it says, in lexicon form, with short sections such as WhatAndHow, <a href="EngineeringEnvy.html">EngineeringEnvy</a>, ObjectOrientedAnalysis and Method with (nonhyper-)links between them.  It would be highly wikiable therefore. If you like this book's concept of problem frames, see also <a href="MichaelJackson.html">MichaelJackson</a>'s latest:

        When we've all learnt as much as we can from practicing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and other lightweight methods of today there will still be value in a few other books on software.  This is one of them in my view.

        Michael deals wittily with our <a href="DisciplineEnvy.html">DisciplineEnvy</a> but makes the case for calling our particular discipline <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a>.  He makes the helpful point that, like physical engineering, it's far too much to expect one individual to be expert in all aspects of our field.  So "I'm a software engineer" is always likely to be pretty contentless.  When people start to say things like "I'm a compiler engineer" we may be getting closer to an appropriate parity with other engineers. But not through pretending that software is not software.

        Dittos for sure.  I am using Jackson's book in my class this semester CS665 Software Engineering I at James Madison University.  The book has a series of "tours" which begin to be defined on page xiii in the preface and they are a good way to get started reading the book.  Since it is a lexicon, it does not necessarily read best in a linear fashion.  More insights per page than any other book except maybe <a href="FredBrooks.html">FredBrooks</a>'s <a href="MythicalManMonth.html">MythicalManMonth</a>. --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>
