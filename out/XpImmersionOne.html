        If you weren't there, you missed out! I expected a lot from this course but it was even better than I expected. The lectures were good, the instructors (<a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>, <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>, <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>, <a href="RobertMartin.html">RobertMartin</a> and his very brilliant fellow <a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a>-ites) were very accessible, and the evening discussions were almost the highlight of the event. I could go on but you'll just have to go to the next Xp Immersion and find out for yourself.

        Well, it took a while for me to get a chance to post, but here goes.  I was at <a href="XpImmersionOne.html">XpImmersionOne</a>, and I had an absolute blast.  It was much more like a seminar or workshop than a straight lecture class.  We had lectures in the mornings, hands-on Xp practice in the afternoon, and bull-sessions led by one of the instructors in the evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the instructors made contributions.  Many of the students did, too.  The actual course materials were semi-irrelevant:  the bottom line was really a) the access to Kent, Ron, Martin, and Bob, and b) the access to each other.  It was absolutely a blast, and I strongly recommend the course to anyone seeking to learn more about Xp, from the horse's, errrr, mouthes.  -- <a href="MichaelHill.html">MichaelHill</a>

        It has taken me a while to respond too... I needed to catch up on the sleep lost with all those late late beer conversations.  I thought the class was excellent as well, but I learned much more from the informal conversations in the evening and in between class.  It was <em>almost</em> like being able to read this really cool book and have the authors and other experts right there to answer questions and give you further insight and advice.  Hmmm... ok, it was exactly like that ;-) -- <a href="AaronHinni.html">AaronHinni</a>

        Hi Aaron !
      </p>
      <p>
        I only made one of those late-night beer sessions but man did we set the software world to rights that night... (Big shout-out to the friendly bartender who supplied us with a few beers and saved us room-service charges...Do you think he reads Wiki) ? --<a href="AlanFrancis.html">AlanFrancis</a>

        It's been about two months since the first XP immersion course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comment sheets that you fill out at the end of a course almost always has rave reviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I attend a course, I like to talk to someone who took the course
        two years ago and ask the question? What did you
        do today that was influenced by that course that you took two years ago??
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, if you are thinking about attending the XP immersion training class,
        there are no two year veterans,  at this time, there is just two month veterans :-)

        It's not every class you take that benefits you every day.  I can make
        that statement about the XP Immersion Training.  Every day, I get
        a little bit of pair time.  Try to force myself to do this Simplest thing
        that could possibly work, and Design by test.
      </p>
      <p>
        I play the planning game to make sure that I am working on the correct task.
        It is useful to hand your manager your stack of stories, and say ?sort
        these please?.

        This has greatly reduced the stress of day to day existence during busy
        times.

      <p>
        It is fun to be hyper-productive!!!!!!!!!!  XP immersion training 
        taught us a series of practices that work together by living through
        the deployment of these practices.
