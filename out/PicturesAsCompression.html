        Pictures As Compression
      </h1>
      <p>
        A picture can be an effective means of compression. Sure, some visual sketches can be open to interpretation and vague, at best. But, some can also tell consistent stories (the <em>same</em> story, even when viewed by many people).
      </p>
      <p>
        The best example that comes to mind is CharlesJosephMinard's chart depicting Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812.  It is described in <a href="EdwardTufte.html">EdwardTufte</a>'s <a href="TheVisualDisplayOfQuantitativeInformation.html">TheVisualDisplayOfQuantitativeInformation</a>.  Once you understand how to read the diagram, it tells a brutal (and unambiguous) story.

        I take 'compression' to refer to reduction in 'information per square inch' in this context.
