        When a lengthy or important page shows up in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> you may wonder what change put it there. You can get a line by line list of differences. Here's how...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Press <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> at the bottom of the page to get the text entry form for the page.
        </li>
        <li>
           Press <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> at the bottom of this page to get the backup copy's entry form.
        </li>
        <li>
           Scroll to the bottom of this page looking for the <strong>Differences</strong> section heading.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Wiki runs a unix <em>diff</em> between the two versions and puts the output, if any, in the <strong>Differences</strong> section. A page authored from only one site won't have a backup copy so you won't find an <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> button. In this case there is nothing to compare.

        Here's an idea: could you put an <A NAME> around the Differences section, such that a script could cause my web browser to go straight to there? -- <a href="GrahamHughes.html">GrahamHughes</a>
