        <strong>Social Dynamics</strong> here refer to the exploration of management practices that can be classified as Sociological in nature. The Dynamics part of this word is adopted due to its links with the GroupDynamics term.

        <strong>A story </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I started this page due to interests in positive <a href="CulturalChange.html">CulturalChange</a>s, hopefully a SeaChange without a tsunami. It is a <a href="WhatAmiDoingAboutIt.html">WhatAmiDoingAboutIt</a> project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have adopted <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>'s characterisation of Studies in Management.(see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management).">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management).</a> The two perspectives are psychological and sociological.
        Both are extremely hard for me, a person more comfortable with formulae and numbers. But I have to try.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So for now I try to equate those two perspectives with "Microeconomics" and "Macroeconomics".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I need a term to draw together patterns of Management behavior within in a organisation. We have <a href="CategoryPsychology.html">CategoryPsychology</a>, we do not have <a href="CategorySociology.html">CategorySociology</a>, and I do not want to draw into the controversies of the Sociological.... stuff that existed before. If there is going to be controversy, I'll start my own, thank you.

        Glad I have found support in APA (American Psychology Association). You can win a competition in "Human and Social Dynamics" 2005 entry. See <a href="http://www.apa.org/science/workplace.html">http://www.apa.org/science/workplace.html</a>

           do a <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> on "Social Dynamics", you will be surprised by the amount of management related sites you will find

        <li>
           the <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> description of <a href="SocialDynamics.html">SocialDynamics</a> has been rejected by me. No I do not want to go that path.

           A good Management research journal was uncovered while Google-ing. You may like it as much as I do.

        Scenario: If a company is planning for <a href="OutSourcing.html">OutSourcing</a>, it is almost impossible for planning activities to be done quickly, and in complete secrecy. Often the morale of staff impacted would be affected. Anyone want to have a go on whether there needs to be great care exercised in respect to Integrity (process) and Dignity (staff)?

        Rescued from <a href="DbasGoneBad.html">DbasGoneBad</a> is the following observation
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This entire exchange, and the page that provoked it (</em><a href="PrevalenceLayer.html">PrevalenceLayer</a>), illustrates a concept called <a href="SocialArchitecture.html">SocialArchitecture</a> that my business partner and I help our clients with. As someone with no dog in this race, the most striking thing about the exchange to me is that we have two technologies and their proponents, each well-grounded and effective in its own right, being used as a hook upon which to hang an argument that has everything to do with human issues and very little to do with technology.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our clients have found that when we work with them to address the <a href="SocialArchitecture.html">SocialArchitecture</a> issues while we simultaneously work the technical issues, the technical issues become much more clear-cut. Here are some <a href="SocialArchitecture.html">SocialArchitecture</a> issues I see at play in this interaction:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Building trust
        </li>
        <li>
           Holding common vision, mission and goals
        </li>
        <li>
           Respecting differences
