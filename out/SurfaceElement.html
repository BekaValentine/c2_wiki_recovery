               <em>Superficial gives answers when you the user are on the outside of an application.</em>

            <li>
               <em>You need to interact with content that is inside the application.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>The element that enables interaction between the inside and outside of an application is most helpfully described as its surface.</em>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The metaphor of surface leaves open the exact means by which a surface manages interaction between user and application, but it is easy to decide whether an application has a surface.<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em> A GUI is evidently a surface, but so is a command-line interface or even a teletype.</em>

        --- <strong>Facets</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A facet is defined as an element. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Each facet element has a fixed attribute that is a Boolean value.</em> 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>When a simple type is defined, you can prevent derivatives of that type from modifying the value of specified facets</em> 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>To prevent modification of a facet, add the fixed attribute to the facet and set its value to true.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Facets can only appear once in a type definition except for enumeration and pattern facets.</em> 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Enumeration and pattern facets can have multiple entries and are grouped together.</em>

        --- <strong>Display of multidimensional data</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A surface chart shows a three-dimensional surface that connects a set of data points. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>A surface chart is useful when you want to find optimum combinations between two sets of data.</em> 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>As in a topographic map, the colors and patterns in a surface chart indicate areas that contain the same range of values. Unlike other chart types, a surface chart does not use colors to distinguish the data series â€” colors are used to distinguish the values instead.</em> 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>To enhance a surface chart, you can change the colors and use transparency to display color bands that are obscured in the back of the chart.</em>
