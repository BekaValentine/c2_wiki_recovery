        Internet Interface

        <em>Any choices for an Internet language?</em> [A what?]
      </p>
      <p>
        The WWW is a horrible bastardization that set UI technology back 30 years, so no (see <a href="ThinClientHasFailed.html">ThinClientHasFailed</a>).  But if I had to pick a favorite, it'd be Python.  I usually end up using PHP though, just because that's what every server supports.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps but at the end of the day maybe the equation chosen was the best choice:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           HTML 
        </li>
        <li>
           Hyperlinks
        </li>
        <li>
           Being able to access any page from a keyword 
        </li>
        <li>
           All the information needed on a page. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Oh, I think the Internet interface was a great choice <em>for its original purpose</em>.  But you don't need a specialized "Internet language" (other than HTML) to disseminate documents and link them together.  Unfortunately, every useful technology eventually outgrows its niche, and so now the net is being used as a generic user interface to all sorts of products: e-commerce, searchable databases, Intranets, fileshares, fanfiction sites, Wikis, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a generic UI, it sucks.  It takes us back to the days of old modal form-fill-in terminals.  Contrary to the original "web" intent, most uses today are highly linearized, forcing a certain sequence of tasks on the user.  Even then, they're ridiculously hard to program for, because HTTP is a stateless protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no support for direct manipulation in the Web, and adding it over HTTP would be a huge burden.  User feedback is slow at best, and non-existent at worst: you can only adapt to user input with a server roundtrip, barring <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and its associated compatibility pitfalls.  There's not even a decent set of UI widgets!  You're limited to HTML forms unless you go the <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> route with all its attendant difficulties.  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>
