        Regular Expression Examples
      </h1>
      <p>
        Generally, <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s are defined in terms of whether a string matches the given <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>, although much more complex variants are certainly in widespread use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Any string containing "a" matches the regex /a/.
        </li>
        <li>
           A string beginning with "a" matches the regex /^a/
        </li>
        <li>
           A string ending with "a" matches the regex /a$/
        </li>
        <li>
           A string s matches the regex /r1r2/ iff there exist substrings s1 and s2 such that s = s1.s2 and s1 matches /r1/ and s2 matches /r2/.
        </li>
        <li>
           A string s matches the regex /r1|r2/ iff either s matches /r1/ or s matches /r2/ (or both).
        </li>
        <li>
           A string s matches the regex /r1*/ iff either s contains the empty string (always true) or s matches /r1(r1*)/ (or of course both).
        </li>
        <li>
           A string s matches the regex /[r1]/ iff s is exactly one character and that character appears in the set r1.
        </li>
        <li>
           To have a ] in the set, place it first.
        </li>
        <li>
           To invert a set, precede it with a ^.
        </li>
        <li>
           Numeric and alphabetic sets may be abbreviated similar to [0-9], [a-z] and [A-Z].
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Here are some more:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           /.*/ matches anything.
        </li>
        <li>
           /colo(u|)r/ matches either "color" or "colour". (This can also be written /colou?r/.)
        </li>
        <li>
           /(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)*(1|3|5|7|9)/ matches all odd positive integers. (Shorter written as /[0-9]*[13579]/. -- <a href="ChristofferHammarstrom.html">ChristofferHammarstrom</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           /(1|)(0(0*)1)*(0*)/ matches all strings of 0s and 1s without two 1s in a row.
        </li>
        <li>
           /0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01]/ matches all valid days of the months with 31 days.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Another example, as in a beer program in <a href="RegXy.html">RegXy</a>, which is an programming language (<a href="EsotericProgrammingLanguage.html">EsotericProgrammingLanguage</a>) with only 2 things, <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s and if/goto commands:

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Syntax:
        Query: LABEL/expr/JUMP_TARGET_ON_MATCH

      <p>
        Change: LABEL/expr/SUBSTITUTE/

        <strong>Example usage of </strong><a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s in Validation<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had great success using <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s in validation routines. They're perfectly suited for those ever changing user requirements like "We can't permit commas, periods or ampersands in field X. The field also has to be between 8 and 12 characters, begin with an S and contain another letter at position 6".
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding this example would give no room for changes, where as a regular expression can be stuck in a database field which can be modified later if necessary. Besides, the code to test the string is much simpler when using a regular expression.
      </p>
      <p>

        A little story from last night's <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> meeting drives home an aspect of <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>. We had two pairs working, and someone from the other pair called out, "What's the name of the 'string ends with' method?" I called back, "You want regular expression matching. Stick a dollar sign at the end." Well, they pored through the String API docs to discover that there's no built-in method for determining whether a string ends with a given substring. I called out, "Python has such a thing; Ruby does not. Use a regular expression, and stick a dollar sign at the end."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, my pair and I needed to test whether a filename ended with a particular extension. If we were working in <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> we would have written
      </p>
      <code>
        fname.endswith('.txt')<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This would return True or False. In <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> we did a <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> match:
      </p>
      <code>
        fname =~ /\.txt$/<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This returns the index of where the match starts, or nil if there's no match. (In Ruby, nil is false and a number -- even the number 0 -- is true.) We joked that we could write a String#endswith method and sell it to the other pair.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moral of the story is, <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> handling isn't built in to <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> just as a convenience; you're actually expected to <em>use</em> regexes, even for common things like an "ends with" test.
