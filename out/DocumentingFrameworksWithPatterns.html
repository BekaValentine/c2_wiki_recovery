        One of the earliest papers
        on patterns and pattern languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a> framework itself was ``invented<em></em>
        (in the words of <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>)
        by <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> and <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>.
        (Does this make Ralph a <a href="MercenaryAnalyst.html">MercenaryAnalyst</a>?-)
      </p>
      <p>
        Each pattern starts with a motivation,
        a description of what's going on,
        and a prescription for the next design and coding activity.
        The patterns
        (really, the prescriptions at the end of each pattern)
        are:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Semantic Graphic Editors:</strong>
        To design a drawing editor using <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a>,
        first list the atomic elements of the diagram.
        Each one will be a subclass of Figure.
        Decide whether the drawing needs to be animated.
        List the tools that will be in the palette
        and make a subclass of Drawing Editor with a "tools" method
        that returns an array of the tools making up the palette.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Defining Drawing Elements:</strong>
        Each drawing element in a <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a> application
        is a subclass of Figure,
        and must implement
        "displayOn:", "origin", "extent", and "translateBy:".
        In addition,
        a subclass of Figure can implement
        any method needed by the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Changing drawing element attributes:</strong>
        List the attributes of the drawing element
        that you want to edit.
        For each attribute,
        decide whether to edit it with a handle,
        an operation from the menu,
        or a tool,
        and update the "handles" method,
        the "menu" method,
        or the list of tools in the drawing editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Complex Figures:</strong>
        Complex Figures should be a subclass of Composite Figure,
        and figures that display one of its aspects
        should be a component of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Constraints:</strong>
        Each constraint in a drawing
        should be represented by a constraint object.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Making new kinds of handles:</strong>
        A handle that changes only an aspect of its figure
        when it is dragged
        is an instance of Track Handle.
        A handle that changes an aspect of all the selection figures
        when it is dragged
        is an instance of Selection Track Handle.
        A handle that creates a line
        from its figure to another figure
        is a Connection Handle.
        Handles that perform other functions
        will need to be new subclasses of Handle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Embedding a drawing in another program:</strong>
        Make a drawing part of a complex application
        by making a Drawing View be a subview of the application's view
        and giving the Drawing View a model
        that responds to Drawing Editor protocol,
        i.e., that implements the
        "currentTool", "menu", "drawing", and "drawing:" methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tools:</strong>
        The "tools" method of the Drawing Editor
        defines the tools that will be on the palette
        by returning an ordered collection of tools,
        which are instances of subclasses of Tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Animated drawings:</strong>
        Animate a drawing by making a subclass for it
        that defines the "step" method
        to perform the next step in the animation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Adding lines:</strong>
        The user should create lines that connect figures
        by pressing a Connection Handle
        on one of the figures.
        Connection Handles can be parameterized
        so that connecting two figures with a line
        can perform some other action on them
        as well as adding a constraint
        or testing whether a connection is allowed.
