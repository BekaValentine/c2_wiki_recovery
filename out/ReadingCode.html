        Reading Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        What do you get from reading other programmers' code?
      </p>
      <p>
        I find reading other people's code is like reading their mind, a little. You see how they approach problems, what they value most in a solution, how much they think of <a href="TheNextGuy.html">TheNextGuy</a>, so on.

        Of course, it's also a little bit like looking at mathematical proofs: you have no idea of the process gone through to arrive at the final product. (It's only recently that I've understood this. When taught proofs in school, it was approached as if the proof was so obvious that it just popped into existence - there was no mention of the struggle and dead ends encountered on the way. I need to revisit math proofs again, Some Day.)

        <a href="BeautyIsOurBusiness.html">BeautyIsOurBusiness</a> talks a lot about something else I find when reading code. Admittedly, my own code appeals to me most, because of the deep insight I have of its instantiation. But when I see beauty in someone else's code, it's a startling thing, like an epiphany.
