        Project Cancellation Junctures
      </h1>
      <p>
        (Probably should be renamed ProjectTerminationJunctures)
      </p>
      <p>
        The wise software development manager plans for failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cancellation Junctures are explicit points in a project where no-go or stop options are executed in planned, orderly, and deliberate manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are arguably several types of cancellation junctures:
      </p>
      <code>
        - Project cancellation junctures<br/>
        - Project element cancellation junctures<br/>
        - People termination junctures<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Is this a way of saying that each "juncture" is a go/no-go decision point in the life of the project? How is that different from, say, a milestone-based delivery contract with functionality/fee milestones? That's the way I do all of my contracts these days. Each milestone comes at a certain date and promises delivery of tested, known good functionality. The client can then proceed with the project or stop development at that point. Isn't that the same thing?</em>
