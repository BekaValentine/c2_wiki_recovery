        Rescuing Broken Links
      </h1>
      <p>
        It would be really excellent if links never got broken, but they do. Cite a page, and the next day the owner of the site hosting it moves it. Copying the contents is anathema to <a href="GoodProgrammer.html">GoodProgrammer</a>s and those who care about respecting authorship. How can we prevent <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>s?
      </p>
      <p>
        You can't, but here is a simple idea to help not prevent, but to enable the <em>rescuing</em> of broken links. If, whenever a page is cited, the person citing it takes the time to find and quote an unusual phrase from it, then the original will most likely be findable by a search engine, even if it gets moved. It may even be findable by using the <a href="WaybackMachine.html">WaybackMachine</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the phrase quoted is pertinent, this also has the beneficial side-effect of enabling a casual reader to decide if the page is likely to be interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, I'm tired of marking potentially interesting references with the tag <em></em><a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a><em> ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Please continue to do so, a recruitment is underway to to encourage a project to correct pages where </em><a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>s are found, making them Updated Pages.<em> -- </em><a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>
      </p>

        [Note that this last annotation was made in 2011. The current year is 2014, and no such project has taken form. Broken links need to be quashed by hand, apparently.]
