      <ul>
        <li>
           Hire only the top 5% performers that are personally known to you, or referred by a top 5%er that you trust. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Have a chief architect plan the software architecture very carefully, such that there is minimal coupling between work units (say, UML packages). 
        </li>
        <li>
           Have the chief architect match the work units to the specific skill sets and experience of the SP staff. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Have all of your SP programmers work from home, where they will not be disturbed, unless they explicitly request to work in a common facility. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Limit status reports to half a page, sent via E-mail, once a week. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Have your SPers bring in incremental builds for testing when they decide they are ready. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Restrict communication between SP developers to E-mail and phone, on an as-needed basis. Never bring all of the programmers into the same room at the same time except during integration testing, and then only those whose code is directly involved. 
        </li>
      </ul>

        N.B. this isn't presented as a <em>serious</em> alternative to XP, but more in the spirit of a <a href="StrawMan.html">StrawMan</a> argument.

        Has this been tried?  I wonder especially about the WorkFromHome part, because this would make me unmotivated, I guess.

        What do we do with the 95% of the programmers not suitable for SP?  <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>?

      <p>
        It doesn't matter in SP since they can never be productive anyway?
