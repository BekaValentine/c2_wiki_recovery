        Linear Types
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="LinearTypes.html">LinearTypes</a> are types whose instances must be held in LinearVariables. LinearVariables must be accessed exactly once in their scope; linear objects' reference count is always exactly 1. This allows them to avoid synchronisation and garbage collection; for the same reason, in-place update of linear objects is also referentially transparent. Linear objects are ideal for representing non-shareable resources; for example, I/O streams. Since it makes little sense to have multiple readers or writers active simultaneously, the stream can be modeled as a linear object. Other examples include hardware resources in a reflective system, such as the CPU or heap.

        See also <a href="OnMonads.html">OnMonads</a>. A monad and a linear type address the same problem in <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>. (Monoids in <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> are the source of inspiration.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Functional programming is based on the mathematical definition of a function, a map from a domain to a range. For each element <em>x</em> in the domain, there is one, only one, and always the same one corresponding element <em>y</em>. Mutable state in a programming language usually ruins the mathematical notion of a function. If a function <em>f</em> is based on mutable state, then <em>x</em> may map to <em>y1</em> when the program is in state <em>t1</em> and then may map to <em>y2</em> when the program is in state <em>t2</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linear types and monads (<a href="OnMonads.html">OnMonads</a>) are mechanisms to enforce a linear view of mutable state. A function can pass the <em>global state</em> to the functions it depends on. It can also return the <em>global state</em> as part of its result. If it wants to modify that state, it simply substitutes a different <em>global state</em>. The <em>global state</em> is part of the domain and the range, and it may be changed by substitution rather than mutation. This is still the mathematical notion of a function.
      </p>
      <p>
        For efficiency, a function can mutate the <em>global state</em> it received rather than  substitute a different <em>global state</em> if and only if it can prove that no other function will be able to detect that a mutation occurred instead of a substitution. Linear types and monads are mechanisms to perform such a proof by type checking at compile time, and at the same time eliminate the need for each function to always pass and return the <em>global state</em> explicitly.
      </p>
      <p>
        What about a monad on the category of functions with linear types (rather than a monad on the category of sets)?

        I'm a bit confused about LinearVariables - above, it is asserted that they hold the <em>only</em> pointer to their referent (a bit like RestrictedPointers in C9X), and so avoid the need for <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>. However, <a href="HenryBaker.html">HenryBaker</a> also discusses the use of LinearVariables in an otherwise normal LISP, in an attempt to make <a href="ReferenceCounting.html">ReferenceCounting</a> more efficient in "Minimizing Reference Count Updating with Deferred and Anchored Pointers for Functional Data Structures" (<a href="http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/LRefCounts.html).">http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/LRefCounts.html).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context, LinearVariables can point to shared objects, but can themselves be used exactly once. Are we sure this is not the case in a fully-linear language?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the semi-linear LISP, there are two handy functions which aren't otherwise needed: dup, which duplicates a variable, so it can be used twice, and kill, which reads a variable but does nothing with the value (linear variables must be read <em>exactly</em> once - not zero times).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the requirement for exactly one read has implications for conditional structures; both arms of an if-else must use exactly the same variables.

        <dd><em>A </em>LinearVariable is a reference that can be used only once. As such, it's never any more useful to the programmer than having an ordinary variable pointing to the same thing. So, you wouldn't normally be any point in having a LinearVariable pointing to a shared object - except for <a href="HenryBaker.html">HenryBaker</a>s cunning optimizations involving reference counting. A LinearObject is something which is guaranteed referred to only by a single LinearVariable. kill and dup apply to both: killing a LinearVariable pointing to a shared object does nothing (well, it cancels the deferred refcount increment); killing a LinearVariable pointing to a LinearObject free()s up the object. dup() on a LinearVariable pointing to a shared object probably just creates a second LinearVariable (with a 2nd deferred refcount increment); dup() on one pointing to a LinearObject would have to copy the LinearObject so that there were now two of them in memory. Which is plausible if it was small/identifiable, but not if it were the entire state of the computer....--AlanLawrence<em></em></dd>

        Linear form is a bit like the inverse of <a href="StaticSingleAssignmentForm.html">StaticSingleAssignmentForm</a> - in SSA, variables are assigned to exactly once, whereas in linear form, they are read from exactly once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linear typing enforces single reading from the variable in a particular scope. The concept should be extended to multiple reads from the variable in the scope. Any idea , Janjua

        The variable must be read exactly once, but the value may be used more than once. Declarative/functional/SSA languages, are capable of handling this nicely. Where redefinition shadows the old definition, we get a handy syntax that mimics that of assignment. So you end up with a brand new linear variable ready to be read from exactly once, without having to introduce a new name into your code for each intermediate definition. <a href="CleanLanguage.html">CleanLanguage</a> in particular, allows for pretty elegant use of linear types like this (it calls them <a href="UniquenessTypes.html">UniquenessTypes</a> or <a href="UniqueType.html">UniqueType</a><strong>'s). The point linear typing in programming languages is to ensure that references don't diverge from a linear usage, so you can safely push them as far as linear typing will allow. They represent the synchronous nature of safe resource manipulation, in a way that can be enforced at compile time.</strong>
