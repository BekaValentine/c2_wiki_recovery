        Standing On The Shoulders Of Midgets

        <strong>Type</strong>: Design | Organizational 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>: You're working in an organization that dictates that you reuse code in libraryX to solve the problem you're working on.  Looking at this API, you find a jumbled mess of cluttered concepts and weird hacks, or it doesn't do half of what you want it to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>: This pattern can show up not just with code libraries, but also with general architectures and databases.  For example, the organization might be using a hand rolled messaging system with various limitations, or a hand rolled database with peculiar semantics, or a complicated/convoluted/contorted project management methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hubris: The developer/manager/owner of libraryX wants everyone to use it, regardless of how bad it is.  They wrote the library, and you better use it!
        </li>
        <li>
           Laziness: Its too much work to change libraryX, and besides, everyone who uses it would have to change as well, so just go through the gynmastics and stop complaining!
        </li>
        <li>
           Fear: We don't know what could happen if you change libraryX, and we're afraid of what might happen if you do.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Supposed Solution</strong>:  Go through the code gymnastics to set up arguments to libraryX as it wants them
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context</strong>:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You end up feeling dirty about the code you wrote to interface with libraryX.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Seductive forces:  Code reuse is a good thing, right?  Re-inventing the wheel is a bad thing, yes? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Why, despite the seductiveness, this is actually a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>: 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Your code ends up being difficult to understand and maintain
            </li>
            <li>
               Strong coupling between your code and the libraryX code 
            </li>
            <li>
               Further entrenchment of libraryX as an essential library for everyone to use
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Replacement positive patterns:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>: Refactor out the ugliness from the public API to libraryX
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="AdapterPattern.html">AdapterPattern</a>: Write an adaptor around the public API to libraryX that hides the ugliness.  Possibly introduce this adaptor into the library so other people can easily reuse it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Design Rationale</strong>: Midget libraries can evolve in all sorts of ways. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The public API was poorly thought out
        </li>
        <li>
           When the code started to smell, no refactoring was done
        </li>
        <li>
           ...others?
        </li>
      </ul>
