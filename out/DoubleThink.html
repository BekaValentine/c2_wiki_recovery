        Double Think

      <p>
        The ability to hold two mutually contradictory ideas in mind simultaneously. And believe both of them. A key skill for a Party member in <a href="GeorgeOrwell.html">GeorgeOrwell</a>'s <a href="NineteenEightyFour.html">NineteenEightyFour</a>.

        Wave vs Particle <em>So are physicists trying to brainwash us?</em> - No, but in this case physicists <em>are</em> carrying some difficult classical baggage to a world where it doesn't apply.  See <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>.

        Free will vs determinism  <em>A fundamental philosophical debate. You can argue it without being a Party member.</em>

        <em>Why is this contradictory? If I need the thing (that is, there is no option not to buy at all), and the price is going to go up, I should buy now.</em>

        That's the big question--<em>if</em> you have no option not to buy it, there wouldn't be as much incentive for them to make such an offer (other than 'helping' you choose <em>where</em> and <em>when</em> to buy it).  But in general, this advertising fnord also attracts people who don't really need an item (and certainly don't need it now).  "Hey, if I buy three, I'll save even more!"

        I suppose this is distinguished from <a href="TriteSayingsComeInPairs.html">TriteSayingsComeInPairs</a> in that <a href="DoubleThink.html">DoubleThink</a> isn't about finding truth - it's about believing truth depending on context.
