        It is having the same problems as <a href="CounterStrike.html">CounterStrike</a> with cheaters, although it's usually easier to find a server without cheaters.

      <p>
        It should be noted that DoD now uses ValveAntiCheat system to catch cheaters.  Also, watch for a new updated version (beta 4) of <a href="DayOfDefeat.html">DayOfDefeat</a> in January of 2003.  It is going to be great :D

        <a href="DayOfDefeat.html">DayOfDefeat</a> is now a retail game like <a href="CounterStrike.html">CounterStrike</a>.
