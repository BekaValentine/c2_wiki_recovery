        I have neither time nor patience to delete the many contributions I once made to the corpus of this wiki. If you find a writing by me and like it, I'm happy for you. If you find a writing by me and are disturbed by it, I disclaim it.

        I am truly saddened that my once passionate participation in this community has come to this.
