        Open Scripting Architecture
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) of <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> and <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> allows developers to implement new <a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a>-capable scripting languages by writing a ScriptingComponent, of which <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> is an example.  Although the OSA is not required for a script to send <a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a>, using it allows applications which load, compile, or execute scripts to work with scripts in that language.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to driving applications via <a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a>, OSA scripts can also make use of <a href="ScriptingAddition.html">ScriptingAddition</a>s.
      </p>

      <p>
        What languages support OSA, and where can I find info on how to use it with each of them?
      </p>
      <p>
        I hear <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> has support, but I know not where.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.applescriptsourcebook.com/links/languages.html">http://www.applescriptsourcebook.com/links/languages.html</a> seems to have more info (although a lot of it sounds out of date).
