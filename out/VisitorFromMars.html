        <strong>Problem:</strong>
        As people become enmeshed in a situation, they lose perspective. Projects develop "blind spots." Assumptions gather moss, remaining unchallenged.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong>
        Any ongoing situation that has aspects that only undergo scrutiny infrequently.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces: </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Time and schedule pressure force people to focus, screening out new, possibly conflicting information.
        </li>
        <li>
           Group cohesion often blocks out fresh points of view.
        </li>
        <li>
           As time passes, people develop calluses, and no longer notice rough spots in a design or interface.
        </li>
        <li>
           The risk of "getting it wrong" is high, and the consequences are muy significant.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution: </strong>
        While <a href="ComingUpToSpeed.html">ComingUpToSpeed</a> in a new situation, we pass through a unique window of opportunity during which we have a fresh, untainted view of the project and problem domain. Take advantage of this period while you're new to a project, or when new members join. Write down impressions. Note rough spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formally grant <a href="VisitorFromMars.html">VisitorFromMars</a> status to newcomers, so that the old-timers may be more responsive to fresh feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong>
        Valuable feedback is captured and incorporated.

        My team has had a product in QA for several years; the number of usability bugs has been very low lately. Recently we "skinned" the product for a new OEM partner, changing terminology and syntax in the CLI and terminology and appearance in the GUI. Suddenly everyone is a <a href="VisitorFromMars.html">VisitorFromMars</a>. After a few days of complaints (NothingWorks) we started getting really good usability bug reports, sometimes on issues that have been present for years. Now those are tapering off again, after only a month.

        The paradigm I like to apply to this is, "Why should I care?" Try <a href="WhyShouldiCare.html">WhyShouldiCare</a> with your current or upcoming project to completely isolate the components from each other. This will give you a new perspective, you betcha.
