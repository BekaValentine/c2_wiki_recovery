        Benefits Of Oo
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> provides a different view of programming than <a href="ProceduralProgramming.html">ProceduralProgramming</a> or <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>.  On the one hand it's about bundling the state and behavior together, but in a larger sense it's about a mindset--a way of looking at programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a list of benefits often assigned to or claimed about OO. If you know of any evidence or detailed argument for any of these, feel free to link them in. Please use the discussion area below the list for long content.

           Better models human thought processes. <em>Hotly contended because heavily tied to psychology theories and personal differences.</em> 
          <ul>
            <li>
               There is a fallacy involved in this assertion. Humans may abstract and model world as objects (soft reflective abstraction), but OOP constructs world via objects (hard projective abstraction). Those are opposite behaviors, but the surface similarities may lead one to believe that OOP better models human thought. See also: <a href="ObjectVsModel.html">ObjectVsModel</a>, <a href="OopNotForDomainModeling.html">OopNotForDomainModeling</a>.

               <em>Basically, humans easily hold multiple views of things - recognizing multiple patterns - whereas OOP often forces us to pick one view and entrench it in our code.</em>

               I'd be hesitant to make blanket statements about human <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> outside of my own. People are different. Some are more comfortable with <a href="EverythingIsa.html">EverythingIsa</a>.

               <em>Looking at "comfort" level is a terrible way to measure whether something is related to "human thought processes" because it depends heavily upon other factors, such as familiarity. What the body of hard psychological evidence tells us is that all people (barring genetic defect, brain damage, or psychoactive drugs) perform the same cognitive functions, learn and think and recognize and pattern match by the same mechanisms. Humans are not </em>that<em> different.</em>

               Compared to others, I believe I am pretty good at explaining my mental steps to come to a judgment or model if I think about it enough. This is with the exception of remembering specific events that add up to summary judgments about frequencies. I don't have a photographic memory. But perhaps we should take this discussion to another topic.

               Do you mean my claims to about my ability to turn my mental models into something clear or concrete, or the accuracy of these models as far as predicting activity in the real world? The sub-topic is modeling the human mind, not modeling the "actual" world accurately. It's merely a claim of an ability at introspection of thought processes sufficient enough to replicate much of it on paper or an algorithm.

Confabulation is also common; I do it all the time, but I'm aware of the possibility so I can correct for it by establishing processes and habits. The problem is, human, that you're super-arrogant and think yourself above these issues. Regarding the rest, here's a piece of common sense that you apparently failed to learn: If one person calls you an ass, that's his problem.

               I see a lot of projecting going on there. And because the person/people who personally insult me rarely use handles, it could be one or a hundred and so I cannot make any reliable assessment of popularity.

        Those of us who criticize OOP do not necessarily disagree with personal or subjective benefits; it is the extrapolation assumption that they are universal or "best practices" which is the real problem. The article also suggests that OO better models the real world, but this does not seem to be a universal primary claim even among OO proponents. [insert link to existing real-world debate when found]
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        OO is good because it makes <strong>testing</strong> easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Example?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can often test each class in isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Same with modules.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [I'd go further and say that it's no more true for classes than for other units of code organization. Classes that don't depend on any others are in the minority, and often not very interesting.]
      </p>
      <p>
        False for any kind of modular language I can think of (C, which lacks a formal model of modules, still falls into this category, but so does Oberon(-2).  Not sure about Modula-2, but I'm pretty sure it also suffers the same problems).  In my OpenAX.25 C project, I was unable to test a module that used the BSD sockets API because, obviously, it would attempt to link against the BSD sockets library.  I couldn't create my own module which defined the sockets API myself because of duplicate symbol definition errors.  I had to resort to creating a thunk module called IPC, that defined IPC_recv(), IPC_select(), etc.  These functions added a layer of indirection which allowed my test code to not only isolate the module under test, but also alter the implementations of the respective IPC functions depending on the expected state of the application (<a href="StatePattern.html">StatePattern</a>).  This made unit testing much easier, but at the rather significant cost of many lines of pointless code.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an object oriented (or, more accurately, polymorphically-oriented, which OO definitely is), this problem simply doesn't arise.  I can mock/stub out the IPC objects as I see fit in my unit test code trivially.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get this same convenience in a modular language, your language simply <em>must</em> implement run-time-dispatched generic functions at the very least.  Only CLOS implements this to the best of my knowledge.  But, then again, it isn't called the Common Lisp <em>Object</em> System for nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In languages that support <a href="HyperStaticGlobalEnvironment.html">HyperStaticGlobalEnvironment</a>s, such as Forth, you can "fake" run-time rebinding of module interfaces by simply loading/compiling the mock/stub module before compiling the tests.  This wastes a bit of RAM, but since the tests occupy RAM only transiently, it shouldn't prove to be a burden.  The only thing that would happen is it'll somewhat lengthen the time it takes to compile and run the unit tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This seems a very language-specific thing. </em><a href="CeeIsNotThePinnacleOfProcedural.html">CeeIsNotThePinnacleOfProcedural</a>. I agree that introducing OO into a language probably gives one more name-space management options, but this is simply because the more paradigms you have, the more options you have. But, paradigm potpourri has its own downsides. <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether C is a pinnacle or not is utterly irrelavent (please re-read where I also said the problem applies to every other modular language I am personally aware of, including Oberon, Python, Haskell, etc.)  Show me even <em>one</em> modular programming language that exercises late-binding at the <em>module level.</em>  It can't be done; as soon as you do, you all but <em>by definition</em> have an object system. --SamuelFalvo
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I first need to see if you are claiming that non-OO paradigms will *always* prevent the implementation of such a feature, or merely that it is not common in practice. For example, very few procedural languages I've encountered support nested subroutines (along with nested scope). Only Pascal. But, this is not a fault of the procedural paradigm. It is some kind of industry habit formed by who-knows-what, for I found nested routines and scope to be useful.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me attempt to explain it via a bullet list to document my thought pattern.  Maybe then my reasoning will become clear.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I think we can agree that entities which we call "modules" are statically linked units of compilation <em>at run-time.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Although they may be <em>dynamically loaded,</em> their linkage occurs statically at the assembly language level once the loader performs address fixups.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           It is possible to have two modules Y and Z such that they expose exactly the same interface.
        </li>
        <li>
           It is not possible for a module X which uses module Y's interface to, for the purposes of unit testing, suddenly use module Z, <em>without creating a whole new executable that is statically linked and loaded.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               The reason you need statically loaded binaries here is because without it, the system's loader may still inadvertently load module Y.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           When running unit tests, many different kinds of mocks may be necessary to thoroughly test module-level interfaces.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Mocking the BSD sockets library for testing a new server daemon's ability to handle various kinds of malicious input, for example.
            </li>
            <li>
               Each kind of malicious input represents a different set of state machines; hence a <em></em><a href="StatePattern.html">StatePattern</a><em> is strongly desirable here.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               However, the module under test has no idea that you're trying to mock sockets.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Therefore, there are only two solutions to follow:
          <ul>
            <li>
               make a new module W, which serves as an abstraction of Y and Z, such that:
              <ul>
                <li>
                   production logic invokes a function in W that configures its interface to respond to module Y.
                </li>
                <li>
                   test logic invokes a function in W that configures its interface to respond to module Z.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Module W must use function pointers or their equivalent to implement the redirection.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Thus, module W is an instance of the <a href="BridgePattern.html">BridgePattern</a>, but at the module level.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               leave your module alone, don't bother with W at all, and turn what <em>should</em> be a unit test into an integration/acceptance test instead.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   This is an <a href="ImpedanceMismatch.html">ImpedanceMismatch</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                   This can cause problems later on if tests are found to take up too much time.
                </li>
                <li>
                   This tends to be more difficult than necessary to automate.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A module, by all definitions currently known to me, is a static entity: it is, from the point of view of the CPU actually doing the job of running the code, just a chunk of code.  CALLs made to it are done with absolute, or at the very least, jump-tables with absolute, addresses.  Everything else, such as ensuring the module's interface matches your expectations prior to compiling, is a compiler-offered feature that has no concrete run-time representation, and even if it did (e.g., in the form of in-core type descriptors), it'd have no bearing on actual <em>execution</em> of code.  Once the binary image is loaded into memory, it's fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as you say, "OK, this is stupid, let's add support for polymorphic module interfaces," well, you've basically re-invented object oriented architecture.  More precisely, you've reinvented <em>interfaces,</em> a feature that basically turns your module into a kind of <em>class,</em> because now you've introduced the ability to have multiple <em>concurrent</em> instances of your "module" co-resident with each other, each offering their services to objects that they own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Languages which I know for a fact require the "modules are static entities" invariant to hold:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Haskell
        </li>
        <li>
           Oberon(-2)
        </li>
        <li>
           Modula-2
        </li>
        <li>
           Python (without resorting to unscrupulous manipulation of internal structures)
        </li>
        <li>
           C/C++
        </li>
        <li>
           Forth
        </li>
        <li>
           OCaml
        </li>
        <li>
           Java (Yes, a class file is also a module file; "module-scope" entities are things like static class methods and the like.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Languages where this is not the case:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> (you can redefine any existing procedure, or use (defmethod) to create a wrapper around existing procedures; this appears to be a practice that is <em>strongly</em> discouraged though)
        </li>
        <li>
           Scheme (similar to CL, you can redefine a global name to mean something else)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I just can't think of <em>any</em> other languages in mainstream use that offers comparable capabilities, from the sole point of view of unit testing alone, as what OO provides.

               Not if you are <em>unit</em> testing, the whole purpose of which is to test code <em>in isolation.</em>  To do this, you have zero choices available: write a wrapper around the module in question, which is precisely what I did for the sockets API.  But, now, the code is linked against the wrapper permanently, even in shipping code.  Thankfully, the indirection doesn't add noticable overhead.

        Is this truly object-<strong>oriented</strong>?  as in: results in <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>?  In my own experience, if you squint hard enough, anything is an object: functions in funtional programming, whole processes in operating-system programming, whole operating-systems in distributed systems programming, etcetera.  DLLs are objects to the dynamic link-loader.  It doesn't surprise me that you can consider parameterized modules and such to be objects.  Of better question is whether that view is <em>sufficient</em> to make the programming object-<strong>oriented</strong>. I'm not particularly keen on trying to answer this question.  (To me, <a href="ThereAreExactlyThreeParadigms.html">ThereAreExactlyThreeParadigms</a> in use that are truly 'meaningful', and 'object-oriented' is not among them.)  But I do note that mere support for parameterized modules would not meet <a href="AlanKaysDefinitionOfObjectOriented.html">AlanKaysDefinitionOfObjectOriented</a>, would not meet the <a href="NygaardClassification.html">NygaardClassification</a> for <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>, does not imply <em>inheritance</em> or any sort of implicit support for <em>delegation</em> (for <a href="PolymorphismEncapsulationInheritance.html">PolymorphismEncapsulationInheritance</a>), and fails many other various <a href="DefinitionsForOo.html">DefinitionsForOo</a>.  Of course, <a href="NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs.html">NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs</a>, so perhaps SamuelFalvo's definition is as good as any other.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are languages that provide parameterized and abstract modules with concurrent existence.  Consider: if a programming language is modular with neat, polymorphic, parameterized modules and such, but did not provide modules as <em>first-class</em> entities that can be produced or replaced on-the-fly from within a language, would this really benefit testing?  Perhaps it is having 'first-class' component-configurations that is most relevant to making units easier to test.  Component configurations are necessary when dependencies go two directions (i.e. component A depends on something from component B, like a callback, and component B depends on something in component A, like a call.)
      </p>
      <p>
        What means "module" in a programming language depends really upon how processes are glued together from constituent parts.  Merely having "modular" components, be they parameterized or polymorphic or not, doesn't make easy the task of configuring these components.
      </p>
      <p>
        SamuelFalvo says: This is what I am talking about.  You can have support for parameterized modules, but the fact is, you're still invoking <em>that module,</em> not <em>your mock</em> module.  <a href="MlLanguage.html">MlLanguage</a> supports parameterized modules, for example, but they're utterly useless from a unit testing perspective.

        Some opinions on OOP from a structured programming perspective (not using a true OO language):
      </p>
      <p>
        Although some of us hate the hype behind OOP, we have found some ideas from OOP to be very useful in structured programming. OOP techniques can save typing, shorten the code, reduce copy and pasting or include file tricks, can make code more readable and less error prone. However, the opposite is also true: when not used carefully, OOP can bloat up code, overly complicate code, cause more errors (especially if dangling objects exist), cause a lot of uneeded line noise (free/create/new/destroy, etc). This is why some prefer to use the stack, along with modules, and not just objects. Some are not fond of purely heap based OOP languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider a case where some OOP techniques are useful: you have a struct/record that you wish to fool with. Say you need a new experimental structure based on an old one. You could copy and paste this old structure into a new file and play with it, or you could cast the struct/record using aligment tricks in C/Pascal. With old procedural coding you end up having to do these dangerous tricks, or copy and pasting to reuse that old structure. Sometimes you can write some procedures to wrap the old struct/record - but then you end up reinventing inheritance and writing boiler plate code! With OOP it hides this boiler plate code, it hides the "self" or "this" or "me" parameter you would have otherwise sent in to the procedures as a pointer or VAR param. In OOP you can safely inherit and play with a struct/record (class) without copy and pasting the old one, or without writing procedural wrappers which emulate inheritance!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="CeeIsNotThePinnacleOfProcedural.html">CeeIsNotThePinnacleOfProcedural</a>, nor is Pascal. For one, their structures are static at run-time. If they were based on <a href="SetTheory.html">SetTheory</a>, then one could use set operations to add or remove elements from an existing set of fields. <strong>Set theory is far more flexible for managing variations-on-a-theme than sub-typing.</strong> If you don't understand why this is so, we will never agree. <a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a> gives some examples. Without more details about what actually you are trying to acheive (business case), I cannot suggest an alternative language or solution. Related: <a href="DeltaIsolation.html">DeltaIsolation</a>.) --top<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What? Of course you can create dynamic structures at run time in Cee or Pascal. You just can't query them using a relational language so easily. But it could be done using parameter tricks, or a macro preprocessor. Consider an Array of Records or an Array of Structs. You can add and delete items from the array. A record or struct is in fact a Tuple in disguise. An array cannot be queried easily, but one could do it using tricks. Items in an array or list can indeed be inserted and deleted - at run time.  Arrays or lists can expand and be saved and loaded from a storage medium too (usually via files, but we don't have to see them as just files.. they could be relationally stored in several different files, split up for optimization - that's the physical issues we shouldn't worry about). The values of arrays or lists can be changed at run time. The trick would be making the items in the array <strong>more query-able</strong> then what is currently offered, perhaps reinventing <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> or TQL ideas. Lists and arrays usually only offer <strong>ridiculously simple operations</strong> such as remove, delete, append, insert, etc. There is <strong>no query language available</strong> for the <strong>array</strong>, or <strong>list</strong>. Databases are actually <strong>a lot about queries</strong> more so than people realize. <strong>What's missing in Objects, Structs, Records - are queries.</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        As for requiring Business Cases, I've provided plenty that you've missed. More concretely, consider a GUI button widget where one wishes to modify the button to have a border around it. Inheriting the button without damaging the old code or using copy and pasting allows us to muck around with a new button. The button does not need to be stored relationally - are you going to store the button's' caption and click behavior in a table? And how are you going to inherit this button without resorting to WinAPI style coding using procedural code, if not using relations?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you don't mind, I'd like to stay away from GUI engine design here and focus on biz domain objects (customers, accounts, invoices, etc.). For one, most custom app developers do not develop GUI widgets from scratch. Second, GUI's are a very long and involved topic. The answer to the above would likely depend on the details of a specific GUI engine: one GUI engine may have a difficult spot where another doesn't and vise verse. (A set-friendly GUI engine would generally start out widgets with all possible behavior and features and filter-based "elimination" would be used to exclude a border from a button, not the other way around as often found in tree-oriented thinking.)

        One problem with OOP is that the algorithms become welded into the class, even though we aren't sure that algorithm will only need to be part of that class! This leads to messes such as multiple inheritance and overly complex solutions (IMO). Some algorithms simply need not be welded to a class and we can't decide on this up front immediately! As a structured programmer speaking here, I therefore do not use pure OOP languages or any language that tries to be pure (Java, etc). However, even in these so called pure languages - one can escape the object system by using the global class (i.e. in Ruby one can DEF a procedure without it being tied to a specific class). Many so called pure languages still have ways that you can escape the OOP model when you need to.

      </p>
      <p>
        If we look back, using POP (Procedure-Oriented Programming), we must deal with all the concerns in a line. Though we can outsource the code into different functions, the main stream still controls all the process. This is the linear model. When OOP is introduced, we can present the world in a more natural way by describing different objects and their functions. Connections between different objects form a network, a matrix of type vs. behavior. This can be called the two-dimensional model.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How is "natural" being measured here? I am bothered by that claim.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Natural" is somewhat informal, but the improvement mentioned above could be measured in terms of the degree to which unrelated concerns can be expressed (and developed & tested) independently of one another. OOP, when introduced, was a step up from POP languages of the same era due to the indirection from interface to implementation (message passing or virtual functions). One may encapsulate unrelated concerns in different objects, and these objects may then interact blissfully ignorant of the concerns encapsulated by their companions. Compare POP, in which the calling procedure must be aware of and test for 'unrelated' concerns so that it can properly select a procedure to call, forcing the system to be coded with a much more 'global' policy and more 'global' data available to procedures. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, OOP still fails grievously when dealing with <em>related</em> concerns such as concurrency management, persistence, logging, optimization decisions, memory management, etc. As a class, these are called <a href="CrossCuttingConcern.html">CrossCuttingConcern</a>s.  If OOP succeeded at these, there would be no need for AOP. Similarly, OOP also runs into the <a href="ExpressionProblem.html">ExpressionProblem</a> - adding new 'verbs' to an interface requires touching every class in the project.

        The simplest examples are available in procedures containing things such as 'baker.bake(ingredients)'. In procedural, the calling procedure must contain the information to locate the correct bake method, such as 'if isBreadBaker(baker) then bakeBread(ingredients) else if isPieBaker(baker) then bakePie(ingredients)'.

           This is covered in <a href="SwitchStatementsSmell.html">SwitchStatementsSmell</a>. Your example assumes a hierarchical subtype-based model of domain nouns. However, in practice variations-on-themes are best modeled with sets (buffet of semi-independent features), not hierarchies. -- top
        </li>
        <li>
           You are in error to claim the example has anything to do with a "hierarchical subtype-based model of domain nouns" - it doesn't matter whether or not there is a 'Baker' class, only whether the object currently called 'baker' can accept the 'bake (ingredients)' message. OOP does not <em>necessarily</em> imply hierarchical classification schemes.

           Traditional OO polymorphism works well with "toy" examples, but not with realistic ones, at least in my domain. OO does not natively handle sets and many-to-many relationships, let alone the ability to query complex objects ad-hoc, and I consider these a flaw with it. <strong>Most of the claims on this page would melt away under the scrutinty of more realistic examples</strong> (at least for some domains). --top

        <li>
           I agree that OO does not effectively handle many-to-many relationships, multiple dispatch, fine-grained specialization, 'open' specialization, or complex queries. OTOH, neither does procedural, which was OO's main competitor at the time these claims were made.

           Hmmm... I can see how my statements would be confusing.

           And there are OODBMSs - even encapsulation may be included by supporting getters and setters - but I happen to agree that the design is fundamentally flawed because it enforces a model on data. I'm a person who favors 'thin table' relational solutions and rejects even the <a href="EntityRelationshipModeling.html">EntityRelationshipModeling</a> as a basis for organizing data in an RDBMS. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>If it includes </em><a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> setter/getter's, then it could be classified as an OOP programming language that removes the distinction between RAM and disk. However, I will agree that the distinction could be fuzzy. The <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> environment could potentially be considered a (non-relational) database, for example.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           A programming system can be achieved by allowing communication to be triggered by update events in a database, but doing so is more <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a> than <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>. And the '<a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>' issue is not a distinction with which I'd agree: (while there are advantages of such a restriction, there is nothing in RDBMS or OODBMS that <em>requires</em> avoiding <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> views, updateable views, updates, and queries of data). The important distinction is on 'data' from <strong>outside</strong> the system vs. 'objects' built <strong>inside</strong> the programming system. Related: <a href="ObjectVsModel.html">ObjectVsModel</a>.

           <em>The outside/inside dichotomy can be weak or fuzzy. A </em><a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a> (or parts of it) may be very app-specific, for example, yet is as much part of the database as any other table. In my opinion, the definition of "database" is kind of like the <a href="DefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfLife</a>: there is no one trait that makes it a database (or database-ish), but rather a multiple factors.  --top<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Hmmm? It isn't so weak or fuzzy as you believe. Programs have inputs, and inputs are clearly from 'outside' the system. If you're confused, I did mean (and say) 'from' outside vs. inside, as opposed to currently stored there. Things like <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a> and other forms of configuration data and configuration management data tend to also be 'inputs' to manipulate a program - they're from the outside even if they are very app-specific. And while 'database' tends to refer to a persistent collection of data as opposed to the management system, I don't really see what the issue of database definitions has to do with the above (perhaps a miscommunication?).
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I've converted </em>ControlTables into arrays or function calls back and forth for performance or scaling or shop-style-preference reasons. The solution design is pretty much conceptually the same. It is mostly an <strong>implementation detail</strong> whether I put such info in a non-code table or in say arrays with hard-coded constants.<em> --top</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            Indeed, whether you store code in an object file, script files, or a database, is an implementation detail. <a href="DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing.html">DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing</a>, and <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> fully embraces this fact. What matters is <strong>communication</strong> between systems. In terms of data, it matters whether the code/data comes from <em>outside</em> a given computation system (i.e. is subject to external manipulation by users or environment) or is <em>internal</em> to the system. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Please clarify. "Outside" is a matter of perspective. </em><a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a> has its own internal SQL processing engine and internal tables. It is not "outside". Moving the same table to a non-<a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a> RDBMS does not change the basic nature of the design. (CF's internal tabling has some big flaws, but irrelevant to this.)<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           "Outside a given computation system" is a matter of topography and is well defined for any given computation system. And to help clarify: really doesn't matter where you store or process the data, only matters whether the data is under control of the computation system or its environment.  
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>If only the app has the password to a given RDBMS table, then only the app "has control". Again, that seems a very minor thing to pivot big distinctions on.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Control within a computation system is not at all a minor thing, though your lack of <a href="SystemProgramming.html">SystemProgramming</a> and <a href="ProgrammingLanguageTheory.html">ProgrammingLanguageTheory</a> background might lead you to believe otherwise. But, while security measures like passwords support distinguishing control, they don't matter nearly so much as the control itself, which really comes down to service contracts. For example, the application also has control over that table if others are simply not allowed to touch it and the application itself is allowed to fail if anyone else touches it. If the application is required to accommodate changes to the <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a>, and things outside that application are allowed to change that <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a>, then control is clearly outside the application, and the current state of the <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a> must be considered by programmers an input to the application (something that cannot be wholly anticipated, certainly cannot be compiled into the program via <a href="CompileTimeResolution.html">CompileTimeResolution</a> and subjected to <a href="PartialEvaluation.html">PartialEvaluation</a>, probably needs documented like other application inputs, must be maintained for backwards compatibility, etc.), and must further be considered by users as a configuration for the application (something that can be tweaked, and that will need to be versioned and managed carefully). It's a big thing, and so big distinctions pivot on it.

        <li>
           <em>We'll just have to </em><a href="AgreeToDisagree.html">AgreeToDisagree</a>. I view it as an implementation detail. It can be swapped back and forth without changing the basic nature of the design. In my opinion you are over-interpreting or over-magnifying side issues.<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               I've the impression that we're talking past each other. I agree that <em>"where the </em><a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a> is stored"<em> is an "implementation detail". What you don't seem to grok is that </em>"where the <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a> is stored"<em> does NOT determine </em>"who controls the <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a>"<em> (this being the logical consequence of service contracts determining control). I think you assume that I would find error in your implementing a </em><a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a> in an external RDBMS and calling it an 'implementation detail' of the application. But I don't have a problem with you doing that... with some exceptions. As I understand it, an 'implementation detail' is something that is 'encapsulated' in the 'implementation' and may be changed without breaking client code. If you allow clients of your application to tweak and re-configure that <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a>, to maintain configurations, and to treat the <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a> as an interface to the application, it is no longer an 'implementation detail'. (The importance of the distinction becomes much more obvious to programmers that have <em>more than one client</em> for a given unit of software.)
            </li>
            <li>
               Regardless, I do agree that we're falling away from the topic subject, and that this conversation can be tabled.

        In a unit testing framework, or in independent development, it would be easy to create a 'mock' baker that can report which ingredients it has baked. This mock baker could be queried after tests to ensure the caller is working correctly. These tests, and the mock baker, would be able to coexist with the final application code. In the procedural methodologies, independent testing would require mock-implementations of 'bakeBread' and 'bakePie' and so on, and the testing framework would need to be built and maintained independently of the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        And to stem a likely objection: I fully agree that one could use <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> techniques even in a ProceduralProgrammingLanguage. One is free to call a 'bake' script or 'bakefn' function associated with the baker. One could even put such a script into a database. But most people would just say you're reinventing OO. <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming languages only aim to make it easier and sometimes safer (than in procedural languages) to use these techniques. (page anchor OOP_techniques_impl) {My objection is near that anchor also.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's reinventing Lisp, not OOP. And, it only "makes it easier" in simplistic textbook examples or device drivers, not production design.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is OOP, which was later reinvented in Lisp as CLOS. And read the above again: "make it easier" refers to the use of OOP techniques in OO languages (relative to the use of OOP techniques in procedural languages) - it isn't something I'd expect you to contest.  Refer to prior sections of the page if you wish to contest claims about the OOP techniques themselves providing benefits over procedural methodologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't believe this is correct. That ability existed in early Lisp.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Object orientation (in Simula I) dates from 1962, which is roughly five years after the invention of LISP, but CLOS and its direct predecessors date from the 1980s.]   
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to implement CLOS existed in early Lisp, if that is what you mean, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. But, by that reasoning, even <a href="SnuspLanguage.html">SnuspLanguage</a> is OOP. Please don't appeal to the lowest of the <a href="FourLevelsOfFeature.html">FourLevelsOfFeature</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        No real effort to support for <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming techniques in Lisp existed until the late 70s, well after <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> and <a href="SimulaLanguage.html">SimulaLanguage</a> had some time to gestate among the people at MIT. (Well, there was at least one other effort, LOOP. Not sure when that one started, or what happened to it.) Anyhow, CLOS is another case of building one language inside another - a rather well developed feature of Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I thought it was Simula II that introduced the OO features, not Simula I. Anyhow, since Lisp makes it easy to mix data and code, any data structure can also contain code. Thus, it may have:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        (bakers<br/>
        (baker01 (attributes...) (code for baker01...))     <br/>
        (baker02 (attributes...) (code for baker02...))     <br/>
        (baker03 (attributes...) (code for baker03...))     <br/>
        Etc...<br/>

      <p>
        <em>Although I agree such may be an "OOP concept", it was not "invented" by OOP nor is it exclusive to OOP. Other paradigms may rightfully claim it as one of their techniques.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Code in structures without any extra support is <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>. It doesn't help with constructors or inheritance, with automatic 'self' reference, with dispatch, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Constructors could also be considered a form of </em><a href="EventDrivenProgramming.html">EventDrivenProgramming</a>. It's an "on-create" event. Again, it's a "shared feature". The others may be also upon further analysis.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ah! I think I understand. You're objecting to the idea that OOP perhaps "owns" certain ways-of-organizing-code, and they can't exist within other orientations or designs. Who is promoting this idea to which you are objecting? 
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect you'd find many that people do, in fact, believe in the existence of <a href="MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage.html">MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage</a>s. I certainly do. Since I believe in <a href="MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage.html">MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage</a>s, I don't consider features to be "owned" by paradigms/orientations; rather, I say that features are "necessary" to paradigms/orientations, or that a paradigm/orientation is "supported" by a language having a certain non-exclusive sets of <a href="KeyLanguageFeature.html">KeyLanguageFeature</a>s. Any given language feature might be necessary to supporting many paradigms.

        <em>Actually, mixing data and programming code was more or less how things started out in computers. They were separated to help manage code, ironically. Now we are shifting back that way as modern techniques allow the power of combining but hopefully without most the original downsides that made it frowned upon.</em>
