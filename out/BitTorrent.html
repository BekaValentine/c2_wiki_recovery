        There's an old <a href="IsaacAsimov.html">IsaacAsimov</a> story, supposedly the foundation of CDMA and its sistern, about how old yiddish ladies all talk at the same time. Well, that's <a href="BitTorrent.html">BitTorrent</a>. The more people who join the party, the more bits get chucked around until everyone has the same bits. Maybe they should have called it "grapevine".
