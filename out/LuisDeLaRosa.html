        Luis de la Rosa (my last name does not do so well when turned into a pattern name) actually.
        I'm fascinated by patterns as a way of thinking.  In a way, it is a superset of object-oriented thinking, as much as OO is a superset of relational/structured thinking, which is a superset of assembly/machine level thinking.

        Currently trying out <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>.  A great concept that should be replicated all over the world as people try to discover the knowledge that is in their communities.  Its a great place to share ideas.

        I specialize in Client-side app / Tool development in <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> and Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not doing that or blogging, I also create Cocoa / <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> Apps for my favorite platform OS X.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I am getting into Ruby (its almost like Smalltalk again) and Ruby on Rails (great webapp framework).
