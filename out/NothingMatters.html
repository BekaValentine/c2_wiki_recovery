        We then spend about 1 hour getting ready to work, 1 hour going to work, and about 9 hours there (work time plus lunch). Then we spend another hour going back home.

        Then there's time spent on house chores, preparing meals, and generally polishing the various gears of our daily routine to make everything run
        smoothly. Let's assume that it leaves us with about 2 hours of free time a day (without counting all the hiccups of life that happen during the week).
        I say 2 hours a day is very little time.

           we should work less time while we are young, and enjoy life more. There is always our family, or friends, to be with; the latest game to play; that novel to read. There is always a lot of everything that is not work to do, and very little time to do it, because of work.

           work smarter, and work less. And remember that, in the end, <a href="NothingMatters.html">NothingMatters</a>, except the good that you built with your life.
