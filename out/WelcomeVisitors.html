        Welcome to the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, also known as "Wiki". A lot of people had their first wiki experience here. This community has been around since 1995 and consists of many people. We always accept newcomers with valuable contributions. If you haven't used a wiki before, be prepared for a bit of <a href="CultureShock.html">CultureShock</a>. The usefulness of Wiki is in the freedom, simplicity, and power it offers.

        This site's primary focus is <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> in <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>. However, it is more than just an <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a>. It started there, but the theme has created a culture and <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> all its own. All Wiki content is <a href="WorkInProgress.html">WorkInProgress</a>. Most of all, this is a forum where people share ideas! It changes as people come and go. Much of the information here is subjective.
