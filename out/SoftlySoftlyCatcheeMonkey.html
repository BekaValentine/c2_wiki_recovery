        The <a href="ProcessPattern.html">ProcessPattern</a> version:
      </p>
      <p>
        Managers, Teachers, Parents, Users, Stakeholders and other Authority Figures seem to want it done right, done immediately, and never done again (<a href="DoItRightTheFirstTime.html">DoItRightTheFirstTime</a>). Of course you can't deliver on such expectations, and in fact most of these Authorities are just your own boojums - the real people behind them know that good work takes time. They're putting pressure on you because they want your best, not because they expect a miracle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now sometimes what these folk want is really not difficult to do. You know how to get from A to B, you get into that <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a>, and you do it. But sometimes you haven't got the faintest, or you're damn certain what they're asking for isn't a realistic expectation, or it isn't the right thing at the right time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't meet the insurmountable problem head on, but move slowly, deliberately, compassionately, to surround it. You don't catch your monkey by running into the jungle and trying to flush it out. Monkeys move faster in a jungle than you, and they can always climb and hide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step back. Get lazy. Ignore deadlines. Think. Research. Wander. Let the back-burners do some work. Panicking and rushing isn't going to solve a hard problem. Perhaps you're not doing the right thing at the right time. Perhaps there's some other way to balance the forces, or some forces you're neglecting. You won't find the solution by looking for it; it has to find you. Let it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you enter the jungle with due pace and caution, but with no idea in your head about catching a monkey, they won't see you as a predator coming. You just mind your business until you see a monkey. They'll be paying you no attention. Then calmly and deliberately notch your arrow and catch your dinner.

        Yes, don't let panic take over.  It is quite possible to learn to relax<em> while</em> you work - pairs help with this - and then you go fast and softly at the same time.  Worth learning!  Of course you have to wait, sometimes.  The trick is to learn to wait very fast.  One <a href="ExtremeWay.html">ExtremeWay</a> to do that is not to sit there with your thumb in your, um, mouth, but to sit down with a partner and write some code to throw away.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Sometimes I find that if I'm having problems with a piece of code, it's because I'm too focused.  In this situation, I find it's best to step away from the screen and do something else.  Maybe I'll go outside for a walk, maybe I'll just visit the coffee machine.  Sometimes (rarely), I'll simply call it a day and go home.
        Five minutes away from the code, and all of a sudden the trees blend away and I can see the forest.

        The thing is this. As Peter says, you have to get back to flow. You can't do that when you're in fear. Peter suggests "resting" to get back to steady. The problem with resting is that it consumes time. Sometimes, if you're waiting for inspiration, it consumes lots of time. Meanwhile some tense but hard-working bastard will thrash around and find a solution, making you look like a lazy jerk.
      </p>
      <p>
        So find a way to use <em>work</em> to reduce fear. That, if I get it, is what Beck and Cunningham are encouraging us to do with <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> and <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>. Do something non-scary, learn from it. KnowledgeBanishesFear.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree with all that, except that <a href="SoftlySoftlyCatcheeMonkey.html">SoftlySoftlyCatcheeMonkey</a> isn't resting. It's not meeting the problem head on, but instead moving slowly, deliberately, compassionately, to surround it.

        From Scouting. BadenPowell claimed he learned it in Ghana. He said, <em>You must not be led aside by fits of disinclination or annoyance; if you give way to these you will never succeed. Patience and perseverance win the day. "Softly, softly, catchee monkey."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is interesting. He speaks of not being led aside by disinclination, he speaks of persevering. Not quite the same as sitting back, ignoring deadlines, and waiting for the muse. Perhaps BadenPowell's advice is being taken wrongly here. The good man wasn't talking about inaction as a form of action.

        Could someone explain what "compassionately" means in the description of <a href="SoftlySoftlyCatcheeMonkey.html">SoftlySoftlyCatcheeMonkey</a>?  On the face of it, there's nothing compassionate about tiring monkeys out and killing them.  Maybe that's not the idea?

        Well, this is interesting.  See, last time I was softly catching my monkey, some bozo went off and accused me of <a href="AnalysisParalysis.html">AnalysisParalysis</a>.  What's up? -- <a href="WaldenMathews.html">WaldenMathews</a>

        Counting the number of 'y's in "<a href="AnalysisParalysis.html">AnalysisParalysis</a>", why?  Just kidding!  I was exploring a whole bunch of stuff that might bear on my solution, and waiting for some sort of Gestalt to form in my tiny pea brain.  Waiting for that feeling of pending certainty, if you know what I mean.

It's a strange feeling. I say "tried to create" because I got it wrong and called it SlowlySlowlyCatcheeMonkey. That got me thinking about what Freud and my subconscious were trying to tell me about the negative influence of the ubiquitous term <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>. Wiki means "quickly" right? Hasn't the continual use of the double prefix <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> here done much more damage to our shared psyche than we all realised? Hasn't <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a> too often come to mean, for the <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>, "now and if not now, more quickly than that"? All that Eastern perpetual now and detachment from the momentary stuff has been ... an enormous con. The clever tyranny of the <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a> begins to be revealed for what it is. They will indeed quickly master you.
