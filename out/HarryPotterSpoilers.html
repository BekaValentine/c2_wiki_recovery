        <em>Agreed. There's a rather obvious </em><a href="RedShirt.html">RedShirt</a> in book 4, though (details omitted for obvious reasons) <em></em>

        Would you mind putting the details on <a href="HarryPotterSpoilers.html">HarryPotterSpoilers</a>?? I'm not sure who you mean.

        Yes, I meant Cedric. There only to get killed. Yes, the author's too good to introduce him 5 minutes before the act, but still a <a href="RedShirt.html">RedShirt</a> in my view, in that he had no other significant part in the story. Perhaps <a href="PlotToken.html">PlotToken</a> would be a better term). It was obvious to me - I guessed Cedric was there to die - but on the other hand it was widely leaked that someone died in the book, so I was expecting something.

        Trying to compete in any way with <a href="HarryPotter.html">HarryPotter</a> is bad news for any character. They will suffer some misfortune shortly afterwards - Cedric's is just the worst. <a href="HarryPotter.html">HarryPotter</a> is a jinx.

        OK, I'll give you Malfoy :-)

        Potter may be a jinx - look at the trouble the Neville (the kid with the toad) has had, and he's never ever competed; however, Malfoy has not suffered any more than Ron w/r/t humiliation.

        <em>Ahem. Voldemort's "died" at least twice - as Professor Quirrell at the end of book 1, and as (the memory of) Tom Riddle at the end of book 2. I'd call that "serious harm"</em>

        <em>Oh, come on. You expect the series to end with Voldemort's triumph?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not at all.  Nor do I expect Harry Potter to die in the series.  Software Development and Architecture are not the only endeavors to make use of patterns.  If you remember that it's a work of fiction, it's rather silly to debate about whether the protagonist is a jinx or not.  If nothing happened to anyone, the book would be rather boring.
      </p>

        <em>Well, of course it's silly. You were taking this seriously?</em>

        I don't see Cedric as a <a href="RedShirt.html">RedShirt</a>. He was developed into a character that the reader could actually care for. We even got to meet his parents. As for real <a href="RedShirt.html">RedShirt</a>s, I propose the Tom Riddles family gardener and the witch Bertha: both of these people die without much ado and I doubt many readers felt sad at their deaths.
      </p>

        Cedric is probably not a redshirt, mostly because he is Harry's rival for Cho Chang, and Harry actually grieves about him in Book 5. The comment about him being a <a href="PlotToken.html">PlotToken</a> is moot. Of course he is, it's a work of fiction, <em>Everything</em> is a plot token ...
