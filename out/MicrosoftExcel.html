        Most any office has tons of <a href="MicrosoftExcel.html">MicrosoftExcel</a> spreadsheets lying around. When they get to a certain size, and start thinking about more automation, a common initial task is to take these spreadsheets and convert them to a format that is more scalable, easier to index, etc., etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to think it was funny that offices do this, instead of just defining a database right away. Recently, though, I've come around. Defining a few DB tables works well if you have a very intimate knowledge of the problem domain right from the start; however, this is rarely the case. You could put this in a database table, but every time you want to change a column format or add a new column, you'll have to hire some expensive programmer to write the SQL for you. Maybe it's an acceptable trade-off to have a tool that lets your receptionist/office manager/whoever change the format, and accept worse performance. Maybe <a href="MicrosoftExcel.html">MicrosoftExcel</a> is a good strategy, at least until the spreadsheets grows to 2000 rows.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's probably a pattern out there that subsumes this, but if there isn't, I'd define a proto-pattern like:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>If the initial data set is small, and you don't know that much about what kind of data you're storing, use a highly flexible, easy-to-modify format to store it. When the data set gets bigger and/or your knowledge about the data starts to crystalize, then migrate it.</dd>

        Excel's hidden talent is the ease in which it massages delimited text files. It's far more useful than a <a href="TextEditor.html">TextEditor</a>.

        I've been doing some proto-accounting in <a href="MicrosoftExcel.html">MicrosoftExcel</a>, and again amazed at the ease of use. Even though I myself know how to program, nothing beats plunking down numbers in pretty rows and plugging in the right formulas to get me what I want. I know it's not exactly scalable to anything else, but right now that fact isn't bugging me ... I wonder: What would an ideal Excel-killer look like, to offer both the instantaneous feedback of the MS' product, but also be painless to throw that logic into a robust DB-driven app? -- francis

        Recently I started using Excel more after several years where I concentrated on 'programming' more than 'spreadsheets'. I noticed that functions were a <strong>lot</strong> easier to use after three years pythoning around. I also learned (from working with a co-worker) that many excel users don't know how to do very basic things. The Excel Killer I'm envisioning would be able to identify a column or a row as a range and offer several common fuctions (@SUM and others) when the person goes to enter a formula beyond the end of a range. -- <a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a>

        Interesting example of commodity software is Worksheet Server (<a href="http://www.jedox.com)">http://www.jedox.com)</a> which turns Excel into a design tool for PHP ( <a href="CategoryPhp.html">CategoryPhp</a> ) web applications.

        Excel's macro recorder isn't very good. It produces awful code, and a major problem with that is maintanace of the code going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the recorder does score, is using it as a way of discovering how the object model in Excel works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is an example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, the recorder will produce code like this.
      </p>
      <code>
        Range("D7").Select<br/>
        Selection.Font.Bold = True<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        OK, now you embed this in a function, and you call the function. There is a major problem. There is a side effect. The current selection has been changed. Now it becomes very difficult to compose these functions into bigger functional units.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the solution is easy. Just remove the select and selection parts.
      </p>
      <code>
        Range("D7").Font.Bold = True<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Does exactly what was intended, with no side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only time I've really needed to use selection was for context sensitive double clicking. You can use the select when you want to use it for navigation.
