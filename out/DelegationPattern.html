      <p>
        In general, the passing of responsibility from one logical grouping of code to another.  Specifically, when one method passes  control to another method.  The called method is usually defined in a separate class, which may be swappable at runtime (see <a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a>.)  For example, a Save method in a business tier object, rather than accessing the data store directly, may create a data tier object and call a method on that object, which in turn writes to the database.

        Delegation is a common theme in <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>, and is used in numerous <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>.  Many different responsibilities may be delegated... object creation, business logic, and data access, to name a few.
