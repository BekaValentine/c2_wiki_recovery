        De Condorcet
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DeCondorcet.html">DeCondorcet</a> is a name that may be used for any voting system satisfying Condorcet's Criterion:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Any candidate who is preferred by a majority of voters to each other candidate should win.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        I am not aware of anywhere in the world where such a system is in use. <em></em><a href="DebianGnuLinux.html">DebianGnuLinux</a> uses <a href="DeCondorcet.html">DeCondorcet</a> voting for their project leader and general resolution process.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          40 people vote ABC (i.e. they put A as their first choice, B as second, C as third)
        </li>
        <li>
          10 vote BCA
        </li>
        <li>
          10 vote BAC
        </li>
        <li>
          40 vote CBA
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then B is preferred to A by a majority of 60 to 40, and to C by 60 to 40 as well. B was last on first preferences and would not win under <a href="InstantRunoffVoting.html">InstantRunoffVoting</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The big problem is that a candidate meeting the condition need not always exist. (If one always did, <a href="ArrowsTheorem.html">ArrowsTheorem</a> would be contradicted.)
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          40 people vote ABC 
        </li>
        <li>
          30 vote BCA
        </li>
        <li>
          30 vote CAB
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This would suggest that a majority of 40 (70-30) prefer B to C, a majority of 20 prefer C to A and a majority of 40 prefer A to B. This situation is called a cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cycles are rare in practice, and can be resolved in a number of ways, suggesting that <a href="DeCondorcet.html">DeCondorcet</a> could be used for public elections. However opponents argue that <a href="TacticalVoting.html">TacticalVoting</a> can be used so as to create cycles and benefit from the cycle-breaker.

        Thanks a lot for the info. This does seem like a good <a href="VotingMethodCriterion.html">VotingMethodCriterion</a>; surprising to me that <a href="InstantRunoffVoting.html">InstantRunoffVoting</a> doesn't satisfy! -- <a href="BayleShanks.html">BayleShanks</a>
