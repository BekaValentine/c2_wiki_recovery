      <p>
        I am a long-time computer geek to such an absurd extreme that I went to graduate school primarily because I loved to play computer games on my TRS-80 (aka <a href="TrashEighty.html">TrashEighty</a>).

      <p>
        Years later, I have a Ph.D. in computer science, wrote a bunch of <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a> computer graphics, but have yet to find gainful employment playing games.
