          <a href="PervasiveComputing.html">PervasiveComputing</a> is likely to replace the desktop paradigm of computer systems (and their massive operating systems), at least in the broad application base they are used now. I would love to see people no longer slaved to a machine to do work, but computers slaved to how people work.

               Wouldn't it make more sense for cars to talk instead of displaying everything? When I need directions, I don't have to be looking at a map; I want the car to *tell* me "make this left, then go over the train tracks..." When it's low on gas, I want it to tell me "you're going to have to get gas either today or tomorrow"  (based on recent/habitual usage rates)

               As information is increasingly available from myriad devices, servers, locations everywhere (even events and attributes associated with GPS coordinates), small, wireless, wearable devices will make it easier to deal with the information by correlating it with your field of view depending on where you are and direction you are looking.
