        Relational Trees And Graphs Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Different ways to provide different structure "types" in relational, or whether it should be done.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Things to consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use one "kind" of structure as another as our needs grow. For example, a given record/node may participate in different structures all at the same time: tree, table, graph, stack, etc. without copying in and out of each. Also supported by structured <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Easily mix collection "kinds" without heavy conversion effort. For example, perform a UNION or JOIN (or ZIP or FOLD or MAP or APPEND) on some or all records/nodes of a two or more collection "kinds". (Support for both structured and destructured <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s may require column type conversion efforts to do any equivalent of 'UNION' two different kinds under heavy-typed systems.)
          <ul>
            <li>
                <em>'... under heavy-typed systems</em> - not really. Under any <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> system you cannot UNION a two-column relation with a three-column relation. The conversion effort would be pretty common here.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>That's going to be true of anything such that it's probably not worth mentioning. -t</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Ah, so then do you <strong>recant</strong> your mention of "under heavy-typed systems" since "it's probably not worth mentioning"?
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>How about a rewording re "be mindful of the cost of conversions". Some things are gonna be a wash either way and some are not.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Which costs do you mean? Expressing the conversion or running it?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Data entry - the complexity of getting <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s into the database in the first place (can be much more difficult if use of surrogate IDs requires ordered and procedural entry rather than declarative entry).
        </li>
        <li>
           Query specification - ability to syntactically supply an embedded tree (for purpose of join, comparison, or other domain math operation) versus having to give the ID, pointer, or name of a previously-defined tree. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Data maintenance - degree to which the RDBMS can automate sharing and cleanup.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>I posit that the requirement for </strong><a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> serves as a practical, distinguishing property between "<a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>" and "<a href="WhatIsData.html">WhatIsData</a>".<strong> That is, if a node is useless without a reference to it from another table, then that node does not represent data about our world or any other. (Note: Needing a reference to the node is fundamentally distinct from the node needing to reference something that exists in another table!) This provides a hard, defining characteristic by which one may judge which 'potential' </strong><a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s are to be stored "in the cell" vs. which are to be destructured into data tables. That is, if you would need to garbage collect the value, you can put it in a cell. No '<a href="EverythingIsRelative.html">EverythingIsRelative</a>' nonsense is required.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Please clarify. Whether something is "needed" or not is difficult to determine because it's based on the domain dynamics. For example, in relational things are generally not related by pointers, as they are in navigational DB's. The only required "pointer" to any given fact is being "in" at least one table, one could say. A "fact" becomes important when the customer/user wants that fact, not because it is tied to something (measurable) in the computer. We cannot tell by looking at computer-space whether a fact will be used or needed by domain-space at some future point in time.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               It's the other way around: we can tell by looking at computer-space where and whether garbage collection is occurring, and thus we can tell by looking at computer-space whether an array of bytes/tree/graph/etc. is a "fact" or a "<a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>". The need for garbage collection is an indicator, an objective measure, a distinguishing property, not a definition. After all, whether a tuple in a database is potentially needed is determined by the customers/users, and this requirement becomes reflected in computer-space. E.g. in <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a> very large strings are represented in separate 'string tables' to which references (surrogate keys) are held. When there are no more references to that very large string from customer "facts", the string can be (and must be, given finite computation resources) garbage collected. By so doing, we know that the string is a <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a> and not a "fact". The same principle can be applied to trees and graphs, and even to integers and doubles which can be of arbitrary width and precision.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Another issue, perhaps related, is that garbage collection is a implementation issue. If we had infinite time and space, then we wouldn't need garbage collection. From a practical perspective we need it, but we shouldn't dwell on it for our logical model until it's forced upon us by practical concerns.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               The logical model already distinguishes <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a> from "facts". I agree that, at least for <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, the logical model doesn't involve <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>, but when working at the logical level we don't need "practical" distinguishing properties like <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>, since we have the model itself rather than the implementation. Anyhow, if you were to follow your own advice, you wouldn't destructure complex <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s until "forced upon you by practical concerns" (e.g. a need to express a complex structure in SQL, or the need to guarantee certain indexes are present).
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Where am I doing that?</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               I assume you mean to ask "where am I not following my own advice?". You are violating your own advice <em>wherever</em> you destructure a complex <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a> as a first option or choice - that is, when you do so <em>before</em> you first demonstrate that it has been "forced upon you by practical concerns". 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Joins - in <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> a fundamental operation is join over equal <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s, so having surrogate IDs requires that you either guarantee by construction that equal trees will result in equal keys (i.e. perform interning by hand), or you must use special relational operators to perform equality tests between <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s represented by surrogate keys.
        </li>
        <li>
           Uniqueness - again, uniqueness testing becomes an issue if the same <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a> (structurally) can have two different surrogate keys (when forcing representation)
        </li>
        <li>
           Symmetry and Composition - whether <a href="GenericProgramming.html">GenericProgramming</a> can be implemented to reuse queries between different classes of <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s; clearly violated for joins at least if special operators are required to test for equality between <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>
           Not have to re-implement operators for each new "kind" of collection added. This includes custom (domain-specific) operators as well as generic ones. With structured <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s this is done by both <a href="GenericProgramming.html">GenericProgramming</a> (to share operators) and composing existing operators with conversion functions. With destructured <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s, collection operators are maintained by forcing every <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a> into a particular relational mold ahead of time, and non-relational <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a> operators are supported without any rewrite by a few generic operations composed with <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>'s <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>YOU are handwaving, NOT ME. -t</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Sorry, but I'm still waiting on any concrete examples to show me how to use relational operators designed for use over trees to perform simple equality and comparison tests. Until then, all I have is your word that it can be done. That is <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a> whether you're in blind denial of it or not.
            </li>

                   Technically, what you wrote was <strong>not</strong>, in any way, a "summary". It didn't summarize anything in the topic.

                   Nice allegations - just make up some principles then call other people's justifications "weak" for not following them. I can see how you gained your reputation. If I were to do some <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a> about "macro-rigor" and complain about being pointed to a "<a href="BookStop.html">BookStop</a>", and take pride in my "working man's ignorance" without any effort to study or better understand the concepts about which I express opinions, people would think I'm an idiot, too. And if I've made an "x is objectively better" claim without a clear and limited scope, it's more likely that you either failed to understand the scope or that you grossly misinterpreted a statement of evidence as a such a claim.

                    <li>
                       You made up: the "existence" of "macro-rigor", the "sin" of <a href="BookStop.html">BookStop</a>, and the "weakness" of "micro-rigor" as a justification.

                    <li>
                       Indeed it isn't. But until the general value of such concepts are widely accepted, it is also inappropriate for you to accuse others of 'violating' them. By analogy, your arguments are weak because they violate TheFooPrinciple.

Second, "macro rigor" is defined as providing a wide range of measurements in a wide range of metrics, as apposed to using a single or few pet metrics (such as only "provably correct" or only "lines of code"). Why does that idea bother you? -t<em></em>

                    <li>
                       First, I should have been less generous: your 'principles' are accepted by only one person, who calls himself <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, and thus are unsuitable as accusations. Second, you misrepresent yourself; you describe (in <a href="MacroAndMicroRigor.html">MacroAndMicroRigor</a>) macro-rigor as being used to support "net" advantage. There is no such thing as "net" advantage, and there is always a "narrow" purpose, therefore such thing as "macro" rigor neither exists nor needs to exist. And it isn't the 'idea' of macro-rigor that bothers me; it is your dishonesty and self-deception that bother me. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <em>You appear to assume the concept is Boolean. Let me reword the prior statement: your evidence does not provide a sufficient quantity and variety of metrics to even approach a thorough analysis from a practical perspective.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Okay, now that you've reworded your statement, it is more acceptable. (And the "always a narrow purpose" comment refers to the fact that there is always a 'purpose', a 'better for what', when it comes to analysis.) Anyhow, now that your wording is more acceptable, I'll simply ask that you defend them. So far points have been raised about sharing, queries, data entry, indexing, flexibility, ability to accommodate variations without re-implementing stuff, etc. and to me it seems that the typed approach comes up victorious on some and no worse on all others except for one-time implementation costs. How is this not a sufficient quantity and variety of metrics to approach a thorough analysis from a practical perspective?

                       I think you really don't know the meaning of that word, "anecdotal". And the points and fallacies of your arguments have been repeatedly presented for public inspection, here and on other pages.

        </li>
        <li>
           Oh, I agree that flexibility is a good thing right up there with performance, convenience, safety, security, etc. But flexibility doesn't "feel" very flexible if one needs to jump through hoops to use it efficiently, easily, safely, securely, or (in a broad sense) 'effectively'. For example: if you'd willingly trade flexibility for convenience, then you should be <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a> about the virtues of BLOBs rather than Tables, since BLOBs can represent anything at all (including Tables). Additionally, I'm unconvinced that "structures should be flexible" is an effective approach to achieve a requirement that "the system as a whole shall offer flexibility", though I'll admit to have never considered how to go about sacrificing all other useful properties for 'flexibility'.

           We don't want flexibility and a "sense" of order. We want flexibility and some "assurance" of order. And while making it easier to navigate and comprehend the models is perhaps a benefit, it is not one that has received much formal attention. <a href="ExpressivePower.html">ExpressivePower</a> doesn't need to appeal to ease of comprehension. Neither do safety, performance, security, portability, composability, etc. Those properties aren't about satisfying our psychological dependency for order. As far as the brain being a "big messy graph", perhaps you should study it; you'll find it is remarkably well ordered. Natural selection didn't favor BLOBs either.

        <li>
           <em>It doesn't receive much "formal attention" because it requires delving into psychology, which is a softer "science" than what math-heads want to or are capable of dealing with. </em><a href="SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple.html">SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple</a>, the purist's bugaboo.

        <li>
           Yes, you should, if both (a) you are willing to defend that point whenever you are called on it, and (b) my arguments are based on an invalid assumption that I'm a great articulator and documenter and yet I keep ignoring your counterpoints to these assumptions. OTOH, the claim that I'm a crappy documenter and articulator doesn't seem to be relevant to this topic, whereas <strong>your</strong> claim that we can (somehow) use relational tree ops and such to perform equality tests is among the primary assumptions upon which you're basing many of your argument. It is appropriate to repeat (and repeat, and repeat) the fact that your assumption has no valid basis every time you make an argument that depends upon it. Why? Because it is a valid and logical counterpoint to your argument until such a time as you offer sufficient justification to support the claim.

      <p>
        You do agree that tree-oriented relational operators can be added to a relational operation set (perhaps call it "extended relational"), correct? Suppose the tree operations only have to know what the "parent key" is.
      </p>
      <p>
        And you do agree that the "domain math" can be made separate from the relational system, as long as certain criteria are met and we are not overly concerned about "machine efficiency" (for the sake of discussion). Correct? Thus, there's no problem with comparing imaginary numbers since "imaginaryX = imaginaryY" is processed by the domain math engine and not the relational engine. The relational engine only has to know whether expressions evaluate to True or False (or perhaps whether equality is met). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, there is no logical reason whey tree operations cannot be added and keys cannot be imaginary numbers. Agreed?

      <p>
        <em>Eh? That is a very </em><a href="NonSequitur.html">NonSequitur</a> argument.

With dedicated types of structures, for every new structure we add, we have to re-implement potentially all 50 of these if we want them available.

           [If I define a type to represent a complex number, e.g., "Complex", I can define values as Complex(1, 2), Complex(1, 4), etc. If I need, for example, pairs of complex numbers in a database, I might define a table (using <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> syntax) as "VAR mytable REAL RELATION {Comp1 Complex, Comp2 Complex} KEY {Comp1}". I can now easily perform queries, e.g: "mytable WHERE Comp1 = Comp2" or "mytable WHERE Comp1 = Complex(1, 5)" and so on. If, however, I cannot define a new type to represent Complex, then I'm forced to define my table as "VAR mytable REAL RELATION {Comp1Real RATIONAL, Comp1Imaginary RATIONAL, Comp2Real RATIONAL, Comp2Imaginary RATIONAL} KEY {Comp1Real, Comp1Imaginary}". Furthermore, my queries become more complex. E.g., "mytable WHERE Comp1Real=Comp2Real AND Comp1Imaginary=Comp2Imaginary", or "mytable WHERE Comp1Real=1 AND Comp1Imaginary=5". And so on. Which seems more kludgey to you? A complex number is a very simple type; more complex types merely expand the difficulty shown above, complicate the implementation of the queries, obfuscate the intent of the queries, and potentially duplicate functionality throughout the system that could otherwise be represented <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> in a type definition. Can you imagine what these examples would look like if the type was a tree, or other complicated structure? Using a type, they wouldn't change significantly -- only the value selector would be different. Maybe replace "Complex(1, 2)" with "Tree(Node(1, Node(Node(2, 4), 3)))", but the rest of the code would be essentially unchanged.

        That appears to be almost entirely a linguistic issue. If you note on SMEQL's opening page, it allows virtual tables, including nested virtual tables. Also, it leaves things like comparison operators to the "domain math" interpreter. Thus, the comparison system/syntax is up to the domain expression processor, not SMEQL. One could use <a href="BrainFsck.html">BrainFsck</a> in the WHERE clause (or equiv.) if they wanted to. You appear to be mixing up mostly unrelated topics. If one wanted to add shortcut syntax for tree specification, they can. SMEQL doesn't prevent it. (I agree that some kind of name-space management or dummy-name-generation technique may have to be specified.) -t

        <em>They aren't unrelated. Why not?

      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I already admitted that one would have to violate *some* independence already. The heavier we want to integrate, the more we have abandon independence. That's life. It's a matter of balancing fundamental trade-offs.

        You face a similar problem with "types". If they share/integrate well, then they lose some or all of their "type-ness". And I'm not sure what surrogate ID's you are referring to. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What the? How does supporting effective integration and composition of types make them lose "type-ness"? As far as "surrogate IDs" I refer to those "foreign keys into the 'TREE_TABLE'" or whatever table you are using to maintain complex tree or graph structures.</em>

        I don't know what this is in reference to. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps a line of reasoning would clarify it for you:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your approach is to not store "non-trivial *structures*" inside "cells". 
        </li>
        <li>
           Therefore, assuming we have a non-trivial structure, it must be stored <strong>outside</strong> a "cell"
        </li>
        <li>
           Therefore, there must be a reference from the "cell" to this non-trivial structure which is "outside" the cell.
        </li>
        <li>
           You wish to store values in other tables.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>It may be the same table, not necessarily "other".</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Therefore, the reference we need must be a key into another table. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Options for keys are described in <a href="AutoKeysVersusDomainKeys.html">AutoKeysVersusDomainKeys</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Among those options is a particular class of auto-key: 'surrogate keys' describe something not really for the user to see.
        </li>
        <li>
           Given that we're working with <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s (i.e. complex structures that, only wholistically, describe individual measurements and domain properties) users shouldn't be particularly interested in the keys. So the choice of 'surrogate key' is justifiably appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
           I called these "surrogate IDs". This should not be a point of confusion.
        </li>
        <li>
           Next, assume we want to perform a query. It is, after all, something we do often in a relational system.
        </li>
        <li>
           And, as part of this query, you want to find all trees structurally identical to a particular other tree... perhaps a tree described by 'tree(1,tree(2,3))', or perhaps something larger.
        </li>
        <li>
           Further, for inductive purposes, assume we have one of your magical 'domain math' operators to perform the equality test. I honestly don't believe you can make it work, but I'll humor you since this argument doesn't depend on the presence or absence of that feature.
        </li>
        <li>
           This leaves us a problem: we must, somehow, pass into this 'domain math' operator both a description of the query tree and a description of the tree against which to compare it - a tree that happens to be in an external table referenced by a surrogate key.
        </li>
        <li>
           Now, I assume we do not wish to implement two versions of the tree-comparison operator: one for comparing trees to a query string and one for comparing and joining trees by surrogate ID. Thus, for symmetry, our domain-math operator either needs two surrogate keys into an implied table, two (table,surrogate key) pairs, or two non-relations (e.g. having us convert a tree into a string by use of a query).
        </li>
        <li>
           The first option, using two surrogate keys into an implied table, always requires the addition of a tree to the table just to perform the query. The second option <em>may</em> do so, but one might get around the problem with some suitably flexible domain operators.
        </li>
        <li>
           Either way, it is reasonable to issue this concern as a "Thing to consider" even given your elusive 'domain math operators'.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm (slowly) working on a pseudo-code illustration of joining on tree equality. But before that, as far as how "embedded" trees could work, my approach would be similar to how <a href="TqlColumnTable.html">TqlColumnTable</a>'s work: the parameter is really a table, but in different clothing. A "shortcut" syntax is created to generate a dummy or virtual table, sort of like an anonymous function in FP. Or it could be a pre-processor command. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose we did this to SQL:
      </p>
      <code>
        SELECT * FROM $tableShortcut("tree","1,2,(3,4,5)")<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Before the SELECT statement executes, the "tableShortcut" pre-processor or "generator" function command "runs" and sends the two parameters to a special function that may resemble:
      </p>
      <code>
        function tableShortcut(env[], params[]) {<br/>
        var indic = params[1];  // process indicator<br/>
        var shortcut = params[2];  // shortcut syntax<br/>
        var rt = env['result_table'];  // result temp table name<br/>
        if (indic=='tree') {<br/>
        while(row = treeParse(shortcut) {<br/>
        runSql("insert into % (%,%,%)", rt, row[1],row[2],row[3]);<br/>
        }  // we assume 3 columns here to simplify the example<br/>
        } <br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        We could make a dedicated tree command, but this approach is more flexible and can be used with graphs or what-not. If your domain is tree-heavy, then perhaps a dedicated function would be warranted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you clarify above the target schema, where all the surrogate keys are being produced and forwarded into other parts of the tree, and perhaps use a slightly less trivial input example? Also, it is unclear by looking how 'rt' is returned; is that name special in this </em><a href="MyFavoriteLanguage.html">MyFavoriteLanguage</a> pre-processor?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as "rt", I've used different languages that returned system-generated temporary file names. I don't know how they worked, I just know that such technology exists. Incrementing a sequential number is one approach. In this case it could keep track of the temp names and clean them up after the end of the query or query set. (Since they are virtual, there may not be a disk-cleanup step anyhow.) I'm assuming our "kit" provides that service, but we could have a dedicated function:
      </p>
      <code>
        rt = makeTempTableName();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        As far as how to turning a string expression into a data-oriented tree, there are many ways to do it and I don't think we need to get into that here. Get a compiler/interpreter book (<a href="BookStop.html">BookStop</a>, he he).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Saying "there are many ways to do it" still leaves among the "things to consider" which approaches can be achieved effectively and the development of a language to actually achieve it. However, I'll humor you on the issue for now; I prefer you focus on demonstrating the join for tree equality.</em>

          <ul>
            <li>
               Graphs would use references (graph ID's). We wouldn't need to create a different kind of tree thing.

           Most our tree operations, such as "treeEqual" shouldn't care whether we are using auto-number ID's or pre-assigned ID's. In different situations, one may be preferable over the other in terms of convenience or performance. This is flexibility at work. You have the same issues. You cannot create a RAM pointer to a parent that does not exist without goofy place-holders. Plus, what happens when you want to disk your trees? Do you reinvent a different node saver that is custom to trees and another that is custom to stacks and another that is custom to lists? That's not reuse. This is a rather nitty issue anyhow. I want to focus on software engineering issues such as productivity and maintenance effort, not how RAM pointers are managed. Further, RDBMS could use RAM address space as unique ID's if they wanted to, but most have found this problematic with non-transient info. It would be silly in general, but might make an interesting *option* for speed-sensitive apps. In short, it could play the same game you are playing. -t

           <em>For the most part, when it comes to value structures, the parents point to the children rather than the other way around. More relevantly, </em>'if the structures are supported by RDBMS, then the user need take no special action at all<strong> - no setup, no teardown, no inefficient workarounds. And for persistence, the problem isn't as great as you believe; one doesn't use RAM pointers; one uses pointers that represent either areas on the disk or an indirection thereof (i.e. representing files or arenas and an offset into them), plus memory-mapped IO. Use of memory-mapped IO allows one to get the speed of RAM+virtual memory, and an address space larger than any existing RAID disk. Finally, with user-defined types the language knows how to serialize all of the UDTs by their construction; nothing is reinvented per type. It is my impression that you're making accusations from ignorance. Anyhow, complexity of data entry is a productivity issue ("parse through the string first, count nodes, generate an intermediate structure, then table-ize it" is considerably more complex for the user than simply handing the RDBMS the </strong><a href="EssExpression.html">EssExpression</a>-like string).

        <em>Here's my list: the cons include:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>1.  Construction of trees since one needs to associate each node with surrogate IDs, the cons include deletion of trees since such garbage collection becomes the job of application code.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One can add a tree deleter to the "tree kit". Whether it's part of the DB or not is mostly a political/economic decision, not a root paradigm/philosophical issue. What does this have to do with "surrogate ID's"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Regarding your first point: adding a tree deleter doesn't make the problem go away. The problem is figuring out when to apply such a device and what can safely be deleted, especially when dealing with "sharing" of nodes. If you attempt to solve this problem generally, you'll learn you need to mark some tables as garbage-collected and others as 'root' - or at least that was my experience. This division of tables as collected or root only enforces the idea that GC is a dividing "practical" property/requirement between </em><a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a> and <a href="WhatIsData.html">WhatIsData</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As far as: "what does this have to do with surrogate IDs", well, there were two separate 'cons'. The only reason you're confused is because you butchered the original format of the list (by somehow merging the first two entries and the second two entries) when reformatting it for your response. The first 'con' with your approach is that you need to associate each node in the tree with a surrogate a IDs, by which I refer to the typically auto-numbered 'key' for each node. The second con is that you need to explicitly manage garbage collection. The third con is "any case where a 'tree' or part of one might need to be described as part of a query...". The fourth con is "comparison and equality and join operations between tree structures". I haven't a clue how you kludged it so badly.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           You munged lots of fragmented thoughts together here. I suggest you isolate them and flesh them out some more. Perhaps hard encapsulation would simplify "garbage collection", I don't know. But probably at the expense of easy sharing. Generally I model things with two kinds of tables, which I will call "domain tables" and "temp tables". Domain tables generally match the "real world" one-for-one: there's one record for each real-world equivalent. If it disappears from the real world or you don't want to track it anymore, then delete that record. Temp tables on the other hand are transient copies to simplify a particular process and disappear upon task completion or deadline. I don't know why you are getting caught up in "garbage collection". -t
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Blaming on me your inability to dissect a simple symmetric list where each item clearly starts with "the cons include" is quite pitiful. And the "temp tables" are solving an entirely different problem. If you think otherwise, then try applying them in a situation where the 'temp tables' need to carry and relate trees/graphs to trees/graphs in the 'domain tables', when adding/removing items from domain tables that relate trees, etc.</em>

        (I agree a tree-only DB may make expressing some such things easier, but the flip side is that you don't get to integrate them with relational tools/operations without reinventing the wheel.

        Let's collect a dozen or so semi-realistic semi-real-world examples and test it against those. Your examples tend to be contrived, seemingly as tools of exaggeration to magnify some real or perceived weakness. While perhaps a useful tool probe things, it's often a poor test of the tool/idea in reality. -t

        <em>How about you prove you can solve the 'contrived' example that has been pared down to its simplest form before you take on anything more challenging? Your attitude seems to be "if it ain't CBA, it ain't realistic", which I find petty and narrow-minded.</em>

        <em>However, a few realistic examples: (a) a database tracking SCTP messages allowing queries over sub-chunk data. (b) </em>MetaModelling databases where one is representing both data and inference rules (this is an especially big field), (c) a database of databases where each inner database represents a possible future (used in AI), (d) mathematics number-crunching databases where one wishes to perform joins over pairs of matrices or graphs that meet particular combined functional properties, (e) sets as identifiers (e.g. set of short strings) while still needing to join on sub-features like matching all but one element, (f) associative memory databases, where indexing and key access on graph structures is critical, (g) problem-solution tables in functional memoization, which requires the key be a problem consisting of a function and some arbitrary values, (h) behaviors databases for units in a video-game where one needs both variants, conditionals, structure, (i) source transforms and equality descriptions for patterns in data-driven optimizers, (j) a hardware database supporting drivers that needs to describe and classify hardware in terms of IO formats and the memory structure for DMI, (k) a hardware database that needs to contain complex-valued modifiers to optimizations or usage rules for specific pieces of hardware - putting in a string is option, but makes ad-hoc queries more difficult.<em> </em>

           How about we look deeper into the video game one. The others seem to have big domain knowledge learning curves.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>You'll be disappointed if you think "behavior databases" have a short learning curve. How about you look into the so-called "contrived" examples which have no domain learning curve at all?</em>

           So we have the ugly trade-off between realism and brevity in set-up? If we take the contrived ones, then how can we test usability in the real world? I don't seek to maximize ability to handle lab-toy problems.

           <em>Hmm? Well, I must have seriously mistaken your repeated complaints and whining here and elsewhere about 'contrived' and 'lab toy' examples.

        <em>That's a short list of semi-realistic semi-real-world examples, many of them quite realistic (seeing as I've needed them but had to go other routes like OOP).

        I've actually compared trees before by serializing them into text and then comparing the text for equality. Fancy relational or type systems are not needed to do that.  I agree it may not work in all cases, especially large trees, but for a specific little side problem, it did the job. -t

      <p>
        <em>Arguments of that form, where you appeal to completeness and complex workarounds as though it were a point in favor of your current system, are remarkably unconvincing.</em>
      </p>

        Complex? It depends on what tools are already available. That was not a reason to build a full tree kit/DB from scratch. I already had a serializer in that case.
