        Crossing The Line
      </h1>
      <p>
        A wise person once explained to me that in dealing with the multiple shades of gray that real-life usually presents, we sometimes have to cross a line to know that it's there. <a href="CrossingTheLine.html">CrossingTheLine</a> is the process of discovering a previously unconscious barrier, limit, or line. It can be a very helpful process, and is an important part of maturity - in both an individual and a community.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recent intense unpleasantness in the wiki may be a good example, at multiple levels, of <a href="CrossingTheLine.html">CrossingTheLine</a>.
