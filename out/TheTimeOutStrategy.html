        The Time Out Strategy
      </h1>
      <p>
        It is used by parents and teachers with children, and is meant to cause refocus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Used on this wiki, it might be implemented simply by the individuals needing time out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us say that you have read something with which you disagree and it is the result of the statements or opinions of one you disrespect, have had disagreements with, or you just plain don't like. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The most immediate urge is to reply with full aggressive rage and what you think is reasonable, sensible, and a proper response to what you feel shouldn't be here. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Step One: Time out on the response - don't respond immediately. If you must write a response right away, do it on your computer and file it in a folder called TakeAnotherLookTomorrow. [<a href="LetHotPagesCool.html">LetHotPagesCool</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Step Two: See what others have to say, if anything. Reflect and classify on a scale of from 1 to 10 where 1 is "Not Important At All" and 10 is "Essential for the Survival of Humankind". Put in a queue of other things that you may have in mind for yourself in your "<a href="ToDoFolder.html">ToDoFolder</a>" with subdirectories called Priority10,...., through Priority02. You shouldn't have a folder called Priority01, since no importance is seen. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Step Three: Continue your life and your activities in relation to the priorities you have established, not forgetting that there is life away from that keyboard in front of you. [<a href="TheInternetIsNotYourLife.html">TheInternetIsNotYourLife</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Let some time pass before the next steps - at least a day, perhaps as long as a week or month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step Four: If you feel that you must, review what was said, and what you may have typed on your computer but did not post. If you feel that there is a need to "set things right", and you have been successful in doing that in the past, do a rewrite based upon what has transpired in your own thinking and in the thinking and response of others. Perhaps someone else has already raised questions and has said much of what you had the impulse to say earlier. Treat this as a confirmation that "you are not alone". Post whatever response you have as a separate edit, at the bottom of the page with reference to what it is a response to. Don't delete things above this place as expression of disagreement, illustrate your disagreement in a "new space". Let both spaces stand on their own based on their correctness or sensibility as coming from the originator. Let others determine which is more sensible or correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step Five: Measure your success. Were you successful in influencing the discussion or causing a refocus by others on the really important points made, some of which might not be made by you. Then ask yourself, "Is it worth the time I have spent on it?" 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TheTimeOutStrategy.html">TheTimeOutStrategy</a> may be worth considering in other phases of ones life as well. Refocus and reflection on what is really valuable may be one of the most important, even if it is not most practiced personal strategies.
