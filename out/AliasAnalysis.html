        In the following example, your C compiler must assume that <strong>*x</strong> and <strong>*y</strong> <em>might</em> be the same variable:
      </p>
      <code>
        int munge (int *x, int *y) {<br/>
        int result = *x;<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          y = 10;	// might set *x, too.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        result = *x;<br/>
        return result;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The compiler can't optimize away the second load through *x.  <em>It can optimise away the first!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most C compilers assume that all pointers of a given type may be aliased.  Many C compilers also assume that once you take the address of a variable, it might be pointed to by any pointer of the appropriate type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortran compilers have much stricter rules.  In the above example, it would be illegal for the programmer to pass in two identical pointers.

        There is a new "noalias" keyword or some such in the new C standard.  <a href="http://kbs.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jutta/c/noalias-88.html">http://kbs.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jutta/c/noalias-88.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Betcha didn't know that C was a happenin' language, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
        No no no. There is no "no alias" in C; that proposal was ancient history. See NoAliasMustGoThisIsNotNegotiable for the history.

        You're probably thinking of C99 "restrict", by which the programmer guarantees that all accesses to the pointed-to item will be through the restricted pointer. Modifying the above example:
      </p>
      <code>
        int munge (int restrict *x, int restrict *y) {<br/>
        int result = *x;<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          y = 10;	    // guaranteed not to set *x
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        result = *x;   // can be optimized away<br/>
        return result;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But note that restrict does not solve 100% of all possible aliasing issues. For example, both x and y above might point to different locations in the same array. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Many C compilers for <a href="DigitalSignalProcessor.html">DigitalSignalProcessor</a>s treat "const" as a form of "restrict"; or can be told to do so as an optimization.
