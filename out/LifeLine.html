        <a href="LifeLine.html">LifeLine</a> has many facets. It is called this way because it is very important and precious. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the facets is <a href="TimeLine.html">TimeLine</a>. <a href="TimeManagement.html">TimeManagement</a> is very important and there is a time for everything. At a macro level <a href="TimeManagement.html">TimeManagement</a> in the <em>right</em> activity is more important than mere productivity (e.g. checkout  <a href="OneHundredRulesForNasaProjectManagers.html">OneHundredRulesForNasaProjectManagers</a>). Sometimes a person need to quiet down and discover / explore <a href="WhatColorIsYourParachute.html">WhatColorIsYourParachute</a>.

        Some people run a business as though it is their Life. That can be dangerous. Maybe it should be flipped around and treat <a href="LifeAsaBusiness.html">LifeAsaBusiness</a>.

        One suggestion for creating HotPages:
        Seek out old <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages, if these support healthy life strategies, enhance it a bit so others can share your discoveries. If they were <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> once and may have relevance, put a <a href="WhatHappened.html">WhatHappened</a> tag on them and see whether you can get some updated information. And if the once <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages are of little relevance, put a note on when they were last changed, and mark them with a <a href="DeletedUnlessDefended.html">DeletedUnlessDefended</a> tag for action later on.
