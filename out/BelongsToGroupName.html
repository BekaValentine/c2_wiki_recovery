      <p>
        This is a way which may be used to Group Pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always thought the <a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a> tag was a confusing way to group the Categories pages. I thought at first something like CategoryList would be better, but it would be ambiquous, since it could also refer to lists in general. Many of the <a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a> pages share a grouping characteristic more than they do a category characteristic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a solution which can be used in wikis, if not in this one:
      </p>
      <p>
        Tag the page at its bottom with something like:
      </p>
      <p>
        (for <a href="RoadMaps.html">RoadMaps</a>):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="BelongsToRoadmaps.html">BelongsToRoadmaps</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other possibilities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           BelongsToTopics
        </li>
        <li>
           BelongsToWikiGnomes
        </li>
        <li>
           BelongsToXpers
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then when one wishes to discover the members of the group, two clicks will give them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way this tag may be useful is by typing BelongsTo in the Search box:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Search]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Belongs To is another way of saying <em>Item in </em><a href="NamedCollection.html">NamedCollection</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="CategoryWikiImplementation.html">CategoryWikiImplementation</a>
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
