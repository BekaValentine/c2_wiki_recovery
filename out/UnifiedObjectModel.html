        Unified Object Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiStub.html">WikiStub</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A revamping of <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>. This page is for the discussion of concrete details of a <a href="UnifiedDataModel.html">UnifiedDataModel</a> (which is otherwise a synonym) and <a href="ObjectOrientedRefactored.html">ObjectOrientedRefactored</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic idea, since we starting from (off-the-shelf) hardware and not some abstraction (see <a href="ComputerScienceVersionTwo.html">ComputerScienceVersionTwo</a>), is to build Objects from the ground up using simpler objects to make a <a href="DataEcosystem.html">DataEcosystem</a>. A unified object model will make threading and async computing much more straightforward. Computing will be able to be delegated to individual objects and message-passing will be uniform. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we have multiple uses for many different generic classes, <a href="PrototypeBasedProgramming.html">PrototypeBasedProgramming</a> is the way because we can rename our generic prototype objects more descriptively for our <a href="DataEcosystem.html">DataEcosystem</a> with very little overhead.  (See a <a href="ClassesPrototypesComparison.html">ClassesPrototypesComparison</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> all your smallest objects (like strings of chars) into the highest object for which you have the highest "category" for <em>as a compound object</em>. In other words, <a href="ClotheYourData.html">ClotheYourData</a>. But this must be balanced with: <a href="DontContainTheUnknown.html">DontContainTheUnknown</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a <a href="DataEcosystem.html">DataEcosystem</a>, built in type/class inspection will become paramount. Python's help() built-in provides a good example, it lists the classes documentation string, all of its data members and methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now what kind of objects shall we build to form the basic modular components upon which most everything will be created? What are the fundamental forces?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An <strong>unordered container</strong> is the first type/class, which can accept any other <em>smaller</em> data type. It cannot include itself.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Since it's unordered you can make it a Bag (or Counter) which counts the duplicate items.
            </li>
            <li>
               An interesting note: A C++ <strong>class</strong> counts as the first kind of <strong>container</strong> as it's <em>designed</em> to be an abstraction of an OBJECT (and, by default, hides its members), while a <strong>struct</strong> could be considered its <em>ordered</em> cousin, anchored to its concreteness in memory. This is a significant conceptual difference.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The next obvious thing would be an <em>ordered</em> container like we're all used to with arrays and <a href="LinkedList.html">LinkedList</a>s, etc, but <strong>stop for a moment</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Apart from a NxN matrix, an <em>ordering</em> implies an unstated, often unconscious relationship in the data.  <em>This is not the pattern in a unified data model!</em>. (Even an Nx<em>M</em> matrix implies an unstated relationship to the data!).
            </li>
            <li>
               Break down your "lists within lists within lists" and make an object that describes your sub-objects and <strong>eventually you'll find either a single, atomic element or an unordered set</strong>. Back to point 1! 
            </li>
            <li>
               Remember <a href="AllDataRelatesToOtherData.html">AllDataRelatesToOtherData</a> and strive for minimizing all undocumented constraints on data (like an ordering).
            </li>
            <li>
               But in the mean-time, we'll need an <strong>ordered container</strong>: a "list" will do nicely.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A simple, linear <strong>label type</strong>. Our <a href="DataEcosystem.html">DataEcosystem</a> needs human-readable names just as the internet needed domain names, so they can be located. A "string" label associates to an arbitrary object. A dict is a set of these associations. Strings cannot be broken up and must be contiguous in memory.  If you need to read a long string from file, you're either doing it wrong or need to write an interface of smaller sub-objects, like "Line", or "PersonRecord". Methods useful for this <strong>label type</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>
               "change name". In-place modification of a name when space allows. When it doesn't, the name change request will have to be put "in the stack" and objects reordered as can.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A standard <strong>numeric type</strong> for computing on the objects we're creating. Integers (perhaps <a href="BigInt.html">BigInt</a>s) should be all that's necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Optional</strong>: a tuple type for making a serial stream for <a href="MessagePassing.html">MessagePassing</a> to Objects. Useful for passing data to threads.
        </li>
        <li>
           These types will fade or be relegated to sub-domains: complex, float (relegated to physics), file (after the <a href="LanguageIsAnOs.html">LanguageIsAnOs</a> becomes real).....more to come.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And look there, the same types suggested in <a href="UnifiedDataModel.html">UnifiedDataModel</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, now what will be some common object types to create from this from the get-go?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A TextFile, for example, is a list of TextLine's.
        </li>
        <li>
           TextLine could be considered a list of TextWords if you're doing language processing, or someone's nicely cloned TextLine as CommaSeperatedRecord and you can clone this to EmployeeRecord (for example) if you're doing <a href="TextProcessing.html">TextProcessing</a>, otherwise leave it as is, in respect for the rule <a href="DontContainTheUnknown.html">DontContainTheUnknown</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now:
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> f=TextFile("test.txt")<br/>
        >>> help(TextFile)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Need to define a standard versioning scheme so it's clear what DataObjects implement what functionality and behaviors.
      </p>

        Okay, I know I must be reinventing the wheel here somewhat. Can someone tell me what similar attempts to all this: CPAN? CORBA? are two things that are similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>CPAN is an archive of software, so probably not directly relevant.  Your ideas appear to be closer to CORBA, a standard (with various implementations) for creating distributed software by allowing objects written in various programming languages to be exchanged between nodes.  However, software agents may be even closer to what you have in mind.  See </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent''">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent''</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you.  I think, however, that with a <a href="DataEcosystem.html">DataEcosystem</a>, the programmers become the agents, working in the interpreter environment and querying/manipulating objects directly making more and more interesting objects in a <a href="MashUp.html">MashUp</a> form.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sounds like an interactive CORBA, which could be quite interesting.</em>
