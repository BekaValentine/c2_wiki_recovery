      <p>
        <a href="GoogleNews.html">GoogleNews</a> is a search engine that searches many participant news sites for the latest news based on key word searches. I use it to look for news related web pages with up-to-date information (created in the past ?couple years). 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use this for <a href="GoogleNews.html">GoogleNews</a> Advanced search (removed by Google in Nov2004) -> <a href="http://news.google.com/advanced_news_search?hl=en&num=100">http://news.google.com/advanced_news_search?hl=en&num=100</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The advantage of using <a href="GoogleNews.html">GoogleNews</a> (<a href="http://news.google.com)">http://news.google.com)</a> instead of the regular <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> is that I would not be getting pages that are created 5 years ago (e.g. search for Xml). And it is therefore very useful for beginners in a fast changing technical area, since it only returns news related websites that are recent.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="BeginnersMind.html">BeginnersMind</a> can not diffrentiate which is out-dated vs current relevant information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Disadvantage of using <a href="GoogleNews.html">GoogleNews</a> is that the News facility does not have as wide coverage as the main <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a>, and that because it is a beta users cannot count on its availability, nor consistency of behaviour over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not to be confused with </em><a href="GoogleGroups.html">GoogleGroups</a>, which used to be <a href="DejaNews.html">DejaNews</a>.<em></em>

        <strong>Example in late 2004</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>While doing a search on </em>'"SP2 patch" activex <em>' </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="GoogleNews.html">GoogleNews</a> comes up with 1 item, an article titled "How to Break Windows..."
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> has 616 items, but did not show the one listed in <a href="GoogleNews.html">GoogleNews</a> (from addict3d...) unless it is asked to repeat search and include omitted items
          <ul>
            <li>
               The <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> came up with this interesting reference to <a href="http://windows2000mag.com/Web/Article/ArticleID/43130/Web_43130.html">http://windows2000mag.com/Web/Article/ArticleID/43130/Web_43130.html</a> that is dated June2004, which is absent from <a href="GoogleNews.html">GoogleNews</a>
