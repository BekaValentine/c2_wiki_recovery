        The Humane Environment
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="JefRaskin.html">JefRaskin</a>'s project to "radically and rationally" improve the usability of computer technology. "The apparent ease of GUIs is deceptive...The GUI style of interaction, with its cumbersome methods (such as pull-down menus and scrollbars), has percolated to smaller devices such as PDAs and cell phones where GUI techniques are even less appropriate."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The primary method of the Humane Environment project is to design software systems, starting from an understanding of human cognition and the needs of the user rather than from a software, hardware, or marketing viewpoint. We design our environment to work with presently affordable and available hardware and with realistic limits on the amount of software development that can be achieved in a reasonable amount of time"
