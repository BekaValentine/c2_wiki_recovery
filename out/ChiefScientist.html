        In some organizations, a position they give you when you're too experienced to let you do real work and they sure as hell don't want you in management.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other organizations, a position where you get technical oversight over all of the real work and look out for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all organizations, a position with very little real power other than its "bully pulpit", little pay (as opposed to real corporate officers), and end-of-the-line connotations.
