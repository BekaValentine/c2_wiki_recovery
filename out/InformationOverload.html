        If you're looking for a present for your non-tech manager, buy this book. As the cover says, it intends to demystify the techno-jargon.
        But is does so in an intelligent way. I would be glad if our department heads would read this, but I would appreciate it even more if some of our techies would. Describes benefits and risks of the use of technologies in business. The best case for objects, reuse (and the use of patterns) I have seen in a language that can be read by people who might need them. -- <a href="MartineDevos.html">MartineDevos</a>

        This term has also come into common use recently, as a result of the amount of information now available to people at home and work. There's way too much information out there to grok, (see <a href="ArsLongaVitaBrevis.html">ArsLongaVitaBrevis</a>) and it's easy to become overwhelmed by it all.

        Is there a way to overcome <a href="InformationOverload.html">InformationOverload</a>? Some would say efforts to categorize and identify highlights in the information provide a way out. The <a href="OpenDirectoryProject.html">OpenDirectoryProject</a> and <a href="CategoryWikiFavorites.html">CategoryWikiFavorites</a> are two examples that come to mind.
