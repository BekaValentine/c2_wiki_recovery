        We Can Stop Spam
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WeCanStopSpam.html">WeCanStopSpam</a>.org was a vqwiki (another type of <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>) about an innovative community-based approach to stopping spam, based on people adding a simple link to the end of their emails. Details were at <strong>www.wecanstopspam.org</strong>, but that has now been hijacked by spamdexer as of 2005-02-21.

        <strong>Don't go there!</strong> You are only helping the spammer if you do so. The spammer is now benefitting from the <a href="PageRank.html">PageRank</a> the antispam was able to build up through links.  Spammers shouldn't benefit from this, please remove links to this site if you find them.  I have done so here.

        The 'simple link' mentioned is <em>Help free our mailboxes. Include http:// wecanstopspam.org in your signature.</em>

        Interesting, I wonder if that could work. Can't hurt to try I guess.

        <em>What's to stop spammers from including the signature in their delightful little missives?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing.  The idea is that in this case they are giving people a reference to an anti-spam site, which provides tools and ideas for stopping spam.

        <a href="http://www.habeas.com/">http://www.habeas.com/</a> have a similar idea, with one difference.  The text to be added to legitimate email is copyrighted, with a license for use that basically says "you can copy this on any email that isn't spam."  So, if a spammer uses it, they're vulnerable to legal action ... if you can get at them.
