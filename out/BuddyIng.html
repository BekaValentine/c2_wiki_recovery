        <a href="BuddyIng.html">BuddyIng</a> is an approach to programming that has components of <a href="PeerReview.html">PeerReview</a> and <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> or <a href="ContinuousReview.html">ContinuousReview</a>. <a href="PhranRyder.html">PhranRyder</a> first used <a href="BuddyIng.html">BuddyIng</a> in about 1990.

      </p>
      <p>
        Buddies are assigned or agree on the task (or tasks) they are to work on. For each task they agree on what to do to complete it. If there is any complexity they then work together until the complexity is removed. The buddies also have to produce the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. During development regular check points are used to show progress and <a href="PeerReview.html">PeerReview</a> the solution.
