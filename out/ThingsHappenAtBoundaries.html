        Things Happen At Boundaries
      </h1>
      <p>
        Wars, typically. Just look at the Balkans, where there are too many boundaries.

        Rainbows are generated at boundaries.

        This is something I've been recently been contemplating regarding the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> itself. Many of the long-running problems I've seen on Wiki come not from those who directly contravene the <a href="WikiSocialNorms.html">WikiSocialNorms</a>, but rather from those who flirt with their boundaries. Those who don't understand or agree with the social norms tend to leave quickly, but there's a small set of contributors whose behavior is right on the edge. That tends to lead to friction and Things Happening (at the worst, <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s).

      <p>
        In some cases this leads to growth (e.g., the <a href="DeleteOnceRestoreOnce.html">DeleteOnceRestoreOnce</a> principle grew out of one such episode), but often not.

        <a href="TheCulture.html">TheCulture</a> has a single organization, called "Contact", that deals with war, diplomacy, espionage, and other things that happen on its borders.  The name is a clear indication of the significance of boundaries.

        <a href="ThingsHappenAtBoundaries.html">ThingsHappenAtBoundaries</a>, therefore make sure you test the BoundaryConditions.

        However, <a href="ThingsHappenAtBoundaries.html">ThingsHappenAtBoundaries</a>, therefore it's a pain in the ass to test the BoundaryConditions.
