        To delete a CategoryX:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Remove all 'CategoryX' tags from the pages in the category.
        </li>
        <li>
           Wait a day to make the <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a> catch up and to be sure all links are gone.
        </li>
        <li>
           Finally remove the page CategoryX.
        </li>
      </ol>

        I am not bold enough to <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> a category out of this wiki. So I ask for a consensus before doing so. Since a lot of work goes into creating a category I suggest others do follow this when they want to delete a category. --<a href="MarkoSchulz.html">MarkoSchulz</a>

        <strong>Concur.</strong> Should we not also be discussing a convention on creating categories so that newbies (and folks with a delicate axe to grind) don't go willy-nilly creating categories? As has been mentioned, it sure is a lot of work to create one if the pages all get the new reference.

        Reasonable new categories should be allowed some time to see if they accumulate a number of pages which are brothers, sisters and cousins. If a category has been retained for a period of time (let's say a year or more), but it has not accumulated more than two or three pages, it would then seem logical, if usage is to be a measure of worthiness of a category, that it probably has been badly classified.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Disagree. Please don't create a category unless: 1) you have made a reasonable attempt to find an existing category that fits the page and not found one, 2) you have found ten other pages that fit the category. See </em><a href="CriteriaForCategories.html">CriteriaForCategories</a>.<em></em>
