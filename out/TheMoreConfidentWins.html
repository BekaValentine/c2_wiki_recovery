        The party that is more confident in a negotiation/confrontation/other situation wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is independent whether this confidence comes from boldness, determination, lies, present support or <a href="AbsentProxy.html">AbsentProxy</a>, better (safer) position, force or else.
