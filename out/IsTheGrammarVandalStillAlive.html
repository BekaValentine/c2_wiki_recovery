        Is The Grammar Vandal Still Alive
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> - is he still alive? Or is this site just being mangled by an unattended software process running on some box somewhere, while he rots in a box in the ground?
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know which creeps me out more, the idea of him being dead or the idea of him still being alive and obsessed with <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.

        Strange. This page was created just <em>before</em> something mangled a lot of lisp pages (removing parts and partly adding character sequences. All edits come from nycmspsrvz3ts432-dmz.mycingular.net.

        <em>Oh, gee -- somebody or something trashing Lisp pages? That's just too damn bad, ain't it? Perhaps somebody or something is getting tired of all the Lisp posing on this board. Whatever.</em>

        "Board"? "Posing"? You must be new around here.

        {{GV is not normally tech-topic-hostile that I remember, other than targeting a topic because it's popular or recent. Some of the Lisp messages suggest a different Lisp Vandal.}}
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, if GV were to restrict his bad behavior to Lisp pages on this board I might not object too strenuously. I think the Lispers and GV deserve one another. <cough>
