        <em>Permission is not needed to create a category. People will comment if they think it does not make sense. What is needed is sufficient pages to make it worthwhile having it. Say a minimum of 10 but that is just my opinion.</em> -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        Maybe <a href="CategoryHistory.html">CategoryHistory</a> is "close enough". There is also <a href="CategoryWikiHistory.html">CategoryWikiHistory</a> as well and even <a href="CategoryComputingHistory.html">CategoryComputingHistory</a>.

        <em>Sometimes it is good to have some related ones with links to each other. Anyone who comes across one will find the other one too.</em>

        I'd lean toward a smaller set of categories. Although, I wish this wiki had a "synonym engine".
