        Wilf Lalonde
      </h1>
      <p>
        Father of Brannon and Robin Lalonde; husband of Marla Doughty.

        Wilf is an excellent professor of (CS 95.) 202, 302 and 402 at <a href="CarletonUniversity.html">CarletonUniversity</a>. He is dedicated to teaching (at least, he was when I was at <a href="CarletonUniversity.html">CarletonUniversity</a>). It was not uncommon to find Wilf in the first-year labs working with students late into the evening.

      <p>
        Wilf was one of the founders of <a href="TheObjectPeople.html">TheObjectPeople</a>. He has an intense work ethic. Late into the night, working on a problem (the nature of which I forget), I remember asking Wilf if we could get something to eat. His response was <em>didn't you eat yesterday?</em> He was, of course, kidding. We ate and then returned to the office and worked well into the night.

      <p>
        Wilf is normally the smartest person in the room. Wilf was (and is) a strong proponent of <a href="NeedsDrivenProgramming.html">NeedsDrivenProgramming</a>, which has many parallels to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wilf was a provincially-ranked wrestler in high school.
