        Also note that the difference in the two categories is that a story is incidental, whereas stories are accumulative. Stories are not only about the topic of stories, but about how stories are used, how they are constructed, where they may be found, etc.

      <p>
        Use <a href="CategoryStory.html">CategoryStory</a> when the reference is to a single story, the <a href="CategoryStories.html">CategoryStories</a> for all other Story Relationships.
