      <p>
        Dennis Gore recently returned to the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation team as "team leader" (as if anyone could hope to lead this band of non-conformists) They are an awesome team who deserve all the accolades that can be heaped upon them.  For two years I served the team as Envy specialist and Library manager.  (You might say I "Envyed" them for the whole time I was there and it would be true).  As <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> would say '...I'm glad to be here'

        Denny probably thought some of us would see this.  But we never come here.
