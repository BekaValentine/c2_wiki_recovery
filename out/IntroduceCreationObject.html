        Introduce Creation Object

      <p>
        Refactoring Object instantiation to introduce fake constructors in VisualBasic6
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Problem</strong></dt>
        <dd>Bruce Mckinney mentions that one of the biggest failures in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> (actually now <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>) up to version 6 is it's lack of constructors. This causes the problem that once you create a new object in VB, it is in an invalid state until you initialize each field, one at a time, unless you have a convention like, say: "always call the 'Init' method after creating a new object.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        However, you have no way to impose the use of such convention and therefore you can't prevent users from using invalid instances of your objects.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Solution</strong></dt>
        <dd>One way I've found I can cope with that is by making all public classes in an ActiveX DLL to be <a href="PublicNotCreatable.html">PublicNotCreatable</a> and introducing one single GlobalMultiuse class which I call CCreator, whose only purpose it's to create and initialize the other public classes in the DLL. Notice that this is <strong>not</strong> a Factory Object pattern, and hence the different name. <em>(It may help to explain the difference for those who are only somewhat familiar with the Factory pattern.)</em></dd>

        <dt><strong>How to</strong></dt>
        <dd></dd>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Create a new Creator Class in your ActiveX DLL project. I use CCreator for its name as a convention, but you can use what you like. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Change your new class' instancing property to be GlobalMultiuse. This way you can use it's methods like they're part of VB's global functions. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Pick one of the other public classes in your DLL and change it's instancing property to <a href="PublicNotCreatable.html">PublicNotCreatable</a>. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Add a new public method to your Creator Class. I use the convention of concatenating "New" & "<a href="ClassName.html">ClassName</a>" for the creation method names. So if you're refactoring your "CCustomer" class you'd add a 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        Public Function NewCCustomer(sName as String) As CCustomer<br/>
        Set NewCCustomer = New CCustomer<br/>
        With NewCCustomer<br/>
        .Name = sName<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ' Add your initialization code here<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        End With<br/>
        End Function<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        method to the class.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Find and substitute every use of 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        Set obj = New CCustomer<br/>
        obj.Name = sValue<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        with 
      </p>
      <code>
        Set obj = NewCCustomer(sValue)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Since your CCustomer class is now <a href="PublicNotCreatable.html">PublicNotCreatable</a>, the compiler will warn you if you miss any occurrence of new.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Compile and test.
        </li>
        <li>
           Repeat for all your other classes.
        </li>
      </ul>
