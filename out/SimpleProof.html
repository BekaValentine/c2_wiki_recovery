        Simple Proof
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="RelationalWeenies.html">RelationalWeenies</a> claim that <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> is superior to the NetworkModel, some even claim that since the ObjectOrientedModel (what ever that is) is very similar to the NetworkModel, then, the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> is also superior to the ObjectOrienteModel... on the other hand ObjectWeenies claim that their ObjectOrientedModel is superiror, that maybe the NetworkModle wasnt that wrong, and that the Relational model is inferior. NonWeenies claim that there is no such thing as "absolutely superior" approach, they claim that <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each side of this discussion is always trying to convince the other sides that their POV is the right one... and, when asked to produce an ObjectiveProof, a lot of times they claim that experts have already published books or created products that show that their particular POV is superior, but they never (almost never?) show a <a href="SimpleProof.html">SimpleProof</a>, something small, that fits inside 1 or 2 printed pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, after time passes, it seems that producing <a href="SimpleProof.html">SimpleProof</a> becomes harder and harder, and explaining the advantages of each approach becomes so hard, that even the supporters of each side forget why their approach was superior, and <a href="TraditionOverridesProof.html">TraditionOverridesProof</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not that <a href="ObjectiveEvidenceNeverFound.html">ObjectiveEvidenceNeverFound</a>, the problem is that ObjectiveEvidence is just too complex, if you are asked to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Read a book with  more than 500 pages explaining the inferior approach,and then actually work with it with a project that lasts at least 3 months
        </li>
        <li>
          Read another book with more than 500 pages, explaining the superior approach, and then actually work with it with a project that lasts at least 3 months (reengineeering the previous project perhaps?)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What will most people answer?: No thanks, it is just too much work, I'll just keep working in my traditional way. Without <a href="SimpleProof.html">SimpleProof</a>  it is just too hard to show peoplet that YouFoundObjectiveEvidence
