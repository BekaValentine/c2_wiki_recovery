        Design Burp

        <a href="DesignBurp.html">DesignBurp</a> is an opposite to <a href="DesignShield.html">DesignShield</a>.  <a href="DesignBurp.html">DesignBurp</a> tells the world something about the internals of your design, hopefully something you want them to know.  See <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a> for an example of a <a href="DesignBurp.html">DesignBurp</a> that was considered useful.  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Useful to have a word for this concept - thanks. Java uses keyword "extends" when a class inherits from another class, and "implements" when it inherits from an interface. This would be another example of a <a href="DesignBurp.html">DesignBurp</a>. Presumably it is intentional, although it is annoying when you turn a class into an interface (so as to allow multiple inheritance) or an interface into a class (so that it can carry some implementation).

        Whether a burp is a good thing can be a hard judgement call. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        In some places you are supposed to burp after a good meal, to be polite.
      </p>
      <p>
        And leave some, to show that you weren't left wanting more.

        In the case of Java, I'm not so sure it's a burp. :)
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, it is important that users of an object instance are aware of its types. So the fact that type information (the inheritance hierarchy and the implemented interfaces) is exposed is good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that extending a class means that you've taken on its behaviour. Knowing that a Widget extends Gadget is important; it means that I can assume that a Widget behaves exactly like a Gadget, except for the overridden methods (which I'll have to check). That's good useful information. So the fact that Java chooses to highlight which type hierarchy happens to include behavior is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Java had multiple inheritance, then you wouldn't need interfaces; you'd just have classes, some of which would be purely abstract. With single inheritance, it's nice to know where the behaviour is coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if you have a class that you don't wish to expose, don't make it public. :)

        In addition to the above, it probably makes the compiler implementor's life easier. -- <a href="RobertWatkins.html">RobertWatkins</a>.
