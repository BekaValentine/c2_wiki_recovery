        I have worked as Software Developer for 12 years. I am currently working in Melbourne, Australia. My main experience is with C++, C# languages, building rich client applications on Windows and Unix platforms. I am married to a lovely girl named Laureey. We have a beautiful daughter Nerissa.

        I first started getting interested in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and <a href="AgileMethodologies.html">AgileMethodologies</a> in 2003. Since then I have endeavored to change my processes to be as agile as possible. Unfortunately my current team and work place is not as enthusiastic about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> as I am, which means that I often need to be creative in my agility.

        I have belonged to the <a href="MelbourneExtremeProgrammingEnthusiastsGroup.html">MelbourneExtremeProgrammingEnthusiastsGroup</a> and the <a href="MelbournePatternsGroup.html">MelbournePatternsGroup</a> for several years.
