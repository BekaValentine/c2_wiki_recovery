        Attribute Table
      </h1>
      <p>
        An attribute table in its simplest form is a <a href="DictionaryDataStructure.html">DictionaryDataStructure</a> of name-and-value pairs. A fancier version may have a schema like:
      </p>
      <code>
        Table: Attributes<br/>
        -------------------<br/>
        entityRef   // foreign key to Entity table or table name<br/>
        fieldName<br/>
        fieldType   // text, numeric, date, etc. (optional)<br/>
        fieldValue<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here is a variation that allows dynamic columns for an existing table. 
      </p>
      <code>
        Table: Attributes<br/>
        -------------------<br/>
        rowRef   // foreign key to record.<br/>
        fieldName<br/>
        fieldType   // text, numeric, date, etc. (optional)<br/>
        fieldValue<br/>
      </code>

        An <a href="AttributeTable.html">AttributeTable</a> is sometimes called an "EAV" table (Entity, Attribute, Value). They can be useful in cases where the user needs to add new kinds of attributes without calling or hiring a DBA or programmer. For example, in off-the-shelf applications, having the application add new columns on-the-fly may be risky and complicated. For example, the database engine used may require administrator access to add and remove columns, but the app may not be able to depend on that for a given user. An <a href="AttributeTable.html">AttributeTable</a> may allow similar flexibility without the need to add columns.

        I believe <a href="AttributeTable.html">AttributeTable</a> is a pattern (or anti-pattern) that only exists because current pseudo relational sql databases make it hard for people to alter their structure, after all, any database can represent is schema as an <a href="AttributeTable.html">AttributeTable</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the sql standard the main instance of the <a href="AttributeTable.html">AttributeTable</a> pattern it is known as the <a href="InformationSchema.html">InformationSchema</a>, sadly it does not cover every kind of thing that can be inside a database, and the databases that support it only do it in a read only way, and therefore it is impossible to use it to alter the schema, you can not for example insert records in to the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES table and have a new table created as a result. In other words if the <a href="InformationSchema.html">InformationSchema</a> were really supported in a read/write way by most current pseudo relational sql databases there would be no need to have more than one instance of this pattern in each database.

        <em>I'd like to see </em><a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a> for situations where "run-time" flexibility is needed. And please, let's not start another "type war" here.<em> -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no desire to start a war, I am not against <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a>, but I am also not pro <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a>, what I would like is to have a database that I can configure and make as strict or as dynamical as I need, or even mix paradigms if that makes it easier for me to implement the requirements of the user. I want to follow the <a href="MiddleWay.html">MiddleWay</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What's proposed in </em><a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a> does this, or at least allows such. For example, you could add a constraint to a table indicating that dynamic (new) columns are no longer allowed. This allows incremental lock-down. Perhaps I should give more examples there.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           if columns are no longer allowed, this sounds like the nanny state enforcing rules instead of the libertarian database allowing the free database a free column market. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>It allows both types of approaches. The default is free-form columns. See also </em><a href="MultiParadigmDatabase.html">MultiParadigmDatabase</a> for free-form tables and columns. I figure it's a better selling point to offer optional trigger-like validation (enforcement) rather than to so say "it must always be wide-open by definition".<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I feel that incremental lock-down is only superficially mentioned in <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a>...  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I fleshed out some of the examples. However, if you feel that heavy enforcement is important for your niche or design style, then </em><a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a> is probably not for you. <em></em>
