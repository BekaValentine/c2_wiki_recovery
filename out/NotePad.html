        <a href="NotePad.html">NotePad</a> is a plain text editor built by <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> and supplied with their <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> operating systems. It is extremely simplistic with regard to search and replace to say the least, but it's perfectly usable.

        <em>For the longest time, the fact that notepad's 64kb limit, as well as the fact that it didn't have decent shortcuts (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+F), were icons of the fact that Microsoft were all about highly visible features and not about everyday usability.  With Windows 2000 and XP, Notepad has been fixed.  Incidentally, around that time I learned to live with Windows + Cygwin, when I had to.</em>

        It is often claimed that more web sites have been developed using <a href="NotePad.html">NotePad</a> than with all of those fancy <a href="WysiWyg.html">WysiWyg</a> HTML editors.

        A notepad replacement is <a href="TextPad.html">TextPad</a>. I use it now instead of <a href="NotePad.html">NotePad</a>, particularly because I can edit many files at the same time and save them as a group. I can also reload the group in another session.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="NotepadPlusPlus.html">NotepadPlusPlus</a> and NotepadTwo are similar, but they're GNU freeware. I use them all the time: when coding in <a href="MatLab.html">MatLab</a> or <a href="VhdlLanguage.html">VhdlLanguage</a> for my electronics subjects, or when I have to program with Java. They support syntax highlighting and the works. See <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net">http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net</a> and <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html</a> to get them. (Addendum: As of 2012, Notepad++ has literally grown into an IDE, and a pretty nice and lightweight one at that. It has a DBGP debug plugin, which lets you step through your code and check your program's state within Notepad++. Combine this with the PHP Xdebug extension and you got yourself a kinda ramshackle PHP debugger -- but also lightweight and better than nothing. --DaNuke<em></em>

        Another good replacement is the CrimsonEditor (<a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/),">http://www.crimsoneditor.com/),</a> which also has good features to support programmers.

        <a href="NoteLens.html">NoteLens</a> is another alternative, blazingly fast, googlized searching, categorization, and other features.

        Since around 1999, I have used <a href="MetaPad.html">MetaPad</a> exclusively.  I simply do a physical replacement of <a href="NotePad.html">NotePad</a>, and the author has a faq that leads you through how to do this on most windows versions.  I have built a ton of websites with this little gem, and I won't have a computer without it.  So far I have replaced <a href="NotePad.html">NotePad</a> on Win98se, XP Home, XP Pro, and Vista Premium. See: <a href="http://www.liquidninja.com/metapad/">http://www.liquidninja.com/metapad/</a>

        Two more excellent <a href="NotePad.html">NotePad</a> alternatives are <a href="NotepadPlusPlus.html">NotepadPlusPlus</a> (<a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm)">http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm)</a> and Notepad2 (<a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html).">http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html).</a>

        The Windows builds of <a href="GeanyEditor.html">GeanyEditor</a> are also perfectly usable now. My TextEditorContinuum now looks like, from light to heavy, <a href="GeanyEditor.html">GeanyEditor</a> --> <a href="JayEdit.html">JayEdit</a> --> <a href="NetBeans.html">NetBeans</a>. Download the installer with or without GTK at <a href="http://www.geany.org/Download/Releases">http://www.geany.org/Download/Releases</a>
