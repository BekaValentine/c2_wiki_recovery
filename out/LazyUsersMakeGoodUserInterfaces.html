        Lazy Users Make Good User Interfaces
      </h1>
      <p>
        The energetic user accepts laborious <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> designs. The lazy one, in preferring to stay lazy, actually simplifies the lives of the other users. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

      <ul>
        <li>
           I dunno... most <em>lazy users</em> can't be bothered to program.

        <em>Sounds closely related to </em><a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a>'s definition of "laziness" as one of the three virtues of great programmers: <a href="LazinessImpatienceHubris.html">LazinessImpatienceHubris</a>.<em></em>

        It depends on how you define "good". An interface that shaves finger-strokes may be harder to learn.  It is hard to make a UI that serves both newbies and power-users well. In my opinion, the fastest UI's are well-designed CUI's. One can fly thru options and lists if done right. (Does not work for 2D or 3D graphical stuff like drawing.) However, the learning curve for an optimized CUI is long. The court reporter keying systems are sort of an example. --top
