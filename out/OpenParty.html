        Open Party
      </h1>
      <p>
        An Open Party is an extremely <a href="TrollFriendly.html">TrollFriendly</a> PoliticalParty:  one which invites even its opponents to join, cause trouble, and do whatever they can to disrupt operations, on grounds that when the party takes power it will need the capability to deal with these exact same efforts by its opponents, and so is best off learning it early.  It is one of the goals of <a href="OpenPolitics.html">OpenPolitics</a> to make such parties the norm and optimize regulations to make them function.
