        At one recent point: <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a> working for a web services firm, using <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a> and <a href="StructuredQueryLanguage.html">StructuredQueryLanguage</a>, while trying to grok the subtleties of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>.

      <p>
        Studied <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> at UTexas for long enough to prove programs and derive algorithms for <a href="AbstractDataType.html">AbstractDataType</a>s. Been programming for 20+ years. (Professionally for more than 4 years.) Finally attained my CS degree from HawaiiPacificUniversity.

        I'm now associated inextricably with the U.S. Navy. I got a sizable signing bonus, room, board, free education, and good health coverage. In exchange for this compensation, I do lots of interesting things. We'll see how long it is until they figure out that I can sling high-level CS theory around.

        Generally thinks that <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> is a good thing by whatever misnomer, disagrees with software patents, and will elaborate as necessary.

        <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> works include:
        CdrToaster, which got in a trademark problem with Roxio (a subsidiary of Adaptec). At <a href="http://cdrtoaster.sf.net">http://cdrtoaster.sf.net</a> you can see the fallout.
        FunctionalPhp Extensions - <a href="http://functional-php.sf.net">http://functional-php.sf.net</a> for more info.

        <em>can you give me a clue how to say "Kjos" please..?</em> -- <a href="RiVer.html">RiVer</a>

      <p>
        Yes, I'd be glad to. First understand that my name came from Norway, where the letters have some - interesting - pronunciations. The way I learned to say my name was not the way that my great grandfather would have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now then, the pronunciation guide: CH from church, followed by OSE from dextrose. I spoke with a Norweigian person on the way it would be pronounced there. Imagine blending a KH with an SH with a CH, then a tenth of a Y, then the U from push crossed with the OO from book, and the S that you expect.

        I note that in <a href="DesignWithInterfaces.html">DesignWithInterfaces</a> you've put a note at the bottom that you're monitoring the page. Are you using the AutoPcn?
