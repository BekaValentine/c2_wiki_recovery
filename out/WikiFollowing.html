        Wiki Following
      </h1>
      <p>
        The phenomenon where after visiting and/or commenting on a number of pages (and perhaps on revisiting) you get the feeling that you are being followed by another person who is commenting on the same pages and are not sure if it's coincidence or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a phenomenon of multiple people having the same feeling, not a criticism or request for change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often occurs through use of the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page.

        Do you ever get the feeling you're being WikiFollowed? (not in a stalker kind of way more like a game of hide and seek) I've been there and hopped about a bit generally leaving mucky paw-print trails behind me and noticed that the same names crop up a number of times. -- SusannahWilliams

        Sure, I get the feeling I'm being followed. In fact, <em>I know I follow</em> other people here. I follow a few people who I know are likely to have something interesting, maybe very erudite, to say. Sometimes <a href="WikiConversation.html">WikiConversation</a>s sprout up as we follow one another. I sense I got followed more when I was a newbie. (I've been here 2-1/2 months, and I feel oldie already.) But, yeah, following happens. -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>

        <em>Don't know if you've been looking at </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, but a lot of people spend their time here primarily looking at it often to see what edits have been made recently, reading and then possibly responding. Which is, e.g., why I knew you had changed your page and added this comment I'm responding to. Perhaps that's the phenomenon you're noticing. See <a href="WikiJunkie.html">WikiJunkie</a>, <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a> etc.<em></em>
