        Open Invitation To Participate
      </h1>
      <p>
        Actually each public wiki, is an open invitation to participate in creating and sharing new stuff.
        But this is not normally the case in the traditional business world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Companies have very restricted rules, whom they accept to work with and sharing the economic results.
        Now that wikis become more and more mature, they are on the threshold to integrate an income model
        for their wikizens.
