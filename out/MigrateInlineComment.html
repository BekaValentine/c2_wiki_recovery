        Migrate Inline Comment
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes, one <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> will write a lengthy treatise on some subjet matter, sign it, and post it to a page.  Another party then  will come along and insert a comment in the middle of it; challenging (in some fashion) the original content.  In many cases, this can be disruptive to the original post, as the flow of the original piece is broken up.  In extreme cases, this leads to an inline reply to the original comment, leading to more commentary at the place, leading to <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When this occurs, use the <a href="MigrateInlineComment.html">MigrateInlineComment</a> refactoring.  The inline comment, along with necessary context, is migrated to its own section below (a DiscussionSection) or on its own page (a <a href="DiscussionPage.html">DiscussionPage</a>) if appropriate.  That way, the flow of the original posting is preserved, as is the comment and any subsequent replies.
