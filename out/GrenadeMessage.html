        Problem: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Message objects are frequently used to let pieces of software communicate with each other.  One thread creates a message object, fills it out and puts it on a queue that another thread will get to at some point in the future.  Of course, these message objects need to contain some sort of context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take, for example, a conferencing system that has Conferences and Participants.  A new Participant connects to the system and a new Join Message object saying "hey, add this Participant to this Conference" goes onto the queue for that Conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contexts: <a href="MessagePassing.html">MessagePassing</a> in low level messaging systems, such as PostMessage between threads in <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supposed Solution: Just use a pointer to the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resulting Context: What happens if the Participant decides they don't want to talk to you and leaves before that Join object is processed?  The object doesn't exist, and you get a crash.  Can be hard to debug.

        <em> I think this is not an Antipattern. With the </em>NullPointerAntiPattern name, it would. This way it looks like a poor programmer wrote the message handler. <em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        When passing an object pointer through PostMessage as a parameter to a non-system message (i.e., with an ID higher than WM_USER), the message sender cannot free the memory after posting the message.  Either the recipient must take ownership of the object, or other mechanisms must be used to free the memory. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Note that the receiver must explicitly take ownership, it cannot be implied. There is no guarantee that the asynchronous </em>PostMessage will succeed. If the message queue overflows, the object will be dropped between the cracks.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           * No, sorry. In that case, PostMessage calls SetLastError(ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_QUOTA) and returns an error to the caller. <em>It's possible, but unlikely, that a thread could terminate after a message has been posted to it but before it handles the message.  That's getting into a pretty small corner case on most systems, though.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
