        Describe <a href="EdwardsMartinMollinedo.html">EdwardsMartinMollinedo</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have agreed to work with university level beginners with good language skills but beginner interpreters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students will work in pairs (one A language and one C language).
      </p>
      <p>
        We could combine consecutive and simultaneous interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have not yet agreed on the subject (the person who chooses the subject could also prepare the vocab).
      </p>
      <p>
        The report will be written in English.
      </p>

        (I hope I got it right). I'm not sure if we are located in the right website. Maybe we should move to homepage, where we were yesterday.
