        A question from the <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a> page:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Can vbUnit be used to test COM objects?"
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes, but it is focused on Visual Basic 6.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, VB6 can't actually use *all possible* COM interfaces.
        (But it can do "just about anything" you're likely to encounter.)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Q. Can you give pointers as how to build a COM object say in C++ that can be tested under VbUnit3? I built a COM object with IFixture interface and some test.. methods in C++. But it could not recognize the test... methods. In fact <a href="VbUnit.html">VbUnit</a> failed with Error.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think you'd have to implement IDispatch for COM "reflection" to work.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So you're writing COM components in C++, you want to write the tests in C++, and you want to use vbUnitThree to test it?  Why?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'd suggest that you try </em><a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>.  Also, try emailing <a href="BodoMaass.html">BodoMaass</a> directly.  I happen to know that he put together a C++ testing framework that he uses quite heavily. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am in an environment where COM objects are built using VB as well as C++. I am trying to go for an integrated testing framework. BTW, as I mentioned, I implemented a COM object with IFixture interface. I believe IFixture is derived from IDispatch. Anyways, my C++ COM object implements IDispatch. VBUnit seem not to like the COM object. I am trying with ITest and VBUnit seems to like the object lot better. But again I need to put in the tests under Run() method and lose the reflection of running any test... methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Are these COM objects being built with type libraries? And do you have tlbinf32.dll on the test machine? The Reflector class in </em><a href="VbUnit.html">VbUnit</a> iterates through the type library in order to find the testXXXX methods, so you need to make sure the typelibs are properly set up. -- <a href="EdSchweppe.html">EdSchweppe</a><em></em>
