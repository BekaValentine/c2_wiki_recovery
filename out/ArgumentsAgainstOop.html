        <strong>Summary of Criticisms Against OO</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As agreed in <a href="AcceptableCriticismOfOoOnWiki.html">AcceptableCriticismOfOoOnWiki</a>, below is a list of criticisms raised against <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>. The opposing twin of this topic is <a href="BenefitsOfOo.html">BenefitsOfOo</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that not every critic will agree with all of these, nor will all OO proponents agree with all the characterizations of OO given here. This is simply a collection of criticisms put forward. To keep this page clean, please put debates in the sections below, rather than embedded in the list itself. (See <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> "replies") I moved the longer ones below, but left some short ones in place. [<a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: somebody rearranged the replies into a single topic for pro and con replies and it's now very confusing and very long. (I'm angry about it.) Needs a rework.]

        <li>
           <strong>Inheritance</strong> - The real world does not form and change in a hierarchical way in some domains. Trees may be mentally "catchy", but they are too artificial to bend well with change and new details. See <a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a>, <a href="ThereAreNoTypes.html">ThereAreNoTypes</a>, <a href="SwitchStatementsSmell.html">SwitchStatementsSmell</a>. Even if domain trees were found, I am not sure they belong hard-wired in code. Generally one should not hard-wire non-trivial taxonomies/classification-systems into code. This is what databases are for so that one can get different views of the same data depending on use and context. (Note that many OO proponents use organizational techniques other than hierarchies. However, loss of hierarchies takes with it promises of something simpler than a big messy graph.)

        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a><strong> - Sub-type polymorphism suffers many of the same problems as inheritance: its "taxonomy" is artificial. Sets are seen as more powerful than lists of mutually-exclusive types or type hierarchies. For one, they handle orthogonality (current or future) better than polymorphism. However, the logical extension of sets leads to relational more or less. OO seems to introduce </strong><a href="DiscontinuitySpike.html">DiscontinuitySpike</a>s (more change effort) when something goes from IS-A to HAS-A. (There are other kinds of polymorphism besides sub-type, but sub-typing is the most common.) See <a href="PolymorphismLimits.html">PolymorphismLimits</a>.

               Grouping related behavior - There is no single "right" grouping because grouping needs are relative and situational. However, "task" grouping is usually more stable than noun-based grouping. Procedural modules can be used to group related functions. See: [in progress, prior material was deleted]
            </li>
            <li>
               Protection of "innards" - Database triggers, referential integrity, and stored procedures can provide similar protection on a larger scale and in multiple languages. On a smaller scale the innards are no more "naked" in procedural than they are in say <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> programs. See: <a href="GateKeeper.html">GateKeeper</a>.

           <strong>Concurrency Issues</strong> - We might distinguish OOP from <a href="ActorsModel.html">ActorsModel</a> in that OOP objects, in practice, use synchronous messaging (effectively, procedure calls) - i.e. an external 'thread' can be involved in a 'stack' of OO messages at once. This is good for performance-in-the-small, but is also a major source of concurrency bugs (deadlock, race conditions, reentrancy issues) and scalability issues.

           <strong></strong><a href="ReinventingTheDatabaseInApplication.html">ReinventingTheDatabaseInApplication</a><strong> - and poorly (slow, buggy, small scale, lack consistency properties and concurrency control of dedicated database systems) becomes a common </strong><a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> in many OO projects. Some OOP languages or libraries offer persistence (<a href="ImageBasedLanguage.html">ImageBasedLanguage</a>, <a href="HiberNate.html">HiberNate</a>, <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>) which can avoid some hassles, but one still ends up reinventing any ad-hoc query and crud operations (because <a href="DatabasesAreMoreThanJustStorage.html">DatabasesAreMoreThanJustStorage</a>).

      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Does Not Model Human Mind</strong> - The human mind is delightfully capable of holding many 'views' or 'models' of our perceptions at once - based on the patterns we need to emphasize for whichever problem we are solving. In a sense, an object in human perception is just one way of viewing the world. OO forces us to pick just one 'model' and entrench it in our program. The use of stateful objects and encapsulation both prevent us from effectively supporting multiple 'views' by functional or logical transforms. In a very real sense, objects are often 'intuitive' in a bad way that can easily lead us to error.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Besides this, how we view things is primarily a function of how we <em>learn</em> to view things - i.e. the patterns that prove most useful to us are the ones that stick in our brains. Because of this, even though fundamental cognition in humans is relatively consistent across the species (with rare exceptions - just as there are exceptions to the '2 arms, 2 legs, 1 heart' rule), such things as culture and prior work experience can have a significant impact on whether OO objects <em>feel</em> so natural to us that some might make hand-wavy allegations that OO models the human mind, or whether we might vehemently deny it.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>I'd like links to some evidence that "cognition in humans is relatively consistent across the species" if the environment is filtered out as a factor. I'm not even sure that is legally testable outside of Nazi Germany-like techniques. However, for the sake of this discussion, perhaps the nature-vs-nurture issue should be put aside and merely state that developers, as is, think differently. The cause of the difference is mostly irrelevant to this topic and perhaps a distraction. It's TMI for the topic at hand.</em> -t
                </li>
                <li>
                   Basic human thought processes, skill acquirement, recognition and learning and so on are the same across the species based on studies in labs and even under MRI. Most are even common across many animals. Study the subject in your own time if it interests you. Different human developers will think about different things - i.e. approaching a common problem from different perspectives. They may have different skill sets to apply, and use different tools to aide their action. But they do not <em>think differently</em> - not in terms of fundamental cognitive mechanisms. 
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>I'd have to question that. There are many ways to model processes and abstractions in one's head. Even notation-wise, sets can be modeled as graphs and vice verse. Music scores can be modeled as d-shaped marks or as time-versus-frequency bars (sometimes called "piano-roll view"). Neither is necessarily or summarily "wrong", just different. There is no good data on whether in-born individual traits will make one gravitate toward one or the other in the absence of environmental influences. Studies of separated-at-birth twins suggests that some of it may be in-born. -t</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   The topic line here is <em>"OO Does Not Model The Human Mind."</em> This claim is very different from <em>"The Human Mind Does Not Model OO."</em> An ability to model an OO process in our heads is a skill. Whether OO models our heads is a question of hard, low-level, cognitive psychology. People do have predispositions for different skills, but that isn't relevant under the topic line.

      <ul>
        <li>
           A paradigm to model human thought processes would involve recognizing ad hoc patterns in large bodies of data and taking action - i.e. closer to rules-based programming, or temporal logic programming. OO does much to hinder this. Of course, the question of whether a paradigm that models human thought would be a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> is distinct from the question of whether a given paradigm roughly models human thought.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Behavioral Tilt is Limiting</strong> - Behaviors are difficult to pick apart, analyze, share, compare... difficult to query in rich ways. I've read a paper describing a search engine where one could query a code-base with something like: <em>give me a function for roman numerals that, given the values 1,3,4,6 will return "I", "III", "IV", and "VI" respectively</em>. The search engine would then use 'roman' and 'numerals' as search terms in comments and identifiers and would test discovered functions to see if they fit the criterion. However, this sort of query becomes less feasible to perform as behaviors gain dependencies upon objects, global values, deep libraries, and preconditions. Simple data types are much easier to work with, share (with other languages and processes and tools), query, and reason about... and it seems reasonable, therefore, that we should put as much of an application into plain-old-data as we can make fit... and that we should find ways (idioms, patterns, language designs) that allow us to fit even more of an application into data. OO over-emphasizes behavior - as a first resort, when it should be nearer a last resort.

        <li>
           <strong>Lack of Modeling Consensus</strong> - There is a wide variety of opinions about how to do "OO modeling". Some tilt toward the "physical-model" birth of OO in Simula-67, while others prefer <a href="ResponsibilityDrivenDesign.html">ResponsibilityDrivenDesign</a>, for example. Thus, we have both a physical tilt and a social tilt of opinions. Yet others say that OO is simply a way to organize code and should not be a higher-level modeling statement. See <a href="OopGoesHalfWay.html">OopGoesHalfWay</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Lacks Normalization Rules</strong> - OO has nothing equivalent to relational <a href="NormalForm.html">NormalForm</a> rules and guidelines to produce consistency and reduce known duplication.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>King Noun is Artificial</strong> - OO generally assumes there is one <a href="PrimaryNoun.html">PrimaryNoun</a> per action or operation. This assumption is often artificial. There is no such identifiable force of nature or human interaction. The nouns that participate in any given action are often numerous and changing. It is sometimes said that one should group code by the most stable factors. "Task" or "operation" is more stable than nouns or entities for the most part. One should be able to swap/change the noun(s) without changing the calling code. This is <a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a>. <strong>In the real world, the relationship between nouns and actions is often many-to-many</strong>, and OO has generally been problematic with many-to-many relationships. <a href="ManyToManyChallenge.html">ManyToManyChallenge</a>.

        <li>
           <strong>Marries you to </strong><a href="NounModel.html">NounModel</a><strong> - Related to above, procedural tends to divorce (decouple) the code "shape" from the </strong><a href="NounModel.html">NounModel</a>. If the noun-model changes, the impact tends to be less than it would be in OOP. One may have to change query code, but they don't have to change the formal relationship between procedures and modules. (In procedural the <a href="NounModel.html">NounModel</a> is mostly in the database, at least in biz apps.)
          <ul>

        <li>
           <strong>No Empirical Evidence for OO</strong> - The case for OO is mostly based on <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> and "toy" examples that some feel distort the probability of certain change patterns. See <a href="OoEmpiricalEvidence.html">OoEmpiricalEvidence</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>OO is Xenophobic</strong> - In practice information needs to be shared between many tools and many languages and possibly many paradigms. Data-messaging is generally easier for this than behavior-based messaging, and data-centric approaches tend to rub against OO encapsulation philosophy. OO that force 'values objects' for messages compromise the <a href="EverythingIsa.html">EverythingIsa</a> object concept. See also "Standardized Attribute Management" below.
          <ul>
            <li>
               this seems redundant with the 'behavioral tilt'.

      </ul>

        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="TextbookOo.html">TextbookOo</a> is Deceiving<strong> - The simple structures and concepts in OO training material fall by the wayside in the real world, leaving one with a tangled mess that is nowhere near as simple and clean as the examples. Many managers are easily mislead by such examples. </strong><a href="ObjectOrientedDesignIsDifficult.html">ObjectOrientedDesignIsDifficult</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           OO is often <strong>hard to teach</strong> - Beyond <a href="TextbookOo.html">TextbookOo</a> examples, OO is hard to "get right" and/or it is tough to articulate in clear language and with open inspection why OO is (allegedly) better. Attempts to justify OO often have an eastern wispy feel rather than a western reductionalist approach favored by modern science.
          <ul>
            <li>
               This is not easily justifiable, and is a hand-wavy claim itself. I suggest we remove it.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Counter view: <em>That is because OOP should be taught with design patterns. Imagine teaching procedural programming without teaching the methodologies to attack problems (divide and conquer etc.)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Visitor is hardly a simplification technique, and there are no clear guidelines for when to apply which pattern. I find the existing guidelines much vaguer and open-ended than relational normalization techniques. (See <a href="DoubleDispatchExample.html">DoubleDispatchExample</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>If the confusion demonstrated on this page is any indication, OO is probably a lot harder to teach than it is to learn.</em> {meaning?}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Global Abstractions</strong> - OO tends to assume or strive toward central global abstractions, which are insufficient to handle a multifaceted, relative, and interweaving world. In contrast, <a href="DataCentricThinking.html">DataCentricThinking</a> tries to make one's view be supplied in an as-needed basis based on situational criteria.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Lacks standardized collection handling</strong> - OO has failed to create consistent collection/relationship handling techniques. How multiple objects interact and relate seems to be left up indidivuals with no consensus forming. Each language or shop reinvents its own libraries and conventions, and these often don't scale beyond the language or RAM without one ending up reinventing a database-like-contraptions from scratch. The "reinvention" of such <a href="CollectionOrientedVerbs.html">CollectionOrientedVerbs</a> for each and every class is seen as a violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> by some. It "smells" of a larger repeating concept that is not being extracted/factored out to a central protocol or standardized feature set. See <a href="InterfaceFactoring.html">InterfaceFactoring</a>, <a href="OoConflictsWithCollectionOrientation.html">OoConflictsWithCollectionOrientation</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>Standardized Attribute Management</strong> - I'm not sure if this belongs under collection handling or the "xenophobic" item or both. But a frustration I have with OOP is that one cannot study all the attribute assignments (set/get's) with other tools because they are "locked" into an app-language-specific format. If they were in relational form or XML, one could use a standard off-the-shelf table viewer or XML editor/viewer to edit, study, search, sort, query, report on, etc. the soup of attributes. Instead I have to rely on language-specific tools, if there are any. It's not logical for each app language or IDE to reinvent all those collection-oriented idioms (although the stubborn companies will try). -t

      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>OO runs too slow</strong> - I don't necessarily agree with this or even care that much. But others have made such a claim and so I shall at least document that fact that the claim appears from time to time. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Later on you say that persistence should be handled by the RDBMS... I can not imagine anything slower than that for the vast majority of the tasks you want to perform.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>To some extent I agree, but it is hard to call OO the "paradigm of the future" if you use it only because current chips are not fast enough to handle relational-based abstraction. Higher abstraction usually requires more horse-power. Most bottlenecks I encounter have to do with collection-handling issues, not processes themselves, and DB's tend to do well on larger datasets (if decent indexing, normalization, etc.) Thus, OO may be faster when processing 5 items, but not when processing 5000. The 5 item scenario is usually not the bottleneck anyhow. In short, it scales better.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some of the justification given for OO comes from lackluster specific languages or lackluster specific implementations. For example, <a href="CeeIsNotThePinnacleOfProcedural.html">CeeIsNotThePinnacleOfProcedural</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Fails <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a> of data and operations - If you split things into data and behavior, then you can apply the best data tools (RDBMS) to the data and the best behavior tools to the behavior. <a href="ComparativeAdvantage.html">ComparativeAdvantage</a>. OO tends to intermix them, dragging them both down to the lowest common denominator. For example, data schemas (noun relationships) are pretty compact as database schemas, but not so if dispersed around in application code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           OO forces one to think <strong>too much about "persistence"</strong>. In database-centric approaches, persistence is an almost automatic by-product of using the database. (However, some databases don't support temporary tables very well.) But in OO you are often forced to think about when and where to "save" stuff to disk, complicating the design. Modern caching techniques allow databases to use RAM or disk automatically without the app developer having to select one or worry about it. OO has yet learned to take advantage of such technology.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's too slow.

        </li>
        <li>
           Structured programs still have to talk to DBAMs and somebody has to build the DBAMs. OO doesn't make any of this different. The DB access code inside an object method looks just like the corresponding code in a subroutine. 
        </li>
        <li>
           OO being (allegedly) good at building an internal DBMS engine does not necessarily mean it is good at every other domain. (See <a href="OopNotForDomainModeling.html">OopNotForDomainModeling</a>.)
        </li>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Since most businesses store attributes in RDBMS, there is often a "<strong>paradigm conversion tax</strong>" between OO and the RDBMS in terms of complexity and speed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           OO does not offer any kind of <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a> short-cuts. For example, it usually takes a lot of code to iterate through or get summary information about each subclass of a master class. Some feel these kinds of things should be built into something that claims to be a "modern paradigm" or language. But encapsulation seems to disallow it from OO. See near bottom of <a href="RelationalBreaksEncapsulation.html">RelationalBreaksEncapsulation</a>. [Perhaps merge this item with "Lacks standardized collection handling"]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           OOP is for some reason a very productive "fad factory". It generates all kinds of buzzwords and ill-defined concepts that everybody is encouraged to use, but the why's, when's, and how's are not very well defined. This includes patterns, SOA, responsibility-driven design, MVC, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           OO is not suitable for writing application code. OO tends to focus on reuse, stability of the conceptual model and minimization of dependencies. These aspects are not very useful for application code. There are good reasons to use OO for writing reusable platforms or libraries. However, OO has been sold and advertised for all kinds of purposes, usually far exceeding the real scope where it can be applied. <em>Perhaps this can be extended in </em><a href="WhenToUseWhatParadigm.html">WhenToUseWhatParadigm</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>OO is Anti-Declarative</strong> - OO tends to view things as behavioral wrappers around state. This is against the idea of attribute-driven programming and/or specification. One could create OO frameworks that are mostly assignments to attributes, but this essentially turns it into a database of sorts, but without the query-ability of databases.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

           OOP can be <strong>too much set-up code</strong> for single-spot and single-time usage. Not every piece of code is meant or fit for a generic kit or tool, but is often very domain-specific and task-specific. See <a href="ComparingDynamicVariables.html">ComparingDynamicVariables</a> and <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a> for more.

      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Two themes tend to stand out: artificialness and inconsistency</strong>. OO is based on some ideas that are catchy on a small scale or in toy examples, but they don't scale to the real world well, requiring many layers of indirection to work around their limits. Lack of consistency makes it harder to understand and navigate OO designs and study OO in general. Every OO modeler ends up modeling their own head, so you have to learn a new head from scratch each time you encounter a new OO application.

        "A lot of us thought in the 1990s that the big battle would be between procedural and object oriented programming, and we thought that object oriented programming would provide a big boost in programmer productivity. I thought that, too. Some people still think that. It turns out we were wrong. Object oriented programming is handy dandy, but it's not really the productivity booster that was promised."

           Nothing wrong with that. <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> is valid evidence for the real world, but weak evidence.

           I disagree, but this topic is probably not the best place to discuss that. Tell me that you've <em>never</em> asked a friend for recommendations.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Of course I've asked friends for advice.  However, advice is not evidence, so I don't see how that is relevant.</em>

        <li>
           It depends on the context and/or community and/or forum. I'd prefer to let the reader decide which kind of evidence they want to keep or ignore rather than a self-elected filterer.

        <li>
           <em>While it may depend on context, it does not depend on community.  While a given community might be willing to treat it as evidence, that community would be committing a fallacy each time it does so.

           Yes, it's committing a "fallacy" based on commonly-accepted formal debate rules. But those rules themselves are <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Even if it were just based on commonly accepted debate rules (which it isn't, it's based on the fact that it's an unsound argument), it still wouldn't be an </em><a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> since no authority has been invoked.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           So the formal debate rules are not tied to <em>anything</em>? That's not an improvement. And who said this wiki "must" conform to formal debate rules anyhow? Nevermind, I don't want to argue about arguing anymore. That's what wives are for.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>"It's based on the fact that it's an unsound argument" is "not tied to anything"?  And I, too, don't think that wiki needs to conform to formal debate rules.  (Do you really want to wait till we have judges before we argue, and have only limited amount of time to form a response?).  But even outside of formal debate, a fallacy is still a fallacy.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               A fallacy is only a "fallacy" against a standard. If you are not clear on the reference standard, it generally comes across as confrontational (although, I suspect you wear that as a badge of honor).
            </li>
            <li>
               {A "fallacy" is any form of argument that is misleading, i.e. where extrapolation leads one to bad conclusions. It doesn't matter whether the conclusion is true or not. I.e. "the sky is blue because Alan Kay says so" is a fallacy, not because the sky isn't blue, but because the argument itself suggests things are true merely because Alan Kay says them. Are you using some other standard for "fallacy"?}
            </li>
            <li>
               "Conversation mode" generally is going to have unstated assumptions, overgeneralizations, and incomplete info. If you shout "fallacy! fallacy!" all the time during that, then you will be lumped with the jesus-shouters on the street corner. <strong>This is not court</strong>. It's better to ask for clarification or give an example that "breaks" a statement as written.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>None of those describe the base situation here.  You posted a quote, that is someone's opinion, as an argument against OOP.  There's nothing to clarify as the quote was perfectly clear.  Requiring a counter-proof (which is what "giving an example that 'breaks' the statement" is) is not required, shouldn't be required, and in this case would be quite difficult to obtain.  Simply pointing out the flaw in the argument is sufficient.  I don't go out of my way to offend people, but if you're offended by having the flaws in your argument pointed out, then I'm afraid you're just going to have to be offended.  (By the way, I've stated the reference standard twice now.  I really doubt I could make it any clearer by repeating it a third time).</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Well, I disagree it is an objective "flaw", as already stated. Too many people think things are "objective" when they are not. If you wish to produce a formal proof that it's objectively flawed, please do, but not in this topic.
            </li>
            <li>
               {You tend to call things "subjective" when they are not. That's just you railing against the English language. A fallacy isn't <em>subjectively</em> an invalid form of reasoning: there is no such thing as a form of reasoning that's sound/valid for Top but unsound/invalid for someone else - that is, where validity and soundness depends upon which subject is performing the reasoning. That said, I <em>suspect</em> your goal isn't to argue so much that <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> is sound/valid so much as to say that expert opinions have a place in a discussion such as this one - not as arguments, but rather in their capacity as (supposedly) informed opinions. Smoke is circumstantial evidence of fire. Negative opinions about OOP serve, similarly, as evidence that there are some flaws - not necessarily fundamental to OOP, but perhaps common among its popular implementations. Problem is, if this was your intent, you worded it poorly when you said: "<a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> is valid evidence"; you should have said instead that "ExpertOpinion (opinions formed in professional capacity by people with experience and information) can serve as strong circumstantial evidence."}

               {Those are very reasonable points.

But the above quote from <a href="JoelSpolsky.html">JoelSpolsky</a> is not from an article focusing upon expressing and justifying an opinion on OOP.

For example, his September 23, 2009 blog entry was very troublesome (I'd say my single biggest time waster is dealing with the code left behind by "Duct-tape programmers".  Yes, sometimes you have to do it, but trying to claim it's a good thing?)</em>

Pulling a quote out of context isn't a praiseworthy act, either.}

        <li>
           Where did I act overly emotional? And, I feel that software engineering is mostly about psychology, not universal principles of nature outside of humans (as individuals and as a group). Thus, objective metrics of the kind we find in other fields generally don't exist. See <a href="DisciplineEnvy.html">DisciplineEnvy</a> and <a href="PsychologyMatters.html">PsychologyMatters</a> for more. OOP proponents often make statements that imply objectivity, such as "OOP increases modularity". But they cannot deliver the evidence in an objective way. If they said, "it personally helps my mental modularity (<a href="MentalIndexability.html">MentalIndexability</a>)", then I don't have an argument. It's the implied extrapolation to all beings that makes me sit up.

You have <strong>faith</strong> that <a href="PsychologyMatters.html">PsychologyMatters</a>, but you don't believe any objective evidence is required to make this view a reasonable or convincing one.

Without any objective assertions, you can't disprove <a href="PsychologyMatters.html">PsychologyMatters</a> any more than you could disprove ReligionMatters in software engineering. OOP proponents, at least, use logic to demonstrate certain forms of runtime-<a href="ConfigurableModularity.html">ConfigurableModularity</a> that do not exist without the relevant OOP techniques (fundamentally: binding behavior to references polymorphically). You seem to ignore evidence that doesn't come with 'numbers', but that's because you blindly ignore that <strong>formal proof</strong> is at the very top of the <a href="EvidenceTotemPole.html">EvidenceTotemPole</a>. Of course, OOP techniques - binding behavior to references - can be implemented in any <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> system (and even many not-<a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> systems), rather than just OOPLs. Appealing to that doesn't change the relevant facts; it only says that you can do OOP without a dedicated syntax via a framework and <a href="SelfDiscipline.html">SelfDiscipline</a>. Anyhow, if you're going to say something "personally helps my <a href="MentalIndexability.html">MentalIndexability</a>", then you should be able to prove it in a psychology lab - i.e. performing recall and recognition and access time tests. And if you're going to claim some psychology benefit is "nature" (as opposed to "nurture"), then you had damn well better be able to provide convincing evidence for it - which means controlling for education and experience.}

           As software designers, we have to weigh boat-loads of factors, some which we have full control over, some we have some control over, and some we have no control over. These must all be weighed and acted upon. Software is a system, and the economy is a system. Whether we call it "technology" or not is mostly a name-game. Software can be ran entirely manually if one has the patience. The computer is not necessary.

           {Sure, there are many factors, some of which are more controllable (easy to predict and adjust) than others. That's a common property for "engineering". <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a>, in that sense, is far more similar to bridge and architectural engineering than it is to the economy. There are very few factors of the economy that individuals have even 'some' control over.}

           I dissagree with the bridge analogy. Physics is the primary force bridge engineers are up against and it generally doesn't change; but psychology is the primary force that SE's are up against (machine performance being the 2nd.) There's already a long topic on that and I'll link to it when found. -t

           {I think your disagreement flawed. First, you fell back on faith that <a href="PsychologyMatters.html">PsychologyMatters</a>, despite it being in dispute, without any evidence whatsoever - that's what we call <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a>. Second, aesthetics matter to bridge and architecture design, too. Third, the primary forces that SE's are up against are typically the same forces that bridge designers are up against: limited time, limited budget, requirements to interface/integrate with the outside world, and a wide number of implementation strategies to decide between.}
        </li>
        <li>
           The default is <em>not</em> that psychology doesn't matter. Most rational people will agree that the open issue is "how much". As far as the bridge analogy, I'll withhold commenting until I find the related topic.

        <strong>Binding Behavior to References (BBR)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        [sub-topic being refactored]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course, OOP techniques - binding behavior to references - can be implemented in any </em><a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> system (and even many not-<a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> systems), rather than just OOPLs. Appealing to that doesn't change the relevant facts; it only says that you can do OOP without a dedicated syntax via a framework and <a href="SelfDiscipline.html">SelfDiscipline</a>. <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And binding behavior to references existed long before OOP. If anything, later languages *limited* the binding to supply "discipline" above machine/assembler address pointer spaghetti. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What? Do you mean before it was </em>'called<strong> OOP? Because many people would argue that early use of OOP techniques began with binding behavior to references. And what any 'language' or 'syntax' does is provide some discipline to remove need for </strong><a href="SelfDiscipline.html">SelfDiscipline</a>. But 'BBR' was listed as a 'technique' and not a definition of OOP; the above should have read "OOP techniques - <strong>such as</strong> binding behavior to references - [...]". OOP means having references to program elements (<a href="NygaardClassification.html">NygaardClassification</a>), having behavior (including access to state) associated (polymorphically) with these references (rather than injected by the holder of the reference), and the ability to communicate references.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We both seem to agree that OOP at least attempted to introduce discipline to BBR. But this would imply that BBR is not by itself "OOP". OOP is an approach to trying to tame BBR.  The "problem" is <strong>managing them</strong> through navigational paths (OO) rather than relational and/or sets, not the mere existence. In other words, I don't like the way OOP manages the references, but am not bothered by existence of them by itself (if used appropriately). -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Agreed. Related: the 'no composer' argument at the top. The need to "manage" references in OO is painful, and evil. I prefer my OO mixed with a healthy dose of FP + </em><a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> + <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a>, along with an object-configuration builder to build large object configurations declaratively (no assignment operations, no managing order-of-operations). OOP has, without a doubt, many problems. That's true for any single paradigm.<em></em>
