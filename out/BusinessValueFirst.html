        Business Value First
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, the fundamental responsibility of Business in delivering stories to Development is to maximize business value. Recall that in the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>, stories are <em>prioritized</em> using <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a>, and rated for risk as well. This is BalancingRiskAndBusinessValue. High-risk stories that threaten overall project success are moved forward, even over stories of higher business value but low risk of complete failure. This risk-reduction rule is called <a href="WorstThingsFirst.html">WorstThingsFirst</a>.

        <a href="TomGilb.html">TomGilb</a>'s <a href="EvolutionaryDelivery.html">EvolutionaryDelivery</a> method (Evo) applies the same principle to the whole <a href="SystemsEngineering.html">SystemsEngineering</a> process.  Tom is currently working on a new book that proposes extending the applicability of the principles to the management of entire enterprises (as already happens in a number of his clients' companies).
