        Processes Should Not Force People

      <p>
        <a href="ProcessesShouldNotForcePeople.html">ProcessesShouldNotForcePeople</a> to obey certain rules. If they do, those rules are likely to be broken everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common example of a rule that I have seen people violate is the following style guideline:
      </p>
      <code>
        if(it_is_true)<br/>
        {<br/>
        do_something();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        is required instead of 
      </p>
      <code>
        if(it_is_true)<br/>
        do_something();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Rule:</em> All branches of conditionals should be encompassed by braces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The odd thing is that the developers who push this rule are the ones who most often violate it!
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of a rule that works within this principle is <em>indenting guidelines in Java,C or C++</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since emacs will automatically reindent a whole file in one command, this rule is easily obeyed by all programmers. If someone would make a mistake about indenting rules, then the files can easily be fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of a rule that violates this principle is <em>the use of naming conventions in C++.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In Smalltalk or Java such a naming convention would not be a major hardship. A person could periodically check whether he was following style guidelines. If he made a mistake and violated a guideline, it would be easy to fix. Just use a refactoring browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        In C++ there are no refactoring browsers, nor will there be in the near future. So fixing a guideline mistake can become quite hard. Some mistakes would be left standing. Eventually there would be enough mistakes that the guidelines go out the window.

        <em>Reductio ad absurdum</em>: An example of a rule that violates this principle is "don't write code with stupid bugs in it". People don't find it easy not to put bugs in their code, and no <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> can find all the silly bugs in your code. Therefore it's wrong to ask programmers to write code without bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is perhaps slightly unfair, since we <em>don't</em> exactly ask programmers to "write code without bugs"; but we certainly want them to try, and when a bug is found it needs to be fixed. Since this manages to happen despite the fact that bug-avoidance and bug-fixing can't be mechanized, it's clear that sometimes it makes sense to aim for things that aren't easy and can't be mechanized.
      </p>
      <p>
        An obvious difference is that bugs are bad in themselves, whereas non-adherence to conventions is only "secondarily" bad. But I think the above shows that <em>if</em> some convention is worth following then the fact that it forces people to do things they may hard needn't in itself make it a bad convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        I should perhaps mention that I think the underlying point is sound: conventions that are easy to work with smoothly are better. I just don't think all conventions that aren't so easy to work with need be bad.

        Bogus argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is another guideline which is, rules should be well-defined. Which means that the term bug needs to be well-defined. Care to try?

        The best definition of a bug: "something that fails the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> or <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>". So your rule is run <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> and run <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>. It fails to satisfy the rule <a href="ProcessesShouldNotForcePeople.html">ProcessesShouldNotForcePeople</a>; if anything, it supports it.
