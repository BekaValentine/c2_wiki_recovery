        Evictor Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        This comes from the Advanced CORBA programming in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> book. The Basic Idea is that a pool of resources (specifically CORBA Servants) are managed by something with the authority to passivate or persist them. Similar to the operating systems concepts for swapping out pages using LeastRecentlyUsed or LeastFrequentlyUsed first algorithms.
