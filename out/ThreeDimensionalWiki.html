        Three Dimensional Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        As the current <a href="WikiWay.html">WikiWay</a> cannot scale past a certain amount of interactions (see <a href="WikiMess.html">WikiMess</a>), the (approximately) 2.3 dimensional wiki hypertext must ultimately give way to its fulfillment of 3 dimensions. Call it WebDotInfinity. This is actually a problem with all community-driven sites. There's a scaling problem after about a hundred items. There is no algorithmic solution to the issue of combining "Most Popular" with "Most Recent". The only way to solve it is to <strong>add another dimension.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why is "Most Popular" an issue? It is for everyone to find their own interest. On this site the most edited can be found through </em><a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>, which reflects either on constructive debate (all positive) or a delete war (positive and negative alternating).<em> -- </em><a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Because some people visit only occasionally -- what will inform them of an interesting set of pages from months ago?  The other reason is for <em>scaling</em>.  On many sites with high daily activity, <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> gets overloaded and no one can tell what is interesting.]
      </p>

           The <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> solution to this is a WatchList per user.
        </li>
        <li>
           Here there are <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s who put a tag for the month on popular pages. Those are retained.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> is also moved to a page for changes in the month, also retained.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The above is true whether your data is the Internet or your <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> desktop. A 3-d data visualization model will obliterate the desktop metaphor of interacting with your data and make a <a href="KillerUserInterface.html">KillerUserInterface</a>. A <a href="UnifiedDataModel.html">UnifiedDataModel</a> will reinvent the <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> and unite the Internet. Forget RDF and XML, a 3-d visualization layer will let your visual cortex do the work of making relationships between data.
