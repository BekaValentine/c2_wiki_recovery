        Late Wittgenstein

        In <a href="WhatIsGoodOoCode.html">WhatIsGoodOoCode</a> I brought up <a href="LateWittgenstein.html">LateWittgenstein</a> while talking about definitions and measurability.

        A quote gleaned from someplace off the web:
      </p>
      <p>
        How should we explain to someone what a game is? I imagine that we should describe <em>games</em> to him, and we might add: "This <em>and similar things</em> are called 'games'". And do we know any more about it ourselves? Is it only other people whom we cannot tell exactly what a game is? - But this is not ignorance. We do not know the boundaries because none have been drawn. To repeat, we can draw a boundary - for a special purpose. Does it take that to make the concept usable? Not at all! (Except for that special purpose.) No more than it took the definition: 1 pace = 75 cm. to make the measure of length 'one pace' usable. And if you want to say "But still, before that it wasn't an exact measure", then I reply: very well, it was an inexact one. - Though you still owe me a definition of exactness.

        The main thread of <a href="LudwigWittgenstein.html">LudwigWittgenstein</a>'s thought after <a href="TractatusLogicoPhilosophicus.html">TractatusLogicoPhilosophicus</a> was quite different from what had gone before. Thus, <a href="LateWittgenstein.html">LateWittgenstein</a>. <a href="LateWittgenstein.html">LateWittgenstein</a> wrote PhilosophicalInvestigations, from which the above quote was taken. (69)
