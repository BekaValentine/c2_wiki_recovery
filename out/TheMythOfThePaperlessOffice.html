        I've recently read this book, and hope to post some comments on it shortly. Malcolm Gladwell wrote a good NEW YORKER article entitled <a href="TheSocialLifeOfPaper.html">TheSocialLifeOfPaper</a> which is essentially a summary of this book.

        The former president of the Color Printing and Imaging Division of <a href="TektronixInc.html">TektronixInc</a> (this division was later sold to <a href="XeroxCorporation.html">XeroxCorporation</a>) used to remark: "Trying to create a paperless office with computers is like trying to extinguish a forest fire with gasoline". Don't know who said it originally -- <a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>
