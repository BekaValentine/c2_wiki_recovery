        <a href="LifePatterns.html">LifePatterns</a> is intended to be a catalog of workable alternatives for people who have already invested a lot of life into their preparing, or performing duties in a career related to computing.

      <p>
        Hopefully there can be a lot of positive and practical templates developed for people to think about.

        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nearly sixty years ago, at the end of the second world war, most people who were alive did not have good prospects. They did have something that the modern twenty-first century did not have, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           much smaller population
        </li>
        <li>
           no globalization as we know today
        </li>
        <li>
           slower pace of life and less distractions
        </li>
        <li>
           most members of the society focussed on rebuilding
        </li>
        <li>
           more spiritual
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As members of the twentyfirst century we have these advantages (see note at end):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           More lessons from History
        </li>
        <li>
           Better education
        </li>
        <li>
           More technology, advancement in behavioral sciences
        </li>
        <li>
           more material wealth that can be used in a constructive manner.
        </li>
        <li>
           Longer lifespans that can be used for learning the lessons of life.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
           Statistically it was said during times of crisis, there are less people in depression.
