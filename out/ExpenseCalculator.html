        Expense Calculator
      </h1>
      <p>
        I wrote this calculator when I volunteered to work out the expenses for our 1981 ski trip to Jackson Hole. I wasn't even sure how to approach the calculation so I just started writing facts into a file. Pretty soon I realized that if I could just sum the groups and then bring those sums into other groups then I'd pretty much have it. I wrote a small AWK script to do just that and print a report. I finished the script and the report together. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> (copy&pasted from <a href="http://c2.com/doc/expense/)">http://c2.com/doc/expense/)</a>
