        Here is an example story that has various incarnations on the web:
      </p>
      <p>
        A manager was commuting to work in his personal helicopter. Unfortunately a thick fog rolled in and he was late for a meeting. The manager realized he was lost. He eventually spotted a tall building and saw somebody standing on the balcony of one of the floors taking a break. So he pulled up next to the balcony and called out:
      </p>
      <p>
        Manager: "Hey, do you know where I am?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Person on balcony: "Yes, you are in a helicopter hovering 30 feet from this building between the 27th and 28th floor."
      </p>
      <p>
        Manager: "You must be in I.T. Your response was <strong>technically accurate, but completely useless</strong>!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Person: "And you must be in management. I gave you a detailed, accurate answer as best I could based on your vague specifications, and still I get chewed out for not reading your goddamn mind!"
      </p>

           <em>Nonsense; many find it quite useful.  Something doesn't have to be useful to everybody to be considered useful.  You might think it useless--your prerogative--but that doesn't make it useless to me.  And--like gravity--the fact that you think it's useless doesn't mean that it doesn't apply...</em>

           It is an anecdote to illustrate that techies often focus on accuracy in their descriptions, when understanding the perspective of the audience may have a larger impact on the effectiveness of the results. It's an illustration of <a href="KnowYourAudience.html">KnowYourAudience</a>.

        <em>Another tale stolen from weblore:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson go on a camping trip; they set up their tent and fall asleep. Some hours later, Holmes wakes up his faithful friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Watson replies, "I see millions of stars."
      </p>
      <p>
        "What does that tell you?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Watson ponders a minute. "Astronomically speaking, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Time wise, based on the constellations, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three. Theologically, it's evident the Lord is all-powerful and we are small and insignificant. Meteorologically, it seems we will have a beautiful day tomorrow! What does it tell you?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Holmes is silent for a moment, and then he speaks. "Watson, you idiot, someone has stolen our tent!"
