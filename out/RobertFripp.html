        Robert Fripp
      </h1>
      <p>
        A RockMusician, well known for his work as a member of the band King Crimson.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fripp has also written down some of his thoughts about music, being a musician, and the nature of practice. These may be of interest to people who see a connection between music and software development as creative processes.

        <dd>A practice of any value will be three things:</dd>
      </dl>
      <ol>
        <li>
           A way of developing a relationship with the instrument;

        <li>
           A way of developing a relationship with music;

        <li>
           A way of developing a relationship with ourselves.

      <p>
        Fripp may be the author of the following quote found in the liner notes to King Crimson's album <em>Discipline</em>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Discipline is never an end in itself, only a means to an end."</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        And:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Relaxation is never accidental."</dd>

           Money is not a problem, only a difficulty.
        </li>
        <li>
           Any fool can play something difficult.

           If we can ask our body to do nothing for half an hour, perhaps we can ask our body to do something for half an hour.

           Listening is how we eat music. Hearing is how we digest it.

           Efficiency: the right amount of the right quality of energy, in the right place at the right time, doing what is right.

           A function of language is to disclose. An effect is to reveal.

        Not only a musician that some <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> enjoy the labour of, but also someone with interesting things to say about skillful, disciplined creative work that some wikizens find speaks to their own work.
