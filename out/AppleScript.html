        Apple Script

      <p>
        <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> is Macintosh and <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> technology for automating tasks within <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> aware applications and for communicating between <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> aware applications. It employs a somewhat English like syntax (see also <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a>) and is the bomb. A weakly promoted killer Mac feature... 
      </p>

      <p>
        The key ideas behind <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> are the <a href="OpenScriptingArchitecture.html">OpenScriptingArchitecture</a> (OSA) and the <a href="AppleEventObjectModel.html">AppleEventObjectModel</a>. The <a href="OpenScriptingArchitecture.html">OpenScriptingArchitecture</a> defines generic interfaces for integrating scripting languages ("scripting components") into the system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The integration goes in both directions: applications can execute scripts written in any installed language, without having to know which language it actually is. Scripts can control applications. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Control of applications works via the <a href="AppleEventObjectModel.html">AppleEventObjectModel</a>. The AppleEventRegistry contains "suites" for several application domains. There's a core suite for basic control that's appropriate for every application. There's a suite for text processing and more specific suites for mail and tabular data. In a sense, these are precursors to the <a href="DocumentObjectModel.html">DocumentObjectModel</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="AppleEventObjectModel.html">AppleEventObjectModel</a> also supported very expressive semantics for selecting objects, which to continue the analogy would be a precursor to <a href="XpathLanguage.html">XpathLanguage</a>. However, it was up to applications to implement those semantics, and implementations varied, leading to <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> developing a bit of a reputation as a <a href="ReadOnlyLanguage.html">ReadOnlyLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is really old stuff by now available in the <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> since around 1992. Unfortunately, whereas programming in <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> is pretty easy, programming for <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>, that is making an application really <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>-savvy, is unproportionally complicated. A lot of applications only have very basic <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>-support if they have it at all. Notable exceptions are, if I remember correctly, QuarkXPress, Adobe Golive (nee Golive Cyberstudio), an early version of Excel. <em>Also </em><a href="BbEdit.html">BbEdit</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is no longer really true after </em><a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>. Making a Cocoa application scriptable mainly involves exposing method names in an XML PropertyList<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, unfortunately, the promise of multiple scripting languages was never fulfilled. Apart from <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>, only UserTalk, the language in UserLandFrontier, fully supports the <a href="AppleEventObjectModel.html">AppleEventObjectModel</a>. <em>Not true, there is also a port of the </em><a href="SpiderMonkey.html">SpiderMonkey</a> <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> engine to OSA.<em></em>

        <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> has had some interesting innovations lately. Recent versions of MRJ (Macintosh Runtime for Java) on <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> 9 allow <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> to control Java applications -- the Java objects and methods of a running Java application can be made visible to <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> as objects and events. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> 10.1, <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> supports SOAP and XML-RPC (<a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/macosx/web_services/).">http://www.apple.com/applescript/macosx/web_services/).</a> Also, Cocoa applications may be getting scriptability for free, with <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> support built into the latest Cocoa libraries. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> is the only ScriptingArchitecture that I know about that allows recording. An application is recordable when all (or most) user-interface handling results in the generation of one or more <a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a>, which are directly routed to the application itself for execution. The <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> system can record these <a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a> in a script, which the user can then edit. This can be a very user-friendly way for a user to start scripting, but of the relatively few applications that support <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>, even fewer support recordability. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Applications that are scriptable, but not recordable, have an architecture something like this: 
      </p>
      <code>
        [GUI] ---> commands ---> [Model] <--- commands <--- [<a href="ScriptingEngine.html">ScriptingEngine</a>] <--- Scripts or <a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a> <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        but recordable applications have an architecture like this: 
      </p>
      <code>
        [GUI] ---> <a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a> ---> [<a href="ScriptingEngine.html">ScriptingEngine</a>] ---> commands ---> [Model] <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Can anyone describe how recordability can be implemented in C/C++ or Java applications via SOAP or XML-RPC, or Python, or JPython? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Would Python- and JPython-embedded applications have to generate Python source code, to implement the recordability pattern shown above? 
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        Recordability could be implemented in other languages and other operating systems just as the are for the Apple event model. Recordability is not an attribute of <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>--it is a property of the way that Apple events work. To implement recordability, you have to generate an "event" in a standardized format for every one of your application's scriptable actions and send them all through a standard channel. Then the "recorder" just has to examine each event that passes through the channel, and output it in the scripting language format. This mechanism is easy to implement in any programming language (assuming you already have scripting built in to an application). 
      </p>
      <p>
        But the fact that so few Macintosh programs support recordability is a good indication of how difficult it is to design an entire application around this architecture. To make it happen, you have to have a strict separation between user interface (which generates the events) and the backing model (which consumes the events), and you need to spend a lot of time designing your event model so that they work as desired no matter whether they are generated by UI or by scripts. Everyone agrees this is a good idea, but very few people actually take it to the necessary extreme.

        Ah... but tools can be (and should have been) created to do all dirty work for the developer. The amount of hand-coding required to use <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>/<a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a> in C or C++ is truly horrendous. <a href="PowerPlant.html">PowerPlant</a> makes it a little easier, but not much, and <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> ACS offers some classes that similar to what I wrote myself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My team and I have wrapped <a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a> and Java classes via JNI for a <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> C++ application using very similar sets of classes [kind of opposite of <a href="SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator.html">SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator</a>, which makes C/C++ code accessible from Java]; if we added a parser for an IDL, we could generate the necessary code at will (but instead we hand-coded it). 
      </p>
      <p>
        I should be able to take an IDL file describing my core "model" objects, annotated with suggestions for what the <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> equivalents should be (as in applescript "use several words" versus C++ "UseServeralWords"). The tool should generate C/C++ code to translate <a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a> into calls to my model objects (and handle return values), and generate the <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> vocabularly resource (there's no reason the tool couldn't generate sample <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>s as well.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        My team is make a Windows application scriptable and recordable using COM, ATL, MFC. Our app is scriptable from <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, JScript, VBScript, etc. using COM, and the VC++ IDL files in the project specify the alternative "vocabulary" used by the scripting languages to access methods of our core classes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One interesting testamony to the power of <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>/Cocoa on <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>, is that Cocoa apps are getting scriptability for free -- the developers don't have to do anything, as far as I can tell. Java apps under <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> 9 also had some free scriptability via MRJ.
