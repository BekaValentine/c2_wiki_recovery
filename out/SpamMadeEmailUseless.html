        Spam Made Email Useless
      </h1>
      <p>
        Email was once one of the most useful features of the Internet. Now it is one of the least useful because of spam, at least outside of intranets. Until the problem is fixed, phone and fax will remain popular.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do others currently deal with this?

        For one, I don't use either of the Evil Outlook Twins for mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        For another, I use a Perl script (PopFile) running on my (Win32) box to tag my mail using Bayesian filtering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet another precaution is that I no longer have my email address posted on any of my web pages in bot-readable form.
      </p>
      <p>
        The email client I use 1) is script-proof and 2) ignores out-of-band objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My spam is now down to manageable levels.  I no longer wake up sweating about adding 3 inches to my mortgage.

        I GaveUpOnEmail, although not because of spam. I use it only for product registrations and to receive a food allergy newsletter from South Africa. Therefore, I expect everything in my mail box to be mass mailings anyway and I glance at it about once every two months. -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>
