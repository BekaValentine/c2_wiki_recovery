        Format String Attack
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="FormatStringAttack.html">FormatStringAttack</a> is a common class of attack on a <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> program that uses either the stdio functionality of the the ANSI C library (most commonly) or another system with similar functionality.  The attack consists of providing a hostile format string which is then processed by the "printf engine", and which instructs said engine to do nasty things.  Many recent Unix exploits are based on <a href="FormatStringAttack.html">FormatStringAttack</a>s; some Windows exploits may use them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the following innocuous-looking program:
      </p>
      <code>
        /* print arguments */<br/>
        #include <stdio.h><br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        int main (int argc, char **argv)<br/>
        {<br/>
        int i;<br/>
        for (i = 0; i < argc; ++i)<br/>
        {<br/>
        printf (argv[i]);<br/>
        printf ("\n");<br/>
        }<br/>
        printf ("There were %d arguments\n", argc);<br/>
        return 0;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If you don't see the problem immediately, it probably looks okay at first glance.  But if someone were to install it SUID or use it as part of a network-accessible server, their box could be attacked.  The line that permits the attack to occur is this one:
      </p>
      <code>
        printf (argv[i]);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        printf expects its first argument to be a format string--an entity including <a href="InBandSignal.html">InBandSignal</a>.  The character % is used in printf format strings to specify output conversions.  Some output conversions, however, can modify the stack; the attacker can thus cause the program to exec a shell, giving the attacker the privileges of the running process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is the in-band signal.  The obvious fix is to use this instead:
      </p>
      <code>
        printf ("%s", argv[i]);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In the latter case, the only format string is "%s", which is harmless.  No matter what is contained in argv[i], it will all be interpreted as text.  Alternatively, one could write:
      </p>
      <code>
        fputs(argv[i], stdout);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        fputs always interprets its first argument as a plain string, not as a format string, so the vulnerability does not exist when using fputs.
