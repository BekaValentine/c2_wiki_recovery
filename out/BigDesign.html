        Big Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        An attempt to define <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> <em>on its own terms</em>, which means trying to say what it is in fairly attractive terms on a neutral framework.  Commentary on the attractiveness (or not) of <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> go to <a href="BigDesignCritique.html">BigDesignCritique</a>.  Corrections to what <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> actually intends to mean go here. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Few methods actually advocate solving <em>all</em> your problems on paper before you solve them in code.  <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> is a <a href="DevelopmentStance.html">DevelopmentStance</a> that is instantiated in several currently popular methods.  Here are some common features of <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> methods:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Formality.  <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> methods are decidedly not willy-nilly in their approach to software development.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Formalized design documents, including <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a> (UML) charts, detailed use cases, and formal sign-off procedures for decision-making.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Very high percentages of design-time (versus code-time) compared to the length of the release cycle, e.g. 30% or more, usually placed right at the beginning of the cycle.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A distinct design phase that is intended to capture all major decisions and most minor ones before any coding begins.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A system of responsibilities that tends to separate thinkers or planners of various sorts from doers or implementors, e.g. Architect vs. Coder.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Extreme attention to vocabulary, removal or clarity of all ambiguities, as if the natural language discourse associated with the above was a form of code, telling people what to do. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As a <a href="DevelopmentStance.html">DevelopmentStance</a>, <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> has made a strong historical case for itself, primarily by contrast to <a href="CowboyCoding.html">CowboyCoding</a>.  This stance is one of intense pre-meditation.  Historically, <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> has spent a lifetime criticizing the cowboy way, defending itself from that way, and ultimately justifying itself by its dramatic improvements relative to the <a href="CowboyCoding.html">CowboyCoding</a> stance.  It is still not the case that <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> dominates the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> developers are committed to maximum thinking up front.  The basic <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> contention is that decisions that are made using the cowboy way are dangerous for at least two reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
        First, because such decisions are likely to be trivially wrong, for their failure to take into account important factors that are not immediately obvious to the decision-maker.  Computer programs are big and complex, and many seemingly minor decisions can have huge impact on the program-at-large.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, because ad hoc decisions tend to be instantiated in a broad, vague, and distributed fashion, they are quite likely to be resistant to change, improvement, or maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This stance usually involves some companion views.  These are not so much a required part of the theory as they are an implicit constant companion to it, probably for historical reasons.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> seeks to control change, by obtaining early and generally once-for-all signoff on requirements and architecture. Most actual <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> methods have detailed structures for responding to the inevitable external changes that will occur, but these mechanisms are often seen as somewhat secondary to the process. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> sees any uncertainty as a danger.  If we don't know something, we can't reason about it.  By eliminating all uncertainty in our vision, we are providing the fodder for the planning process and increasing its likelihood for success. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> places a very heavy emphasis on writing things down.  This follows naturally from our desire to rationalize the software process.  Theoretically, written documents help to control change, make sure we've covered all potential problems, and identify uncertainties that need resolution.  Practically, written documents form a shared knowledge base, and can be used in myriad ways to support the <em>business</em> of developing software. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> takes advantage of the fact that some individuals are better-qualified to make some design decisions than others. So it seems only logical to divide the labor between those who are good at making these decisions, and those whose role is best defined as carrying the decisions out.

        <dd><strong>Do people equate UML diagrams with </strong><a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a>?<strong></strong></dd>
      </dl>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I don't equate the two. I like class diagrams as an architectural notation. I like use cases as a way to expose unfamiliar or inconsistent problem domains. I like deployment diagrams as a way to map logical to physical architecture. I use sequence and collaboration diagrams when CRC needs recording. I'm frustrated by the <a href="UmlCaseVultures.html">UmlCaseVultures</a> inability to represent the range of things I'd like to model, but usually I can live with that. I suspect that the reason I like these parts of UML is that I don't use Smalltalk, but a guy's got to make a living ...
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm actively attempting to combine the practices of <a href="XpAndUml.html">XpAndUml</a>, and I'll be putting up a document describing my take on this shortly. On the latter I bow to our wiki XPerts in all things, and hope they'll give it a hard critique. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess what I'm saying is that UML is a necessary evil on many occasions even though I see a great many <a href="UmlTotalFailure.html">UmlTotalFailure</a>(s). --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's exactly what I was looking for. Is there any other place where </em><a href="XpAndUml.html">XpAndUml</a> are discussed jointly?<em></em>

        Outside of wiki there is also:

      <p>
        Using UML is not ipso facto <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a>, in my view.  I frequently make sketches using Rose, print them out, then a few days later throw them away, which is hardly <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> behavior.  But due to both its historical development and its key advocates, UML is intimately related to <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a>:  The fact that the three amigos are <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a>'ers, and that UML is their baby, is inevitably going to make UML seem <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a>'ish in many people's minds.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        UML is not intrinsically linked to <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a>, and I think you would find that neither <a href="GradyBooch.html">GradyBooch</a> nor <a href="JimRumbaugh.html">JimRumbaugh</a> advocates <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> - at least as described on these pages.  (I happen to be a fan of SmallDesign, but I have a hard time watching people being untidy in their arguments.) -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

      <p>
        Alistar, would you agree that there is a difference between <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> and HeavyWeightMethodology?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm tempted to suggest that the OO HighPriests have, to some extent, managed to do away with HeavyWeightMethodology while keeping <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a>, at least in that they see everything as modelling.  Witness the very high formallity of UML and the very high <a href="PercentageOfDesignTime.html">PercentageOfDesignTime</a>.
        (Depending on whether you consider UML to be documentation or code.)
      </p>
      <p>
        --<a href="BenAveling.html">BenAveling</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would expect that a HeavyMethodology would contain a <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> as a component.  We no longer see a requirement for fully decomposed structure charts down to the leaf level before coding, so there is a lightening there, and they do recognize increments, iterations and prototypes. Unhappily, I can't see that the high priests of OO have gotten rid of the weight - witness UML Process and <a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a>, light though their proponents would like to believe they are.   <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>, <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> and I are all trying to counteract this weight, in our own ways.  I just agreed to be a series editor for Addison Wesley on a series of books on light-weight methodology elements.  The draft of the central book is emerging, the digest of it I posted at [1].  The point is that I disagree with the weightiness of even the amigos' methodological recommendations - or else they keep changing their minds depending on who they are talking to, or else they just haven't learned how to say what they mean.  The result is that when I show up on a project, I cringe at the amount of paperwork / screenwork people are being asked to do, without a sense of what that is about or how to detect diminishing returns. That being said, I would say that I now encounter all manner of variations about how much <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> to do, maybe I've been crossing cultural boundaries a lot, but I've seen the entire spectrum in the last few months. --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        My sense of the <a href="ThreeAmigos.html">ThreeAmigos</a> is that its not really a methodology in the true sense.  You can't map it to a DevelopmentLifeCycle, everything is just modelling and once you've done your model you've finished. Whether the modelling is done with a <a href="WaterFall.html">WaterFall</a> <a href="TopDown.html">TopDown</a> approach, or a CodeAndHack approach is never really specified.  That's why I thought the distinction between HeavyWeightMethodology and <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> was useful.  --<a href="BenAveling.html">BenAveling</a>  PS I liked your <a href="MethodologySpace.html">MethodologySpace</a> paper.

        Here's my question about <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> in its own terms. <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> claims to be formal. Does it care about formally provable correctness?
