        Leap Seconds Puzzle Answer
      </h1>
      <p>
        The question was, "<a href="LeapSeconds.html">LeapSeconds</a> can cause a day to be more or less than 24*60*60 seconds long. What else can?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Please put your answers here or so:

           Shift from daylight savings time to standard time -- <a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That was the answer I had in mind when I asked the question. Midnight to midnight, the day we change to daylight savings time is twenty-three hours long; the day we change back is twenty-five hours long. (This caused a serious problem in logging software on a project I worked on.) -- <a href="PaulChisholm.html">PaulChisholm</a>

        I <a href="HadThisPattern.html">HadThisPattern</a> recently as well (see <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/10/17.html#a91">http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/10/17.html#a91</a> ) It's funny, every time I see something like secondsInDay = 24*60*60, I always used think to myself "what about leap seconds?" but rarely about the daylight savings time shift. (This is an advantage of working with a library that has a robust representation of time, to increment a date by one day, do something like date.addDay(1) or date.add(1,"DAY") or whatever). -- RodWaldhoff

        These other answers are like the old puzzle/joke about using a barometer to measure the height of a building:

           Travelling VERY fast or sitting next to a black hole. <em>[Nope. All you can say is that two clocks can be made to disagree - that doesn't change the number of seconds they count in one of their days.]</em> Not really a fair criticism, you can say that about nearly <strong>all</strong> of these answers, including the "official" one!

           According to a news report, El Nino winds had a measurable effect on the Earth's rotation. Something like (?) 1/4 milisecond.

           If time should ever turn out to be quantized, and 24*60*60 seconds is not fully divisable by a time quantum (may not be possible, depending on the exact definition of a second). :-)

           Shift to a metric timebase. Lets shift to 10 days per (metric) week, while we're at it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Redefine the timebase so that c (the speed of light in a vacuum) is some convenient multiple of 10 meters per metric second.

           First convince the majority of people that anything is possible. Second, convince them via magic or science or religion that the day is longer. That's it. Reality is not so real!
