        Xp Guilt
      </h1>
      <p>
        One thing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> seems to be about is overcoming guilt over doing the right thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           On the <a href="FoldedZipperedProcess.html">FoldedZipperedProcess</a> page, <a href="RogerLipscombe.html">RogerLipscombe</a> mentions feeling guilty about writing code to meet QA's test suite.
          <ul>
            <li>
               XP says always write to the tests.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PairProgrammingMisconceptions.html">PairProgrammingMisconceptions</a> page discusses feeling guilty about programming with someone else.
          <ul>
            <li>
               XP mandates it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> and <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> seem to be about overcoming guilt over not being clever enough to do something the complicated way.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Again, XP mandates the simplest possible design at all times.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           People feel guilty when they aren't spending lots of unpaid overtime on a floundering project.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="FortyHourWeek.html">FortyHourWeek</a> says this isn't your problem, it's a symptom of a broken project.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Nobody ever reads <a href="DesignDocumentation.html">DesignDocumentation</a>, but everybody feels guilty about not reading it.
          <ul>
            <li>
               How about replacing it with a simple <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Programming teams frequently get guilt-tripped into committing to more than they know they can do.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>, and in particular the <a href="YesterdaysWeather.html">YesterdaysWeather</a> rule give programmers the courage to say when something can't be done with the time and resources allocated.
        </li>
      </ul>

        "Overcoming the guilt over doing the right thing" because you're reducing fear early.  I think your point ties in very nicely to <a href="ExtremeHumility.html">ExtremeHumility</a>, and <a href="ExtremeHumilityAndHowWeAchievedIt.html">ExtremeHumilityAndHowWeAchievedIt</a>. -- <a href="MiroslavNovak.html">MiroslavNovak</a>
