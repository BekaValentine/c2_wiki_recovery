Mockery is at least as antisocial and destructive a behaviour as any vulgar insult, yet you've repeatedly defended pointless mockery. There's no matter of principle here.</dd>

As <a href="WilliamGibson.html">WilliamGibson</a> observed, knowing how things work destroys the arrogance inherent in demanding things work the way you want them to.

        <dd>I've been at it [operating system design] for more than 5 years, and the platform I'm aiming for still hasn't changed that much. Actually, it still hasn't become mainstream. My target platform includes a 5 degree of freedom input device, a REALLY powerful 3D graphics card, and either a very LARGE monitor or multiple monitors side by side. Obsolete? Mmmm, not yet. In fact, even if I were extremely slow at implementation and didn't bother to do anything for the next 10 years, my design still wouldn't be obsolete. Now THAT's an OS design. Ambitious? Beyond your wildest dreams. And perhaps that's why you dislike it so much.</dd>

        <dd>I'm almost completely self-taught in computer science. Everything I know about design, UI and OS, was all self-taught, without exception. The OS course at university was contemptible. The textbook (<a href="AndrewTanenbaum.html">AndrewTanenbaum</a>'s misnamed OS Concepts) just as bad. I still congratulate myself on the wisdom and prescience of taking one look at that course and running the other way. . . . Oh, another thing I learned at university, probably the most critical thing, is to have utter contempt for university, computer science and programmers in general. A valuable lesson that.

Because I think people who spend all their time in vague pronouncements and useless navel grazing deserve to be verbally punished for it. And I'm not adverse to administering the punishment.

        <dd>An interaction designer, any good designer, is something else. You've got creativity there. You've got synthetic ability up the wazoo.  You've got analytical ability turned up to 11.  Any competent designer can run rings around an engineer for pure analytical ability. The only thing missing from a designer is technical details (things that can be learned by rote memorization) and the volition to torture oneself by learning them...  The reason we need engineers is because designers never, <strong>ever</strong> want to do engineering. Would probably kill themselves en masse before they let it happen.</dd>

Guided by its sense of smell, our Unix bashing has finally made it react. After more than a week, we'd given up hope of this animal making an appearance but here is a specimen for us all to marvel. This species of a bygone age, dating all the way back to an earlier epoch when mainframe dinosaurs still ruled the world, has hardly changed in succeeding eras.

Since it's not possible to say "any one of this", it's also not possible to say "any X and Y of these implies X is identical to Y" (ie, one and exactly one). As a consequence, security has no concept of number, neither cardinals nor ordinals. [20]</dd>

If it gets displaced from its position then that's not a big deal so long as it acts in a way that's appropriate to its new position and that another nanomachine replaces it in its old position. And this can be achieved by broadcasting uniquely identifiable signals in three dimensions with time-encoded information so that the nanomachines can triangulate. Basically, you need GPS. And of course, using DNA (globally distributed information used differently by each cell).</dd>

           Richard, for the uninitiated, is known to despise all <a href="WindowsOperatingSystems.html">WindowsOperatingSystems</a>, as well all forms of <a href="UnixOs.html">UnixOs</a>, including <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a>. For him to compare either to high-performance automobiles is astonishing.
        </li>
        <li>
           I try to keep this in mind whenever I read Richard's more inflammatory statements.
        </li>
        <li>
           A lovely turn of phrase.

           This page isn't just ranting about RK, though, some of us are just awed by certain gems of phrasology. Depends on the person and the quote. I collect fortune cookie sayings, too, but they're less interesting.
        </li>
        <li>
           Here we see the rare, self-proclaimed dissenter and contrarian who avoids dissent. A rare beast indeed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Here we find the <em>real</em> reason Richard dislikes C and its numerous derivatives.
        </li>
        <li>
           I personally find this the funniest thing I've ever seen Richard write.
        </li>
        <li>
           Here, Richard illustrates the difference between an (alleged) sociopath, and an ordinary, garden-variety asshole.
        </li>
        <li>
           Richard later defended his position in an interesting way: "As is pointed out in <a href="EconomicsOfInformation.html">EconomicsOfInformation</a>, all knowledge carries with it an opportunity cost. So the knowledge that Dan asks that I absorb would provide me with a net negative benefit; it would actually be destructive." One may agree or disagree, but that is a defense that could earn him tenure in a university philosophy department all by itself. :-) Whether that reflects on RK or on philosophy departments is an exercise left to the reader.

           The response to this was "I think ten people just tried to simultaneously insert that into <a href="RichardKuliszFanClub.html">RichardKuliszFanClub</a>. Hope it works out for you. Good luck."

           Costin at the time of this writing was indeed "satisfied" that RK's non-arguments were transparent enough to be self-discrediting

               Why buy a car whose full capacity you can't legally exercise? (well, maybe on the Autobahn) Even Chrysler Plymouths can apparently do 110mph+ (gleaned from speedometer), which is twice the legal speed limit on many American highways. It's just a pointless waste of gas and no good for the environment. -- <a href="TheerasakPhotha.html">TheerasakPhotha</a>

        re: 6 - I just found it humorous coming from RK.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Translation: I.e. ironic given that RK has been accused of being uncivilized, so RK's statement would then imply RK doesn't belong here. RK on, the other hand, is implicitly saying that he is at least sometimes civilized, and in any case, whether it applies to him is irrelevant to whether it is a true statement.]
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The other implication of 6 is that some pages aren't built upon an assumption of civilized discussion.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Unfortunately we do in fact have counterexamples.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>What does that mean?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Every flamewar/edit war is an example of a page built on uncivilized discussion.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Regardless, all pages here are built upon an assumption of civilized discussion.</em>

        <li>
           They <strong>should</strong> be, I agree.
