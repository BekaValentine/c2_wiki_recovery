        Inappropriate Intimacy
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="InappropriateIntimacy.html">InappropriateIntimacy</a> is a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> that describes a method that has too much intimate knowledge of another class or method's inner workings, inner data, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        These two methods or classes may be serving the same purpose, the similar parts should be extracted into a separate class using the <a href="ExtractClass.html">ExtractClass</a> refactoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe the other method needs to be in this class along side the current method: Use <a href="MoveMethod.html">MoveMethod</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe the other data needs to be over here with the current method: Use <a href="MoveField.html">MoveField</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe the inner data should be exposed instead of being private: Use <a href="EncapsulateField.html">EncapsulateField</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If it's a subclass method knowing or doing too much with the superclass, either <a href="MoveMethod.html">MoveMethod</a> the method into the superclass, or ReplaceInheritanceWithDelegation (<a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceInheritanceWithDelegation.html).">http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceInheritanceWithDelegation.html).</a>

        <em>But inappropriate intimacy makes it more exciting!  Seriously though, isn't this a restatement of </em><a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>?  Perhaps the knowledge of the workings of the superclass is new, as in not covered by <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>.<em></em>

        Perhaps, but this article was specifically linked from <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>, so I thought it warranted SOMETHING. Also, this code smell is known as <a href="InappropriateIntimacy.html">InappropriateIntimacy</a> in other circles, so I thought it warranted its own article -- even if we end up nuking everything here and redirecting to <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>. Thoughts? -- CMyers
