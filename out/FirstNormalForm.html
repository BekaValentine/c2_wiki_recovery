        First Normal Form
      </h1>
      <p>
        First Normal Form is a property of database tables.
      </p>
      <p>
        A table is in First Normal Form (1NF) when it has no <a href="MultiValue.html">MultiValue</a>d fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following table is not in 1NF:
      </p>
      <code>
        Make   | Model | Color <br/>
        --------|-------|-------<br/>
        Ford   | Focus | White <br/>
        |       | Blue  <br/>
        |-------|-------<br/>
        | F-150 | White <br/>
        |       | Blue  <br/>
        --------|-------|-------<br/>
        Toyota | Camry | White <br/>
        |       | Red   <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This table has multi-valued records, and might be used to store the various models and colors available to some makes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The previous table has been converted to 1NF as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        Make   | Model | Color <br/>
        --------|-------|-------<br/>
        Ford   | Focus | White <br/>
        Ford   | Focus | Blue  <br/>
        Ford   | F-150 | White <br/>
        Ford   | F-150 | Blue  <br/>
        Toyota | Camry | White <br/>
        Toyota | Camry | Red   <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note how the table now lacks a so-called primary key! What you must ask is ... why did you need that primary key anyway? I know! <a href="SecondNormalForm.html">SecondNormalForm</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You can't, in the general case, determine the </em><a href="PrimaryKey.html">PrimaryKey</a> of a table by looking at example data. A primary key is a candidate key that has been designated as "primary" as a matter of convenience. This table has one candidate key, consisting of all three of its columns. It <em>is</em> apparent from the example data that this is the only possible candidate key, so, if it's necessary to designate a <a href="PrimaryKey.html">PrimaryKey</a>, that's it.<em></em>
