           No it isn't.  You get that nice, cozy feeling only when working with nice, cozy AF signals.  As soon as you get higher in frequency, the schematics as everyone learns them become increasingly worthless.  You now need to introduce new symbology which increasingly mimicks physical production constraints.  Eventually, you find you need to express things in 3-D, since reality exists in three dimensions, but your drawings cannot.  So, we find ourselves with <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>s, but by no means ever does the territory and map equate. --SamuelFalvo

           That's actually quite irrelevant to <a href="TheMapBecomesTheTerritory.html">TheMapBecomesTheTerritory</a>.  If you're working with higher frequency, that can be used both in the design and comprehension of the map, and <a href="TheMapBecomesTheTerritory.html">TheMapBecomesTheTerritory</a> still holds true.  If not, then <a href="TheMapBecomesTheTerritory.html">TheMapBecomesTheTerritory</a> simply requires a less complicated map.  And a map is no less a map for being N-dimensional.

        "the map is not the territory" is useful because its a reminder of two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1) that my understanding of any situation is incomplete, and
        </li>
        <li>
           2) that reasonable people can view the same situation in different ways because they have different maps.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Adding a third:  that I can translate the map into an understanding of the territory is a "convenience.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Note, too, that people also have MappingFilters, which cause what's known in cartography as ProjectionDistortion.  This can be downright insidious.  -- <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>

        The first time I heard this statement, I was immediately reminded of the (in)famous koan, "What is the sound of <a href="OneHandClap.html">OneHandClap</a>ping?"  Both are expressions of the same idea. -- <a href="TimLesher.html">TimLesher</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I always wondered what the point of that koan was. *claps with one hand*</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ...I still don't get it. -- <a href="DanielBrockman.html">DanielBrockman</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Me neither. Or I don't see them as the same idea. To me, this is about not confusing different levels of abstraction (another version is "</em><a href="DontEatTheMenu.html">DontEatTheMenu</a>"). A map is an abstraction of the territory.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's hard to repeat the effect of the koan in written (or electronic) form, and I hate to even try, because it's a far more wonderful thing in person when you "get it".  
      </p>
      <p>
        But imagine me asking you, "what is the sound of <a href="OneHandClap.html">OneHandClap</a>ping?"  What do you do next?  If you open your mouth and words come out, that is incorrect.  That is the sound of you talking.  If you try to mimic what the sound might be like, that is also incorrect--that is the sound of you mimicking.  The only way to truly, utterly, and accurately convey the sound of <a href="OneHandClap.html">OneHandClap</a>ping is to do it (<em>as Bart did in one episode of The Simpsons</em>).  Hence the similarity to <a href="TheMapIsNotTheTerritory.html">TheMapIsNotTheTerritory</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea behind the koan, at least to my mind, is to come to understand, really <em>grok</em>, the difference between the representation of a thing (talking about a sound, for example), and the thing itself (the actual sound).  Of course, now on some level I feel I've cheated you of that... --tl
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's not the traditional interpretation of the koan (see </em><a href="http://www.metta.co.uk/Wds/wds7.htm">http://www.metta.co.uk/Wds/wds7.htm</a> for that.)  Some of us can audibly clap with one hand, making the koan harder to fathom.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Right. Clapping with one hand is not the answer. The point of all koans, including this one, is to get the student to grok what's up with zen, and as such, there is no right answer; almost any student answer will demonstrate a lack of grokking.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Maybe I'm reading it differently, but I don't think that's entirely incompatible with my learning, either.  Maybe I'm being too obtuse with the above (note that I didn't <em>give</em> the answer, just walked to a step away from it, but that's about as close as I can get).  
      </p>
      <p>
        I've often believed that parroting Suzuki's famous single-word answer, in itself renders the answer incorrect. --tl
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Clapping with one hand is not the answer.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we're on to something... the response I'd hoped to get is "but you <strong>can't</strong> clap with one hand--that doesn't make sense".  That leads us down the path of "well, then how could you expect to describe an answer that is no-answer?"  No-answer doesn't have an abstraction (oral description, written explanation, answer key in the back of the book) that we can use to simplify away its difficulty--which brings us back to why this page reminded me of the koan.  Anyway, feel free to delete or move this thread mess to another page.  I think it's TargetReached. --tl

        This is not as fuzzy a concept as it may sound.  The map <em>really</em> is not the territory.  Sometimes the map's representation of the territory is really good.  Sometimes it really sucks -- as is seen with a badly-drawn map.  Sometimes it's because the friggin' territory changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The representation is not the thing.  And because it is not the thing, the assumption that the representation is accurate or even meaningful can be misleading -- to the extent that actual harm can result.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use mapping software.  Sometimes it's saved me hours.  Usually it's pretty good.  It's an <em>adequate</em> representation.  Occasionally it fails, but I'm aware enough of the disparity that I no longer get suckered into the really egregious navigation errors that <em>could</em> result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point is not that you shouldn't use maps, but that, in addition to having maps as accurate as possible, it is equally important (more important?) to have an appreciation for the <em>degree</em> to which the map can be trusted, and how to detect the places where the map's rendering of reality goes awry.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, of course, it helps if you have some way of amending your map when you find it veers from its landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, this is also a metaphor, and it's even profound, but it's not mystical.

        (This goes hand-in-hand with another principle:  ObservationWithoutAssumption, also known as ObservingTheObvious.  Discussed obliquely in Heinlein's exposition of the FairWitness.  There are times when you <strong>just want the facts</strong> without all the baggage of "what does it all mean" so that you may see <em>all</em> the data, rather than filtering it against beliefs and presuppositions.)

        On Exactitude in Science . . . In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.
