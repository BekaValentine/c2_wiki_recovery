        (Scale: 10 persons, appr. $1,500,000CAD)
        (Environment: Digital Alpha 4100, Digital UNIX, Windows NT, Oracle 7 database)
        (Tools: Oracle Designer, Developer, PL/SQL, Pro*C, DEC C/C++)
        I joined this project from its early beginning and worked on it for almost 2 years. It's a typical industrial process control system. We went to Sweden for software implementation with the cooperation of ABB Automation. I learnt a lot from this project.
        Main tasks include developing client-side displays using ORACLE Forms/Reports, writing TCP/IP socket communication programs using C/C++ and ORACLE Pro*C in UNIX system, writing low-level process control communication program based on ABB IMS800 system.

        (Scale: 5 persons, appr. $240,000CAD)
        (Environment: HP PC Server, SCO UNIX, Oracle 7 database) 
        (Tools: <a href="PowerBuilder.html">PowerBuilder</a>, MapInfo, Oracle PL/SQL, Pro*C, C/C++)
        This is my first project after graduation. It's a very interesting project that we delivered our users a very convenient and straitforward stock house managing system that they can 'move' heavy coil strips just by drag-and-drop in Windows screen. 
        My responsibilities include developing user displays and reports using <a href="PowerBuilder.html">PowerBuilder</a> and MapInfo, writing TCP/IP socket communication programs using C/C++ and ORACLE Pro*C, and writing stored procedures, triggers, and packages in Oracle database.
