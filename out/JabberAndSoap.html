        Jabber And Soap
      </h1>
      <p>
        Web services are young. Let's admit that and get critical about the technology and standards that are being proposed from all fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the core of SOAP, we have <a href="RemoteProcedureCall.html">RemoteProcedureCall</a>. But this conclusion is hardle fair. 
      </p>
      <p>
        SOAP is an <a href="InterfaceDefinitionLanguage.html">InterfaceDefinitionLanguage</a>. But it's not that easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOAP is surrounded by proposals for all kinds of services for AsynchronousCommunication, security, <a href="WorkFlow.html">WorkFlow</a>, etc.
      </p>

           <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2003_03_30_patricklogan_archive.html#200097950">http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2003_03_30_patricklogan_archive.html#200097950</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Jabber (see JabberProject) is an XML messaging system under consideration for a standard by the IETF.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.jabber.org/ietf/">http://www.jabber.org/ietf/</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So the questions are these: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What does Jabber lack for XML messaging? 
        </li>
        <li>
           What of SOAP, WSDL, WS-xxx is needed to augment Jabber?
        </li>
      </ul>

        last edit of this page in 2003 by EarleMartin, not much link and it appears (from Meatball version of Jabber) that the two are in different league. I would like to <a href="DeleteThisPageSomeTime.html">DeleteThisPageSomeTime</a> and move the summary comments about Soap elsewhere? Any one have objections? -- dl
