        Wiki Server Side Applet
      </h1>
      <p>
        Recently many Wiki s support plugin framework theirselves. We can call them <a href="WikiServerSideApplet.html">WikiServerSideApplet</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is several kind of wiki server side applet
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Plugin (installed by manager only; written with server side language in wiki system plugin frame work, and full access controlled by Operating System or controlled by server side language intrinsic access control)
        </li>
        <li>
           Wiki sandbox applet (written in page; written with wiki common language or by server side language with intrinsic access control, and access controled by wiki system and wiki context, I'll introduce in the following article) 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most plugins has been implemented with same language as <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> itself.
        For example, if <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> is written with Perl, the plugins are also written with Perl.
        They has been installed by wiki site manager only, they are not editable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe many persons noticed the server side program is useful if we wrote it in wiki page(and it be editable).
        But it seems too dangerous to enable a program run on server side. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to introduce that the common language between wikies is useful to write server side applets and it runs in side of sandbox, so the behavior is managed at all, mostly safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why I did think so,
        Mr. OKada wrote Ruby program plugin which enable ruby script written in page and runnable. Then
        Mr. SHIMADA(he proposed HashedWiki at first also) proposed LISP like script in his own wiki(but his own wiki is written with Perl), I(ksr at todo dot  org, Tiki) found that it is useful if it is standardized script language in order to write plugin. And I named it as standardized <a href="WikiServerSideApplet.html">WikiServerSideApplet</a> in Wiki context. It works in sandbox(managed region and resources). There are many languages to write <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> but there is no common language to define and control and extend its behavior. We need to save effort to implement similar functionality in each Wikis if possible.
