        Voice Of Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        When people sign their contribution as <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, what voice do you imagine for them inside your head? Bass? Baritone? Tenor? Male? Female? In principle, perhaps it's the same as reading something written by a single person and signed with their name, or reading something unsigned. Still ....

        <em>I imagine hearing it as male tenor. But not only the </em><a href="VoiceOfWiki.html">VoiceOfWiki</a>, but most text here, as long as I don't know the voice. Interestingly, I have never thought about hearing text with a voice. I just now come to the conviction, that I do sometimes hear different voices, if the text is longer or the tone strong. But mostly male tenor for computer-science. When one particular <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> addressed me the first time with my name on wiki, I heard my name with the same voice, that my english teacher from California used. -- <a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a><em> </em>

        I sometimes hear different voices too. ;-) Actually, to be honest, I think I hear my own voice, like I'm reading to myself.

        I hear the same voice SidMeiersAlphaCentauri uses for the Voice of Planet.

        One of the problems with the anonymous <a href="VoiceOfWiki.html">VoiceOfWiki</a> is that you have even less to go on in deciding the ToneOfVoice. Some newcomers assume the worst more than oldies, because this really is a <em>surprisingly</em> friendly place compared to most other net discussions.
