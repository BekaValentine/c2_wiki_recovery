        Ward And Ralph In New Orleans
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> had gotten a tape from Tektronix in the summer
        of 1989 with lots of neat Smalltalk systems on it.
        The one that interested him the most was <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a>, a
        framework for drawing editors.  He had read an article
        in Hoopla! about it, and was eager to use it in his
        course on object-oriented programming and design.  He
        didn't have any trouble running the code, but he couldn't
        figure out how to use it to make his own editor.  There
        was no documentation, and the only comment in the code
        was a list of unimplemented features!
      </p>
      <p>
        When Ralph saw <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> at OOPSLA'89, he said "You've got
        to help me!  How does this thing work?"  Ward sat him
        down at a table in the lounge, pulled out a set of index
        cards, and proceeded to give a <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a> talk.  After
        an hour or so, Ralph was convinced.  When he went home
        after OOPSLA and looked at <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a> again, it all made
        perfect sense.  He wrote some class notes for it, gave
        a couple of lectures on it a few weeks later, and several
        students used it successfully in class projects.

      <p>
        It is amazing how much easier it is to understand a
        program when you know what it does!

        What exactly was missing from the documentation?
        Not the usual comments.  The Smalltalk tradition
        is only to paraphrase the code, which Ralph had no trouble
        reading.  The real question was 
        <em>what problems does it solve?</em>
        Since <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a> was a framework it didn't solve any end-user
        problems.  So Ward discussed the <em>responsibilities</em>
        assumed by each class and showed by waving cards how each
        class met those responsibilities.
