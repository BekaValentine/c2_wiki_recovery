        When a wiki is used on corporate intranets, they often become saturated with information. Many of the users tend to just read the titles on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, dive into random pages and then believe they are up to date on the what goes on. <a href="WikiJamming.html">WikiJamming</a> is the act of creating a wiki page that deliberately conveys a different message when it is read out of context.
