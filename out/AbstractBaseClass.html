        Abstract Base Class

        <em>Do we need the word Base in this concept? Why not just </em><a href="AbstractClass.html">AbstractClass</a>?<em></em>

        From Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) [web1913]:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Abstract \Ab"stract`    1. ...</dt>
        <dd>2. Considered apart from any application to a particular object; separated from matter; existing in the mind only; as, abstract truth, abstract numbers.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        An abstract base class is a class that is "exists only in the mind".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Eh? As opposed to what? ALL classes exist in the mind, in the design, in the source code. Concrete (non-abstract) classes can also have instances that "exist" in memory.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You cannot ever directly create an object of a type that is abstract - they are only used as "parent" classes, or "base" classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, a class that has any <a href="PureVirtual.html">PureVirtual</a> member functions is an abstract base class.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, any class which is declared "abstract" is an abstract class. Any classes which contain abstract (<a href="PureVirtual.html">PureVirtual</a>) methods (either directly declared, or inherited and not overridden) must be declared abstract; but the converse is not true -- an abstract class need not have any abstract methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q:When is all of this useful? (See <a href="PolymorphismExample.html">PolymorphismExample</a> for the exciting conclusion!)
      </p>
      <p>
        A:One way this can be useful is when one in <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a>, exposes the design which was previously "only in the mind". Another is to actually build and then utilize the class in a working program.
