        Schedule To Unblock Others
      </h1>
      <p>
        The idea is to complete the portions of a feature that will unblock those
        dependent on you. This way development moves along smoothly because
        more lines of development can be active at a time. For example, instead
        of implementing the entire database, implement the simple interface
        and stub it out. People can work for a very long time this way using
        that portion of the feature that caused others not to block. Plus
        it's a form of rapid prototyping because you get immediate feedback
        on these parts. Don't worry about the quality of implementation
        because it doesn't matter yet.

        Also known as an IntegrationPlan, but that probably sounds too much like <a href="WaterFall.html">WaterFall</a> for the present generation.

        I think of it as short cutting an integration plan so that subsystems
        can implement using the "real" interfaces they will need, but sooner
        than they otherwise could. The integration would require real functionality
        so all the tests would pass. With a non-blocking approach you get other
        code working as fast as possible, but it really only works in the broadest
        terms.

        Oh, a sort of improvised planning.  I like that!
