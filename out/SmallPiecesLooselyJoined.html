        [isbn:0-7382-0543-5] From Amazon: <em> "... the </em><a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a>; ... attempts to make a case that the institution has completely remodeled many of the world's self-perceptions." <em></em>

        From Publishers World Review: <em> "A philosophy professor turned marketing guy turned writer, Weinberger boasts an extremely likeable mainstream intellectual persona, flashes of insight and genuine literary talent. But the aspect of his personality that drives this book ... is his tendency to question. ... Weinberger leads readers through an exploration of the Web's implications beyond Amazon.com. ... [His] concepts are, in a way, accurate. Weinberger ... celebrates the Internet's gift to its users: permission to be an individual in a virtual world we can tailor to our passionate, idea-driven taste." </em>

        "Someday, someone was going to notice that the Internet is not just virtual, but instead connects to, and fundamentally affects, society. In this rich and beautiful text, Weinberger weaves an account of the places in our social and conceptual fabric where the Internet will pull, and possibly tear. This is not a book about the Internet and society; it is about society, marked with the net. "
