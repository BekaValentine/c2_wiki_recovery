        Evidence Stop
      </h1>
      <p>
        An Evidence Stop is similar to a <a href="BookStop.html">BookStop</a>. It's a point in a discussion where further evidence is needed, and further progress is unlikely unless the evidence is actually obtained.
      </p>
      <p>
        An <a href="EvidenceStop.html">EvidenceStop</a> is not necessarily "bad". Knowledge sometimes depends on external variables, and it can be good to document the points where external variables come into play. An unfinished discussion is not necessarily a worthless discussion. In the future somebody may ask the same question, and the discussion may lay the groundwork such that some of the wheels of probing and inquiry don't have to be invented from scratch.
