        Adoption of <a href="WiMax.html">WiMax</a> may however be restrained by high spectrum licensing costs, thus offsetting the advantage of no substantial infrastructure required for deployment.

        Intel is getting ready for the day of the mobile super mini PC, small enough to be stored in a handbag, powerful enough like a broadband connected computer, and cheap enough to be widely adopted. Intel has revealed its <a href="WiMax.html">WiMax</a> Connection 2300 chipset to compete with Qualcomm CDMA and other <a href="BroadbandWirelessAccess.html">BroadbandWirelessAccess</a> implementations.

        <em> ..the </em>WiMAX standard, based on IEEE 802.16d, aimed to deliver non-line-of-sight fixed broadband access. Now, many WiMAX proponents are hopeful of full 2-way broadband for mobile and portable devices as well, based on IEEE 802.16e.<em></em>

        Some work is still required (e.g. certification). The standard addresses roaming and other considerations important for use in <a href="WirelessDevicesEnterpriseComputing.html">WirelessDevicesEnterpriseComputing</a>.

        "Mobile <a href="WiMax.html">WiMax</a>" standards development is not yet finished as planned for mid 05, despite the hype associated with the now in market Intel Rosedale chipset. The delays give room for alternate <a href="ThirdGeneration.html">ThirdGeneration</a> solutions and competing standards to compete.

        For large telcos without cellular operations or <a href="ThirdGeneration.html">ThirdGeneration</a> cellular infrastructure (e.g. BT), "Mobile <a href="WiMax.html">WiMax</a>" can fill a complementary need.

           Flarion was mentioned to have the proprietary competing technology that could derail <a href="WiMax.html">WiMax</a> if it does not get its act together quickly. This company is in the news in mid 05 as it gets acquired by QualcommInc who singlehandedly created the CDMA (<a href="CodeDivisionMultipleAccess.html">CodeDivisionMultipleAccess</a>) market.
