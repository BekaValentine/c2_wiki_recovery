        Programming Team Size

        What, in general, are the forces acting upon large programming teams, versus those acting upon small programming teams? How do different methodologies attempt to address these forces?

           I see this part of XP not as a radical change, but as a re-adjustment in balance, acknowledging that instability is not the chimera for small teams that some of the literature (often aimed at big teams) says it is.

        <em>Yes.  We don't see it as a radical change either, but as a way we focus our attention on our real needs.  In addition, it's important to remember that we're a fairly small (10) team, and we're working in Smalltalk.  There's some discussion relating to C++ below.</em>

           This re-adjustment is necessary, but there's a danger of over-balancing the other way. I've added some comments to that effect. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
