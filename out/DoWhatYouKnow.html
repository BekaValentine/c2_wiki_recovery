        Much pain and suffering in the workplace can be avoided by the <a href="SimpleMinded.html">SimpleMinded</a> approach to your work and to <a href="DoWhatYouKnow.html">DoWhatYouKnow</a>.

        <strong>What does this mean?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        At least two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Do the things you know how to do,
        </li>
        <li>
           Know what things make up what you are to do.
        </li>
        <li>
           Learn the things you find you, do not, but will need to, know.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Natural outgrowths:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Learn what does thing efficiently that you are now doing.
        </li>
        <li>
           Learn things that will expand your reach by adding new tools to your toolbox.
        </li>
        <li>
           Do more things.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Adding targeted knowledge:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Increases your value
        </li>
        <li>
           Raises your Self Esteem
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Increasing one's technical competence:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Adds to one's toolkit
        </li>
        <li>
           Expands the expertise we can bring to bear on the client's system. Sometimes the littlest extra insight solves a raft of technical problems.
        </li>
        <li>
           Professionalism requires that we do this anyway; there is no such thing as standing still
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        One could also use this as the opposite of <a href="IfItCantBePerfectDontBother.html">IfItCantBePerfectDontBother</a>. If you don't know the perfect solution, at least pursue the best partial solution. If you don't understand the whole problem, work on the part you do understand.
