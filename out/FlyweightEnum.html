        Flyweight Enum
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the <a href="JavaDesignFlaws.html">JavaDesignFlaws</a> (pre 1.5) is the absence of enumerated types.  There are several workarounds for this, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use integers to represent enums.  A dummy class is declared to contain the range; and a bunch of static final int declarations are in the class body, each encoding one of the cases. i.e.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        class MaritalStatus {<br/>
        public static final int single = 0;<br/>
        public static final int married = 1;<br/>
        public static final int divorced = 2;<br/>
        public static final int widowed = 3;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This works, but has liabilities discussed in <a href="UseEnumsNotNumbers.html">UseEnumsNotNumbers</a> and <a href="UseEnumsNotBooleans.html">UseEnumsNotBooleans</a>.  A better (though it takes more typing) solution is.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use flyweight objects to represent enums.  A flyweight object is one that has no internal state (though in Java it will have a built-in monitor, a couple scratchpad registers for the <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a>, etc).  An abstract base class represents the set; a set of derived concrete classes represents the individual members in the set.  Like this:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        abstract class MaritalStatus {<br/>
        class final Single_T extends MaritalStatus {}<br/>
        class final Married_T extends MaritalStatus {}<br/>
        class final Divorced_T extends MaritalStatus {}<br/>
        class final Widowed_T extends MaritalStatus {}<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public Single_T single = new Single_T;<br/>
        public Married_T married = new Married_T;<br/>
        public Divorced_T divorced = new Divorced_T;<br/>
        public Widowed_T widowed = new Widowed_T;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The paranoid might want to add dummy constructors to make sure no other instances of MaritalStatus (or its children) are created by the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The enum system in JDK 1.5 is quite similar to the above, IIRC
      </p>
      <p>
        Advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If a function is declared to take a MaritalStatus, it will accept <em>only</em> a MaritalStatus.  (Or null--you can't eliminate this possibility unfortunately).  But you can keep someone from passing in an EthnicGroup or a string length or some other unrelated quantity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Since the enums are full-fledged objects rather than ints, they can be stuffed into containers, have their names printable by the program (provide a toString method), introspected, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No need to worry about the numbers assigned to each case; no chance of duplicating one.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Disadvantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is hard to provide a <a href="TotallyOrdered.html">TotallyOrdered</a> set.  The < and > operators will not work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           More typing needed.
        </li>
      </ul>
