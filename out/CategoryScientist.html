      <p>
        <a href="CategoryScientist.html">CategoryScientist</a> is for pages describing important scientists and their contributions. Click on the heading for a list of scientists. To be included in this category, at least one of the following should be true (the more the better):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Have an advanced degree in a particular scientific or engineering discipline.
        </li>
        <li>
           Be an active or formerly-active researcher in a particular scientific or engineering discipline (pure academic research certainly qualifies, as does industrial research of an exploratory nature. Coding up <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>s in Java is not considered "research").
        </li>
        <li>
           Be a noted authority in a particular field (this doesn't necessarily mean well-known to the general public; but one's work should be reasonably well-known by other scientists in the field).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that this category is not reserved for the "big names" like Turing or Knuth or Newton... though they all qualify. Nor is anyone disqualified by his/her work being obsoleted by subsequent work in the field - Newton's laws of motion have all been replaced by more modern theories (though they remain excellent approximations for velocities << the <a href="SpeedOfLight.html">SpeedOfLight</a>), but he still counts.
