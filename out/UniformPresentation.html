        Uniform Presentation
      </h1>
      <p>
        For objects or concepts which have similar use, there must be similar presentation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that if one is editing control system batch recipes, the recipes must be presented with controls that are similar, and similarly placed on the respective screens. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, things that are to be used the same need interfaces that work the same. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, this is obvious, but should be stated nonetheless.
