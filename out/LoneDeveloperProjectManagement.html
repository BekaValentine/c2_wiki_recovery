        Lone Developer Project Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is not always possible, and many developers are still "alone in the night"
      </p>
      <p>
        A lone-developer project suffers from many of the same problems as multi-person projects, such as delays, budget overruns, <a href="ScopeCreep.html">ScopeCreep</a>, <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a>, unrealistic expectations, lack of indicators, etc. What methods for managing larger projects can be used efficiently in a lone developer project?
      </p>
      <p>
        Some suggestions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use <a href="IndexCard.html">IndexCard</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>.  This will help avoid many delays due to buggy code.  Done diligently, it will also resist <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> because you won't implement anything that you aren't testing for.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use short increments and the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>, measure the number of "points" of work you do in an increment and schedule that many more for the next increment.  This suggestion alone can help a lot for the problems mentioned above.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use an <a href="AutomatedConfigurationManagementEnvironment.html">AutomatedConfigurationManagementEnvironment</a> to mercilessly automate repetitive tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
           AutomateMercilessly is good, even for multiple programmer projects -- you automate it once, and everybody benefits.  See also <a href="ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate.html">ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate</a>.

           <a href="FourVariablesUnderStress.html">FourVariablesUnderStress</a> must be managed.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="RubberDucking.html">RubberDucking</a> is perhaps more viable while working alone.  <a href="MultiplePersonalityDevelopment.html">MultiplePersonalityDevelopment</a> can be a replacement.
        </li>
