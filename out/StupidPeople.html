        Stupid People
      </h1>
      <p>
        All the evil in the world is done by stupid people. Smart people can wind up doing evil because they're screwed up by <a href="StupidPeople.html">StupidPeople</a>, or because they've been screwed up by smart people who have been screwed up by <a href="StupidPeople.html">StupidPeople</a>. But make no mistake - it is the stupid people who are to blame. We could round them all up and kill them. If that wasn't a stupid idea ...

        I find this an <strong>oversimplification</strong>. It's often the stupid <em>side</em> of people that causes the problem, not individuals who are significantly more stupid than the rest. Hitler, who was democratically elected, triggered the stupidity to come out of otherwise normal people (and allowed his own stupidity to rule him).  If Earth was invaded by an alien race, then a personality like Hitler's could perhaps save our butts from extinction. We all have some degree of stupidity in us and need to tame or channel it for good uses. None of us are perfect or 100% right.  We need to allow our strengths to shine without letting our weaknesses counteract the strengths of both ourselves and others.

        <em>Even at their most intelligent and rational, people will do foolish things because information about consequences is always incomplete and often fraudulent, because we are wired for selfish motives (like survival and prestige) and greedy algorithms are rarely optimal, because we constrain our thoughts with social mores, and even because morality - what we consider 'evil' - is subject to fashion and fad like everything else in human society. We don't need to be stupid to do evil things. We're perfectly capable of paving the road to hell with our good intentions.</em>
