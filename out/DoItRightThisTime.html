        The core of iterative development.
      </p>
      <p>
        XP covers this with <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s ('do it right'). Also <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> ('this time') is meant to help to <a href="DoItRightThisTime.html">DoItRightThisTime</a>. Each iteration develops a system that is fit for its current niche (requirements). As the niche changes the system evolves (iterates).

        Also a conversational <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, as in, "We're sure to get it right this time!"

        This seems to be another in a series of undefined catch phrases masquerading as profound thoughts.  At the risk of sounding like Bill Clinton, what do you mean by "it," "right," and "this time?"

        I know too many people who want to do it right, but they want to do that next time.  There is no next time.
