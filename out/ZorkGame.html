        Zork Game
      </h1>
      <p>
        Zork was a conceptual descendant of <a href="AdventureGame.html">AdventureGame</a>, one of the first such, and for many years, by far the most sophisticated such. It was text-based <a href="InteractiveFiction.html">InteractiveFiction</a> at its finest. It originated on DEC-10 mainframes at MIT in the late 1970s and was written in MDL language (pronounced "muddle"), a very powerful Lisp variant that incorporated ideas from MicroPlanner (think Prolog crossed with Lisp).
      </p>
      <p>
        It featured a fairly powerful natural language parser (sentences with multiple phrases, compound nouns, etc), autonomous agents (timer event driven), and a host of other features that appeared in no other text adventure games for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game was later ported (rewritten, actually, with extreme difficulty) to PCs, published by Infocom and spawned a host of sequels back in the early to mid 80s. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the ideas used to program Zork for PCs sound like primitive Java. Each "Object" was declared and could have 'attributes', the source was compiled into a <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> which could be used by any platform. The games ran on a "Z-Machine" (simulated virtual machine) which operated the same on any platform, from CommodoreSixtyfour to mainframe to PalmVx.
      </p>
      <p>
        Infocom was swallowed by Activision. Once computers could create '<a href="FirstPersonShooter.html">FirstPersonShooter</a>s', text-based interactive fiction pretty much died out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game and language still live in a reversed-engineered compiler called "Inform" which can be found at <a href="InformLanguage.html">InformLanguage</a>.

        I seem to recall that there was a <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a> (?) version that ran under 4.2BSD that preceded the Infocom version. And that was probably ported from elsewhere. Anybody else have more details?

        <em>Yes--Zork was a port of the FORTRAN game known as "Dungeon".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not true--Dungeon was the FORTRAN clone of Zork. It did not precede the original mainframe Zork, though it definitely preceded any home computer versions, and, indeed, the formation of Infocom as a company.</em>
