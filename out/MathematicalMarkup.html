        Mathematical Markup
      </h1>
      <p>
        Refers to a way of marking up mathematical formula.  Several examples out there:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           TeX and <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> provide excellent mathematical markup
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="MathMl.html">MathMl</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Might it be useful to add some math support to <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>?  Obviously, using quote marks for italics and bold is something that doesn't scale well.  Entering raw <a href="MathMl.html">MathMl</a> would be a pain; TeX is probably a better model.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stuff we would need:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Fonts:  Roman, <em>italics</em>, script, that stylized font with the letter R when representing the real numbers (what is it called)? <em>blackboard font</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Easy access to greek and Hebrew letters (SIGMA, aleph) [and that means the right fonts]
        </li>
        <li>
           Easy access to numerous other mathematical symbols (times, right-turnstyle, subset-of) [and that means the right fonts]
        </li>
        <li>
           Support for superscripting and subscripting
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A quick and dirty solution: allow LaTeX markup, which is processed on the server and included in the page as an image. This is done on other wikis.
