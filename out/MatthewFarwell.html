        I hope you're still here, I like your phrasing in <a href="VoodooFix.html">VoodooFix</a> of <strong>Put the code down slowly and move away from the code</strong> that I think it ought to become a page on its own but I cannot decide which words to use, I'll let you or the rest of <a href="ThisWiki.html">ThisWiki</a> decide::

      <code>
        Put <a href="TheCode.html">TheCode</a> down slowly and move away from <a href="TheCode.html">TheCode</a><br/>
        PutTheCodeDown slowly and move away from <a href="TheCode.html">TheCode</a><br/>
