        <a href="MacGyver.html">MacGyver</a> is the name of a show from the 80's as well as its main character, played by Richard Dean Anderson (of "Stargate SG-1"). His claim to fame was using simple, found items in ingenious ways to defeat the bad guys or extricate himself from precarious situations. In one episode he uses bamboo, sheets, and a small engine along with duct tape to create an ultralight and fly away from his kidnappers.

        Also used to express (hasty/crude/kludged) design and implementation <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>/s of sorts with which many of us are unfortunately familiar.

        <a href="MacGyver.html">MacGyver</a> once explained to a shocked agent that he preferred to stay loose, eschewing formal plans because they reduce flexibility. Instead, he stays observant and learns things out of curiosity; then as a situation builds up, he constantly takes little actions to increase his options, like grabbing a piece of rope or taking shelter in a room with possibly useful chemicals.

        Apparently, there was a Swiss Army Knife Society Convention in San Diego last weekend (supposedly a tongue-in-cheek gathering of people  totally enamored with those handy little pocket wonders). A speaker read a TV promo from a recent Macgyver episode, "Macgyver must stop a bulldozer using only his Swiss Army Knife and a two-by-four", and someone in the audience asked "What does he need the two-by-four for?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So how </em>'do<em>' you stop a bulldozer using only a Swiss Army Knife and a two-by-four?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Hey, buddy!  If you stop that bulldozer I'll give you this spiffy <a href="SwissArmyKnife.html">SwissArmyKnife</a>!" ;)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>[Followed by, </em><strong>THUNK!</strong><em> Bulldozer stopped and Swiss Army Knife recovered.]</em>

        By the way, the tongue-in-cheek pronunciation of this character's name is "mic-jive-er".
