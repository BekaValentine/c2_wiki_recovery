        I thought political machines already used XP. I mean they just do everything off the cuff anyway.

        It's hard to see <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> used for politics, under the definition that
        politics is how we determine policy.  XP doesn't lead, it follows.  It specifically divorces itself from determining what is the right thing for the program to do by saying that "whatever the customer asks for is the right thing to do, until she changes her mind".  It turns policy into code, in much the same way that police forces enforce the policies of a government.

        Rob's thought above would lead us to a possible <a href="ExtremePolitics.html">ExtremePolitics</a> solution, except that politics suffers in this regard from not being testable.  If political solutions were testable, you could develop a solution based on what the customer (constituent, lobbyist, etc.) asks for.  You could then test it, and implement or not based on the results.  It would solve a lot of problems and produce some others ... - <a href="RjLesch.html">RjLesch</a>

        I thought that a political process <em>was</em> tested every time an election is held. Of course it is a totaly un-modular test, equivalent to a <a href="TakeItOrLeaveIt.html">TakeItOrLeaveIt</a> on a whole system. Maybe <a href="ExtremePolitics.html">ExtremePolitics</a> should do away with the single general election and have module based elections. Then we could have one party in charge of law and order, another for the environment and another for welfare etc.... CjB
