        Bad Programming Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A programming language that really, really sucks.  The sort of languages which makes the simplest of tasks (<a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a>, etc.) horrendously complicated.  The sort of language that that turns programmers into heroes; as doing <strong>anything</strong> requires heroic efforts.  The sort of language that fortunately, is seldom seen in the wild these days (and is usually specific to a particular site; one which has been using it for years and sees no reason to change).

      <p>
        No, we're not talking C/C++/C#/Java, no matter how popular bashing these may be 'round these parts.  We're not talking joke languages like <a href="InterCal.html">InterCal</a>; only <a href="RealProgrammingLanguage.html">RealProgrammingLanguage</a>s need apply.  No we're not talking <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a>; we're talking languages that are <a href="WorseThanCobol.html">WorseThanCobol</a>.  <strong>Far</strong> worse.
