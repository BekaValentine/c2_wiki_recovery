        <em>For an emblematic example of </em><a href="HorselessCarriageThinking.html">HorselessCarriageThinking</a>, launch MS windows <em>calc.exe</em> or kde's <em>kcalc. --</em><a href="ChristopheThibaut.html">ChristopheThibaut</a>

      <p>
        And for one possible resolution, load Excel or Gnumeric. (Or if you are so inclined, just write some code.)
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point though, I see one benefit of HCT: people will understand it. Anyone who has used a "normal" calculator, and can figure a mouse out, can use <em>calc.exe</em>. -- m
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, but it still won't be useful to them unless they use the keyboard interface (which has nothing to do with the GUI). Clicking the buttons with the mouse is unbelievably tedious; I can't imagine that anyone would seriously attempt to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unless they were using a stylus device or touch screen. Imagine! M$ writing a program which was not to be appreciated for its full value for several years. Question is, why doesn't MS Word have a full keyboard at the bottom, on which you click the mouse to type? It already has a "keyboard" of formatting options... -- m</em>

           I don't get this at all. I find calc.exe very useful. I even have a (slightly better) calculator app loaded onto my phone. I also use the mouse to click the buttons on the calc.exe. I never use the numeric keypad. I don't find it "incredibly tedious". I'd find replacing calc.exe with Excel INCREDIBLY TEDIOUS!

        <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a>'s speech The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet is related to HCT. See the video at (<a href="http://www.educause.edu/conference/e98/webcast98.html).">http://www.educause.edu/conference/e98/webcast98.html).</a> It includes the most compelling example of HCT I've ever seen, as well as generalizing HCT from "something that Just Happens" to "an evil that afflicts all new revolutionary technologies".
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, genuinely new things to do aren't even remotely related to the technology you're applying. The connection is only obvious to the inventor that comes up with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't confuse new things to do with the new technology itself. Good roads for the Horseless Carriage are not a new thing to do, but a requirement of the new technology. The same with traffic signals, lanes, interchanges. The same with passenger cars, trucks, semis, buses and tow-trucks. (Though the bus system is a distinct technology.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Pedantic note: I've been told that the good roads were actually the result of lobbying by (non-motor) cyclists, prior to the Horseless Carriages. -- </em><a href="MikeAnderson.html">MikeAnderson</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also don't confuse new things to do with old shit that's done with the new technology. Any sentence that starts with "replace" does NOT refer to a new thing!
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of new things are lawn-mowers, leaf-blowers and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's some more good examples of what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
        New way to do the same old shit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           CDROMs replacing audio CDs, diskettes and tape backup.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        New thing to do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           networking, both wired and wireless, and massive hard drives, completely <em>obsoleting</em> the need for portable storage
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        New things to do supplant old things to do at least as often as they complement them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Something like the USB stick is more comparable. Hooking to a network is not always possible or practical. USB only defines the interface, not the medium (storage technique), and thus has more staying power. Early USB sticks maybe topped out at around 16 meg, but now you can find 16 gig or more. The older equivalents didn't really have this ability (although tape did get thinner and stronger). However, the existing interface does limit the transfer speed, which has resulted in some somewhat kludgey changes for later USB versions.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>The key fact is that this is never, ever done by the generation that invented the technology, and sometimes not even by the generation that follows it. Take for example the internet.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The first and most important use it's been put to is faster mail. How long has it taken for groupware to develop?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The second most important use of the internet has been a faster printing press (the web) with the exact same kind of annotation/reference capability as can be found in any paper book. How many decades has it taken for wikis to develop? How many decades more until bidirectional links take hold?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And going back to the HCT example, trains had already created commuting so this was in no way novel to the inventors of the horseless carriage. Highways and interstates were invented only many decades after. Which all goes to show how backwards-looking and unimaginative is horseless carriage thinking.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        But in fact, this is all just legalisms and beside the point red herrings. "thinking" vs "doing". What the bloody hell is that all about?? You're raving on and on and on about how great and creative every pissant inventor must have been, without showing any evidence of understanding the central point of this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was email a great advance over postal mail? Sure it was. But it wasn't an advance that required <em>radically different thinking</em>. Someone just figured out a better way to do the same old shit that everyone else had been doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figuring out how to do the same old shit better is a tried and true means of invention. It requires a little engineering, a little creativity, a lot of thought, and not much else. And it's very different from figuring out <em>completely new and different uses for technology</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figuring out <em>new things to do</em> instead of <em>better ways to do things</em> is where the real hard work of invention comes in. It's at least a hundred times more difficult to do, as judging by the ratio of people who are able to perform each activity. It's difficult because it requires certain character and emotional traits which are very rare in people. It requires,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           self-confidence, ego and hubris to the point where you can dismiss everything that everyone has ever done or wished to do.
        </li>
        <li>
           reflection and self-criticism to the point where you can dismiss everything that <em>you</em> have ever done or wished to do.
        </li>
        <li>
           a genuinely open-ended mind capable of synthesizing new usage patterns ex nihilo, rather than going down a finite list of possible uses and analyzing whether your invention would help them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What inventor are you thinking of here who figured out new things to do?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Gutenberg invented a new way of copying the RC Bible. Aldo invented the book, ergonomically designed to fit into saddlebags, with content of actual interest to readers. Hell, this wiki was an invention of the latter category; a completely new usage pattern.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Apparently, it's a very rare combination of traits. I can understand why someone who lacks that combination of traits, for whom coming up with new things to do is patently impossible, would waste their time idolizing what every clod is able to do. It's like worshipping arithmetic because calculus is permanently beyond you. It's very human. But that doesn't make it right.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dichotomy between "new ways to do the same old shit" and "new things to do" is nowhere more oppressive than in <a href="OperatingSystemsResearch.html">OperatingSystemsResearch</a>. The field is dead not because there aren't any more OS researchers, but precisely because those that remain are exclusively in the first category. No one is left to do original research anymore, only industrial engineering types masquerading as researchers. -- RK
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to RK's rant above:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Harder is not necessarily better. Yes. It's harder to invent a whole new thing to do than it is to invent a new way to do the same old shit. It doesn't mean new ways to do the same old shit are not worth having. A horseless carriage is a hell of a lot better than a horsey carriage. Further, where exactly in the development of the modern automobile did the automobile emerge as opposed to the horseless carriage? Was it not an evolutionary process, like every other invention in history? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Like almost every invention in history. The reason being the dearth of people capable of figuring out new uses for the damned thing.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The dichotomy between "new ways to do the same old shit" and "new things to do" is a false dichotomy. They're the same freakin' thing, in two ways. First, a substantively better way to do a <x> can sometimes make <x> applicable in a lot more places, enabling the kind of fundamental shift you're ranting about. After all, computers are just a new way to do math, right? Secondly, if you take a few steps back, you'll see that after all these years, humans are mostly trying to accomplish the same things. All the technology doesn't change the fact that we're all struggling to understand our environment, procreate, sustain comfortable lives for our selves and our offspring, and engage in various other petty activities.

           <em>Your argument is true but irrelevant. Let's bring up a concrete example, email. Email is so much easier than postal mail that the way it's used is significantly different. However, this different usage pattern is an </em>'emergent<strong> phenomenon and not an invention for which anyone is responsible. In fact, if the usage pattern is substantially different, humans are perfectly capable of deliberately breaking the technology in order to prevent it. For example, the music industry outlawing </strong><a href="PeerToPeer.html">PeerToPeer</a>. The majority of humans not only engage in HCT, they insist on it.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What does it matter that no one "invented" the email usage pattern? See <a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You seem to be arguing that for an invention to be worth anything the inventor must have a <a href="GrandVision.html">GrandVision</a> of its purpose in society. What difference does that make? It's rare in the extreme for an inventor to have such foresight, and yet, I don't see why that's a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When the inventor doesn't have a grand vision, we're shackled to a </em>StupidVision. Like for example, email. Threading and categorizing are still not widespread in email, despite the fact that threading at least is widespread in newsreaders. Or rather, <em>was</em> widespread since GUIed newsreaders seem to have taken a step backwards. <a href="EmailIsObsolete.html">EmailIsObsolete</a> since it's just straightforward mimicry of the postal / secretary system which is itself obsolete. The form of email was obsoleted by its underlying technology, but most developers of email are too dumb to realize it. The only exceptions I've ever encountered are Gmail and Timber (<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/timber.html)">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/timber.html)</a> and Timber is vaporware.<em></em>

        The article implies that a majority of people in the industry reject new technologies. This is often not the case. The Automobile, telephone, and radio all had plenty of stock backers. In fact, many times the industry rushes into ideas before they've been better-tested and tuned, as all the failed early dot-coms (pre-2002) demonstrates. The "problem" is that there's a disconnect in the appropriateness of which technologies receive attention and those that don't. People do bet on future horses, they just keep picking the wrong ones. But we don't know whether this is an inherent flaw in human-nature, or the difficulty in knowing what can work in practice and what doesn't.

        A current example of horseless carriage thinking is <a href="DataOriented.html">DataOriented</a> programming. It is possible to start programming in the <a href="InformationOriented.html">InformationOriented</a> sphere using <a href="EnDeme.html">EnDeme</a>s and certain other <a href="InformationOriented.html">InformationOriented</a> approaches. So far endemes have been used in production only for things that <a href="DataOriented.html">DataOriented</a> approaches already do. These are inventory status handling, exception handling, and security authorization. The powerful uses for <a href="EnDemes.html">EnDemes</a> have not yet been allowed in production, probably because companies can not even imagine doing things they do not already know how to do. They have needs that are not filled, but simply discount their needs as being unobtainable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You wrote, "The powerful uses for </em><a href="EnDemes.html">EnDemes</a> have not yet been allowed in production..."  It sounds like there's a story behind that.  Would you be willing to tell it?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The story is mostly a story of me trying to figure out what I've got and how to use it. I have talked with numerous employers and co-workers about this, however since the theory and practice are still under development, most of this talking has been along the lines of 'I've got this idea, any idea how we could use it?, or 'I've figured out how to use this idea but it's not production ready yet'. Maybe in a year to two the discussion will go farther. I have listed some semi-theoretical benefits of <a href="EnDemes.html">EnDemes</a> on the <a href="EnDemes.html">EnDemes</a> page. I have come up with practical uses too but not posted them yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm curious about your </em><a href="EnDemes.html">EnDemes</a> but I'm not clear how they'd be used in practice.  Could you demonstrate with some examples?  Could you show how Endemes would facilitate inventory status handling, exception handling, security authorization, and the more powerful uses that you have in mind?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have included the Exception Handling example below as it is fully non-proprietary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm also curious to see how </em><a href="EnDemes.html">EnDemes</a> would facilitate something more <a href="InformationOriented.html">InformationOriented</a> than, say, representing the same data using a conventional <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a> approach.  For example, to record the same data as Employee endemes, we might define a table of Characteristics, a table of Employees, and an EmployeeCharacteristics table to represent the many-to-many relationship between Employees and Characteristics.  (I realise there's probably a better page for this question, but I'm not sure what it is.  Feel free to move this to there.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a discussion of these very issues on the <a href="BusinessTalentEndemeSet.html">BusinessTalentEndemeSet</a> and <a href="KnowledgeDatabase.html">KnowledgeDatabase</a> pages.

        <strong>Exception Handling 'Horseless Carriage' Example</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The exception handling code is not proprietary and so I can show a couple of key methods here. Note that this is 'horseless carriage' code, and maybe should be done with <a href="DataOriented.html">DataOriented</a> techniques instead.

        Usage:

      <code>
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_errors))<br/>
        Throws.A(new DataException(_errors), Throws.Actions, "PSA");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When the 'Throws.A' method gets run, it starts a loop to process the "PSA" endeme, the 
        'P' in the case statement runs the 'P' routine (Pause at a breakpoint), then
        the 'S' case runs the 'S' routine (squawk to the user that there is a problem), then the 'A' case runs the 'A'
        routine which sends an alert to the support staff that there is a problem.

        The exception handling system allows a programmer to handle an exception in a
        nearly infinite number of ways and that is the benefit of doing it this way.
