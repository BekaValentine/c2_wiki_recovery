        Wiki Prerequisites
      </h1>
      <p>
        What <a href="WikiPrerequisites.html">WikiPrerequisites</a> are implicitly expected of <a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a>s?
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue of what prerequisites should be assumed on this wiki came up on <a href="SelfStandingEvidence.html">SelfStandingEvidence</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Technical prerequisites:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Access to a web browser and internet connectivity come to mind.
        </li>
        <li>
           A working knowledge of English, perhaps.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>This question echoes my thinking. Does the page address the artifact of computer and software or the wetware of appetite for exchange?</em> -- <a href="BenTremblay.html">BenTremblay</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If we only assume those, then it would be expected that we explain to the readers what arrays and loops are. That is asking too much. Nor does the vast majority of existing wiki content fit the bill. As a starting point, I would suggest a general understanding of:

        <a href="UniverseOfDiscourse.html">UniverseOfDiscourse</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Control structures (loops, IF's, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Subroutines
        </li>
        <li>
           Arrays
        </li>
        <li>
           Basic data structures (maps, lists, stacks, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Basic OOP concepts (polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance)
        </li>
        <li>
           Basic <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> concepts
        </li>
        <li>
           Be familiar with at least one "staticly typed" language and one scripting or dynamic language.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Nobody complained about prerequisites until <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> came along. Even the bureaucratic task of enumerating and debating prerequisites is exceedingly wasteful to be done just in order to provide ourselves justification against trolls who want to play <a href="HumptyDumpty.html">HumptyDumpty</a> basic concepts like syntax, language, math, science, and so on. The quasi-totality of contributors here recognize a common background related to programming and converse without problems, and where there are differences, which mostly happens about nuances, they are made explicit in the proper context.
