        He Didnt Invent The Term
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> <em>didn't</em> invent the term object, as is suggested by <a href="AlanKayOnObjects.html">AlanKayOnObjects</a> and <a href="HeInventedTheTerm.html">HeInventedTheTerm</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Object was first used in Spring 1967 by <a href="KristenNygaard.html">KristenNygaard</a> and <a href="OleJohanDahl.html">OleJohanDahl</a>, to describe the instance of a class in their brand new Simula67, the first language with encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism and one of Kay's main influences in designing the much purer object-oriented <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> at Xerox from 1970.  The other key influence on Kay, which he freely acknowledges, was a demonstration he attended while studying at Utah in the late sixties by <a href="IvanSutherland.html">IvanSutherland</a> of his pioneering <a href="SketchPad.html">SketchPad</a> system.
      </p>
      <p>
        So was it in fact the <em>-oriented</em> that Kay added to describe Smalltalk's very uniform object and message sending?

        And remind me, when exactly did the marketing people manage to do away with both? --<a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        Richard, you seem to be refuting that he coined the term <em>object-oriented</em> by saying that someone else coined the use of the word <em>object</em>... One surely doesn't follow the other ?  --<a href="AlanFrancis.html">AlanFrancis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You're quite right that it doesn't follow. I'm asking for confirmation that Kay was the first person to use <em>object-oriented</em>.  Plus it did seem a bit of an oversight not to mention the Simula people's use of the word object until now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or do Kay or others say that <a href="IvanSutherland.html">IvanSutherland</a>, being not only a genius but an English speaker and an American, must have first used the word <em>object</em> in the context of a programming language that included encapsulation using classes, inheritance and polymorphism?  Facts are facts, but can we bear to share out the kudos a little more than that? --<a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        And that's fair enough.  The page was <a href="AlanKayStories.html">AlanKayStories</a> and I for one would have laughed less if it had had a disclaimer at the bottom stating that that although <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> may or may not have coined the phrase, he certainly wasn't the first to use the word <em>object</em>. --<a href="AlanFrancis.html">AlanFrancis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Agreed, it's a great story and I tried to keep the laughter going when I refactored the story into <a href="HeInventedTheTerm.html">HeInventedTheTerm</a> by not putting a disclaimer or even a backlink.  It's interesting though to see two quite different tellings of the same story, isn't it, the second from an eye-witness?  That's history for you. --<a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I realise you're making a serious point about what we attribute to whom, but the point I'm making is that the page wasn't WhoInventedObjectOrientation, it was <a href="AlanKayStories.html">AlanKayStories</a>. --<a href="AlanFrancis.html">AlanFrancis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ah, a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> pedant like me! Agreed again. My concern really arose from the fact that unlike <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a>, who had existed as a page on Wiki for some years (and indeed in real life too), the inventors of <em>object-orientation</em> the stuff of programming language design (if not the actual phrase) had no pages and not a single mention on the whole of Wiki that I could find until this week.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Important newsflash - </em><a href="KristenNygaard.html">KristenNygaard</a> was in fact previously mentioned in <a href="ProcessPatterns.html">ProcessPatterns</a> for a paper he wrote that <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> couldn't find but thought was written about 1974, but which someone else knew was really written in 1986 and found for us all.  If that's not recognition for you, I don't know what is.  [<a href="IronyWarning.html">IronyWarning</a>]<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew that I shouldn't complain but I was already tired from trying to refactor <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> and related pages for the sake of posterity.  So I wrote the restrained <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a> instead.  Maybe I should have written GripesOfAnOverwhelmedWikiRefactorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two simple questions remain for me: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           would we agree to RefactorTheFourGospelsIntoOne
        </li>
        <li>
           what is WikiPosterity
        </li>
      </ul>
