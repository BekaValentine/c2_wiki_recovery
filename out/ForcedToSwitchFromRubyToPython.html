        Forced To Switch From Ruby To Python

        Some users are required, usually for professional reasons, to work with <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> despite it not being their preferred language.

               For work, because I assumed that I'd like <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> just fine at the new job.  And to a point, I suppose I do - I'm not about to quit over it, at any rate.  Still, there are so many things about Python that just continue to irritate and disappoint me, no matter how long I spend writing it.  I still write most of my "for fun" code in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> (and none in Python).

        I'm too lazy to do this at the moment, I should probably create a ForcedToSwitchFromPythonToRuby page.  Where I work, I'm about to be "forced" to switch from Python to Ruby...forced is probably too strong of a word, because I acquire data, and am free to use whatever language I want.  Pending board approval, we're going to switch the front end of our product from the current HTML-<a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>-I'm-not-sure-what-else debacle to Ruby-on-Rails with Java backend.  I voted for Ruby, though, because it was either that or PHP.  Thus, it's an interesting situation, and probably a little too early to make a ForcedToSwitchFromPythonToRuby page anyway!  :-)
