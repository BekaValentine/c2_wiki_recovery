        Though I like many of the extensions [In <a href="WikiClones.html">WikiClones</a>], it's sad to see that folk haven't just added these to the original. I think it's because of the licensing; it would be very good for <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> if its transition to <a href="CopyLeft.html">CopyLeft</a> could be expedited.

        I'm very sorry if I seemed impatient - that was not my intention at all. I have only the greatest respect for folk working on wikiness and I appreciate that such delicate fish must be cooked gently.

        But I'm not certain why you think <a href="CopyLeft.html">CopyLeft</a> would threaten any wiki users' intellectual property rights. There are a great many copyleft products in use in commercial development shops - linux, apache and gcc to name three whose users number in the millions - and I don't believe any such use would be made if anyone felt their intellectual property was at risk.

        IANAL, but I've never seen the opposite view before - can you refer to some real case where a <a href="GnuGeneralPublicLicense.html">GnuGeneralPublicLicense</a>, say, had such an effect?

        There are copylefted versions of Wiki. Specifically, <a href="JosWiki.html">JosWiki</a> claims to be under the <a href="GnuGeneralPublicLicense.html">GnuGeneralPublicLicense</a>. Glancing at the source code, it looks to me to be a fresh implementation (and it has quite a few new features). May be it would be a better starting point for collaborative work because of these licensing issues.

        I looked at <a href="JosWiki.html">JosWiki</a>, and while the functionality is very cool, the source code seems to be missing from the site. I am very interested in running a <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a>, and I'd like to run it from GPL's source on general principles. Can anyone send me the source to <a href="JosWiki.html">JosWiki</a>, or point me to another GPL's Wiki? Ideally, one that runs over CVS (a phenomenally cool idea, BTW. I ran a web server over <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a>, a versioning filesystem, a few years ago, and loved it. But <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> is absurdly expensive...)

I've been meaning for a while to have another hack at the thing but my other projects have intervened - still it should be very easy for anyone knowing or willing to learn a tiny amount of Perl to take the CVSish bits of <a href="CvWiki.html">CvWiki</a> and combine them with <a href="JosWiki.html">JosWiki</a> ...<em>--</em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
