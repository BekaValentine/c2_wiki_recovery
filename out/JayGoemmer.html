        Hi! I used the Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT) for 5 years beginning in 1994, and actively beta-tested Robert Masenten's AGiliTy interpreter (see <a href="AgiliTy.html">AgiliTy</a> [sic]) and <a href="MagxCompiler.html">MagxCompiler</a>. I maintained my own home pages for AGT, AGiliTy, and Magx, and offered several suggestions to Mr. Masenten for expanding AGT as it stood at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 1997, I began learning <a href="GrahamNelson.html">GrahamNelson</a>'s Inform 6 (see <a href="InformLanguage.html">InformLanguage</a>), and I started the "Inform for Dummies" thread on rec.arts.int-fiction in December 1997 (out of sheer desperation, I might add). I took a 2.5 year hiatus from IF beginning in mid-2000. Since then, I've quit using the variants of AGT, and have switched exclusively to programming in Inform.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also eternally indebted to <a href="LucianSmith.html">LucianSmith</a> (author of "The Edifice," Comp97's 1st place winner) for initiating the InteractiveFictionInformTips page.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I asked the desperate query about replicating the "Trinity" intro, and figured out how to (crudely) implement location-sensitive hints like AGT's on the Inform Tips page (at IntFicInformTips). (Thanks for the additional clarification.)
        </li>
        <li>
           I also wanted to know how to implement flags (I now suggest setting the "general" attribute) and timers (a.k.a. "counters," in AGT parlance).
        </li>
        <li>
           I wrote the verbose little summaries entitled "<a href="AgtLanguage.html">AgtLanguage</a>," "<a href="AgiliTy.html">AgiliTy</a>," and "<a href="MagxCompiler.html">MagxCompiler</a>," as well.
        </li>

           My Magx/AGiliTy game "E-MAILBOX" placed 27th out of 34 entries in the 1997 Annual IF Competition.

           Adam Cadre's June 1998 "Chicken Comp" inspired my first "official" Inform release entitled "POLLO Y CAMINO (Chicken and Road)."  Now being betatested and updated for Release 2.

        I submitted updated versions of both of these games for inclusion in Cascade Mountain Publishing's "Millennia Anthology" CD-ROM compiled by Michael Berlyn, but since CMP closed its doors in Spring 2000, the CD won't be materializing. Sorry!
