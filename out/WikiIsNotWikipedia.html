        Wiki Is Not Wikipedia
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page is required reading for all wiki users, whether they be newbie or old-timer.

      <p>
        As this wiki matures a curious pattern emerges.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the olden days, people learned to Wiki here then migrated out to other forums.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a>s who grew up with <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> come here. Sometimes, they start applying its norms to our edits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following are the norms for this wiki:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           unattributed viewpoints
        </li>
        <li>
           original research
        </li>
        <li>
           fussing, noise, fun, actual and inactual advances
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, jokes, and transclusions
        </li>
        <li>
           signed works by <a href="WikiAuthor.html">WikiAuthor</a>s
        </li>
        <li>
           content shamelessly ripped off from other forums, possibly without attribution
        </li>
        <li>
           unsigned works by professional authors
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nothing here needs to be chronically cleansed of any potential for dissent!
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The corollary of which is that <a href="WikipediaIsNotWiki.html">WikipediaIsNotWiki</a>
