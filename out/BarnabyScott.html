        In recent years I have written a couple of ludicrously over-elaborate database applications for my own use and/or amusement

           Ok, that intensely provokes my curiosity, can you list them and say what is "ludicrously over-elaborate" about them??? -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        <li>
           P.S. I see no edit buttons, even in the <a href="SandBox.html">SandBox</a>, on <a href="MonkeyWiki.html">MonkeyWiki</a>, and tacking "?action=edit" onto the page name just provokes an error message that I'm not allowed to. Yet the <a href="SandBox.html">SandBox</a> seems to have been used.

           <em>From: </em><a href="http://www.waywood.co.uk/MonkeyWiki/InstallationInstructions.html">http://www.waywood.co.uk/MonkeyWiki/InstallationInstructions.html</a>  "EDITABLE = 0 will make the site impossible to edit, otherwise put 1."  I believe the wiki was made un-editable on purpose.<em></em>

           Yes that's right - I did make it read-only while I was away on holiday because it kept getting hammered by spam. I have since put some spam-protection in place, but as yet I have no evidence of how effictive it is. The spam seems to have dried up on its own for now!
