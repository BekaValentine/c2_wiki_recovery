      <p>
        <a href="GtkPlus.html">GtkPlus</a>, or GTK+, is an <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> graphical widget toolset written in C which is primarily aimed at Unix desktop machines, although it has also been ported to the Win32 environment. It was initially written to support development of <a href="TheGimp.html">TheGimp</a> so that that <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> project could be developed without relying on the non-Free MotifToolkit, but it has since become a library in its own right. The "G" in "GTK" still stands for the Gimp.

        <strong>Quickly becoming THE replacement for Motif.  Sun ships GTK, HP ships GTK, and SGI has GTK as a download on their website, and it might be on the surfware CD.</strong>

        GTK+ is the basic widget set for the <a href="GnomeDesktopEnvironment.html">GnomeDesktopEnvironment</a>. The Gnome widgets are derived from basic GTK+ classes, and add a layer of features appropriate to a user desktop environment

           Should this article also describe the strange GTK+ type system?

        <strong>One tragic weakness of GTK+ is that I often hear there's no Mac version.  That said, though, it's the most highly-recommended toolkit for </strong><a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>.<strong></strong>

        <em></em><a href="GtkPlus.html">GtkPlus</a> now runs on XDarwin (EksDarwin in wikispeech?) which is a <a href="XwindowsProtocol.html">XwindowsProtocol</a> for Mac OS X. It can run rootless so X programs appear in Aqua. X programs run inside the XDarwin program (exactly like the Classic Environment). I just installed <a href="TheGimp.html">TheGimp</a> and it appears to be running fine on my iMac (now if I can just learn how to use the darned program).<em> -- </em><a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a>
