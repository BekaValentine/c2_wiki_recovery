        "McIlroy had been working on macros in the later 1950s, and was always theorizing to anyone who would listen about linking macros together to eliminate the need to make a series of discrete commands to obtain an end result. "If you think about macros," McIlroy explained, "they mainly involve switching data streams. I mean, you're taking input and you suddenly come to a macro call, and that says, 'Stop taking input from here and go take it from there.'"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Somewhere at that time I talked of a macro as a 'switchyard for data streams,' and there's a paper hanging in Brian Kernighan's office, which he dredged up from somewhere, where I talked about screwing together streams like a garden hose. So this idea had been banging around in my head for a long time."

        Macro processing modification of SAP. Led to TRAC.<br/>

        This paper describes a form for defining new operations in<br/>
        terms of a basic assembly-like language and other defined<br/>
        operations. The use of such macro-instructions provides a concise<br/>
        way of describing complicated procedures The author describes<br/>
        and illustrates with examples the important features of these<br/>
        definitions such as (1) the ability to refer to other definitions,<br/>
        (2) the indication of a reference hierarchy by parentheses, (3)<br/>
        the ability to conditionally include or exclude instructions,<br/>
        and (4) the ability to create floating addresses. An application<br/>
        of these techniques to writing algebraic compilers is briefly<br/>
        indicated. This application deals only with fully parenthesized<br/>
        expressions and it is not clear how remote symbolic references<br/>
        (floating addresses) within definitions are handled.<br/>
        It is interesting to this reviewer to observe the gradual<br/>
        coalition of the structure of macro-assemblers (or compilers)<br/>
        and algebraic compilers. The author"s description of the coding<br/>
        that must be added to a programming routine to make it a macro-<br/>
        instruction compiler also constitutes a description of the<br/>
        essential portion of an algebraic compiler. This similarity<br/>
        suggests that an alternate approach might be to start instead<br/>
        with a base program which contains a syntactical scanner,<br/>
        a storage allocation procedure, and a mechanism for handling<br/>
        remote connections.<br/>

        Macroinstruction compilers constructed from a small set of<br/>
        functions can be made extremely powerful. In particular,<br/>
        conditional assembly, nested definitions, and parenthetical<br/>
        notation serve to make a compiler capable of accepting very<br/>
        general extensions to its ground language.<br/>

        In the late 1950s. several symbolic assembly languages, such as<br/>
        SAP, had become available, and by 1957 some of these, including<br/>
        IBM"s SCAT and SAP for the 704 machine, permitted users to<br/>
        define macroinstructions (often called macros) as shorthand for<br/>
        frequently occurring sequences of machine instructions. Then<br/>
        in 1959, M. Douglas McIlroy and Douglas E. Eastwood of Bell<br/>
        Labs introduced conditional and recursive macros into SAP,<br/>
        and in 1960 described how macros could be used to extend any<br/>
        programming language to meet the user"s own special requirements.<br/>

        A translation approach is described which allows one to extend the syntax and semantics of a given high-level base language by the use of a new formalism called a syntax-macro. Syntax-macros define string transformations based on syntactic elements of the base language. Two types of macros are discussed, and examples are given of their use. The conditional generation of macros based on options and alternatives recognized by the scan are also described
