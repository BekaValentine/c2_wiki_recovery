        Internet Experience

      <p>
        The <a href="InternetExperience.html">InternetExperience</a> refers to the "LookAndFeel" of the internet, namely how pages look, act, and behave. Pages such as most of the pages on this <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> would have a different experience than, say, a <a href="WebSite.html">WebSite</a> that relies heavily on <a href="MacromediaFlash.html">MacromediaFlash</a> animations. Generally, you can group it into two categories:
      </p>
      <p>
        FormExperience: How the page looks. The <a href="MacromediaFlash.html">MacromediaFlash</a>-heavy <a href="WebSite.html">WebSite</a> would have a more EstheticallyPleasing design than, say, this <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        FunctionExperience: How the page performs. The <a href="MacromediaFlash.html">MacromediaFlash</a>-heavy <a href="WebSite.html">WebSite</a> would be completely incompatible with a <a href="PlainText.html">PlainText</a> <a href="InternetBrowser.html">InternetBrowser</a> such as <a href="LynxBrowser.html">LynxBrowser</a>, and would tend to have too much VisualClutter to perform better than, say, this <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, for a WebDesigner is to concentrate on FunctionExperience before FormExperience - This <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> lends itself to look bland, however it's simple and intuitive to use. (These rules also apply to <a href="ComputerProgramming.html">ComputerProgramming</a> in general.)
