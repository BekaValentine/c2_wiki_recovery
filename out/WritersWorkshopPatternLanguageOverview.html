        Writers Workshop Pattern Language Overview
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is an overview of a small pattern language
        for WritersWorkshops.
        You can see a list of the patterns
        (and start walking through the pattern language) at <a href="WritersWorkshopPatterns.html">WritersWorkshopPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a "cheap" pattern language.  The patterns
        not only should be applied in order, but reflect
        a temporal (rather than structural) progression.
        There is no single ideal medium to describe what
        goes on in a writer's workshop.  I use patterns
        here not because they describe structure, but because
        they provide an ideal form to elaborate the forces
        that drive these ceremonies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This collection of patterns is decidedly generative.
        None of these patterns stand alone;  they are gestalten
        that combine to make a whole larger than the sum of the lot.
        The patterns interact in intricate ways;  I attempt to
        describe the interactions in the course of the presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This language describes our many writer's workshop
        experiences at Bell Labs.  The rationales and forces
        recall the initial tutoring that the Hillsiders received
        from <a href="RichardGabriel.html">RichardGabriel</a> back in 1993 or 1994, at a retreat
        near Ben Lomond.  That's the closest link we have to the
        creative literature community, which has a lot more
        experience with this format than we do in the pattern
        community.  I offer this language as capturing practice
        that has worked very, very well for us, in hopes that others
        find it useful.
