        How to Design Programs is a great book for the absolute beginner programmer. It deals first with processing simple forms of data then moves to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          processing arbitrarily large data
        </li>
        <li>
          abstracting designs
        </li>
        <li>
          generative recursion
        </li>
        <li>
          accumulating knowledge
        </li>
        <li>
          changing the states of variables 
        </li>
        <li>
          changing compound values
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are the section titles from the book itself which can be found (in full, online but printable if you have that much paper) on <a href="http://www.htdp.org/">http://www.htdp.org/</a> or you can buy a copy direct from the MIT press (on that site) for about £43 (UK) / $67 (USA).

        I haven't read it yet but fully intend to over the next month or so as it seems very comprehensive and appears to have what I crave as a beginner programmer myself. Which is terms, definitions, concepts and examples that seem to provide a more holistic picture of modern programming and it's uses/potential to a new-comer than other 'teach-yourself-such-and-such' style books or reference books about a single or individual languages.

        Introduced to me by 'ska' (still don't know who you really are) who also left the message below on my <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It isn't as 'mainstream' as many books you may have seen, but it is aimed much better at your situation, I think. Also, this text is vastly superior to most introductory programming texts. In your shoes, I would seriously consider learning what programming is about before worrying too much about particular tools. HtDP won't teach you a popular language - but it will set you solidly on the road to being a real programmer. Picking one (or several) currently popular languages later at need will be easy if you have some depth of understanding. That being said, tools like <a href="DrScheme.html">DrScheme</a> probably do everything you are likely to need in the foreseeable future, so you can choose to stick with it if you want, also. -- ska"

        <strong>How to Design Programs</strong><br/>
        <strong>An Introduction to Programming and Computing</strong><br/>

        <dd><em>This introduction to programming places computer science in the core of a liberal arts education. Unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process. This approach fosters a variety of skills – critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail – that are important for everyone, not just future computer programmers.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>The book exposes readers to two fundamentally new ideas. First, it presents program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement; how to formulate concise goals; how to make up examples; how to develop an outline of the solution, based on the analysis; how to finish the program; and how to test. Each step produces a well-defined intermediate product. Second, the book comes with a novel programming environment, the first one explicitly designed for beginners. The environment grows with the readers as they master the material in the book until it supports a full-fledged language for the whole spectrum of programming tasks.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>All the book's support materials are available for free on the Web. The Web site includes the environment, teacher guides, exercises for all levels, solutions, and additional projects.</em></dd>

        This book is, in many ways, a <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a>-lite. It covers similar ground as <a href="StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.html">StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms</a> (and both books use <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> as the teaching mechanism), but the material in this book is quite a bit less daunting. Many of the examples in <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a> are drawn from other courses that your average MIT engineering student would study (lots of examples in <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a> have to deal with things like circuit simulations, problems that many non-EE's will have trouble understanding); HTDP deals with simpler problem domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a> (though being a shorter book) is a bit more comprehensive in the number of topics it covers. Quite a few interesting topics that <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a> covers in great depth (how to write interpreters, how to model unbounded-precision arithmetic, etc.) this book ignores or glosses over. For many programmers that won't matter much, but it's material that makes <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a> shine.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a big, thick book, but quite a bit of the text is examples and problems. If you skip over that, this book can be read through in a <a href="CuplaDays.html">CuplaDays</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One good thing about this book is that it's rather evangelism-free with regards to its language choice.
