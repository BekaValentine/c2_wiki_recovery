        Recursive Builder Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        In this Internet age, everybody publishes information and creates applications using HTML.  And so do you.  So you've got some interesting data to show the world, you read it from a database... and then?  You find the <a href="BuilderPattern.html">BuilderPattern</a> in the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> book.  And you decide that that's how you will build your HTML pages.  Your HTMLPageBuilder class will have methods startPage(), endPage(), startForm(), endForm(), addSubmitButton(), etc.  [Let's assume you're using Java.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you notice that the builder has many startXYZ() / endXYZ() methods.  Both of these usually need access to the same information; but whether they
        <em>really</em>
        need it at all depends on the specific HTML that is generated.  And: you always have to make sure that you have an endXYZ() for every startXYZ(). 
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, every time you build a recursive structure, the same thing occurs.  Isn't there a nicer interface for the builder?  Yes there is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
        use the Command pattern, and pass the builder a Command object which builds the internals of a given part of the structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the example, give the builder methods like "buildPage(String title, ICommand command)".  (Here ICommand is a simple interface with just a single "void execute()" method.)  At the place where buildPage() needs to build the internals of the page, it calls "command.execute()".  This command then calls other buildXYZ() methods as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        When working in Java, this is nicely combined with the 'anonymous classes' feature of Java 1.1, where you can use expressions like "new ICommand() { public void execute() { /*some code*/ } }".
      </p>
      <p>
        When working in Smalltalk, you of cource don't need an ICommand interface-- just use a Block.  The message then becomes "buildPageTitled: aTitle around: aBlock".
      </p>

      <p>
        And so you end up coupling shed loads of code to your current page layout, which marketing will want to change quite soon. XML/XSL parsers can help solve this problem, as can templating systems such as <a href="WebMacro.html">WebMacro</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In last case where I applied this pattern, this was exactly the concern.  Yes, it was concerned with DHTML generation, and no, XML/XSL/<a href="WebMacro.html">WebMacro</a> were not appropriate solutions.  So what we did is that the builder just builds up an object structure representing the logical page structure, and have a separate Writer class that visits the logical structure and creates out the DHTML.  When marketing or technology changed their mind again, it was often a matter of minutes to update the Writer.  So why did we keep the Builder interface, and don't we build the logical page structure directly?  For three reasons: (1) It seemed good to separate between the code that creates the logical structure and the code building it (<a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a>); (2) it turned out that for us it was easier to test through an abstract Builder interface, than to compare an expected and an actual object structure (see <a href="TestingBuildingCode.html">TestingBuildingCode</a>); and (3) it takes effort to remove the Builder interface, with changes to numerous test cases, and the gain is not worth the effort. -- <a href="MarnixKlooster.html">MarnixKlooster</a>

        <strong>Related question:</strong>
        I re-read the GoF <a href="BuilderPattern.html">BuilderPattern</a>, and noted two related remarks which seem contradictory to me.  In the "Implementation" section (p. 101) they say in point 2:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Tree structures such as parse trees that are built bottom-up are another example.  In that case, the builder would return child nodes to the director, which then would pass them back to the builder to build the parent nodes.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Which is of course an alternative for the <a href="RecursiveBuilderPattern.html">RecursiveBuilderPattern</a>.  But then I started wondering about the datatype of the child nodes that the builder would return.  And the GoF goes on to say in implementation issue 3:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>In the common case, the products produced by the concrete builders differ so greatly in their representation that there is little to gain from giving different products a common parent class.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Eh?  So what would be the type of the nodes that the builder creates?  Isn't this a contradiction? -- <a href="MarnixKlooster.html">MarnixKlooster</a>

        I think it is extremely important in know when to use <a href="TechnologiesOverPatterns.html">TechnologiesOverPatterns</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you clarify this? -- <a href="MarnixKlooster.html">MarnixKlooster</a>

        Yes, sometiems instead of using Patterns, it makes more sense to use Perl, or XML, or grammer-generator.  I love Patterns and use them all the time. But I'm also mature enough to know when not to use them.
