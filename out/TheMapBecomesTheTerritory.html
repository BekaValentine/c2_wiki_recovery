        The Map Becomes The Territory
      </h1>
      <p>
        Where a description of a process or product is utilized via some formal and predictable (albeit not necessarily automatic) mechanism to execute a process or create a product, one can say that <a href="TheMapBecomesTheTerritory.html">TheMapBecomesTheTerritory</a>.  Such a map could be a design document, a blueprint for a lithograph, a description for a house's wiring or plumbing, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has the neat and useful property whereby we can examine the design-description (the 'map') and learn everything we want to know about the product... under the assumption, of course, that it is actually implemented in accordance with the map, which means within the map's specified acceptable error tolerances.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the vast majority of modern computer hardware products, <a href="TheMapBecomesTheTerritory.html">TheMapBecomesTheTerritory</a>.  This is a practical necessity due to the requirement to program a manufacturing plant to properly construct the hardware.  Similarly, when compiling software, one can often say that <a href="TheMapBecomesTheTerritory.html">TheMapBecomesTheTerritory</a>, often with zero error-tolerances (making it even more predictable).
