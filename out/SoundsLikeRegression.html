        Sounds Like Regression

        <a href="JoelSpolsky.html">JoelSpolsky</a> on his <a href="WebLog.html">WebLog</a> describes the process of refactoring one of his products: FogBugz.
        He often makes comments on <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, describing which parts are valuable to him.
        However, the article linked above talks about the reasons why unit tests were not written (and he also breaks the <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> advice DontRefactorWithoutTest).  They sum up to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          - It's easier to 'just write the code'
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          - It's easier to 'hand check the html response'
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        and critically
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           - Use the working HTML for the unit test.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I'm still learning a lot about the areas that <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> has introduced me too, but I can't help feeling that the description of number three is perfect for a <em>regression</em> test!
