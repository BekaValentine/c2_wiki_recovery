        My first experience with wiki was a few years ago when I set up a <a href="TikiWiki.html">TikiWiki</a> as a tool for long-distance collaborative program planning in my work.

        This worked fairly well and I continued to sample different wiki platforms.  I recently became a fan of Plone as a Content Management System, using ZWiki as one component of it.  My current (2005) project is the development of the Rootstalk Project, an online grassroots political think tank (<a href="http://www.rootstalk.org).">http://www.rootstalk.org).</a>

        I've read much on this site about the attempts to use wiki for political discussion and the subsequent problems and failures.  Some folks say it is a tool that simply can't be used for political collaborations.  I'm either an optimist or a fool for trying, but I'll give it my best shot.
