        Nibbled To Death
      </h1>
      <p>
        To be <strong>Nibbled To Death</strong> means that you've been charged for this, charged for that, charged for every little thing, and while each charge on its own may have been insignificant, the totality is overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Banks in the UK excel at this.

      <p>
        The phrase often heard in the U.S. is actually "Nibbled to Death by Ducks" ... Same phrase?
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe here in the UK it's more recognisable as what happens to students. ;-)

        <em>Actually, in The Good Ol' US of A we say, "Nickel and dimed to death," meaning small charges applied all over the place that add up to a large drain on finances.</em> - Indeed, if you click on the title of this page you'll find it referenced by <a href="NickelAndDime.html">NickelAndDime</a>.
