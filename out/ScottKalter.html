      <p>
        Scott Kalter is a free-lance software contractor.  He has worked as an MTS, General Manager, Vice President, and even a cofounder of an Internet startup.

        He stumbled into <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> while perusing Object Oriented Tips [<a href="http://www.kinetica.com/ootips/">http://www.kinetica.com/ootips/</a> - <em></em><a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> as of 2004-02-22<em>].  </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        His gratification at seeing <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> was extreme as he did research in the early '90s working on real-time collaborative tools to support just such activity (he and his partners were tired of time-sharing the keyboard).

      <p>
        The policies towards <a href="ContinuousIntegrationRelentlessTesting.html">ContinuousIntegrationRelentlessTesting</a>, <a href="XpDesign.html">XpDesign</a>, <a href="ModelFirst.html">ModelFirst</a>, <a href="BusinessValueFirst.html">BusinessValueFirst</a> and <a href="WorstThingsFirst.html">WorstThingsFirst</a> are extremely refreshing and reminiscent of discussions with his friend <a href="MartyHeyman.html">MartyHeyman</a>.
