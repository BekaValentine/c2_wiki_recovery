        Wiki Conversation Argue
      </h1>
      <p>
        We gotta argue about <a href="WikiConversation.html">WikiConversation</a> or we'll never know whether the stuff
        on <a href="WikiConversationAgree.html">WikiConversationAgree</a> is the stuff about which we agree, or just the stuff
        someone articulate has managed to pull on the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do what thou wilt with <a href="WikiConversation.html">WikiConversation</a>, but aim to just grow this beast here.
        If you reckon something here has consensused out, and folk agree, move it
        to <a href="WikiConversationAgree.html">WikiConversationAgree</a>: take your own contributions to a thread out of here
        when they're what that page says (well, maybe leave the why and the wherefore
        that brought us to that agreement).  If you can see that there's a few well-defined camps into which opinion forms, maybe set them out on <a href="WikiConversation.html">WikiConversation</a>, see what folk do to it there.  When stuff's entrenched there,
        maybe rip some of it out of here just like if it'd been agreed on.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see a page with a natural name, and you think it needs some arguing
        about, create it's ~Argue page and argue on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make it up as we go along.  Do what we will.  Remember good humour in arguing,
        and never forget what <a href="GoodStyle.html">GoodStyle</a> tells you.  But argue, anyway - without thesis
        and antithesis, there ain't gonna be no synthesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and say who you woz and (at least if it's out of order) when you sed it.

           <em>Argue? Okay. Date/thread format sux. The key to </em><a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a> is being able to delete and synthesize; anything that gets in the way of that is against <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> and won't survive.<em> --</em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

      </ul>
      <p>
        I think ~Debate might be a more neutral tag for n-party m-sided Debate where both 
        argument and agreeing take place. -EB
