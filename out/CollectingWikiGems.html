        Collecting Wiki Gems
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is the art and practice of extracting in a process very much like mining, the gems which exist in this RawWiki. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time I find one, I pick it up, look at it, and then decide whether I should put it in my bag. (My <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>). Sometimes only part of what I pick up is worth saving, so I chip off the residue and keep the rest. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is partly in response to possibility that although what I have in reality is a copy of the Gem, the original may be lost from this wiki.
