        Study Online
      </h1>
      <p>
        I want to take some formal classes in some specific programming topics (databases, SQL, XML, and a high-level programming language) but I don't have the time for graduate school, week-long seminars, or even classes at a local college. I'm mostly self-taught, but I find that HR people like pretty paper certificates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, my day job is not IT-related, so I have no local guru's brain to pick. I think (rightly so) that I'd much rather read your comments than ask on AskSlashdot.

        So how about it? Are there any good online study options which lead to pretty (and marketable) certificates? Money isn't a major consideration: if it's recommended, I'll find the resources.

        I understand that I have special needs (not being a typical IT type), but perhaps a <a href="StudyOnline.html">StudyOnline</a> pattern can develop out of my question.

        Many colleges have "Distance Learning" programs, complete with pretty certificates.
        For example, the University of Washington Extension program's web-site is:
        <a href="http://www.outreach.washington.edu/">http://www.outreach.washington.edu/</a>
        A typical sequence is 3 one-quarter classes.
        When taught in a classroom, each class is typically 3 hours of lecture per week,
        and roughly 6 hours of homework per week, for 10 weeks.

        I took the UW Extension's introductory sequence in databases and SQL.
        (I took the 3 classes in the classroom.) It was very worthwhile. -- <a href="JasperPaulsen.html">JasperPaulsen</a>
