        Wiki Interviews
      </h1>
      <p>
        The idea is this. Interview pages take the form <strong>JoeSoapInterviewsFredNoggins</strong> or more simply <strong>WikiInterviewsFredNoggins</strong>. The first can morph across to the latter, by agreement mainly of FredNoggins, but the reverse is not normally true.
      </p>
      <p>
        In either of the above cases, and unlike most newspaper or magazine interviews, FredNoggins has final editorial control over the page. The interviewer(s) are there to suggest questions but are not expected to complain
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           if a question is not answered
        </li>
        <li>
           if a question is deleted
        </li>
        <li>
           if a question is "improved" by FredNoggins before being answered
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any attempt on the part of the interviewer to edit FredNoggins' answers to indicate what they <em>should</em> have said is considered particularly bad form, unless FredNoggins decides otherwise.

      <p>
        Reading <a href="RichardDrakeInterviewsWardCunningham.html">RichardDrakeInterviewsWardCunningham</a>, I think I'd like to see a line before each question (more or less) <em>-- like was done on </em><a href="InterviewWithKent.html">InterviewWithKent</a>.<em></em>
        Then it would be easier to see the transition from topic to topic.
        <em>(Of course, it would make more of a difference if more than one question was answered!  ;-)</em>
        This style might also encourage refactoring or linking to other Wiki pages for discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also thinking of a convention for "JoeSoapInterviewsFredNoggins<em>Discussion</em>" pages, for 3rd party comments.
