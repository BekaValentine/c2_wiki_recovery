        Bluetail Ab
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ok, so I didn't delete your page this time, and I guess I was being too irritable in having done so before, but I still want you to answer my question.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am aware that you are far more stubborn than I am, and I am aware that you have resources, such as open proxies, that allow you to exert your will, regardless of what anyone else says. I'm not trying to dispute that, I get it, but I still have an open question.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here we have a page about "Bluetail AB", and it has some kind of history that is presumably interesting to someone. Ok, fine, so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've just been wondering, from the beginning, what did Bluetail AB do, that makes you or anyone interested in their history, such that you want this page to remain?
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I may have implied otherwise by words or actions, I never meant to say I thought this page definitely should not exist, I've just been wanting to know what the subject is, if this page is to remain, and I think the page should explain itself, rather than requiring me to do research to find out what the page might be about.
      </p>
      <p>
        I gather that Bluetail AB used Erlang, and that some one or more of the original Erlang designers went to work for Bluetail after leaving Ericson. Is that what makes this company/page interesting? If so, why is that interesting? Because few companies use Erlang, or what?
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the kind of thing I was asking to be added to this page. I do not have any interest in <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>ing this page even with a regular <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>, let alone someone with your kind of infinite stubbornness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't want to fight at all, ideally, but also ideally, I'd like to see pages explain at least minimally what is up with their subject matter, that's all. I would think you wouldn't object to <strong>that</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So would you kindly answer those kinds of questions, and we can make your answer part of the page, and then there's no reason to delete the page, and then everyone's happy. Ok with you?
      </p>
      <p>
        The particular usage of <a href="ErlangLanguage.html">ErlangLanguage</a> by Bluetail AB doesn't seem especially interesting, but it is interesting that a company can be built around Erlang. <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a> (who probably created this page originally) might have further information, but he seems not to visit here infrequently.

        Apparently, Bluetail AB (a Swedish company) was purchased by Alteon Web Systems, which was in turn bought by Nortel. The links originally given below have therefore been replaced with corresponding links within the <a href="InternetArchive.html">InternetArchive</a>. This page is for those interested in the history - ignore it if you aren't interested.
