        Inversion Of Control

        A very good text titled <em>Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection Pattern</em> can be found at <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>s bliki: <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html.">http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html.</a>

        When did <a href="InversionOfControl.html">InversionOfControl</a> change from a term describing how I/O is performed in event-driven operating systems and frameworks into a term that means "pass an object's dependencies to the constructor" which is just normal object-oriented programming?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Event driven I/O frameworks are instances of </em>IoC, not the definition. It doesn't mean passing anything to constructors. See <a href="HollywoodPrinciple.html">HollywoodPrinciple</a> and Martin Fowler's article for more.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        IoC, as another term for <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>, is just passing things to constructors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So, I suppose I should get rid of all those non-constructor @inject statements in my Java code then.  </em>'CLEARLY<strong>, they're not </strong>IoC or <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>.  No siree.  You got me -- I'm caught.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        @inject still applies (or is intended to apply) at construction time of the object.
