        Short Wiki Signatures Smell
      </h1>
      <p>
        Signing contributions with initials ('-- qc') instead of a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> ('-- QuentinCrisp') is a <a href="WikiSmell.html">WikiSmell</a> of over-reliance on <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>. If you're writing so much that you find this shortcut handy, try <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition,

           Initials aren't good identifiers. In September 2004, there were 310 unique sets of initials vs. 393 sets that were ambiguous*. For example, 'jb' could refer to any of 53 <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a>. [*computed from all pages in <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a> with two- or three-part <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>s; there are probably a few ringers.] 10 years later there are over 4400 pages categorised as <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>s (an unknown number of homepages are not categorised). Given there are 27 letters, the probability of a set of 2 initials being unique is 0.00137. And 4400 * 0.00137 = 6.04 therefore every such set should have more than 6 similar in the average by now. In other words: When the number of sets of 2 letters reaches 729 than the probability that any given set has one similar is 1. So initials become more confusing than helping with communities over 700 members.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="LinksAreContent.html">LinksAreContent</a>, and initials aren't links. They don't offer a way to learn about and leave comments for contributors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Initials aren't friendly to newcomers to the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, and make Wiki feel like a private club. Wiki is already more than enough of a challenge for newcomers; please don't make it more so.

           Signing with initials creates more work for refactorers. Before moving a quote to a different context, a refactorer either must determine who the initials belong to, or refactor away the signature. DontMakeWorkForOthers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The one place where signing with initials is harmless is one's <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>, where there's an obvious connection between initials and authorship.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if you use a full signature early in a thread, it's not too bad to post follow-up stuff with your initials. This happens a lot and <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s can pick it up pretty easy. Ideally, refactoring out of <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> will eliminate most signatures anyway, so it's only when we want to maintain a thread that this is a big deal. Make sure your full signature is on the page somewhere though, or don't sign at all.

        Most of these arguments apply to other non-<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> signatures too, e.g. '-- quentin'.

        A particular offender is 'dl', whose initials grace ~200 pages. Who is DL? Hard to say. There are twenty-five people with those initials who have home pages on the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>.

        I personally do not care as long as a signature is <strong>unique</strong> among a topic or related topics in which the person is participating to avoid confusion. If one letter is sufficient to achieve uniqueness, that's fine. <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> can also achieve this, although that is not its original purpose. Wiki has always accepted anonymous contributions, and short-cut signatures can be viewed as simply anonymous contributions with extra info in order to have a continuity of discussion beyond a few paragraphs. It sort of reminds me of scoping rules withing software code. We can roughly break it down as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>No Signature</strong> - Uniqueness only within paragraph
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Short-hand/Abbreviations</strong> - Uniqueness only with a topic or topic grouping
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> Nicknames with a wiki "home" page<strong> - Uniqueness within </strong><a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>RealNames<strong> - Uniqueness over the whole WWW (approximately)</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I hope we can welcome all as long as they follow the necessary conventions to know which is which. Some propose only the first and last be permitted (<a href="RealNamesOnlyOrAnonymous.html">RealNamesOnlyOrAnonymous</a>). I don't understand why scope must either be very small OR very large, but nothing in between.
