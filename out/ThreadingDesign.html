        Threading Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        Are these described already somewhere?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here goes, from the top of my head:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No threading at all.  Usually asynchronous events that happen in the context of the process (signals, interrupts) are not considered threads.  The traditional approach to these little asynchronities (is there such a word?) is to make them respect the integrity of the main thread.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           One thread, main thread, doing most of the work but starting threads to do background tasks when needed.  Often used as a workaround for library calls that cannot be requested to send completion events to the system's event multiplexor (eg select()).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           One thread, main thread, that only exists to start worker threads for any real work.  Often uses a pool of worker threads to avoid thread creation / termination costs.  All state-integrity critical code has to be made threadsafe under explicit locking.  Further divided into:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           coarse locking, where big subsystems are written in the "traditional" way (no threadsafety) and have a common lock for ensuring that at most one thread executes in the subsystem at any time (like many OS kernels);
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           fine-grained locking, where each object has its own lock (if it needs one).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           no locking, where no system does changes into global / heap-allocated variables (like scripts executed in a web server);
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           some suitable combination of the above.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Dedicated threads.  All threads have their own "areas" in the application, and communicate with each other via well-defined, threadsafe interfaces.  Sometimes referred to as message-passing.  Further divided into:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           coarse division, where there are relatively big subsystems with one thread for each.  Akin to old-fashioned processes;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           fine division, where each component (object, structure) has its own thread (like Erlang programs).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some combination of dedicated / moving threads, eg.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           threads that most of the time stay in their dedicated system, but may make direct (ie not message-based) calls into other systems.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Others?
