        What's Happened To <a href="RoedyGreen.html">RoedyGreen</a>? - His very informative web site <a href="http://mindprod.com">http://mindprod.com</a> has not been working for a while.

        This is obviously a concern because of his medical condition.

        Well, a quick look at comp.lang.java.advocacy has him still posting his irrepressible views on most things today (2001-09-24), and his sig contains a link to the defunct website (can't reach it from here either)..... hopefully it will be back up soon.
        As an aside, java.advocacy seems to have sunk from its usual flame-fest into a political discussion ground.... i thought that usenet was wide enough to soak this sort of thing up.

        His site is back up, with several recent updates. Yay :)

        As of today (15-Apr-2002), I can reach <a href="http://mindprod.com">http://mindprod.com</a> fine;
        last week I was not.  It seems this problem comes and goes.

        Deaths of famous geeks always make me wonder how Roedy's doing. Incidentally, he seems to still be alive (2003-10-06), posting away as usual. I am very happy that this is the case. -- <a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a>

        I also get a stab of panic when his website's down, as it is right now (2004-01-10). According to <<a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/groups?q=author:%22Roedy+Green%22&scoring=d">http://groups.google.co.uk/groups?q=author:%22Roedy+Green%22&scoring=d</a>>, though, he's still on the case - <em>Roedy: DESTROY ALL REPUBLICANS!!!</em>. -- ta
