        The main character learns this ditty when he needs a rhyme that can't be gotten out of one's head. This is to hide his murderous intent from mind-reading police. Don't worry, the book is actually a lot better than this plot summary might indicate.

        In fact it's a famous classic that won the <a href="HugoAward.html">HugoAward</a>. Also classic is his <em>The Stars My Destination</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's borrow a polished plot summary under fair use: "a psychological thriller in which a tycoon decides to kill a rival and get away with it in an era in which telepathic cops catch every serious criminal; both in its sparkling portrayal of multi-person mind-to-mind dialogue, and in its narrative trickery, the story of Ben Reich and his nemesis Lincoln Powell is one of sf's most effective contributions to the noir thriller."

        That site says his novel <em>The Computer Connection</em> was nominated for both the Hugo and the Nebula, yet somehow I managed to overlook it all these years. Hmm.

        Back to <a href="TenserSaidTheTensor.html">TenserSaidTheTensor</a>...that reminds me of another mentally-mesmerizing ditty (an army marching song, in this case), although used for offensive purposes (it was sort of a mental virus in the original <a href="GermanLanguage.html">GermanLanguage</a>, but given only in <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a> translation in the story for the sake of reader safety :-)

        Left, right, left, right,<br/>
        Left his wife and seventeen children<br/>
        in starving condition<br/>

        Left, right, left, right..<br/>

        But I can't recall the author or title of the short story.

        Another catchy ditty by Alfred Bester, this from "Fondly Fahrenheit" (<em>The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</em>, August 1954):
      </p>
      <code>
        Oh, it's no feat to beat the heat<br/>
        All reet! All reet!<br/>
        So jeet you seat<br/>
        Be fleet be fleet<br/>
        Cool and discreet<br/>
        Honey...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And from Bester's "The Push of a Finger" (<em>Astounding</em>, May 1942):
