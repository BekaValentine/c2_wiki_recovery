      <ul>
        <li>
           Is it sensitive to disturbances in Power? Ethernet cabling?
        </li>
        <li>
           Do the LEDs blink in a correct way?
        </li>
        <li>
           Does it radiate too much? (EMC testing)
        </li>
        <li>
           Does it handle electrostatic discharges? (ESD testing)
        </li>
        <li>
           Does it matter if the cables are connected in any particular order?
        </li>
        <li>
           What happens when the ethernet interface gets 230 volts?
        </li>
        <li>
           What happens when the power interface gets 230 volts?
        </li>
        <li>
           Does it work if we use a vacuum cleaner on the same 230 volt connectors. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Can it take 100Mbits of traffic load?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Put a big magnet next to it. Does it still work?
        </li>
        <li>
           Shake it while it's working. Does it still work?
        </li>
        <li>
           Drop it. (Call it an accident. ;-)  Does it still work?
        </li>

        Oops. Thanks. Just started typing this test spec on the public <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> so it could later be moved to our internal website. Is anyone else interested in putting together generic test-specifications for "internet devices" on this site? /<a href="AndersHedberg.html">AndersHedberg</a>
