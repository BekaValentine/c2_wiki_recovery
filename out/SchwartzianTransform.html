        Schwartzian Transform
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> idiom for sorting arrays according to a criterion that is a function of the elements in the array.  It cleverly avoids computing the criterion value every time an element in the array is passed as a comparand to the sort block.  The code for the transform is typically insanely concise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic steps are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Turn the array into an array of references to pairs, whose first elements are the elements of the array themselves, and whose second elements are the computed criterion values.  Perl's map() function accomplishes this concisely.
        </li>
        <li>
           Sort the array created in the first step by the second elements of the pairs, using Perl's sort() function and a sort block.
        </li>
        <li>
           Turn the sorted array from the second step back into an array, again using map().
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Named after its inventor, <a href="RandalSchwartz.html">RandalSchwartz</a>, a prominent figure in the <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also known as map-sort-map and decorate-sort-undecorate (DSU).

        An example from the above article: "Suppose I have a file that has people's names in the first column, and bowling scores in the second column:
      </p>
      <code>
        Fred 210<br/>
        Barney 195<br/>
        Betty 200<br/>
        Wilma 170<br/>
        Dino 30<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and that I want to sort this file based on bowling scores."
      </p>
      <p>
        The article presents this solution to sort lines from stdin according to the numerical values in the second space-delimited column:
      </p>
      <code>
        #!/usr/bin/perl<br/>
        print map { $_->[0] }<br/>
        sort { $a->[1] <=> $b->[1] }<br/>
        map { [$_, (split)[1] ] }<br/>
        <>;<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, it is customary to decorate the info so that the value to sort by comes first in a tuple and the second item in the tuple is the original info. The built-in sort method for Python lists does the sorting work. Then, to undecorate, just drop the first item from the tuple. Assume here the bowling info is read from a file f:
      </p>
      <code>
        bowling = [line.split() for line in f]<br/>
        decorated = [(int(pair[1]), pair) for pair in bowling]<br/>
        decorated.sort()<br/>
        undecorated = [pair[1] for pair in decorated]<br/>
        for pair in undecorated: print " ".join(pair)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It's easy in <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> to supply your own comparison function to the built-in sort method for sorting by special criteria.
      </p>
      <code>
        def compare(a, b):<br/>
        return cmp(int(a.split()[1]), int(b.split()[1]))<br/>
        bowling = f.readlines()<br/>
        bowling.sort(compare)<br/>
        for line in bowling: print line[:-1]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But using the built-in sort method with a user-defined comparison function can be much slower than decorating each item to sort with the info to sort by, then using the built-in sort method as-is, then undecorating the items. Hence, the real purpose of DSU--at least in <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>--is to sort <em>efficiently</em> by special criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Python 2.4, DSU's importance is acknowledged by supporting it directly via the optional `key=' named argument to the `sort' method (and the new `sorted' built-in function).  To built-in sort the above-exemplified `bowling' list by integer value of the scores, for example, you could code:
      </p>
      <code>
        bowling = [line.split() for line in f]<br/>
        bowling.sort(key=lambda name, score: int(score))<br/>
        for pair in bowling: print " ".join(pair)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is maximally efficient (even faster than explicitly coding out the DSU as above).  Almost as fast, if you want to sort "on the fly" without altering the `bowling' array, is the new `sorted' built-in:
      </p>
      <code>
        bowling = [line.split() for line in f]<br/>
        for pair in sorted(bowling, key=lambda name, score: int(score)):<br/>
        print " ".join(pair)<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        DSU is also the recommended trick in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> for the same reason, if I remember correctly.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> (as of version 1.8), the idiom is explicitly mapped via the method Enumerable#sort_by. For example, to sort numbers alphabetically:
      </p>
      <code>
        [1,2,3,10].sort_by {|n| n.to_s}        #=> [1, 10, 2, 3]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It is even possible due to the way Ruby does array comparisons to sort things based on multiple criteria. For example, to sort personnel records by last name, then first name:
      </p>
      <code>
        personnel_records.sort_by { |person| [person.last_name, person.first_name] }<br/>
      </code>
