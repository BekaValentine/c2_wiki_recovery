        Displacement Activity

        Activity undertaken when some more important task's deadline is looming.

        When I was studying for my final degree examinations I played more bridge than ever before. That was pretty much a pure <a href="DisplacementActivity.html">DisplacementActivity</a>.
      </p>

        I'm wondering how much other authors and programmers suffer from this weakness -- <a href="SteveHolden.html">SteveHolden</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably pretty much everyone who's reading Wiki.

        For example,

           <a href="http://www.hotornot.com/">http://www.hotornot.com/</a> (More pictures of people than you could ever need.  Appeals to the voyeuristic and judgmental side of <a href="HumanNature.html">HumanNature</a>.  Utterly unproductive.)
        </li>
        <li>
           House work.  Conventional wisdom is that it needs doing. If you're not disciplined enough to do it regularly as a normal chore, then ask yourself why this time you suddenly decided to do it before you absolutely had to.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>. It's educational, creative and maybe even sociable .. but is that why I'm here?  I suspect not.

        <strong>Better and worse displacement activities</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not necessarily a weakness. It can be part of a strategy to give the subconscious more control. It' a signal that rest is necessary. It can be part of decreasing the available time, increasing the pressure, thereby delivering a better result. Sometimes a sense of urgency can produce a better result than otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The above is the most common rationalization strategy used by </em><a href="ChronicProcrastinator.html">ChronicProcrastinator</a>s. <a href="PeopleDontThinkFasterUnderPressure.html">PeopleDontThinkFasterUnderPressure</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Though it's important to note that some displacement activities are a better form of (mental, physical, psychological) rest than others. <a href="TeleVision.html">TeleVision</a> is a pretty common <a href="DisplacementActivity.html">DisplacementActivity</a> for many people, though I'd argue that it doesn't really let you rest. Probably far better to: Have coffee with a friend, go for a bike ride, or cook a meal with fresh produce you just bought from the market.

        <strong>The suffering</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people have some kind of displacement activity. For some, it's Wiki. For others, it's solitaire. For others, it's hot-or-not or <a href="NetHack.html">NetHack</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, when a deadline draws near, I think, If only I hadn't spent time the a <a href="DisplacementActivity.html">DisplacementActivity</a> I'd be finished long ago. And yet, I don't know if that's true.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't take the rest (because this would be seen as abandoning our high-pressure deadline) so we do the displacement activity instead. We get the worst of both worlds: no rest and no progress.
      </p>

        I really enjoyed thinking about my neglected VW bus as a mental break during overwhelming political or technical circumstances.  A little hope, a lot of displacement, an opportunity for [different, at least] creativity and self expression, and rest.   And reading a mailing list every so often gave the added outlet of alternate community.  I think this is the reason religions push church attendance and a day of rest.

        ...and in complete retrospect, I've enjoyed <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> and <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> for this exact reason working in the trenches of C++ applications.  It's very rewarding to come across points in displacement activity that benefit the drudgery of the important tasks.  Prototyping and testing design was the reward I found in Python. -- Dean

        The only time I get any household chores done is when I have a work-related deadline looming.  The fact that I would rather clean my toilet than do my work is a pretty clear indication of how much I enjoy my job.  --<a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To get household chores done, ask your employer to promise a deadline on something hard to a customer.

        Engaging in <a href="DisplacementActivity.html">DisplacementActivity</a> may well be a weakness by some reasonable definition of weakness, but it's a fact that we do it and it's hard for us to not do it.  Rather than forcing ourselves to exercise enormous willpower to do the work at the right time, <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> makes it <em>easy</em> to start the task.

        <em>I would like to be able to use </em><a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> as an escape, but one of the problems leading to indulgence in <a href="DisplacementActivity.html">DisplacementActivity</a> in the first place is the solitude of the single consultant, author, programmer, what have you. I've bemoaned before the absence of <a href="VirtualPairProgramming.html">VirtualPairProgramming</a> tools, maybe someone has good news? Or maybe I just need to get out more? -- <a href="SteveHolden.html">SteveHolden</a><em></em>

        This is a specific form of <em>have accountability</em>.  A very useful idea for all parts of life, not just for work.  I am a more responsible person now than in my youth because I have a wife and kids to answer to.  Since I work at home though, playing with kids is a convenient <a href="DisplacementActivity.html">DisplacementActivity</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would say having accountability makes it harder to avoid starting the task.  It's still not <em>easy</em> though.

        I have long suspected that the reason managers and businesses are so excited about <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is because it will cut down on web surfing. One computer, two people, really keeps that slave-driving whip going. Not nearly as easy to pretend you are working. Catbert would be proud.
