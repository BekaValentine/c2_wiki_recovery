        The <a href="EntityBroker.html">EntityBroker</a> - efficient and intelligent database access
        Writing Business Software means manipulating data. As a matter of fact, the major part of the code often deals only with moving data to and from the databases into and out of the object model. In the world of Java, professional often resort to an Object-Relational mapper to completely automate this task. Until now, in the world of Windows development, these tools were not available. We are now changing this - for the first time, an Object-Relational mapper is available for .NET-developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In "Regular Business Applications" that most of us programmers are writing all of the time, we need to access data that is normally stores in an SQL database. Data access, especially using the past Frameworks that Microsoft has delivered (DAO, RDO, ADO) and today's ADO.NET-technology has always been easy - but never been integrated with the object oriented programming model that is in use in today's software architectures. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal with the <a href="EntityBroker.html">EntityBroker</a> is to change this. Besides a small configuration file, you donâ€™t even know that a business object is stored in the database, and as the developer of the object, you just have to adhere to some simple rules for programming your object. What you get out of this is simple - BoB is handling all the persistence for you. You can "just save" your objects, you can query for them, you can follow relations, and behind the easy to use object oriented API, all SQL statements are created for you automatically. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="EntityBroker.html">EntityBroker</a> is a framework for automatically mapping your business objects into database tables. Reading and writing the data contained in the objects is done automatically - as a developer, you just add some lines of attributes to the code of your business object, and you get transparent persistence. The Framework is not only handling simple object persistence, but also handling relations, data binding (yes, you can directly bind a business object to a form) and complex queries.
