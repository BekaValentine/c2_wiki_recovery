        Organize Java Unit Tests
      </h1>
      <p>
        Please it's not a Usenet discussion, so keep the subject general (no "because I am using XYZ I prefer to...") or this will end up in a bloody war!  Users following these simple rules should be able to use the most features of <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> without having the mess.  (<a href="VladimirBossicard.html">VladimirBossicard</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Proposed organization:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           separate tests from production code (two separate trees)
        </li>
        <li>
           one (or more) test class per code class <em>(Sometimes there are good reasons from breaking out some of the tests for a code class.)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           test classes in the same package as the code classes
        </li>
        <li>
           one <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> per package  <em>(Sometimes more, you might want to have a separate test suite that tests persistence with the actual database, for example.)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           one TestAll that includes all <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>s
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Name test classes in a way that can be easily detected with reflection</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you use <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> for class names (as is the Java convention), name your test classes after the tested class, with the prefix "Test_".  E.g. the class DatabaseConnector would be tested by the class Test_DatabaseConnector.
      </p>
      <p>
        A naming convention like this makes it easy to distinguish test classes from functional classes, both visually and mechanically.  The latter is useful when you...

      <p>
        <strong>Use reflection to create </strong><a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>s<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a>, it's easy to forget to add a test case to a test suite.  (You may be retro-fitting tests to some code you have inherited, for example).  Furthermore, building a test suite by hand is repetitive, boring, work -- that's the kind of work the computer should be doing, not the programmer!  Therefore, use reflection to automatically build the test suite for a test class.  The latest version of <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> can do this for individual test classes, but does not help you construct a single Test<strong>'All class for your entire system.  Therefore...</strong>

        <strong>Build test hierarchies automatically</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a generic System<strong>'Test class that can find all the unit tests on the classpath and organises them into a tree of test suites organised by package.  It does this by recursively searching for class files that start with my naming convention for tests ("Test_") and are not inner classes (the file name does not contain "$").  This ensures that my test suite contains all tests for all packages with no extra work on my part.  It also means that I can have...</strong>

        <dd>Instead of relying on MagicFilenames, wouldn't it be better to define a <a href="MarkerInterface.html">MarkerInterface</a> which all your test classes implement and use that to decide whether a class belongs to a test suite or not? -- <a href="IvesAerts.html">IvesAerts</a></dd>
      </dl>

        <dd><em>If you have to check whether a class implements an interface then you to load every class to check whether its a test.  It is much faster to scan filenames in directories than to dynamically load and link class files.  Therefore I prefer using </em>MagicFilenames.<em> --</em><a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a></dd>

      <p>
        <strong>No explicit per-package test suites</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's boring to keep a per-package test suite in sync with the tests in the package.  Therefore, per-package suites should be generated automatically (see above).

        Many of us working in <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> tend to have separate packages for test cases, because you can't split a package across projects and we can't be bothered to write something to strip out the test cases for production. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially in <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>, create package X.test to hold tests for package X.

        Test classes in the same package as the code classes ? Is there a reason why it is  good to follow this rule, when all 
        we want to test in unit tests are public interfaces.? (Rahul Salota)

        <em>Not if everything you test is public and you don't need to instrument your production code for testing.</em>
