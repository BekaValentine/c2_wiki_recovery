      <p>
        <a href="CodeGeneration.html">CodeGeneration</a> is the process
        by which some (semi?)automated tool (the <a href="CodeGenerator.html">CodeGenerator</a>) is used
        to turn higher level (more abstract) input
        into lower level (less abstract) output.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I disagree. Reading database schemas via JDBC and generating java code is not a higher level to lower level issue. We need a better definition that encompases this sort of horizontal business.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>how about: "to turn an abstract input, or a terse input, or a high level input (or any other existing input) into either a less abstract output, or a more verbose (less terse) output, or a lower level output, or, basically, some other output that doesn't yet exist." </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, this </em><a href="CodeGeneration.html">CodeGeneration</a> definition is good, we need better definition of higher level/lower level.
        In your sample database schemas via JDBC are higher level because you chose it to be higher level. If you will update database schemas from a java code then java code becomes higher level and database schemas - lower level. Highest possible level is human input. Lowest possible level does not exist, because it's always possible to generate next level from any other level. Usually the lowest level of an interactive program is set of windows on user interface screen, but even this level can be used to generate something else looping through windows handles.<em> -- </em><a href="AlekseyPavlichenko.html">AlekseyPavlichenko</a>

        <a href="CodeGeneration.html">CodeGeneration</a> is the process of transforming <em>code</em> from one representation to another. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, this is from a higher to a lower level:

        The output of the <a href="CodeGenerator.html">CodeGenerator</a> invariably needs further processing
        before it is complete.
        This further processing may or may not be fully automated;
        hence the distinction between <a href="ActiveCodeGeneration.html">ActiveCodeGeneration</a> and <a href="PassiveCodeGeneration.html">PassiveCodeGeneration</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's not true that it "invariably needs further processing"; there have always been e.g. compilers that produce machine code directly rather than assembly. Also, whatever finally does produce the machine code typically can be considered to be a "code generator" (consider macro assemblers if you have any doubt), so that claim is necessarily false; the recursion has to stop somewhere.

           But those data tables can be (and often are) regarded as just a different representation of code/programs.

        <li>
           ... such as the lookup tables generated by lex/flex when generating lexical scanners: the most constructive interpretation of those tables is that they represent the specification of a certain finite automaton - i.e., a program; followed by yacc/bison's generating the code for implementing a context free grammar.

      <p>
        <strong>A</strong> I don't think so, since <a href="CodeGeneration.html">CodeGeneration</a> can create huge duplicate snippets of code, whereas <a href="GenericProgramming.html">GenericProgramming</a>
        and <a href="TemplateMetaprogramming.html">TemplateMetaprogramming</a> won't. -- <a href="AlexBetis.html">AlexBetis</a>

        Disagree, they are in fact widely considered examples of code generation. As justification for why, they take general code and produce more specific code. I don't think it's relevant whether they produce <strong>duplicate</strong> code snippets, but actually that's not entirely true either. They usually can, and do, especially since you used the word "snippets". They do not produce duplicate copies of entire <strong>functions</strong>. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        The <a href="ClarionLanguage.html">ClarionLanguage</a> RAD tool (www.softvelocity.com) is an excellent example of code generation. Based on a data dictionary (database definition) and a set of highly configurable templates (browse, forms, reports, process) it can generate a fully functional desktop or web database driven application WithoutWritingaSingleLineOfCode. --SergioCastillo

        I am hoping the 80/20 rule applies to code generation, but I'd be happy with even 60/40.  I work for a consulting company.  As such, we're constantly writing new applications.  They are all data driven.  They all have different database schemas unique to their solution, but the code to access the database is always the same grunt work again and again.  We chose the code generation route.  It seems we need more senior programmers writing templates then we need junior programmers performing CutAndPasteProgramming for all the grunt work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we can achieve good, working, usable code for 80% of the project, that leaves us with the bulk of the time to focus on the unique (and generally more interesting) 20%.

        Generated code should never be edited by hand.  Either class extensions or decorators should be used to augment or change behavior of the generated code.  These pieces, written by hand, are outside of the package structure of the generated code.  This allows the code to be generated again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider all the code required just for simple database persistence in a web app:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            UI - html/jsp/asp/php
        </li>
        <li>
            Server-Side Controller - to handle the form in #1
        </li>
        <li>
            Model object (say, User.java or Order.cs or Message.php)
        </li>
        <li>
            Data access object interface - UserDAO is an interface defining save/update/delete.  We should always write to the interface.
        </li>
        <li>
            Standard implementation of UserDAO - persists data to and from the database on every request
        </li>
        <li>
            StandardUserDAODecorator - Wraps the standard implementation of User DAO.  Allows ease of customization of the generated code without having to actually modify the generated code directly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generate unit tests for each DAO implementation.  It'd be nice to know if the generated code worked.
        </li>
        <li>
            Optionally generate the ServiceLayerPattern from Fowler's <a href="PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture.html">PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture</a>.  I rather like this pattern, actually, as it's a natural fit for the business rules, rather than the application logic.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generate unit tests for the service layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Optionally generate decorators for the service layer.  You don't want to hand edit generated code, but the default business rule may well be insufficient for your application.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generate factories for all classes you plan on decorating.  This factory reads from a config file.  You choose your decorator by editing the file.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, a "simple" web application will have many classes just to be able to save a message to a forum.
      </p>

        All of this can be created from one xml metadata file.  I suppose the real question, though, is what would be simpler?
