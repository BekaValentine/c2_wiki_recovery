        Fragile Relationships
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="CompanyEmployeeRelationships.html">CompanyEmployeeRelationships</a> is becoming one of the many <a href="FragileRelationships.html">FragileRelationships</a> in this 21st Century.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, all human relationships are getting more fragile, including FamilyRelationships.

        Is this an irreversible trend? Where are we heading with this trendline?

        I liken the situation to molecules in a boiling pot. The more energy each molecule has the harder it is to cohere, and the mixture becomes volatile. Technology, mobility, fluctuating economies, evolving knowledge, and fickle tastes are the increasing "energy" that seems to propel us in all directions, both personally and professionally. Maybe we are heading for a phase change from "boiling water" to some kind of "gas" :-)

        ok I get depressed reading this. Any thing positive we can do about it?

        <li>
           Buy Final Fantasy XI - "etc...etc...'Community' ". Now who gets to be the hulking beast and who the cute couple?

           Plan ahead to make time to work on your interactions and don't let Them take that time away. Once a week, have a night that you know is yours and own it.  Once a month, do something special.  Once a year throw a party on the same date.
        </li>
      </ul>

        I don't think, that we will reach the gas state. The evaporation heat is too large for humans to bear. I think we will see HistoryRepeating, in this case either revolution or civil disobedience or a slow return of values (but only after a peak).
