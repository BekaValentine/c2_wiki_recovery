        I haven't read the book, but... These tools aren't just for XPers. The title is a little misleading. Ant, specifically, is general purpose, and has no features that are necessary to XP. JUnit, and Cactus, maybe, but unit testing should be a part of every programmers toolbox, whether they're doing XP, or not.

        I think that the XP in the title, is there for cache.

        <em>I haven't read it either, but I think the idea is more: So you want to do XP? Here are some tools that you can use. Not: Here are some tools that were made for XP.</em>

        I was the TechnicalEditor for this book.  The book really addresses two main tenets of XP, <a href="AutomatedTesting.html">AutomatedTesting</a>, and <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>.  Obviously, the <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> and related chapters related to <a href="AutomatedTesting.html">AutomatedTesting</a>.  The <a href="ApacheAnt.html">ApacheAnt</a> coverage is there to support <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>.

        I haven't yet been able to read the final product, and I didn't get to review the <a href="HttpUnit.html">HttpUnit</a> chapters, though I wanted to.  If you have any thoughts or questions, I'd be happy to respond.
