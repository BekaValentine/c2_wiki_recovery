        I started to get interested in XP in 2000 when I was working at a <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> firm. After having seen some other firms with a more agile process I became a technical manager at PTS.
        In my current position at TASS I have the opportunity to stimulate and coach Scrum/XP training and projects.
