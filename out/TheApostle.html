        While we are on the subject, how about this thought-provoking film, starring Robert Duvall in the title role?

        Excellent movie. Excellent script and performance by Robert Duvall. The passionate story of a Southern Road Preacher doing wrong and trying to find redemption. I bought the DVD. Highly recommended.

        I like dramas and I have a higher tolerance for slow-moving movies than most people I know, but I felt like sleeping through that movie. It wasn't that it moved too slowly, I just didn't find the story compelling.
