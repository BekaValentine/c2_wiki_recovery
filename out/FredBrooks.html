        Frederick Phillips Brooks, Jr., author of The <a href="MythicalManMonth.html">MythicalManMonth</a>, <a href="NoSilverBullet.html">NoSilverBullet</a>, and the recipient of the 1999
        ACM <a href="TuringAward.html">TuringAward</a>, for "landmark contributions to <a href="ComputerArchitecture.html">ComputerArchitecture</a>, <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>s, and <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a>". Professor Emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

        His biography/resume is at <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/FPB_BIO.CV.04.2007.pdf">http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/FPB_BIO.CV.04.2007.pdf</a> . <a href="HeInventedTheTerm.html">HeInventedTheTerm</a> "<a href="ComputerArchitecture.html">ComputerArchitecture</a>". His time at <a href="InternationalBusinessMachines.html">InternationalBusinessMachines</a> seems to have been the basis of his most famous work: he invented modern hardware interrupt systems while working on the <a href="IbmStretch.html">IbmStretch</a>, he led the whole <a href="IbmSystemThreeSixty.html">IbmSystemThreeSixty</a> project, and <a href="MythicalManMonth.html">MythicalManMonth</a> is based mostly on his experience of leading the software development for the 360.

        Interestingly, he describes his current research interests as <a href="HumanComputerInteraction.html">HumanComputerInteraction</a>, virtual worlds and 3D interactive computer graphics - not the areas in which his work is widely famous.

        He has a new book (2010) not yet found (2014) in any of my nearby libraries (<a href="SanDiego.html">SanDiego</a>):
