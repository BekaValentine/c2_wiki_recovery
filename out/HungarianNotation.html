        Hungarian Notation
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> discussion below is primarily an argument. A good summary of Hungarian Notation and Systems vs Apps Hungarian can be found on <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation#Systems_vs._Apps_Hungarian">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation#Systems_vs._Apps_Hungarian</a> Further reading on the topic can be found in the original paper, as mentioned below: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvs600/html/hunganotat.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvs600/html/hunganotat.asp</a> -TomBrend

        A variable naming convention developed by <a href="CharlesSimonyi.html">CharlesSimonyi</a> at Microsoft. The word "Hungarian" is used to describe either Simonyi's original nationality or the appearance of the variables, or both (I forget) (<em>he is Hungarian, for what it's worth</em>). In Hungarian, the types of variables are encoded into the name. For example, m_pszName would be a (m_) member variable of a class, that is a (p) pointer to an (sz) null-terminated string. Hungarian was originally developed to support C programming by providing visual cues to compensate for C's lax type checking. However, it has been used in other languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hungarian notation inspires some of the most bitter religious wars among programmers. Detractors claim that it is indecipherable and that no real standards exist for its usage. Adherents claim that it becomes more likeable with use, and the instant mnemonic recognition of type that one gains with familiarity aids program comprehension immensely. -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

        <em>I would normally edit the above to correct the factual errors, but I am reluctant to hack about with anything written by Michael. However, I have to make the note that the characterization given is quite simply wrong, and is based on a very common misreading of Simonyi's original article.

           Michael says "m_pszName would be a (m_) member variable of a class, that is a (p) pointer ..."
          <ul>
            <li>
               The "m_" practice is extremely widespread in industry, whether Simonyi/MS suggest it or not, it is not only an example of de facto Hungarian notation, it actually is sometimes argued to be a good example of the right thing to do, and that follows Simonyi's original principles, because there's no question but that it helps avoid certain common scoping mistakes. (The counter-argument is that whether something is a member or not could be considered an implementation detail, but the overall answer is not 100% clear.)

           A careful reading with the benefit of doubt shows that the original article did not advocate using this to show the actual types.

        [You do mention "ignorance and prejudice", but Michael's description is completely free of such; he's not even taking any stand of his own, he merely mentioned that there are religious wars between adherents and detractors. To read something negative into this is so grossly unfair to Michael that it staggers the imagination.]

      <ul>
        <li>
           My comments about arguing from prejudice and ignorance were not aimed at Michael, but at the expected readership. I do now realize that it can be misread and I apologize for any offence inadvertently caused. I have modified what I wrote in the light of this realization, but Michael is describing the common misconception, not the actual system Simonyi originally proposed.

        [The two URLs you provide are informative, and should remain on this page, but the support for your position is thin. For one thing, the question of how <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a> "should" be used, and how historically it was originally defined, is different from the question of how it <strong>is</strong> widely used, and the latter is what forms the pragmatic de facto definition.]

      </ul>
      <p>
        [Worse yet, although Simonyi begins in some sane ways, talking about <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a> types being a superset of simple machine representation types, and nodding towards OO language types, and implicitly distinguishing structural types from named types, the microsoft article then goes on to provide official standard examples that violate that sanity, such as "pch" for a variable that is a "pointer to character". This is self-contradictory. It violates the arguments Simonyi made for the whole system. "Pointer to character" is as concrete as a type can get, there's nothing abstract about it.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [One can make an argument supporting the notion that something like "secondRowParameter" is a better name than "i", but your apologia, and criticism of Michael, completely falls apart in the face of that "pch" example, which typifies what detractors dislike about <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a>, yet is explicitly part of it - and is the aspect that seems to be most widely implemented.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [I think Michael's description should remain intact, but that it would be appropriate to add a note explaining the sane part of Simonyi's original suggestion, and that Microsoft itself corrupted it into something lacking sanity. Joel's example is a nice one, I think: "us" as a prefix on unsafe strings and "s" for safe strings. Aside from religious wars over whether it would be better as "unsafe" and "safe", that's a perfectly legitimate convention to help keep the code straight.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [It's also worth mentioning that a certain percentage of this stuff is fixable by creating assignment-incompatible objects to avoid errors. Even in C, one can do this by, for example, wrapping an int inside a struct. Joel's example could be struct { char *s; } Safe; and struct { char *s; } Unsafe; - and one then gets compiler assistance in catching errors.]

      <p>
        Doug, everything you say here is true. It's frustrating when people present the common, modern understanding of "Hungarian notation" and then tear it apart - as it should be. They then never look at the original paper, never try to find something useful, and never learn the lessons that are there. It's true that "rows" and "columns" can be wrapped and then the compiler catches the errors. Some programmers do. Do you?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Yes, and ditto, I train people to do this, whether they work for me or not (the latter is of course more difficult, since one must persuade rather than insist). In C++, it turns out to be an interesting rare good use of the preprocessor: I created a terse macro for completely painlessly creating such wrapper classes (templates didn't seem to cut it for this), and that convenience eliminated all resistance. Everyone loves the type safety that this sort of thing affords, when it is sufficiently convenient that they're never tempted to shortcut it.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's extremely cynical of you to ask that question of me. :-) You were pretty sure the answer was "no".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The original paper is its own worst enemy, and the terminology and examples led directly to the misunderstanding, but there is a really good idea here that's been lost, trashed, spat upon and generally had scorn heaped upon it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So perhaps here is the lesson:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Abandon all hope of ever being understood, all ye who have a good idea but don't say it perfectly.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        -- Seeker of truth, finding of things that help, frustrated that people seem only ever to find why things don't work, rather than trying to find why it's a good idea and should be made to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I sympathize, but consider that you started out frustrated with all these people viewing <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a> purely in terms of its misshapen dark side form, so you were further frustrated by Michael pointing to that, which lead to a certain tone in your post, to which I responded with a certain tone of my own, leading to more frustration on your part. These things snowball. Frustration leads to more frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think you are correct in all this, including the suggested lesson (from which I myself have often suffered), so presumably the above can be refactored whenever someone gets the energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would add an emphasis here: I think that <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a> done correctly is not a substitute for object wrappers, but again, too many people implicitly or even explicitly think they are. <a href="MeaningfulName.html">MeaningfulName</a>s are a documentation aid, and as such, do not substitute for automated safety aids, such as static type safety, when the latter are possible. This is something that troubles me about the most common kinds of reflection (the ones based purely on matching names as strings) as well. It's great, it's cool, but it's a house of cards when relied upon too heavily, because too often there is no safety net. -- Doug

        For what it's worth, I - as a Hungarian - can tell you, that Hungarian as a language does not read or sound (at all) like Hungarian notation. Except for the "szar" prefix (zero terminated character array, IIRC), which has a meaning in Hungarian. Homework is to find out what. When you do, you will know that no Hungarian tends to use it. -- WhiteWolf

        Hungarian notation is far older than Simonyi's tenure at Microsoft. He had definitely developed it by the time he was at Xerox, and I'd bet it was before I started working at Xerox in 1984. -- <a href="ChrisHibbert.html">ChrisHibbert</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first I heard of "Hungarian" was in Charles's Ph.D. thesis <em>Meta-Programming: A Software Production Method</em> (1976), which is available online at <a href="http://www.parc.com/about/history/pub-historical.html#CSL.">http://www.parc.com/about/history/pub-historical.html#CSL.</a> -- PaulMcJones
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I have to add that "Hungarian" is a human language from the Ural-Altaic/Finno-Ugric family of languages being used for probably 2000 years now. And it's agglutinative, so while Simonyi was indeed Hungarian, Hungarian Notation is also a bit like the human language. Agglutinative means that word's "types" are indicated by appending various phonemes at the end of words.</em>
        <em>Example:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        English:	Hungarian:<br/>
        money		penz<br/>
        my money	penzem<br/>
        to eat	  enni<br/>
        he's eating	eszik<br/>
        house		haz<br/>

        Here is the URL for a document which fairly completely describes Hungarian notation and its benefits: <a href="http://www.songtrellis.com/testSite/docstore/DescriptionofHungarianNotationanditsbenefits.doc">http://www.songtrellis.com/testSite/docstore/DescriptionofHungarianNotationanditsbenefits.doc</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        To summarize, the Hungarian notation for data instances makes use of three notions.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) UNIQUE TAGS ARE DEFINED FOR TYPE DEFINITIONS AND INSTANCE VARIABLES
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A large software project might use thousands of different data types. Some of the type declarations 
        for these data types would assign a restrictive meaning to a primitive data type supplied by a programming 
        language. Many others would supply type names to record or object declarations used within the software project. 
        Creating a new Hungarian tag for each allows a software developer to easily identify what a data instance describes by examining its name without referring to the instance declaration. The notation has greatest utility when it is used in the coding of very large software systems (Microsoft Word, Excel, Access).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are primitive types corresponding to the data types defined by a particular programming language. Petzold, the source from which many have formed their impressions of HN, described these primitive types in his "Inside Windows" volumes without pointing out the utility of derived types that restrict the usage of the primitive types or that are used to name record structures or object types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the objections below concern the folly of limiting a naming scheme to a restrictive primitive type vocabulary. It is folly. Large programming projects that use Hungarian Notation do not much utilize the primitive type names except when very generic kinds of code are being written (low level heap managers, string handlers, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
        When a data type is not primitive, a more restrictive tag is almost always employed to label a data item and the actual primitive implementation of the type is not mentioned in the Hungarian tag. 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) PREFIXES ARE USED TO LABEL COMPOSITIONS OF DATA TYPES
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The data types defined in a software project can be composed and transformed in a number of interesting ways. Hungarian Notation defines a number of standard prefixes to make clear when a data instance is intended to be used in such a composition operation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the standard prefixes that can be applied to data type tages are:
      </p>
      <code>
        p for a pointer. A pfoo would be a pointer to data item of type FOO<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        pp for a pointer to a pointer.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        h for a heap handle. This is a pointer to a pointer that points at a data item recorded within a heap.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        rg for an unstructured array containing data items of a certain data type. An rgfoo would be an array that <br/>
        contains data of type foo. Individual elements would be selected by an ifoo index variable.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        mp for an array which is used to map from one data type to another. <br/>
        Eg. A mpdochdod would be indexed via a doc index. The expression mpdochdod[doc] would produce a handle to a <br/>
        document descriptor. <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        dn for an array whose elements that describes a meaningful index such as an opcode. If the meaningful index<br/>
        were an OP type, a data structure of type EOP (entries for OP) would be defined, and a dnop array would be <br/>
        defined which describes what each individual op means<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) SUFFIX MODIFIERS ARE USED TO DISAMBIGUATE INSTANCE VARIABLES AND EXPRESS INVARIANTS
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        When more than one instance of a data type is declared in a programming name space, a unique suffix is affixed to 
        the item to disambiguate it from all of the other instances in use within a function or procedure. This suffix can be a hint to describe the usage of the data item. 
      </p>
      <p>
        More interestingly, when a data item is an instance of a pointer or array index, a standard suffix modifier can be affixed to a Hungarian, which expresses the invariants that must be maintained when that data item is used. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the standard suffixes which express invariants are:
      </p>
      <code>
        Max - added to an index data instance which records the actual size of an array or data block. <br/>
        eg. the declaration of a an array of type FOO in C would be:<br/>
        FOO rgfoo[ifooMax];<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Mac - added to an index data instance to indicate the limit of an actual usage within an array. Mac stands for <br/>
        current maximum. It is invariant that ifooMac <= ifooMax. ifooMac == ifooMax is the condition which is true<br/>
        when all entries within an array are in use. <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        First - added to an index or pointer which designates the first element within a range that may be validly<br/>
        processed<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Last - added to an index or pointer which designates that last entry within a range that may be validly <br/>
        processed.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Lim  - stands for limit. An ifooLim is equal to ifooLast + 1 and designates the location where a new foo item<br/>
        could be recorded in an array or data block.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There is a Hungarian standard for naming functions and procedures. In many cases, these names quote the data tags used as parameters and the type of the return value if one is generated. This is explained in the document referenced above.
      </p>
      <p>
        The discussion below shows little cognizance of the usage of Hungarian Notation to notate composition of data types
        and to express invariants that must be maintained as a data item is used in a program. I have found these features of the notation to have very high utility. -- <a href="DavidLuebbert.html">DavidLuebbert</a>

      <p>
        I like hungarian notation in C because C forces me to declare variables at the start of blocks - so by the time they're used, their type may have scrolled off the screen. The other thing about C is that being non-OO it tends to encourage larger functions; I'd say that the typical C function is 20-100 lines long where the typical C++ one is maybe 5-20. Long functions also make it likely that the type has gone some place that requires some scanning.
      </p>
      <p>
        In C++, I think it's a lot less use; apart from the two issues above, in C++ you're usually dealing either with an accessor function, and most of these are actually named after the type. For example, if I have a class Foo with a member of type Bar then I'll usually call the member myBar and have an accessor called bar(). So if I have an object of class Foo called foo, it's obvious what the type of foo.bar() is.
      </p>
      <p>
        And C++ used with STL generates more types than you could ever shake a stick at - hungarian notation for one of these would be longer than the variable name itself. If you've ever looked at the mangled names of variables that compiler generates to stick in object files you'll see some hungarian notation that'll drill your eyes out of their sockets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contrast this with Perl, where the type is determined by the use. Sort of mandatory hungarian ... well maybe not ... -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        The claim that "C encourages long functions" is more controversial than the claim "many C programmers write long functions"! Older versions of C didn't do much strong type checking, so encoding types in names could help avoid mistakes which today's compilers would catch. The Windows header was an example - Microsoft had scores of "handle" types all of which were integers. (They have improved things since.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If we stipulate that Hungarian never replicate information the compiler checks, then it can be useful today. For example, many people encode scope in names: using capitals for globals (like class names), "my" as a prefix for instance variable and lowercase with no prefix for stack variables. The cost is low because only a few things need distinguishing. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        I feel obligated to put in my <a href="DevelopmentTools.html">DevelopmentTools</a> case here (again): <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a> seems to be used to embed type information about a certain variable everywhere in the code where it is used. But, my standard human factors rant about this kind of practice applies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It obfuscates code from being "read" like text, and thrusts this property of the variable forward even if you didn't care about it as the reader
        </li>
        <li>
           Refactoring the type of that variable becomes an O(number of uses) operation that wastes the developer's time

           It is a human-maintained convention that can be erroneous, thereby misleading code readers even more than they might have been if it wasn't there. So, should you check every notational assertion with its declaration anyway? If so, then what is the point of this notation?

        My problem with Hungarian Notation is more fundamental and stylistic - I think it encourages sloppy, sprawling, poorly decomposed code and careless, ill-coordinated maintenance. Simply put, if your namespace is so polluted that you need a cheap trick like HN to keep track of your variables, you've made a terrible mistake somewhere. You should never have so many variables and constants visible at one time; if you do, then you need to review either your data structures, or your functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is especially true for code written under either the OO or FP methodologies, as a primary goal in each is to isolate (in OO) or eliminate (in FP) those variables that are not immediately needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        HN notation also presents a problem in the case of OO, in that it interacts very poorly with polymorphism. It is actually undesirable to know the class of an object in many instances, but at the same time marking it with the parent class tag is misleading and contradicts the goal of HN. As for marking globals as separate from locals, why on earth do you have any globals in the first place? ;-) -- <a href="JayOsako.html">JayOsako</a>

The point isn't so much that you have to limit the number of variables, but rather that large proliferations of variables in the local namespace is a sign of a design mistake. Why would they all be visible at once? Aren't there some abstractions they can bound into? Why do you need this particular bit of state visible here, anyway?

        <strong>A possible rationale for using it ...</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In strongly-typed languages, variables have a constant type for the duration of their life that is known at compile time. This ensures a low number of typesafety issues as most are caught during compile time, the <strong>second cheapest</strong> time to detect them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's hard to determine the type of a variable when you are coding. Problems like whether or not a string is a plain ASCIIZ char *, or a fully wrapped string object are hard to resolve from use. However, semantically, they are somewhat different.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important in C when utilizing printf() as the difference between %ld and %d could be the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>cheapest</strong> time to detect type bugs is when writing the code. Also, it helps code review and summary reading of the code as one doesn't have to go back and forth between the declaration (typically in a separate file) and the use.
      </p>

        It is suggested on other parts of this page that C encourages long blocks of code with variables declared at the top. I read in other parts of Wiki about <a href="SwitchStatementsSmell.html">SwitchStatementsSmell</a>. Suppose your toolbox includes Windows 2.0, a C compiler, and a text editor with no color highlighting. The way we were encouraged to program user controls in this environment was to write a WindowProc with the responsibility of processing all the messages of interest. Each message has an associated integer constant defined. The preferred way to build such a method is to build a big switch statement with a case for each message of interest. An interesting control will have non-trivial code for many messages. The probability that you write expressions using such variables that is textually far removed from the declaration is high. You've got to do something to help understand what you meant when you declared the variable in the first place.

        Now, if your product enjoys an unprecedented success in the marketplace and becomes the overwhelmingly predominant platform in the world, that code winds up being ubiquitous.

        That doesn't resonate with my experience. I've been stumbling through Hungarian for years now and I still read code written with it noticeably slower and with less comprehension than code written without. New code is much harder for me to write because I have to look up a wart anytime I use a type that is unusual for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that I may use type information differently than people who use Hungarian notation. Most of my type-sensitive code deals explicitly with translating from one type to another. The rest of my code either uses the right type for it's <em>[its]</em> context or calls a translator very early on. The code I'm working with right now uses several representations of the same thing: BSTRs, ASCII strings, WinNT Unicode strings, and JNI Unicode strings for strings; and pointers and jobjects for object references. So I have the problem. We use Hungarian here and what I've noticed is that it doesn't help - I still have to write and call the translation code - it's just that now I have to remember how to mangle the names after I've done the real work and I have to remember to mangle them differently whenever I change my mind. Other people on my team write the translation code inline. I can see how they would have a difficult time keeping the type information straight while writing code that does several type translations on top of the job it was originally intended to do. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>

        When I first used Fortran, its 'Hungarian' approach to declaring variable type was very appealing.  Now, I favor prefixes that show conceptual type, not implementation type. As an example, an application team might standardize on 'sec' for seconds, 'hr' for hour, and 'ft' for feet, though they are all implemented as, say, doubles. Thus when you write ftsecTravelSpeed = ftDistanceTraveled/hrElapseTime you are likely to see the mistake. This is especially helpful when working in a strongly typed language that does not allow operator overloading, and the application has many dimensions and units with calculations between them.

This allows inserting stuff - resource allocation/deallocation or locking/unlocking or debugging printf's - at the top and bottom of the function without having to look for returns all over the place. Oh yeah - I got this idea from Eiffel, as well as using assertions at the beginning and end of functions (not demonstrated here).

        Hm. It is in general easier for individuals to understand things than to get the correct version enshrined in corporate (or governmental, &c.) policy.

It's not especially rare for organizations to do things that 80% of their members would (or do) disapprove of.

        <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a> is one of those religious arguments with no grey zone in the middle. In my 15 years of Microsoft development, I have seen more fights over this than anything else. It used to be more important in the earlier days. I still swear by it (as opposed at it!) because I can be pages down in a function and look at a variable and know its type instantly without going all the way to the top and checking.

        Many moons ago in a different life I worked for Nantucket on Clipper (an <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> derivative). Back then, I wrote an article called <em>HUNG - Hungarian without the Arian</em> (pun intended) which was a scaled down version of Hungarian for Dbase languages. This was an extremely generalized notation that I still use today - though less and less, mostly just for primitive types. All numbers, regardless of 16 or 32 bit, signed or unsigned start with the mnemonic "n" (nNames), an array starts with "a" (aNames), all strings start with "s" (sName), all pointers start with a "p" (pnName, psName), and so on. Exceedingly simple and purposefully non-precise. Non-POD (<a href="PlainOldData.html">PlainOldData</a>) class instances don't normally use any mnemonic. The idea is that I don't [<em>...?</em>]

        I avoided HN for such a long time, because of various reasons stated above. I have recently changed my stance, based on findings that provide counterpoints to the strongest arguments against HN. Putting my counterpoints in text is also a way for me to think out the problem space :)

        If a type changes, you have O(N) 'wasted' time to fix all references. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you are constantly changing types, you are not designing your software. If you're not designing your software, you can't expect it to last. If you don't expect it to last, you don't need to worry about conventions. (You will usually be wrong in this respect, though, since software has a tendency to take on a life of its own.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Changing types underneath a large N number of dependent lines of codes introduces a high probability of tricky bugs. Overflow errors, sign shift errors ('>>' IA-32 SAR is not your friend), general serialization, comparison. Basically, the compiler forces you to check these type of things out. If you don't, you're just lazy, which may be okay for you... (can't vouch for your customers if any though).
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>This is highly language-dependent. It is worst in languages where implicit conversions (that change the abstract value) and static overloading are common. In languages with </em><a href="ImplicitTyping.html">ImplicitTyping</a> and/or ArbitraryPrecisionArithmetic and no implicit conversions, changing types is almost a non-issue: if you make a mistake, the code either fails to compile or fails immediately in <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing; it doesn't introduce silent, tricky bugs.<em></em>

        The HN warts are nasty ugly things that detract from the readability.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Camel-casing the actual name of the variable allows you to visually filter out the 'noise' of the type ids. When you need to get more detailed information about the code, you can examine the type ids.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Subjective. Most people find HN still to detract from readability regardless of the case of the name.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Correct usage of the warts allows you and others unfamiliar with your code to understand the intent of your types. You have to use a standard convention for types and understand the flexibility of the system. Simply using dwType, wType, lType, iType does not correctly convey the depth of tagging conventions that are available.
          <ul>
            <li>

        <strong>What about the strongest argument against Systems HN (it violates </strong><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>)?<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you use the brain-dead, understandingless idea of encoding the machine type in the name, then it does, and you shouldn't do that. If you use the originally intended but poorly explained idea of encoding the intent, or "additional type" information, then it doesn't. If you use a language that actually has proper, user-defined, machine-checked types, then it's of no value. If you use C, then it is of value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Avoiding HN is philosophically impossible</strong>. If we go by the definition that "types are classifications", then almost everything is potentially a classification. For example, "leftFrameBorderWidth" has four classifications in it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Left-ness (member of all things that belong to "left")
        </li>
        <li>
           Frame-ness (member of all things that belong to "frame")
        </li>
        <li>
           Border-ness (member of all things that relate to or belong to "borders")
        </li>
        <li>
           Width (Member of all widths)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A strict interpretation of HN would leave us with a zero-lengthed named, which is obviously ridiculous. In practice its usually about not duplicating the *languages* or app's types. But generally what becomes a formal or declared type is somewhat arbitrary or situational. 
      </p>
      <p>
        --top
      </p>
      <p>
        I think you hit the relevant point at the end there, but didn't emphasize it nearly enough.  Avoiding HN is <strong>only</strong> about not duplicating types already described in the language environment.  After all, duplicating the type violates <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>: the classification is represented in both the name and the declaration (or context, for <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a>).  Avoiding HN means that if you change the formally recognized type, you don't need to also change the name.  Of course, given a good <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a>, doing so would be a non-issue.

        <strong>Practical - Only When Helpful</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In general I see cases where they seem helpful and cases where they just create unnecessary verbosity. For example, "amount" is almost clearly a number. One does not need to repeat the fact that it's a number. But at this point I cannot state any clear rules on when to use it. It takes experience and guessing what the reader might be thinking when they see it.

        I once got into an <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> over the term <strong>"book" appended to wiki titles</strong> because I kept mistaking them for "real" titles instead of book titles.

This set off the no-HN purists. I lost the <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> and would like to thunk the purists on the head for what to me was a very practical concern.
