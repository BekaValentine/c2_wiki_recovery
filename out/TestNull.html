        Invoke a method with a null parameter.
        If the method is not meant to be invoked with a null parameter, is
        the effect of doing so documented?
        Does the invocation actually have that effect?

        <em>Interesting point: - invoke the method with a null parameter where the method does not expect to have a null parameter, you getâ€¦ guess what?, a </em><a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a>. Which is the reason why <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> exist?

        There are many ways of getting a null value when you don't want one and don't
        expect one, so there's a reasonable chance that sooner or later your code will
        be invoked with a bad parameter.
        When this happens, it's important for your code to pass the blame onto the
        calling code by acting sensibly :-).

        Isn't this better handled by assertions?

        ... assuming of course that you have a means for implementing assertions,
        and that you always leave them enabled. --

        No, it's better handled by exceptions. Just code as if null references couldn't happen. Most environments will throw an exception for you if you try to use a null reference, so all you have to do is handle null reference exceptions (or exceptions in general) properly and you ought to be fine. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>

        Sun assert guideline says don't use assert to check parameters. <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html#usage">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html#usage</a> -- Jtf

        Keep in mind, a null pointer is not a truly bad pointer. Suppose an object's constructor assigns some global variable to this then throws an exception. I have worse schemes in my head if you want them.
