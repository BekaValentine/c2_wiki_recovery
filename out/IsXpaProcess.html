        I was stunned by a statement by <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> at the <a href="XpTwoThousandAndOne.html">XpTwoThousandAndOne</a> that he doesn't see XP as a process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I ask myself: "what is it then, after all?"
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a state of mind
        </li>
        <li>
           an attitude
        </li>
        <li>
           a "methodology" (whatever that is)
        </li>
        <li>
           a problem solving strategy
        </li>
        <li>
           a set of values/principles/practices
        </li>
        <li>
           a social contract
        </li>
        <li>
           ...?
        </li>

        For me, my understanding changed over time. I was first focussed on the practices. Later on the practices became only means to set the values in place. The longer I do XP, the more I like to see it as an attitude. --<a href="DierkKoenig.html">DierkKoenig</a>

        To compare with <a href="ShuHaRi.html">ShuHaRi</a>, XP is a process on the Shu level, but maybe more of an attitude on the Ri level...
