        Code Monkey

      <p>
        Modern computing environments automate support for <a href="CloneAndModifyProgramming.html">CloneAndModifyProgramming</a>. You may use your editor's <a href="CopyAndPaste.html">CopyAndPaste</a> mechanism to copy functions and perform small changes to each one.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you need even more fluff in your <a href="CodeBase.html">CodeBase</a>, mere automation of CAMP might not be enough. You need the manual skills of a <a href="CodeMonkey.html">CodeMonkey</a>, to chronically reproduce the same project, over and over again, top-down, with minor variations each time.

        Characteristics:
      </p>

        <li>

           Don't expect to think out of the box
        </li>
        <li>
           Only cares about doing "cool" development
        </li>
        <li>
           Business need is secondary to the need to experiment and learn
        </li>
        <li>
           Good Code formatting
        </li>
        <li>
           Chooses to implement hard to maintain algorithms
        </li>
        <li>
           Very Poor estimator of time to complete

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Draw backs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Doesn't care that much about the produced functionality
        </li>
        <li>
           Maintainability of the finished product is difficult
        </li>
        <li>
           Code is usually not ready for production when output
        </li>
        <li>
           Knows how to run the <a href="ClassWizard.html">ClassWizard</a>, then add the same feature, a little different each time, to each class the wizard creates
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        How to Utilize:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Heads down code factory situations
        </li>
        <li>
           Must enforce stringent Regression test methodology (Unit and system)
        </li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
        Another dev's opinion: the need to experiment and learn, caring about new technologies and choosing to implement algorithms don't seem to me like the characteristics of a code monkey. Most code monkeys I've met only know one language(Java usually) and are opposed to learning more, they say that algorithms and math are useless in the "real world" and they have no idea what the "cool stuff" even is, wishing to use it is unthinkable.

        I've heard the phrase <a href="CodeMonkey.html">CodeMonkey</a> (and various derivatives) used with a different meaning.  Rather than an insult for a programmer who is sloppy (which the above implies), I hear it used for someone who is doomed to work on "unglamorous" programming tasks, often using older/antiquated/"uncool" technology.  Examples of work that a <a href="CodeMonkey.html">CodeMonkey</a> might do in this definition (I do not intend to denigrate these tasks myself):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Coding/implementing forms, other UI for some enterprise/web app; typically implementing a specification designed by someone else.
        </li>
        <li>
           Numerous other "job-shop" tasks in the IT department.  ("Oh, Joe?  The VP wants this particular query automated...")
        </li>
        <li>
           Anything involving COBOL
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s.  (In places where <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are the responsibility of a separate QA staff, it's often looked down upon as "grunt work")
        </li>
        <li>
           In the embedded systems world, diagnostics.  
        </li>
        <li>
           "Minor" features in an integrated product.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While the <a href="CodeMonkey.html">CodeMonkey</a> in this definition is not necessarily <em>sloppy</em>, he is (or is perceived to be) a programmer of junior-skill; and given the above tasks in the theory that they are less important (or less likely to cause major problems if done incorrectly).  Elite programmers, OTOH, like to work on such things as architectures, frameworks, kernels, libraries, toolkits--the sort of stuff that the <a href="CodeMonkey.html">CodeMonkey</a>s depend on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that neither definition is a compliment.

        My understanding of the phrase is as the above...although I now appreciate that the following mention of <em></em><a href="CommodityProgrammers.html">CommodityProgrammers</a><em> is perhaps a slightly less insulting term ;-)</em>
        I also particularly object to the inclusion of <em>hackers</em> in the initial definition...to be a hacker (geek also!) is something to be most proud of. Give me a hacker to employ <em>any</em> day, rather than bland cookie-cutter CS grad MCSE-hopefuls ;-)

        I've gained new appreciation for the phrase <a href="CodeMonkey.html">CodeMonkey</a>, but I must admit, I originally pictured the old philosophical pondering: If an infinite number of monkeys on an infinite number of type-writers randomly tap the keys, would they eventually produce <em>Hamlet</em>? (I'm sure there's a link to this somewhere on Wiki.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I pictured an infinite number of <a href="CommodityProgrammers.html">CommodityProgrammers</a> tapping randomly at their keyboards. Would they eventually be able to produce <insert your favourite program>?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, <strong>I</strong> thought it was funny...
