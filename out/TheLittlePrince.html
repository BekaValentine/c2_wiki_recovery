        Or "Le Petit Prince" if you prefer the French original. Go for the version with illustrations by the author.

        There is also a very nice "multimedia" adaptation, with 3D graphics (!) made from the author's illustrations (in French). <a href="http://www.gallimard.fr/multimedia/html/PP.html">http://www.gallimard.fr/multimedia/html/PP.html</a>

        Saint Ex is one of my favorite writers. Although I never read him in French (only in English and in Polish). I first read <a href="TheLittlePrince.html">TheLittlePrince</a> when I was just a kid.

        The other book by him that I really like and go back to every now and then is <a href="WindSandAndStars.html">WindSandAndStars</a>.

        Did you know that he wrote "The Little Prince" while he was living in New York during WWII.

        His philosophical tale Le Petit Prince is a masterpiece. It contains drawing from the author. It was brought on stage in Belgium by one of our best actors, casting a different Little Prince every night (for more than a year).

        His book, "The Little Prince", contains a pearl of wisdom:
      </p>
      <code>
        "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly;<br/>
        what is essential is invisible to the eye."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Think about what it means not only about life in general, but about programming (e.g. debugging) in particular.
