        Rediscovering Old Pages
      </h1>
      <p>
        Spam here on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> acts as a sort of <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a>, except that it demands attention from those who care. It brings to our attention pages that might otherwise be forgotten and cycles them up into <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, where more people get to see them.

        Ah, there is <strong><em>something</em></strong> good about the amount of spam we're seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, I was thinking something along the same lines. The only sad thing is that it destroys the last genuine modification date. There's something very nice about finding a page that hasn't been modified in two, three or maybe even five years.</em>

        Agreed - the same is true of pages having categories put on them.

        I think of any process that touches old pages as "turning the compost".

        This only really makes a difference to <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>s. There are many other ways for <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s to dig beneath the tip of the <a href="WikiIceberg.html">WikiIceberg</a>, such as <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a>, <a href="WantedPages.html">WantedPages</a>, and <a href="ReallyValuablePages.html">ReallyValuablePages</a>. They also look at random searches and <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s.
