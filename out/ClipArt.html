        <a href="ClipArt.html">ClipArt</a> is a collection of images that can be used as decorations or illustrations in documents or software. Generally, use of clip art does not require any payments to or permission from the copyright holder, except possibly for an initial payment to buy the collection.

        For example, all those little pictures in your company or neighborhood newsletters are clip art.
