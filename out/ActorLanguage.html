        Actor (R) is a Win16 programming language developed by The Whitewater Group (R) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Actor uses a combination of the Pascal and C syntax with the Smalltalk class library. Actor is very object-oriented, everything in Actor is an object. All classes in Actor descend from one root class, Object. Actor is interpreted and uses a garbage collector at runtime.
