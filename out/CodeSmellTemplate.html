        Code Smell Template
      </h1>
      <p>
        I just copied this from the <a href="AntiPatternTemplate.html">AntiPatternTemplate</a>. If something should be added or reworded, go ahead and do it. In particular, some of the slot descriptions could use amplification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every slot should contain accurate information and descriptions, <strong>except</strong> those explicitly marked "supposed". This should cut down on some of the confusion people have with <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s and which parts are good or bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discussion about this template should probably go on CodeSmellTemplateDiscussion, just so it's easier for users to cut and paste the template itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the template has evolved to a stable state, it might make sense to go back and restructure existing <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> using it.

           Judging by the <a href="SetTheBozoBit.html">SetTheBozoBit</a> page, where almost all of the contributors cheered on the <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> as if it were a <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a>, I think this is by far the most important section, and therefore perhaps needs to be expanded.

           The exterior link to this antipattern did not at <strong>all</strong> help emphasize that it was an antipattern rather than a pattern; such things need very clear emphasis.
