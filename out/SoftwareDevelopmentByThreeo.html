        Software Development By Threeo
      </h1>
      <ol>

          o Group has developed 3oProgramming. An initiative to help <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> developers to manage their projects. More information can be found on <a href="http://www.3o.nl">http://www.3o.nl</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          oProgramming is based on eXtremeProgramming but has some differences. E.g. 3oProgramming does not deal with customers, simply because they do not exist in most <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> projects.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Instead of a customer there's a community which containes mostly software developers responsible for joining in projects as a developer or as a tester. The people within the community are situated worldwide, as with the developers joining a project. This geograhical distance can influence the progress of the project over time in a negative way.. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at this scenario 3o Group tried to come up with a non commercial development method where the priority lies at implementing standards for designing, coding and planning.
