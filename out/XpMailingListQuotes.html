        How good the design is doesn't matter near as much as whether the design is
        getting better or worse. If it is getting better, day by day, I can live
        with it forever. If it is getting worse, I will die. --<a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        When I suddenly understood how each of the practices of XP have weaknesses

        We tried pair designing but the process doesn't know 
        how to track it so its discouraged, (incidentally it did work well). We 
        tried for an oral or very small written coding standard for our group, but 
        instead got a massive company wide document. We've tried to move our group 
        into a large room with tables, but its too weird, and besides we've already 
        got all of these nifty cubicles....

        The consultants from the avionics firm are particularly unreceptive to XP. 
        They want hard data; they think anything else is bs. They argue that if 
        they based decisions on gut feelings that planes would fall from the sky, 
        rockets would spin out of control, and they would lose business. Personally 
        I think they don't like XP because it could cause them to lose some 
        consulting business.  --Christopher J. Helck

        Arrrggghhh! We're in the middle of a crunch time. (We used big design up front,.
        Took six months to design and we now have three weeks to implement the entire
        project. Things are not going well.) Can I contact you again in a few weeks
        when things sort themselves out? I'm really interested in seeing pair
        programming in action. --GeoffreyClements

        The "Run" button is addictive. I sometimes press it two or three times in a

        For instance: if your program has a requirement that it update and retrieve
        specified information from multiple applications at specified intervals, a
        metphor for that section of the system could look like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        The system "mailman" then begins his route.  He stops at each "house",
        picking up the outgoing mail that is sitting in the mailbox (as long as the
        flag is up), and delivering any mail from his mailbag that was supposed to
        go to that address.

        What I'd not quite naively EXPECT is that maybe pairing while finding the 
        bug wouldn't go faster, but that pairing while fixing it would both go 
        faster and get better results. If you get any subjective data on this, 
        please let us know.

        I hope you've got THAT in writing, preferably blood. In all the places I've 
        visited, even when they said this, they were then really angry about bugs 
        once the crap came out. I hope you'll update us on how this aspect plays 
        out after your initial release.

        This has been a discussion in XP from the beginning: can you write a program text so that someone can pick it up and build the needed internal representation efficiently, or do we need additional artifacts (design documents) to assist that process?"
