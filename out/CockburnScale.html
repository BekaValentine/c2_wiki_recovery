        Cockburn Scale
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Cockburn Scale is a method for classifying how much ProcessCeremony a project requires based on its criticality and size.  
      </p>
      <p>
        "Criticality" is defined by the sentence "A defect could cause loss of ":
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Life (L)
        </li>
        <li>
           Essential money (E)
        </li>
        <li>
           Discretionary money (D)
        </li>
        <li>
           Comfort (C)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        "Size" is defined as the size of the development staff:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1-6 (6)
        </li>
        <li>
           7-20 (20)
        </li>
        <li>
           21-40 (40)
        </li>
        <li>
           41-100 (100)
        </li>
        <li>
           (extends arbitrarily)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So a two-person, life-critical project is given the rating L6, and a ten-person project that could potentially cause tangible monetary loss but not enough to jeopardize the organization is a D20.

        The scale was presented in <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>'s book <a href="AgileSoftwareDevelopment.html">AgileSoftwareDevelopment</a>.

        Can we have some concrete examples of the differences between E and D?  From a business case point of view, <em>all</em> money is essential money.  Depending on some of our customers, the project I am working on now could be classified as either E100 or D100.  Perhaps I'm misinterpreting something? --SamuelFalvo

        <em>The difference is strictly in scale.  If the magnitude of the loss is likely to cause the business to stop functioning, it's "essential".  Otherwise, it's discretionary.  A concrete example: if I run a small business that grosses $1M a year, and the failure would cause a 20% drop in revenue, that hurts a heck of a lot.  On the other hand, if the failure precipitates a $120M liability lawsuit, that's fatal.</em>
