        The message that was in this space imploded upon itself.

        Analysis is still underway; however, <br/>
        we believe that the immense mass of <br/>
        the additional conventions added to<br/>
        Wiki caused a singularity, into which<br/>
        all meaning and discourse were drawn.<br/>

        Perhaps if more <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> linked here they would collapse as well, I fear however that disparate views generate a different StressTensor leading to a WikiNova rather than a singularity

        Oh, wow. Lots of nice art. Content? Well, we have the rest of Wiki for that.

        C'mon, foks. WikiDeadWeight ain't all that bad yet. I find influences on my work here all the time. However, I don't come here for philosophy. Otherwise that black hole pictured above would capture me as sure as a photon straying too close.

        Eventually, Wiki will consist of a single page which is delightful, humorous, inspiring, and contains <em>exactly</em> what you need to know to finish today's programming project early. This is the first form of the wiki singularity: the page horizon. There will be no need to refer to any other page or to add any other topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, the page will collapse to a single sentence containing an aphorism so pithy, witty, wise, and relevant that no more will need to be said about the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally the page will disappear, because Ward will have such a pleasant and fuzzy glow from pondering that aphorism that distractions such as paying the Wiki bill will have faded from his consciousness.

        Sorry to burst your bubble, but, shortly after this happens, the Wiki will grow exponentially to a ridiculously large size and then collapse under its own weight. Probably from people trying to analyse this "magic" statement to death. -- <a href="AluoNowu.html">AluoNowu</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        More likely, it will suffer 'heat death', as more and more pages are created and edited by a constant number of people (interesting, that <a href="WikiFire.html">WikiFire</a>s would seem to prevent this).
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather I think it will grow exponentially in size, yet its mass will remain the same while it's volume increases.  This will continue to the point where its density effectively becomes zero, at which time the lack of anything meaningful to say about it will create a situation where more is being deleted than added.  It will then shrink until it reaches the point where it again spurs comments and analysis, and will oscillate between these two states for eternity.  This is called  WikiBounce. -- <a href="UnknownDonor.html">UnknownDonor</a>

        If you dig too deep in the Wiki, you will get into the <a href="WikiSingularity.html">WikiSingularity</a> where you cannot escape again. This is even better than being a <a href="WikiAddict.html">WikiAddict</a>. <em>Many are still going down that path.</em>
