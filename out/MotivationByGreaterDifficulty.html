        Motivation By Greater Difficulty
      </h1>
      <p>
        A common tactic found on athletic teams (and in the military) is <em>motivation by greater difficulty</em>.  If a team or squad fails at some exercise (has a poor practice, etc.); the sargeant/coach/person-in-charge rewards them for their efforts (or lack thereof) by <em>making their task difficult next time</em>.  A sports team which loafs in practice often finds itself running windsprints or "stadiums" the next day, for a good long time--<em>followed</em> by the regular practice.  The windsprints are often conducted to the point of physical exhaustion; far in excess of what would normally be necessary to adequately condition the athletes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A classic example of this in US sporting lore is the brutal training camp that Paul "Bear" Bryant ran at Junction, TX when he was head football coach at Texas A&M University.

        In other words, negative reinforcement (punishment) is the primary motivation for this activity; not increased productivity (in the athletic context, increased level of conditioning).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the military context; this probably doesn't do much long-term harm; as this sort of technique is primarily used on troops in basic training; it's uncommon to subject frontline troops to this sort of activity.  Likewise in sports; most coaches are smart enough not to "run 'em 'til they puke" on game day.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>However</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This tactic occasionally finds its way into corporations, where the drill sargeant is replaced by the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a>; and rather than a squad full of raw recruits being fashioned into soldiers; this tactic is employed on seasoned professionals who <strong>are</strong> (effectively) on the front line.  Failure to meet some deliverable is often met with new rules which make the workplace <em>less</em> pleasant and/or productive; requiring even <em>greater</em> effort from the workers to make up lost time than would be needed if well enough were left alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Removal of priveleges for the duration of a project (such as the ability to manage one's own time--<a href="MandatoryOvertime.html">MandatoryOvertime</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Mandatory status meetings, the purpose of which is often to browbeat the employees for their (alledged) underperformance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Often times, punishment isn't the primary intent (even if it is an ulterior motive)--it is believed that by placing additional burdens on the employees, it will "focus" them and increase their productivity.  It is highly questionable whether this actually works.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In many cases, it causes burnout and other problems.
