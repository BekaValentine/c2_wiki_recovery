        Database Is Representer Of Bs
      </h1>
      <p>
        In contrast to <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>, a database (DB) is a representer of complete b.s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Businesses deal with lots of random b.s. every day.  
      </p>
      <code>
        b.s. in<br/>
        b.s. out<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A database contains a lot of b.s. that may or may not be true.
      </p>
      <p>
        A DB is a fuzzy b.s. storage device.  NULL is the perfect representation of b.s., so the database must have a NULL or it isn't a good database. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A DB must not be restrictive or have constraints because b.s. is very fuzzy and doesn't fit particular categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        A DB should allow unlimited value logic instead of two value logic. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It does. Just create an extra column for confidence. And then you can represent facts that include BS about your confidence.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One option is to offer an opinion rating byte type column (on a scale of 0 to 255, please rate how confident are you that this row is complete b.s.). However the byte type makes it too restrictive, likely it should just be a blob or a string type so that you could put personal mumbling and commentary in the cell describing your hatred or love for the particular row in question.
