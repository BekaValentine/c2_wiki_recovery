        Konrad Zuse
      </h1>
      <p>
        (1910-1995) German computer pioneer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1938 Konrad developed his Z-1 computer in his parent's living room, a mechanical computer, using binary arithmetic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Z-2 was later made with the help of HelmutSchreyer.
      </p>
      <p>
        His most famous work was the relay-calculator Z3 (which contained a fully functional floating point unit using around 600 relays) and the language <a href="PlanKalkuel.html">PlanKalkuel</a>. Because of wartime conditions he operated independently of developments in the U.S. and Britain. His influence after the war was limited, but he supposedly influenced HeinzRutishauser who in turn influenced the development of Algol 60.
      </p>
      <p>
        His computer company was absorbed into Siemens Corp.
