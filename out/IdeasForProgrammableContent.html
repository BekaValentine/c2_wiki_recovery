        Ideas For Programmable Content

      <p>
        I'm thinking about <a href="ProgrammingInWiki.html">ProgrammingInWiki</a>, which would use a Wiki as a shared development environment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The ideal use for a <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a> in such a wiki would be to let programmers set up <a href="BoilerPlate.html">BoilerPlate</a> / skeletons / wizards which could be used for code generation by other members of the team. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Have you seen </em><a href="HyperPerl.html">HyperPerl</a>/<a href="WikiInHyperPerl.html">WikiInHyperPerl</a> and <a href="ReflectiveWiki.html">ReflectiveWiki</a>?<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, but these are about programmingWiki, not programming using Wiki. The key words used by the originator seem to be "SharedDevelopmentEnvironment" which is an exceptionally good idea whose implementation deserves consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Missed that bit, yes.  I'm suddenly thinking </em><a href="WriteInLisp.html">WriteInLisp</a>, because it seems appropriate (from the very little I've learned about it so far).  Not very wiki though.<em> </em>
      </p>

        I don't have a lot of first-hand experience with it (yet), but wouldn't <a href="RebolLanguage.html">RebolLanguage</a> be useful in a ProgrammedWiki environment?  It allows the delivery of directly executable content.  The only requirement for participants would be to install the REBOL environment on their local box (versions for just about *.OS) ... I've toyed with the idea myself, but I'm not far enough along with <a href="RebolLanguage.html">RebolLanguage</a> for that exercise.

        The scripts are very compact, and much can be done in little space.
