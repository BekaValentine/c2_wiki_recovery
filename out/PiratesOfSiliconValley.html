        Pirates Of Silicon Valley
      </h1>
      <p>
        A movie about the rise of <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a> mostly, counterpointed with the rise of <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> as a contrast. Funny, sad and inspiring.

        Did anyone see the movie <em>Pirates of Silicon Valley</em> Sunday evening?
        I really enjoyed it. I have to admit, Bill is interesting. Will COM persist or will the blue meanies tear it down so we can all start over again?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>While the portrayal of </em><a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a> seemed pretty fair, the <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a> bits were mostly whitewash. Bill as clueless roller-geek failing to pick up women ... um, yeah.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Could Bill have, by any chance, owned the parent of the parent of the production company that did POSV?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You have to remember POSV was based on </em>FireInTheValley which was partially written by <a href="MichaelSwaine.html">MichaelSwaine</a>, an avid Apple booster. He despises <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a> and has a love-hate thing for <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a>. Notice how <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> was just portrayed as comical until they interacted with Apple. Apple had much more depth. Anyway, I laughed so hard at <a href="SteveBallmer.html">SteveBallmer</a> and <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a>' slouch. This movie is too funny. Go rent it.<em></em>
      </p>

        I went to rent it from a mainstream movie rental joint while working on a programming contract in Silicon Valley, the heart of the incidences portrayed. Strangely, they didn't carry it. (This was before eMovies were practical.) I wonder if "Bugsy" is missing in Vegas also.
      </p>
      <p>
        I eventually saw it, and the "broke into rich neighbor's house" argument scene between Jobs and Gates near the end is a classic. Clever ending also. The "IBM virgin" scene is right up there also.

        Do you think the woman at the Xerox lab [<a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a>?] was supposed to be <a href="AdeleGoldberg.html">AdeleGoldberg</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That was my take at least -- my wife thought I had blown a gasket when I started pointing at the screen and laughing hysterically when we saw the movie.</em>
