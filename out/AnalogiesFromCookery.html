        Analogies From Cookery

        Apart from the tech-mainstream uses of "recipe" and "cookbook" as technical terms, there's also:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Taste <a href="EarlyAndOften.html">EarlyAndOften</a> (if producing a product with many components, such as a French apricot tart, engage in UnitTasting)
        </li>
        <li>
           ThreeStarRestaurants has the same connotations to me, negative as well as positive, as <a href="ThreeStarProgrammer.html">ThreeStarProgrammer</a>s
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Yeah, but what about 4 or 5 star restaurants?</em> 
            </li>
            <li>

          </ul>

           ElizabethDavid's FrenchProvincialCooking could be glossed as CookTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork (and a reaction to BigCuisineUpFront)

        Cooking also displays the ultimate in <a href="PlanToThrowOneAway.html">PlanToThrowOneAway</a> and <a href="EvolutionaryDelivery.html">EvolutionaryDelivery</a>, but to a large degree deprecates reuse.

        Depends where you draw the analogy. A recipe is reusable - indeed, recipes evolve and fork like software projects, and exhibit their own <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>. And if you refactor your fridge mercilessly (on the principle of YouArentGonnaEatIt) you can end up with a collection of, uh, stock components which can be used both to solve new instances of familiar problems, and as usefully high-level abstractions for the experimentation process that leads to solving new problems.

        Many people of my generation learned to program by typing in listings from magazines - not unlike how many people learn to cook. Today magazines have the programs on CD-ROM. Make one person follow a recipe; take another to a restaurant. Both subsist; only one learns how to cook. -- <a href="PeterHartley.html">PeterHartley</a>

        A friend in the catering industry told me that really is a people business, because almost <em>anyone</em> in the supply chain can mess up your product, so you have to make everyone understand what's important. -- <a href="SteveFreeman.html">SteveFreeman</a>
