        <a href="TheMozillaProject.html">TheMozillaProject</a> (Mozilla dot org) is an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> programming effort set up by Netscape Communications to coordinate work on NetscapeCommunicator 5, which was released under the NetscapePublicLicense on March 31st, 1998. This codebase was rejected and a new suite, codenamed "Seamonkey" was written. In order to develop Seamonkey, the project invented <a href="MozillaXul.html">MozillaXul</a> and <a href="XpCom.html">XpCom</a> (as well as creating the Netscape Portable Runtime Library and many other things). The Seamonkey suite is now being retired in favour of the separate <a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a> (formerly Firebird) and <a href="MozillaThunderbird.html">MozillaThunderbird</a> browser/news components, each running on a shared instance of the GeckoRuntimeEnvironment shared library.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the process of all this, new ground was broken in development tools and methodologies, giving rise to <a href="BugZilla.html">BugZilla</a>, a public bug-tracking database; <a href="MozillaTinderbox.html">MozillaTinderbox</a>, a system for monitoring build quality across multiple platforms; and Bonsai, a web interface to a CVS repository. These tools, most notably <a href="BugZilla.html">BugZilla</a>, are now used by other projects, notably <a href="RedHat.html">RedHat</a> and <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a>.
