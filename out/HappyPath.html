        Happy Path
      </h1>
      <p>
        The positive path thru a program. The customer logs in, puts an item in their shopping cart, passes their credit card, and buys the item. No typo is committed, no exception is thrown, and no cloud shall blot out the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of a <a href="CodingStandard.html">CodingStandard</a>, functions and blocks on the happy path should appear first, preferably in chronological order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some crews generally code the <a href="HappyPath.html">HappyPath</a> first. Given a simple method with only happy-path lines, <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> makes layering in the <a href="SadPath.html">SadPath</a>s and error handlers easy. The method should then refactor to <a href="IlluminateTheMainline.html">IlluminateTheMainline</a> and preserve the happiness of the original method.

        <strong>Discussion:</strong>

      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Is this pattern in conflict with use if <a href="GuardClause.html">GuardClause</a>s?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> In the presence of <a href="GuardClause.html">GuardClause</a>s, the <a href="HappyPath.html">HappyPath</a> would be the flow-control path that is not blocked. (Being trapped by guards is usually the beginning of a very long <a href="SadPath.html">SadPath</a>...).  Coding the <a href="HappyPath.html">HappyPath</a> first does not conflict with later integration of <a href="GuardClause.html">GuardClause</a>s.
