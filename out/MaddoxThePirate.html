        Maddox the Pirate is the pseudonym for George Ouzounian, a native of Utah who achieved Internet fame through humorously inflammatory diatribes on his website, The Best Page in the Universe (<a href="http://maddox.xmission.com">http://maddox.xmission.com</a> or <a href="http://thebestpageintheuniverse.net),">http://thebestpageintheuniverse.net),</a> on issues from the hypocrisy of pop culture to crappy children's artwork, beginning in 1997. He holds a degree in Mathematics from the University of Utah and formerly worked as a programmer for a telemarketing company, though selling merchandise and sales of his recent book, The Alphabet of Manliness, now sustain him financially.
