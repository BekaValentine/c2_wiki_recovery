        It's nice to have your trash cans emptied for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's also nice not to have last afternoon's CrcSession put into a nice stack of cards, or to have your byzantine pile of highly organized chaos reshuffled. (Or to find out your water bottle has been used to feed the plants...)
      </p>

        <em>Or to find out that the postman put a parcel in the dustbin on the day it was emptied...</em>
