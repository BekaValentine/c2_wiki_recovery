        Maybe in 50 years time -- who knows, maybe sooner, maybe later -- there will be intelligent computer programs reading Wiki. But there aren't any yet. <em>How do you know?</em> When there's some discernible prospect of them existing, it might make sense to take them into account. 
        <em>Why not think about it before such a critical event manifests itself (what needn't be necessarily the case)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But why do so <em>now</em>? <em>Because a hopefully generous time interval for anticipation might be helpful for the </em><a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We haven't the slightest clue what they'll be like. <em>Yes. Therefore we should start to think about as soon as possible.</em> About the only thing we <em>can</em> be sure of is that any entity, human or computer or alien life-form, capable of reading and understanding the content of Wiki won't need primitive mechanical aids.

        I don't advocate writing for humans because I think humans are the most important things in the universe. I advocate writing for humans because <em>at the moment and for the foreseeable future</em> humans are the only entities reading Wiki. There may also be computer programs doing some very mechanical processing on Wiki, but I don't see how complicated <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a>s will help <em>them</em>. I don't believe in optimising our writing for readers that don't exist yet and whose preferences are completely unknown. -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>

        This reinforces the concept <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> <em>yet</em> so therefore, <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> <strong>until</strong> we <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s who are the current form of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s find our peers. -- <a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a>
