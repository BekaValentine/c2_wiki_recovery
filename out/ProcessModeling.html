        <a href="ProcessModeling.html">ProcessModeling</a> is probably better known to computing professionals as activities related to constructing <a href="DataFlowDiagram.html">DataFlowDiagram</a>s through the use of once popular <a href="CaseTool.html">CaseTool</a>s (now eclipsed by the use of <a href="UnwantedModelingLanguage.html">UnwantedModelingLanguage</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the use of <a href="ProcessModeling.html">ProcessModeling</a> probably started with the humble <a href="FlowChart.html">FlowChart</a> that predates the arrival of <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ProcessModeling.html">ProcessModeling</a> was elevated to a new level with the <a href="BusinessProcessReengineering.html">BusinessProcessReengineering</a> craze of the early 1990s, where the favorite technique is based on IDEF. IDEF has no sequencing of activities and is not directly linked to computerization, until <a href="SoaAndLooseCoupling.html">SoaAndLooseCoupling</a> became the <a href="NextBigThing.html">NextBigThing</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in the beginning of the twenty-first century the <a href="ProcessModeling.html">ProcessModeling</a> technique of choice is <a href="BusinessProcessModelingNotation.html">BusinessProcessModelingNotation</a> (BPMN). It will take time for the user community to recognize both the limits and limitations of BPMN, and have a realistic expectation of this business facility.

        There may be a resurgence in the use of <a href="FlowChart.html">FlowChart</a> as a <a href="ProcessModeling.html">ProcessModeling</a> tool as well. BenGraham, grandson of the <a href="FlowChart.html">FlowChart</a> inventor, has written a book called "Detail Process Charting" and has developed a <a href="CaseTool.html">CaseTool</a> as well. A comparison of this method with techniques such as IDEF can be found at <a href="http://processchart.com/comparison%20of%20business%20process%20flowcharting%20techniques.htm.">http://processchart.com/comparison%20of%20business%20process%20flowcharting%20techniques.htm.</a>

        In 2006, <a href="ProcessModeling.html">ProcessModeling</a> use of <a href="BusinessModeling.html">BusinessModeling</a> SWOT technique was linked up with a Russian <a href="SystemsThinking.html">SystemsThinking</a> method called TRIZ (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ).">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ).</a> The result is termed P-TRIZ by Howard Smith - former BPMI co-chair, of Third Wave <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a> fame. Howard's assertion is that SWOT by itself is problematic in its application; however, when teamed up with TRIZ, SWOT becomes a <a href="ChangeManagement.html">ChangeManagement</a> tool and caters for <a href="BusinessContinuity.html">BusinessContinuity</a> concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        P-TRIZ is a <a href="StrategicManagement.html">StrategicManagement</a> tool that is meant to address <a href="PortfolioManagement.html">PortfolioManagement</a> and <a href="RiskManagement.html">RiskManagement</a> concerns.
