        The <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> database is different enough from either Smalltalk or relational databases to require a different approach to projects using it.

        We are using <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> in three projects in Argentina. Two of them are used by an official organism devoted to the control of insurance companies; the third is a business information system used by a company in the alimentary market. We would like to share experiences with other <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>/S developers. Also, we think that a <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> mailing list would be useful and interesting to developers and system administrators. -- <a href="LeandroCaniglia.html">LeandroCaniglia</a> (22/02/1998)

        We're using <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> to build an intelligence gathering system for Customs & Excise Canada (spy stuff). We've got a somewhat limited (read: bad) deployment environment -- what amounts to a 2400 baud WAN, which has driven us to some interesting non-traditional implementation strategies. We're also storing source code in Envy using a home-grown interface (which I'm happy to share). Despite all of these hits, it's great fun: Learning about being a spy is more fun than learning about banking or insurance claims. <grin>  --<a href="AnthonyLander.html">AnthonyLander</a> (23/02/1998)

        We were (up to March '98) using Gemstone/S as part of a system for generating insurance products. We had invented a language for this and Gemstone was used to store, version and browse (for re-use) the parse-trees that were generated by fragments of the language. Our experience of Gemstone was pretty much that it was a great idea and definitely the way to go forward from the relational world in theory but probably still too immature in practice! 
      </p>
      <p>
        We also had to develop a framework to manage the server code in Envy (really this was an extension to the Gemstone Envy Toolkit) - what's the point of having Smalltalk on the server if you can't use the same tools and practices that encouraged you to choose it for the client? We did find that once we had all this under control, moving code execution to the server to improve performance became a (nearly) non-technical administrative process. Theory vindicated or try doing this with stored procedures!

        Mutual Travel uses <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>/S as our enterprise-wide object repository.  This repository serves to several internal intranet information systems.  In addition, it holds the information clients enter on our public website.  We find it to work very well with <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a>/<a href="VisualWave.html">VisualWave</a> server-based applications.  The first release of our software was almost 2 years ago.  We have been expanding the application suite regularly. --<a href="JosephBacanskas.html">JosephBacanskas</a> (12/08/1998)
