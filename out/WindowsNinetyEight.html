        Windows Ninety Eight
      </h1>
      <p>
        Windows 98 (pronounced as windows ninety eight) was the version of <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> that was released in 1998. It was the later version of <a href="WindowsNinetyFive.html">WindowsNinetyFive</a>. Compared to its predecessor Windows 98 was better in stability and user friendliness. The operating system was optimized for the Internet. In fact the integration of <a href="MicrosoftInternetExplorer.html">MicrosoftInternetExplorer</a> to the <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> in Windows 98 was a subject of anti-trust litigation and a Department of Justice investigation which is still continuing (see <a href="MicrosoftAntiTrust.html">MicrosoftAntiTrust</a>).

        I started a programming gig, and they gave me a Win98 box. I spent a week whamming on <a href="VisualCeePlusPlus.html">VisualCeePlusPlus</a>, and experiencing frequent lockups. Then at a meeting they asked me how I liked Win98. "I have found it's very stable if you only run one application at a time."

        I didn't figure everyone would laugh. As an old Unix and Amiga guy, I had no idea that this generation had been advertising Win95 as if it were "the first widely-used desktop that supports multitasking". Sigh. A couple weeks later <a href="WindowsNt.html">WindowsNt</a> went in. I took to calling that "Windows NUT".
