        Shotgun Surgery
      </h1>
      <p>
        Shotgun surgery means making a number of small changes to a number of different areas in the code, in order to effect a single, coherent change in behavior.  It's a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> that sometimes results from <a href="CloneAndModifyProgramming.html">CloneAndModifyProgramming</a>, and usually indicates a violation of the <a href="DontRepeatYourself.html">DontRepeatYourself</a> principle. It can also result from poor <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a>, which itself may be due to lack of language support for effectively abstracting certain <a href="CrossCuttingConcern.html">CrossCuttingConcern</a>s (a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> caused by a <a href="MissingFeatureSmell.html">MissingFeatureSmell</a> rather than any fault of the programmer).
      </p>
      <p>
        Shotgun surgery (one change in behavior implemented as many changes to code) is the complement of <a href="DivergentChange.html">DivergentChange</a> (many changes in behavior all requiring changes to the same unit of code). Either way you want to arrange things so that, ideally, there is a one-to-one link between common changes and classes.  When the changes are all over the place, they are hard to find, and it's easy to miss an important change.

      <p>
        In <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> code, you can use <a href="MoveMethod.html">MoveMethod</a> and <a href="MoveField.html">MoveField</a> refactorings to put all the changes into a single class. If no current class looks like a good candidate, create one. Often you can use <a href="InlineClass.html">InlineClass</a> to bring a whole bunch of behavior together. You get a small dose of divergent change, but you can easily deal with that.
