        Dynamic Closure
      </h1>
      <p>
        In a language with <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a>, a <a href="DynamicClosure.html">DynamicClosure</a> is a function which will be evaluated in the dynamic environment it was created in rather than the one it is called from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is an example of creating an adder in <a href="LispOnePointFive.html">LispOnePointFive</a>:
      </p>
      <code>
        define ((<br/>
        (make-adder   (lambda (x) (make-closure)))<br/>
        (make-closure (lambda () (function (lambda (y) (addx y)))))<br/>
        (addx         (lambda (z) (plus x z)))<br/>
        (do-test      (lambda () (prog (a)<br/>
        (setq a (make-adder 4))<br/>
        (print (a 2))<br/>
        (print (a 3))<br/>
        (setq a (make-adder 5))<br/>
        (print (a 2))<br/>
        (print (a 3)))))<br/>
        ))<br/>
        => (make-adder make-closure addx do-test)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        do-test ()<br/>
        6<br/>
        7<br/>
        7<br/>
        8<br/>
        => NIL<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In make-closure, the "function" special form binds the "(lambda (y) (addx y))" to the current <em>dynamic</em> environment, in which x is bound to the argument to make-adder.

        In the old literature this was called the FunargDevice.  Passing a function as an argument to another function (such as maplist) was known as a DownwardFunarg.  Returning a function as the value of another function was known as an UpwardFunarg or a FunctionalValue.  Nowadays, functions that take functions as arguments or return functions as values are normally known as <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s.  See <a href="ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-199.pdf">ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-199.pdf</a> for a discussion of how the "Funarg Problem" was dealt with in the days of dynamic scope.
