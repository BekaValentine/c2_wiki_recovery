        I'm a Developer, nowdays I'm working with java, but I have worked with
        <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and yes <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a> and <em>xbase</em> ( my god, I wrote this ! It's our secret okey ! )
        for more than 15 years. I read Sarson, Chen, Martin, Codd, Yourdow and finally Booch and like this guy very much.
        I liked very much of smalltalk too, however I couldn't apply it. A few times ago, I have deserted from my job and begin work with GreenHouses and Plants cultivation, but this is a longer history, maybe for next time. 
        And of course sorry, my english isn't perfect as you can see.
        But, I think that make software is a magical thing, as was when I was 13 years old and
        learned with a Sinclair machine <em>ZX80</em> and the very cool spectrum (sounds and colors wow!).
