        Some folk hark back to WikiBeforeXp with a tear in their eye and a lump of nostalgia in their throat. They even claim Wiki is no longer a community. Well, what is a community? If wiki ain't one, is that a good or a bad thing? If it ever was one, is there a way to make it a community again? What are the mechanics of community?

        This is a question for all occasions and situations. Community is something which is shared, where people listen to one another and do not impose themselves. Community is alive here as we listen and talk to oneanother. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
