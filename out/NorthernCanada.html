        Northern Canada
      </h1>
      <p>
        The three territories of Canada (Yukon, NorthwestTerritories and Nunavut) collectively known as <a href="NorthernCanada.html">NorthernCanada</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, anything further north than 100 miles from the southern Canada/US border.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the 100 mile rule, both Calgary and Edmonton, with about 1,000,000 population each are part of the "Great White North". <em>I've visited Calgary and lived in Edmonton, they are far from </em><a href="NorthernCanada.html">NorthernCanada</a>. Check the map. - What is this 100 mile rule you speak of? 100 miles from the magnetic north pole? 100 miles from the nearest Ice flow? 100 miles from from Uncle Zeke?<em></em>

        I think it is a real hoot to read such blatantly incorrect statements.  I often just shake my head in amazement when people make such absolute statements as are on this page.  It reminds me of Jay Leno and his Jaywalking feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The 100 mile rule probably derives from the fact that a very large percentage (>80) of the population lives within 100 miles of the U.S. border.</em>

        I love the humor of Bob and Doug McKenzie <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Underground/6756/takeoff.htm">http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Underground/6756/takeoff.htm</a> but they're not true Canadian representatives anymore than the stereotype of the Texas redneck is accurate.

        Thanks to our southern neigbors, we have too many Taco Bells, <a href="McDonalds.html">McDonalds</a> and Wal-Marts.  We have too much cable, too many department stores just like Macy's, plenty of warm days and divided highways.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't have bears, midnight sun or rats.  Yes, we have mosquitoes and gorgeous long summer days.  In June, the sun is up at 4:30 a.m and it doesn't set until 11:30 p.m.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are no bears or rats in Canada?  That's amazing; there are lots of them in the US.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nah we got lots: The arctic is teeming with those cuddly white bears and pet stores carry those cuddly white rats.
