        Software or hardware that compels the user to spend more time tweaking, configuring, adding-on, and generally serving the machine than they do actually using it.

        This includes:

      <ul>
        <li>
           a notorious proprietary operating system that requires regular yearly outlays of time and money. And the CPU manufacturer it rode in on.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="LinuxDistribution.html">LinuxDistribution</a>s that never work when installed but entail nights and weekends of searching, downloading, combining and tweaking packages.
        </li>
        <li>
           hardware manufacturers that advertise "plug and play" but don't have the drivers ready for your OS revision.

        Here's another: an editor (with its own wiki, even!) with version numbers past the teens that buries its (estimate) 1500 preferences, but includes a Rogerian psychotherapist to help you deal with the sheer overload of knobs to tweak. <em>Could you be referring to </em><a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a>?<em> [No, Emacs; the comment was literal in all respects, not satirical (aside from some hyperbole about intentions). Emacs is a much larger phenomenon than non-users could possibly imagine -- speaking as a vi user.]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not sure that this one qualifies, as </em><a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a> is actually <strong>useful</strong> out of the box, unlike the other examples above.<em></em>

        Speaking as an Emacs user, I have found Vim to be more useful straight out of the box...
