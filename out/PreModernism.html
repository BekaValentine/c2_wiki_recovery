        Pre Modernism

        What comes <strong>after</strong> Modern? <a href="PostModernism.html">PostModernism</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What comes <strong>before</strong> modern? Ahh, <a href="PreModernism.html">PreModernism</a> (the old days)!

        Modern day people are pro-science, skeptical, and fairly well educated. With the internet available we are becoming much more educated than we ever were. A post modern person should aim to be even more pro science than we are in modern times.

        Example: Anyone who rejects evolution and favors old bibles from 2000 years ago, is a Pre Modernist.  The bible is pre modern, outdated.

        Although Larry Wall claims to be a Post Modernist, I consider him to be a Pre Modernist since he's a Evangelical Christian.

        A pre modernist is an extreme conservative who still holds on to old fairy tail belief systems that have been proven wrong.

        In terms of programming, a Pre Modernist is one who rejects certain advances in modern technology, and favors the old way of doing things.. the pre modern way of doing things. For example, programmers who prefer managing memory instead of getting work done, are pre modern.  Sometimes being old and non-modern is the way to go though (being ultra conservative): for example some people still use assembly language when memory and CPU is very tight. One still has to be extremely conservative (with memory and CPU) in some cases. In those cases, being pre-modern is justified.

        Pre modernism is cray cray!
