        Off Wiki

      <p>
        This could mean a number of things, some good, some bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Good:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Whatever was being done, was being done "not" on Wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           The information was pulled <a href="OffWiki.html">OffWiki</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           An idea was bounced <a href="OffWiki.html">OffWiki</a> to see what others would have to say.
        </li>
        <li>
           Not regularly using Wiki of late.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>The Bad</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Now <a href="OffWiki.html">OffWiki</a>, like being "Off" Crack-Cocaine, in that it was an addiction that had to be broken like it was a very bad/unhealthy thing.
        </li>
        <li>
           Wiki was having a "bad" (off) day.
        </li>
        <li>
           A version of Wiki that is "Off" (crazy).
        </li>
        <li>
           The side of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> that is on the ShadySide.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Its one backlink is factual: not regularly using Wiki (with no particular overtones).</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Yes, that is where it came from, and will add to list above.
        </li>
      </ul>
