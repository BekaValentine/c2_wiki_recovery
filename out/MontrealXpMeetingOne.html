        This meeting was mostly about seeing who was interested in XP in Montreal and who would show up. The turn out was encouraging and we just did some basic "get-to-know-people" stuff like describing who we are, where we work and what we want to get out of XP. We were 9 around the table.

      <p>
        The meeting was unstructured (intentionally) and so we took a lot of time to cover fairly little ground (but we had fun isn't it?). Some of the things we came away with were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An interest in <a href="AgileMethodologies.html">AgileMethodologies</a> in general (in specific how they measure up to XP and whether or not they are viable alternatives). See <a href="AgileAlliance.html">AgileAlliance</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           A desire to have some topic or theme to future meetings.
        </li>
        <li>
           A proposal for somebody to write up a presentation or guide a discussion of a specific topic which would be posted here and discussed a bit prior to the meeting to make sure that it covers relevant issues.
        </li>
        <li>
           Some interesting ideas about <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> and the role of software aided development (specifically involving <a href="KeithPaton.html">KeithPaton</a><strong>'s Code Auditing software Code Check).</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           We agreed to communicate using the mailing list (see above) and this wiki for the time being - <a href="IainLowe.html">IainLowe</a> proposed that he start another wiki if we get to be too much for this one (or too off-topic).
        </li>
      </ul>
