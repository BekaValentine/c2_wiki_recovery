        Much cooler than the <a href="TeleTubbies.html">TeleTubbies</a> (which are now <em>passe</em>):

      <p>
        BBC pre-school education and fun.  Live action entertainment show.
        Four brightly coloured "children", two similarly semi-realistic 
        "adults" and a "dog" (or two in later episodes).  The action takes 
        place at a kind of pre-school playgroup, including singing and 
        dancing, craft activities, stories, play and occasional trips out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thoughtfully tries to address some of the social interaction issues
        which plague children at that age. Moral, but not sickeningly so.

        My three year old loves the tweenies, and has learned a lot.
