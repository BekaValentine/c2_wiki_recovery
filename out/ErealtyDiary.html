        <strong>24 Apr 02--Introducing story cards to the client</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Went to my client today after a series of emergencies, two of which gave me tasks to do.  We talked yesterday about the client right/responsibility to prioritize stories.  I had the two emergencies on cards, with another card, roughly:  Get buglist up-to-date and on cards, produce estimates.
      </p>
      <p>
        I walked up and waved the three cards at her.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I think I'm going to get another session on XP!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yep.  I've got your two emergencies, here, and another task I have from this morning, to get our bug list up-to-date and costed.  What do I do first?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "You can't do seven things at once?  C'mon, multitask!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I can do two, if I get to not think.  If I'm programming, there's nothing left but breathing and scratching my head.  Sometimes I forget breathing."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Okay, do this one, then finish the bug list, and I really will prioritize it tomorrow morning.  Then the other emergency."
      </p>
      <p>
        My thought bubble:  Wow, planning before panic.  This might work pretty well.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Excellent, I'll do it that way, thanks."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Before you go, I've got another thing--I noticed today, during training, that we could use an easier way to get the calendar back to today--Almost everything leads us back to needing today's schedule."
      </p>
      <p>
        I pulled a blank card from my pocket, carefully not smugging it up, and wrote that down.

        <strong>25 Apr 02--Adding unit tests to legacy ASP</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Good news, <a href="AspUnit.html">AspUnit</a> exists.  Bad news, it's not quite the same API as the general family of *Unit harnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm stubbing my toes on a couple of things:
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the only method of inclusion is a literal "put this file here at compile-time."  If my file includes A and B, and they each include C, the compiler goes batsqueak on me.  I'm not sure how to write my tests so I can run (multiple/all) test suites with one click.  This will become important to solve soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, one of ASP's primary features is a quick thunk (two characters) between code and immediate HTML output to the client's browser.  ASP doesn't, so far as I've found, have a way to view the buffer being built, even though it's buffered until page completion by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not a technological limitation, but a fact of my codebase is few subs/functions/methods.  Often a display-and-process form page will handle the two cases in the two branches of one file-long If-Else statement.  This leaves me with a wealth of code that isn't very unit testable.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I've found myself doing a couple of categories of refactorings, without tests.  More exactly, where my <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> software is EyeballUnit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Category one, granulate and defer output
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Extract chunk into new subroutine
        </li>
        <li>
           Refresh browser, look at output, hope I spot any breakage.
        </li>
        <li>
           Change thunks and equivalent 'Response.Write()' calls to appends to a local string var, which I Response.Write() just before leaving the sub.
        </li>
        <li>
           Refresh, eyeball...
        </li>
        <li>
           Change sub to function, return temp string var from function, change calling code to store or write return value as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Refresh, eyeball...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once I've done this, I have to try hard to resist refactoring in trickier ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Category two, relocate bits to be includable
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Create new file, #include it from main page
        </li>
        <li>
           Refresh, eyeball...
        </li>
        <li>
           Move functions to new file
        </li>
        <li>
           Refresh, eyeball...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once I'm there, I can start separating the the calculations and the DB usage out of the HTML wrapping code, and write some tests, including, I hope, one that will expose what I'm here to fix in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll need to write more DB support fns so I can setUp() DB stuff reliably, before those tests are going to be good to me...
      </p>
