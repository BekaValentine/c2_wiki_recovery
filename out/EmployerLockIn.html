        Employer Lock In
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many employees would like to <a href="JustLeave.html">JustLeave</a> their existing jobs, but there are many things that can keep people from leaving bad jobs:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Restrictions</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="OverlyBroadIntellectualPropertyAgreements.html">OverlyBroadIntellectualPropertyAgreements</a> or anti-competitive clauses in contracts
        </li>
        <li>
           Bad economy (that is, no alternative jobs available)
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of technologies (proprietary or obsolete) that leave one with an unmarketable skill set
        </li>
        <li>
           Requiring so much <a href="OverTime.html">OverTime</a> that there's no time for finding something better
        </li>
        <li>
           Immigration indenture
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Golden Handcuffs</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Stock options
        </li>
        <li>
           Deferred bonuses
        </li>
        <li>
           Health benefits
        </li>
        <li>
           Higher-than-average pay
        </li>
        <li>
           Position of authority or respect
        </li>
        <li>
           Personal relationships with co-workers
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The above make some people feel that they are "stuck" with a particular employer, no matter how bad the job is.  In the case of the "restrictions", this feeling may be valid, but people who keep themselves locked in <a href="GoldenHandcuffs.html">GoldenHandcuffs</a> have only themselves to blame.
