        Often, you can see more than one side to an issue. You'd like to factor all these sides so their relationship is tensegritous and harmonious. But you can't rely on your correspondents to help you do that, and the conversation looks like it'll get acrimonious.

        Represent all viewpoints as separate <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>(s). Give your feisty correspondents each a commensurable place to add their ideas. Establish low-temperature conflicts so the heated ones have no place to occur.

        Or you can separate the ideas to different pages. Instead of <a href="EmacsVsVi.html">EmacsVsVi</a> you could have <a href="EmacsRules.html">EmacsRules</a> and ViRules. Then when the opponents chime in in opposition for some rational reason, you can simply move the comment to the opposite page, where it would support rather than oppose the page proposition.
