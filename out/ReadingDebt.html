        Reading Debt

      <p>
        Your <a href="ReadingDebt.html">ReadingDebt</a> is the set of books that you have promised yourself that you will read someday but haven't purchased or opened yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be preferable to keep your <a href="ReadingDeficit.html">ReadingDeficit</a> low and your <a href="ReadingDebt.html">ReadingDebt</a> consequently higher. However, bibliophiles like myself can't help but accumulate extra books in the hope that one day they'll migrate to the <a href="ReadingDeficit.html">ReadingDeficit</a> and finally to the completed pile.

        I have this (anti) pattern!  My <a href="ReadingDebt.html">ReadingDebt</a> is pretty large. I tend to buy books that I know I will someday want to read. For instance, I bought a Raymond Chandler collection years ago because (a) it was rather cheap and (b) there were four complete novels in it. I hung onto it for a couple of years and eventually read them. 
      </p>

        I also find that I buy books, read the first few chapters and then decide to put it down and read it later.

        My bookcases are full, but I'm purging them this weekend. Probably a good idea to recycle unread books.

        At the risk of inventing a name for a problem that might not exist if you didn't name it(!), what might we call the set of [books] that you would add to your <a href="ReadingDebt.html">ReadingDebt</a> if you knew they existed?  Can we make distinctions between friends who add to one's <a href="ReadingDebt.html">ReadingDebt</a> by recommendation, and companies who try to add to ones <a href="ReadingDeficit.html">ReadingDeficit</a> by selling you a book even though <a href="YouArentGonnaReadIt.html">YouArentGonnaReadIt</a>? -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a>
