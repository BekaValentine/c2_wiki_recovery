        I am the principal hardware engineer of an electronic hardware/software/mechanical design firm, <a href="http://www.GoodmanAssociates.com/.">http://www.GoodmanAssociates.com/.</a> My experience is in medical and commercial instrumentation, though I have also designed several industrial control products. I live in Verona, WI, USA, which is a semi-rural area just a few miles from Madison, WI, a medium-sized city with a large University, many cultural amenities, and a very active high-tech community. In my spare time, I enjoy cycling and prairie restoration.

        Our firm designs a mixture of medical and commercial electronic products. The engineers all have 20-30 years of experience in our disciplines, so people tend to contact us to solve harder problems, or to solve simpler problems in more innovative ways. Because of our unique experiences and high level of mutual respect, it is natural for us to operate as a collaborative. Above all, we have a lot of systems experience to suggest approaches for particular problems, lots of fabrication experience to know what can be built and lots of product experience to know what to avoid.

        In short, we can do all or any part of the engineering for most electronic products and provide the client a complete set of manufacturing and test documentation. If desired, we can set them up with a contract manufacturer and work with the manufacturer to produce a finished product. For a lot of clients, we supplement their in-house engineering departments by filling in when resources get overcommitted and by doing design reviews to reduce technical risk.
