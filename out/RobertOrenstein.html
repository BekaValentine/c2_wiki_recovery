        I'm the Webmaster at Perforce Software. I presented a pattern language for HTML way way back at PLoP '95. I haven't posted here for a while, but I'm hoping to get some information (or start a discussion) about <a href="WikiReplacingMailingLists.html">WikiReplacingMailingLists</a>. -- <a href="RobertOrenstein.html">RobertOrenstein</a>

        <em>Has anyone at Perforce considered using wiki as a collaborative development tool? I was wondering just the other day how much work it would take to have something like </em><a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> use Perforce for version control. Difficult to say how useful this would be until you try it of course. -- <a href="ChrisSteinbach.html">ChrisSteinbach</a><em></em>

        We're just starting to play with wikis. So far, there are four of us using it, and we'll widen the audience shortly. The main obstacle is getting people to buy into it, and I don't think this'll happen until our wiki supports Email Notification. Supposedly, that's in the works... -- <a href="RobertOrenstein.html">RobertOrenstein</a>
