        Analogy Fest
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="AnalogyFest.html">AnalogyFest</a> is an event at the <a href="AgileDevelopmentConference.html">AgileDevelopmentConference</a>. It's a place for people to get together and talk about carefully worked through analogies between software development and something else. We don't care much about whether the analogies are <em>true</em> - we just want them to be useful in sparking ideas that people can try out on their projects. For more, see <a href="http://www.visibleworkings.com/analogyfest/.">http://www.visibleworkings.com/analogyfest/.</a>
