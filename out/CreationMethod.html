        Creation Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        I first heard about <a href="CreationMethod.html">CreationMethod</a> from <a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use <a href="CreationMethod.html">CreationMethod</a> when refactoring several constructors into meaningful creation methods. Example:
      </p>
      <code>
        public class Telephone{<br/>
        public Telephone(){...}<br/>
        public Telephone(String model){...}<br/>
        public Telephone(String model, double price){...}<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Constructors do not always clearly convey intention. When I have several constructors, I refactor them to <a href="CreationMethod.html">CreationMethod</a>s like
      </p>
      <code>
        public class Telephone{<br/>
        public Telephone(String model, doublePrice){..}<br/>
        public createDefaultTelephone(){ }<br/>
        public createTelephoneWithModelAs(String model){ }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        Presumably that should be "public Telephone createDefaultTelephone(){}" etc. And this kind of creational pattern leaves a bad taste in my mouth somehow - feels like it's just aliasing against the language's built-in syntax. Then again, "constructors" in <a href="ObjectOrientedLanguage.html">ObjectOrientedLanguage</a>s in general leave a bad taste in my mouth too. :) (I like the idea of object templates better than class templates, and that will be reflected in my design for <a href="DefnLanguage.html">DefnLanguage</a> assuming I ever get around to writing any of it up.) -- <a href="KarlKnechtel.html">KarlKnechtel</a>

        I would assume it should really look like this
      </p>
      <p>
        public class Telephone{
      </p>
      <code>
        public Telephone(String model, double price){..}<br/>
        public static Telephone createDefaultTelephone(){ }<br/>
        public static Telephone createTelephoneWithModel(String model){ }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        as you wouldn't want to have to have one instance of Telephone in order to create another Telephone.
      </p>
      <p>
        An essential fact that is a driver behind this pattern is that sometimes you want to have two constructors with the exact same signature, but with different intents.  For example
      </p>
      <p>
        public class Telephone{
      </p>
      <code>
        public Telephone(int modelNumber, int modelSubIndex) {}<br/>
        public Telephone(int modelNumber, int defaultAreaCode) {}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
        (yes this specific example is contrived, but I'm building on the original example)
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case you'd have to have some other way of indicating to the constructor what you want to do, which means passing in additional arguments, or having "-1" have special significance, etc.  Constructors are severely lacking in this manner.  However, the <a href="CreationMethod.html">CreationMethod</a> can basically overcome this shortcoming, and you just have to understand that these are essentially constructors.  (NOT <a href="FactoryMethod.html">FactoryMethod</a>s - that is related but different)
