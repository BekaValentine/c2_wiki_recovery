        While creating my own <a href="PrivateLanguageApplications.html">PrivateLanguageApplications</a>, it was realized that real-estate is available when using <a href="MultipleMonitors.html">MultipleMonitors</a> whereby WantedFeatures can be made available to the InsideApplication by utilizing features within an already existing application, providing the UtilizationModelMethodAndStructure for accomplishing the desired end within the application, while leaving the work of providing and displaying the features outside of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a new idea, just one not recently employed within programs written on my Computer, and displayed on the considerable Monitor Space I have available. It can be employed as a new approach to refactoring and upgrading old procedures, rewriting to borrow and employ processing and display resources from the outside.
