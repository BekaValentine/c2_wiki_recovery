        <em>"A middling book that contains some interesting ideas, but features a terrible deus ex machina at the end. Interesting for bringing up some issues about </em>OnlinePrivacy before they were part of mainstream awareness."<em></em>

        <em> This is a trilogy? Funny, it reads like three unrelated novels that just happen to be set in the same universe. Certainly, you don't need to read them in any particular order.</em>

        Author of one of the <a href="AsimovsFoundation.html">AsimovsFoundation</a> "sequels", but it was so bad I've expunged the title from my memory. Introduces dozens of new plot devices inconsistent with the rest of the books, and generally messes up so much it takes <a href="GregBear.html">GregBear</a> most of the last book in an heroic (and mostly successful) attempt to tie the loose ends together again. Awful.
