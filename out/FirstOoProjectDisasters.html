        First Oo Project Disasters
      </h1>
      <p>
        It seems like the first <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> project (particularly those using <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>) done by most companies turns out to be a disaster, leaving bad tastes in the mouths of managers and some programmers for years to come. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is too late to change history, but what can we do about removing that bad taste?
      </p>

      <p>
        Such disasters often are due to bad planning (and no or insufficient education/tutoring), and these people often cannot be enlightened, mostly because they don't care. -- <a href="JuergenHermann.html">JuergenHermann</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        (I agree with the first half of Juergen's sentence and disagree with the second half, but <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> has left an ongoing and growing bad taste in my mouth for 13 years, and I won't get very close to a C++ project even now.  For object projects using other languages, there are, however some cures. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not an <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> problem, but a <a href="RiskManagement.html">RiskManagement</a> problem and a <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> problem.  Many first-OO projects were done with too many new things, which is bad risk management.  Many first-OO projects were done with C++, a dangerous language which increases risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any project using a new <em>anything</em>, be it a language, <a href="ProblemDomain.html">ProblemDomain</a>, or platform, has increased risk.  If you are doing just one new thing, you can succeed, although you are almost certain to not meet a constraint (budget, time, quality).  The disasters comes from doing two new things at once ("Let's do our <em>new</em> product using C++").  These projects fail, or if they succeed, it's with everyone feeling like they failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ is such a dangerous machine that it counts as <em>two</em> unknowns unless you have an experienced machinist on the team.  The problems with learning C++ are not so much with OO itself, but with gritty realities such as <a href="MemoryManagement.html">MemoryManagement</a> in the presence of exceptions.  Objects are easy by comparison.  <em>The first time, I read 'machinist' as 'masochist'. That might help or might hurt.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Things may be improving now that programmers are trying some <a href="ObjectOrientedLanguage.html">ObjectOrientedLanguage</a>s which don't have C++'s exposed programmer-mangling gears.  Languages such as <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> and <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> only count as one unknown because they have guards on the machinery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you reduce one of the unknowns with C++ by not using exceptions?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think so.  You can chose not to throw exceptions, but libraries you call may throw them, and <em>operator new</em> throws an exception if it runs out of memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You know you can turn that behavior off, right?</em>
      </p>

        Here is a recipe for disaster:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Grab people with little or no experience in <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a>. Little means less than a month.
        </li>
        <li>
           Select <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> as the implementation language and give them 3 months.
        </li>
        <li>
           Wait exactly 3 months to get some feedback, realize that nothing works, give then 3 more moths.
        </li>
        <li>
           At month 6 get some feedback again. Lack of training? Here is some training. Wait 6 more moths.
        </li>
        <li>
           At month 12 declare C++ to be a disaster and get back to do <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Changing a fast disaster into a slow-motion disaster.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
