        Nobody Reads Every Page
      </h1>
      <p>
        Only really obsessive people with lots of (<em>maybe too much...</em>) time on their hands read every single new Wiki page. Most of us just scan the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> list for interesting page names or for the names of our favorite authors, and skip the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        When people find new pages that don't seem to fit in wiki, they are likely to delete them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Never assume that readers have read related pages or understand why you have written a particular page. If it's important to have contextual information or to state your assumptions, give the page a very meaningful name and add an appropriate introductory paragraph. Add links to related wiki pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't repeat the same introductory information on a set of related pages. On each such page, provide a link to a single page that explains what the purpose of the group of pages is. Also, while nobody reads every page, you can assume a general familiarity with the major wiki topics (software development, patterns, <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>).
