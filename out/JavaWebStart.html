        JWS helps to overcome the administration/installation problems which have prevented Java becoming popular on desktops. It also caches downloaded classes, and of course the API ... so will mvake downloading a much faster process.

        I have Java runtime 1.4.2.05, read news that I should upgrade to 1.4.2.06 in order to patch up serious bug discovered Nov04. I have since downloaded j2re-1_4_2_06-windows-i586-p-iftw.exe and j2re-1_4_2_06-windows-i586-p.exe (whats the difference?). 
      </p>
      <p>
        And then I discovered I have <a href="JavaWebStart.html">JavaWebStart</a> installed in in 1.4.2.05 directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So how do I upgrade to the new version, and have the old version removed?</em>
        Do I have to remove the applications that use JavaRuntime first?<em></em>
