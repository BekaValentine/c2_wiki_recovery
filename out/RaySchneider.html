        Moved rfom WhoAreYou...

      <p>
        WhoAreYou is a question which we each must ask of ourselves and of others.  
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was a young physicist, just starting out, I had an interesting conversation with an associate. We were walking across a hangar at the Naval Air Development Center, where I worked at the time. The topic was the management of complex activities which are beyond the complete understanding of any single individual. At the center, we develop large scale avionics systems, pioneering such systems as the P3C Orion ASW system - the first airborne, fully integrated aircraft with a central computer (at least that I know of).

        His response was: My father says it's all a game of <strong>Whom Do You Trust?</strong> My own father, who was a Rear Admiral in the Navy, told me once that the first thing he did when he assumed a new command was to find someone who already knew the place inside out, whom he trusted, and made him his adjutant. By doing this, he guaranteed a smooth transition of power, because the adjutant already knew how the organization ran. That's an instance of <a href="WhomDoYouTrust.html">WhomDoYouTrust</a> and to answer that question you must be able to answer the inherently prior question WhoAreYou. [One of the amusing things sometimes is how things transmogrify on a Wiki.  The original form of the story was Who Do You Trust and some language Nazi came by and "fixed" it.  Unfortunately, that doesn't change the fact that it was originally said as "Who do you trust?" Oh well ... not important, just annoying.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Building an answer to WhoAreYou involves adopting principles and standards that you trust, often by consciously modeling those who have gone before and whom you admire. The patterns which relate to this are <a href="RiverOfTime.html">RiverOfTime</a>, <a href="ShouldersOfGiants.html">ShouldersOfGiants</a>, <a href="SaintsAndHeroes.html">SaintsAndHeroes</a>, <a href="GhostsInUs.html">GhostsInUs</a>, and undoubtedly some I have not thought of. -- <a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>
