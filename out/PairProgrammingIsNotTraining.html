        Pair Programming Is Not Training
      </h1>
      <p>
        The truth about <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>; as opposed to the misleading page titles with names like <a href="PairProgrammingIsJustTraining.html">PairProgrammingIsJustTraining</a>, <a href="LetTheJuniorDrive.html">LetTheJuniorDrive</a> (an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>), and <a href="SellPairProgrammingAsTraining.html">SellPairProgrammingAsTraining</a> (an adoption pattern that should be abandoned once <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> has shown its other benefits).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not to say that programmers don't learn a lot from <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> (they do, especially when <a href="PairProgrammingIsDoneByPeers.html">PairProgrammingIsDoneByPeers</a>), just that it is not usually appropriate as a training technique when skill levels differ significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also not to say that <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> can't have the same benefits as training; it can end up being very <em>like</em> training.  But it's intended to be something other than training, and if you takes this bear and dress it up in a fish outfit, it still won't have gills.
