        Double Plus Un Good
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="NewSpeak.html">NewSpeak</a> term from <a href="GeorgeOrwell.html">GeorgeOrwell</a>'s <em></em><a href="NineteenEightyFour.html">NineteenEightyFour</a><em>.  In </em><a href="NewSpeak.html">NewSpeak</a>, there is no word for <em>bad</em> or <em>evil</em>, there is only <em>ungood</em>. Modifiers are also ambiguous. One uses the modifier <em>plus</em> for emphasis, so <em>plus ungood</em> means <em>especially ungood</em>.  The most emphatic modifier is <em>double-plus</em>, so <em>double-plus ungood</em> is the worst thing you can say about something.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I thought this page was a negative commentary on </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and other similarly-named languages.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        See? It works!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And I thought it was going to discuss the downside of the </em><a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>'s increment operator (++)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It really works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously <a href="BigBrother.html">BigBrother</a> likes to use prefix operators. I prefer UnGoodDoublePlus, or just UnGoodPlusPlus. . . 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, but </em><a href="BigBrother.html">BigBrother</a> is right so you had better use prefix operators if you know what's good for you.<em></em>
      </p>

        The extra <a href="CopyConstructor.html">CopyConstructor</a> of postfix++ is ungood. -- DamianYerrick
      </p>
      <p>
        I vote that this page be repurposed into a commentary on overuse of modifiers.
