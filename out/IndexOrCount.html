        You've surely seen code like:
      </p>
      <code>
        int number_of_elements;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I think this means "the count of elements".  Then there's:
      </p>
      <code>
        int number_of_selected_element;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which I think means "the number that identifies the selected element".  The subtlety is confusing, which is enough reason to not use "number" in a name.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it gets worse:
      </p>
      <code>
        int num_elem;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which is it?  
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution: use "count" or "index" instead of "number".  If you like prefixes, 'c' and 'i' work well.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For even worse naming:
      </p>
      <code>
        int no_elem;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        does this mean "count", "index", or "yes/no"?
      </p>

      <p>
        I suggest "elements" or "elts" for number_of_elements, and "element_idx" or "elt_i" for number_of_selected_element.  -- <a href="PanuKalliokoski.html">PanuKalliokoski</a>

        I use <strong>count</strong> or <strong>number_of</strong> for the total amount, and <strong>_index</strong> for a specific element.  Using <strong>number</strong> to denote which of a set seems unwieldy to me.  Typically, however, I'm using this in a loop, so I just use the loop variable to identify the current element and if I need to save it off for some reason (comparison, etc), I have a new variable of the index type and call it <strong>biggest<em>, or </em>'marker</strong> or some such. --<a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>
