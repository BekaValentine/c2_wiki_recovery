        Describe <a href="BillHamaker.html">BillHamaker</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bill Hamaker is the End User Computing manager at Marvin F. Poer & Company.   In practice that means I wear lots of hats including doing a lot of programming of custom in-house applications in Microsoft Access and Visual Basic.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote an article on a customized data base query tool for the May 2004 Dr. Dobbs Journal.  If there are readers of that magazine here I would be interested on any comments about that article.
