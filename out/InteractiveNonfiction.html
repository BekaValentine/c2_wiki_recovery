        Interactive Nonfiction

      <p>
        As opposed to make-believe (<em>why?</em>), interactive non-fiction is the interaction of real-people through an intermediary about real-issues, real-decisions, and reality. This wiki is an example of <a href="InteractiveNonfiction.html">InteractiveNonfiction</a>. Here, we discuss and debate, conduct dialogue and open for examination and review our thoughts, ideas and knowledge.
