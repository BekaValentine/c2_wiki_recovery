        This could take many forms, and I've seen a couple. The most disturbing is to see those who follow the practices without understanding the mindset. Say, a draconian management team enforces <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> (an excellent practice) while forgetting IndividualsAndInteractionsOverProcessesAndTools. -- <a href="DonBranson.html">DonBranson</a>

        I'm not sure if this is the same as AgileInNameOnly, but that's what my firm practices.  <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> is pretty much our only agile practice.
