        Stackless Python
      </h1>
      <p>
        Stackless Python is a reimplementation of the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> that doesn't use the native (or so-called "C") runtime stack to represent the virtual machine stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        This change enabled a number of interesting features, including a port to the stack-limited Palm platform (<a href="PalmPython.html">PalmPython</a>) and the implementation of continuations and coroutines (see <a href="ContinuationExplanation.html">ContinuationExplanation</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        After a period of inactivity, Stackless was reinvigorated by ChristianTismer and is, as of spring 2004, under active development. For more information, see <a href="http://www.stackless.com/,">http://www.stackless.com/,</a> especially the mailing list.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As of December 2004, it's back to inactive.  Looks like most of Tismer's interest is now in </em><a href="PyPy.html">PyPy</a>, a project that looks about as vaprous as <a href="PerlSix.html">PerlSix</a>.<em></em>

        <em>And it does not have continuations anymore.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Could someone clarify whether <a href="StacklessPython.html">StacklessPython</a> has continuations or not?  And if it doesn't, what is its main selling point?  Also, what's so bad about multiple stacks anyway?  My C-based <a href="FlowBasedProgramming.html">FlowBasedProgramming</a> implementation (called THREADS) has no trouble switching stacks... It has been suggested that it's not stackless at all, but just has multiple stacks - otherwise how does it handle "local" variables?  Comments? 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am attaching a conversation with WolfgangKeller on <a href="StacklessPython.html">StacklessPython</a> ("Stackless" for short) below. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am beginning to understand why "Stackless": the problem seems to be that Python is an interpreter, and the base version mixed interpreter state and program data on the same stack.  This seems to relate to an idea I had, that a neat application architecture, using <a href="FlowBasedProgramming.html">FlowBasedProgramming</a> (FBP) concepts, would be to have each FBP process running its own interpreter if it requires one, so the interpreter doesn't have to handle task switching.  This should give a much leaner interpreter.  An added advantage is that you could then mix interpreted and compiled processes together in a single application.  --<a href="PaulMorrison.html">PaulMorrison</a>

        <a href="StacklessPython.html">StacklessPython</a> is nifty because it adds continuations. What the heck is one you ask? Here's what I think they are:
      </p>
      <p>
        Multi-tasking systems have to have the ability to save the state of a task, and then restore that state with all of its accompanying bits so that the program can happily continue on its way.
      </p>
      <p>
        A continuation is just that, it's a saved state. (Also see <a href="ContinuationExplanation.html">ContinuationExplanation</a>.) What makes this cool is that you can have python code save a copy of its state this way and then access any of the aforementioned accompanying bits to change them or just read them.
      </p>
      <p>
        One minor example of continuations:
        You can write your own 'loops' where you only change one variable and then run that saved state again
      </p>
      <p>
        If you extend the idea of continuations just slightly, you get coroutines....
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>actually, if you restrict the idea of continuations, you get coroutines, (resumable) exceptions, flow control, gotos.. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Coroutines are continuations that call each other, rather than themselves. This means you can have the equivalent of 'micro-threads' such that when each coroutine hits a point where it has to wait, it calls another coroutine to do something and then at some point the first coroutine will be called again. (Also see <a href="ContinuationsAndCoroutines.html">ContinuationsAndCoroutines</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, how is this useful? What good is the whole idea?
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my friends wrote a prototype of a persistent Python CGI interpreter where getting input from the webserver is actually a function call. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>this idea has been predated from </em><a href="AviBryant.html">AviBryant</a> with Borges (written in Ruby) and <a href="SeasideFramework.html">SeasideFramework</a> (<a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>) and various Scheme and LISP clones exist (UncommonWeb is the bigger project)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone else has suggested that you could have a quick distributed python by saving these states and passing them across the network to another interpreter. (though there would need to be a bit more infrastructure for this to work). Someone else has mentioned a successful implementation of this idea would be perfect for independent agents.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, both SISC and </em><a href="KaliScheme.html">KaliScheme</a> do that.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A pretty average computer should be able to run at least hundreds of these continuations without severe load (from what has been said on the newsgroup, I haven't tried that many). Therefore, you could have one coroutine for each character in a role-playing game, or for each unit in a strategy game, or for each Sim in your economic simulation.

        <em>Is the stackless implementation of continuations better than, for example, a threaded implementation?  What implementation does </em>regular<em> Python use?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Regular Python doesn't have continuations. Continuations can't be implemented using only threads. Continuations are much more powerful than that; you can implement threads with continuations, but not the other way around. The stackless implementation should be understood in opposition to a stack-based implementation. I would say that there are tradeoffs between the two, but in the context of Python, stackless has a HUGE advantage. The nice thing about a stack is that it's usually very quick to operate, so function calls can be fast; but many high level languages, especially Python, make function calls so slow that you could be using MUCH slower structures and never notice the slowness. The nice thing about the stackless stucture is that it doesn't assume a linear block of memory like the C stack does, and many of the basic operations that you want to do with continuations are very simple and quick.

        Er, that document talks about "one-shot subcontinuations" (see <a href="SingleUseContinuation.html">SingleUseContinuation</a> for what that means), not regular continuations, and by the way, there are various things you can do with continuations that you can't do with <a href="SingleUseContinuation.html">SingleUseContinuation</a>s.  <a href="DavidPiepgrass.html">DavidPiepgrass</a>

        Stackless is excellent for every kind of application that needs to handle
        asynchronous threads. Especially for I/O-bound applications, where each
        thread usually wastes a lot of time waiting for something, you can
        enormously speed up things by using _lots_ (tens or hundreds of thousands)
        of threads in parallel and thus "interleaving" the waiting time, so that
        there's always at least one thread which has everything it needs to
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another issue (which you address in
        <a href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/method.htm">http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/method.htm</a> if I understood it right):
      </p>
      <p>
        Python is not only an excellent "middleware" language (as it interfaces
        with practically everything easily, including Java and .net), it's also an
        excellent prototyping language, with development times which are typically
        a fraction of those for the same application in Java. And once the Python
        prototype is finished, all you have to do to turn it into a productive
        application is to profile it and re-implement those modules which are
        considered too slow for example with Pyrex, which gives your "prototype"
        native C(++) speed.

        Unfortunately he's too busy earning his living and trying to keep the

      </code>
      <p>
        The name of "Stackless" is somewhat misleading (or at least bad PR  ;-) .
        Getting rid of the C stack in Stackless is just a means for the aim of
        handling a lot of concurrent tasklets (=microthreads) with reasonable
        ressource requirements. IMHO Stackless should be renamed into something
        like "Microthreaded Python" "Parallel Python" or something like that... Or
        even better, the main Python implementation should be "Stackless"ed.
