        Methodologist As Religious Reformer
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Come and embrace the One True Development Process." <em>no thanks</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of these three morphemes, am I right in thinking that there's only one that generates even the slightest positive vibes for most readers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           prison reform
        </li>
        <li>
           the <strong>Reform Bill</strong> of 1832 that transformed UK democracy
        </li>
        <li>
           "he's a reformed character"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sure, it's got some bad connotations too.  But please don't lets be too heavy in decrying the goal of reforming the world of software development.  It may just need it.
