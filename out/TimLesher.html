        I've been lurking on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> since 1999, but didn't get up the nerve to write anything until about 2001 (FearOfLookingStupid?).

        I don't come around here much anymore since the emergence of <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>.  I do believe in <a href="SharkBotConsideredHarmful.html">SharkBotConsideredHarmful</a>.  And while I understand and sympathize with the aims that caused its creation and continued use, to me it feels a lot like "having to destroy the village in order to save it."

        <strong>WikiNostalgia</strong>

        A recent (August 2004) exchange, written to my <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>, that restored some of my hope for <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>. This is the way Wiki seemed to work when I first found it in 1999-ish: someone (me, in this case) makes an edit that someone else questions, and we hash it out like humans.

I also thought "well, historically WikiGnome1 is quite reasonable, so maybe he knows something I don't about it...

        At any rate, I highly recommend <a href="LispInSmallPieces.html">LispInSmallPieces</a> for someone who wants to understand the semantics of Lisp and Scheme in a lot more depth than is necessary for casual coding, e.g. if one is interested in serious implementations of Lisp or Scheme. (I was rereading it this time around because I implemented a Lisp/Scheme hybrid, and some aspects of the marriage didn't work out well, so I needed to rethink some issues.) -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
