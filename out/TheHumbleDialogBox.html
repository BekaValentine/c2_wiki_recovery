        The Humble Dialog Box
      </h1>

        A paper at <a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a>, by <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>:

        It describes a design technique to facilitate testing of GUIs, which involves keeping all logic out of the dialog box, but instead putting it in a non-GUI class that essentially has a one-to-one mapping of typical view functions.  You can then easily create a mock view to guarantee the contract between this class and the view, and then finally create "The Humble Dialog Box".  As stated in the paper, "Notice that each [dialog box] action method is very small, just a simple delegation. Every method that receives data on the view is as close to a pure �set� method as possible."

        <a href="TheHumbleDialogBox.html">TheHumbleDialogBox</a> is not quite the same as <a href="ModelViewPresenter.html">ModelViewPresenter</a>. The key to the pattern is a totally passive view containing only setters.  You can have <a href="ModelViewPresenter.html">ModelViewPresenter</a> without that.

        Another article of Martin Fowler is more specific to the Humble View (which is the concept of the Humble Dialog Box):
