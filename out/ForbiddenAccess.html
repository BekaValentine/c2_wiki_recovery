        Forbidden Access

      <p>
        Every once in a while when trying to access a wiki page (and it seems that it happens right after I've been seconding some page deletions) I get a page that says <strong>Forbidden - Access Denied</strong>, etc.  A few minutes later (more or less) and everything is back to normal.  Since the problem is intermittent the explanation on <a href="WikiHelpDesk.html">WikiHelpDesk</a> does not seem to apply. Any light on the subject would be very much appreciated. -- <a href="MarkTilley.html">MarkTilley</a>

        <em>Just a guess, but I suspect it's Ward's system doing some sort of updates, like the reverse search database, or similar. It's consistent with being in the wee small hours Californian time.</em>

        Except it happens midmorning EST, so not really that early Pacific Time.

        <em>I also get Forbidden at random times.  I don't know whether it's a throttle or whether the web server engine just has a threshold for "don't let any more people in" that gets tripped by high access request levels.  Usually the condition subsides in a few minutes, occasionally I'm blocked for an hour or more.</em>

        Perhaps it's Wiki's way of suggesting that we should visit the <a href="BigBlueRoom.html">BigBlueRoom</a>.

        Ward, an administrative question:
      </p>
      <p>
        When trying to access <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> this morning, I get occasional messages of the following sort:
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>Forbidden</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        You don't have permission to access /cgi/quickDiff on this server.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (In trying to <em>save</em> this message, got a similar error)
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually retrying (several times) to load the page fixes the problem.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Just wondering whassup.  If this is a bug or server configuration problem, consider it duly reported.  If it is normal behavior of Wiki under load (or during maintenance), let us know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks!
