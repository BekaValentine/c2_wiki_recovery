        Inventor of the <a href="LightningRod.html">LightningRod</a> and the FranklinStove. Discovered that lightning is an electrical phenomenon. The most illustrious Philadelphian ever, responsible for the Poor Richard's Almanac, the early American printing presses, early firehouses, and the first mint.  Pretty good for someone who had failed at life by the age of twenty-three.  He also invented bifocal lenses, and -- get this, all you free spirits on Wiki -- a version of the day-planner.

        His autobiography is online, and it's very funny: <a href="http://earlyamerica.com/lives/franklin/">http://earlyamerica.com/lives/franklin/</a>

        <em>Interestingly, his autobiography ends in 1757.  There is nothing about the American Revolution or its aftermath in it.</em>

        BF was one of the most widely known Americans in the world <strong>before</strong> the American Revolution. He wrote his autobiography when he was 51 years old, after he retired from his printing business, and he (correctly) thought his life was pretty full and interesting. Franklin was 70 in 1776 and he was 84 when he died in 1790.
