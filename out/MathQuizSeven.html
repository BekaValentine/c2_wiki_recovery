        Math Quiz Seven
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was recently reminded of a problem I saw published in 88 or 89 in the soviet Math journal (forgot its name ). The original was in Russian alphabet which I cannot type, so I'll transliterate:
      </p>
      <code>
        KYOTO +<br/>
        KYTO<br/>
        -----<br/>
        TOKYO<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The nice thing in Russian alphabet that all 3 words are names of big cities (KYTO stands for Quito). In Latin writing, I hope there's a KYTO somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is this a trick question? Or is there a legitimate (non-zero) solution? Or is discovering the answer to THAT question the whole point of the problem?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The point of math quizzes is that when you find valid, interesting questions about the puzzle, you should answer yourself. Obviously there's a non-zero solution. Take letters to represent distinct digits.

        The T does not match in the above. The solution first posted is unique and obviously now is spoiled, but the fact that it was solved in maybe less than 1 hour could be a good indication of the IQ level still kicking on C2.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, it is possible to demonstrate that the solution first posted is unique in the sense that no other solution in any *conventional* number system (ordinary base b numbers) exists. I struggled for a while attempting to find another solution in some *exotic* number system, such as the integers in base -7, with digits {0,1,2,3,a,b,c}, where a=-1, b=-2, c=-3. (It is possible to represent all the integers uniquely in base -7. Counting begins: 1, 2, 3, ac, ab, aa, a0, a1, a2, a3, bc, bb, ba, b0. Those are the numbers 1 through 14. Note that the positions in a base -7 number representing odd powers of 7, (-7)^1, (-7)^3, (-7)^5, etc. have a negative positional factor, so that, for example, c2 = ((-3) * (-7)^1) + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23. And in base -7, 123 = (1 * (-7 ^ 2)) + (2 * (-7 ^ 1)) + 3 = 49 - 14 + 3 = 38.) Well, it turns out that that no solution exists in base -7, or in any other *exotic* number system, either, as far as I can determine.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, something kept bothering me about the uniqueness of the solution. It just felt intuitively as though the problem should be, or could be, made a special case of a more general problem, a problem with a more general solution, or set of solutions. Then it struck me in a flash!  If the problem is reformulated as</em> 
      </p>
      <code>
        KYOTO +<br/>
        AKYTO<br/>
        -----<br/>
        TOKYO  <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>one can produce a schema (or algorithm) which generates an infinite number of solutions, of which the solution first posted is a special case. (Of course, AKYTO does not seem to have any meaning; but that's neither here nor there.)</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can someone please confirm that this solution-generating schema (or algorithm) actually exists for the revised quiz, and perhaps even write it down? Just so that I can be sure that I am not hallucinating again, as when I claimed a solution in base 11 for the original puzzle!</em>

        OK, let's try this. First, let us adopt the notation Z(n) for a digit with value n (for 0 thru 9, these are the ordinary decimal digits; for digits greater than 9, which is to say for bases greater than 10, we need to devise these additional digits, of course.) Now, for all n > 2, specify base (4n-1), and 
      </p>
      <code>
        O = 0;<br/>
        T = Z(3n-1);<br/>
        Y = Z(2n-1);<br/>
        K = Z(2n);<br/>
        A = Z(n-2);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This seems to satisfy the general condition and yield a general solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        For n = 2, there is a special case. The base is 7; the values of T = 5, Y = 3, K = 4 are correctly generated, as in the first solution above; however, instead of A = 0 (which would conflict with O = 0), in this case A = spaces; the  white space in the leading position being the equivalent of zero.

      <p>
        Hence if the unknown digits have to be between 0 and 9 inclusive, there is just one additional non-exotic solution (corresponding to n=3), as shown below, which uses a base of 11.
