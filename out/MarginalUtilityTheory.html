        Marginal Utility Theory
      </h1>
      <p>
        Economic theory that does not say that the first $10 have more value than the next $10. (See <a href="MarginalUtility.html">MarginalUtility</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="MarginalUtilityTheory.html">MarginalUtilityTheory</a> states that when you are producing at the best rate, the cost of producing the next unit over the best rate is equal to the income you will get for selling it, so you decide rather not to produce it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably, the risk is too big that the product will be defective, so you better don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, you are not doing this for the customer, you are doing this for yourself. If the customer is not willing to allow you any profit, I'm sorry but look for someone else.

        Ditch Digging Example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Five shovels - 3 diggers - 2 of the shovels have marginal utility.
        </li>
      </ul>
