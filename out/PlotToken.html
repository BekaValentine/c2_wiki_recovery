      <p>
        A set of ideas/concepts given to the author of any fantasy book, all of which must be used in the book. They include
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The mysterious wizard (often old and bearded)
        </li>
        <li>
           The broken weapon
        </li>
        <li>
           The powerful but apparently insignificant artifact (ring, stone, whatever)
        </li>
        <li>
           A major character must die (or appear to, but re-appear later)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most of these appear in <a href="LordOfTheRings.html">LordOfTheRings</a>, but they were at least reasonably original there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this was invented by DaveLangford, a SF critic and author. I first read it in White Dwarf, a UK gaming magazine, probably in 1980 or so
