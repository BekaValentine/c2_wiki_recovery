        Fred Dot Net
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you're curious about the name, Visual Fred was coined by Bill Vaughn, formerly of Microsoft. It's considered to highlight the sentiment that this really isn't <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> anymore, and perhaps should've been given a different name. Form your own opinion, after considering the differences.
