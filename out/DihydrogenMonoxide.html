        Dihydrogen Monoxide
      </h1>
      <p>
        This may be a little off-topic for the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, but is important nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO) is a colorless and odorless chemical compound, also referred to by some as Dihydrogen Oxide, <a href="HydrogenHydroxide.html">HydrogenHydroxide</a>, Hydronium Hydroxide, <a href="HydroxicAcid.html">HydroxicAcid</a>, or simply Hydric acid, that is a constituent of many known toxic substances, diseases and disease-causing agents, environmental hazards and can even be lethal to humans in quantities as small as a thimbleful. It is a major component of acid rain.

      <p>
        Dihydrogen monoxide kills uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death.

        Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           as an industrial solvent and coolant. 
        </li>
        <li>
           in nuclear power plants. 
        </li>
        <li>
           in the production of styrofoam. 
        </li>
        <li>
           as a fire retardant. 
        </li>
        <li>
           in many forms of cruel animal research. 
        </li>
        <li>
           in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical. And even after using special procedures to remove all traces of it, food is left shriveled and tough.
        </li>
        <li>
           as an additive in certain "junk-foods" and other food products. 
        </li>
        <li>
           in certain forms of torture and/or murder.
        </li>
        <li>
           dehydrated DHMO would make a good business venture. It could be sold in small quantities, or in large bulk form, and then all one would have to do, would be to rehydrate it with water. A fortune could be made.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Studies by scientists have shown that a majority of the U.S. population favors a ban on this substance.
