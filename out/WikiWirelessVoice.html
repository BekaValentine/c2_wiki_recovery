        Wiki Wireless Voice

        What if you could have a wireless eye-mounted display+earpiece and use voice recognition/generation (server side perhaps using <a href="VoiceXml.html">VoiceXml</a>) and do Wiki all day - driving, walking down street, waiting for bus etc. For instance something like <a href="http://xybernaut.com/Solutions/product/poma_product.htm">http://xybernaut.com/Solutions/product/poma_product.htm</a>

        almost same experience can be had using rim blackberry except had to use c2 special search since findpage does not have aa send button and enter does not work on the rim with go.web. Added a mark for it and quicklinks easy to do wiki anytime anywhere now

        And the speech synthesizer would use the <a href="VoiceOfWiki.html">VoiceOfWiki</a>.
