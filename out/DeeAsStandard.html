        Dee As Standard
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hi!
        I was just wondering... why nobody has submitted a Dee-based language (like for example <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>) to an standards body like Ecma, or ISO... wouldn't that help with its adoption?
        What would happen if, someone did it... (could I do it?) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine if someone just takes the description of <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> from the books and tries to submit it as an EcmaStandard (like <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a>) would he (or she) had copyright problems with the authors of <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> ? if not, why none of the DeeImplementors has done it? (is it expensive? too complicated? perceived to be pointless/worthless?)
      </p>

        <em>Before we commit, let's see if we can fix the oddities of D first, such as the prefix/infix confusion.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {Be careful to distinguish D from Tutorial D.  D is an abstract specification of the characteristics a "good" database language should have.  It does not specify any syntax, let alone use of prefix vs. infix operators.  Tutorial D is a specific example of a D which is intended to be an illustrative teaching tool -- and therefore demonstrates a variety of syntax options -- rather than be practical, ideal, consistent, or even complete.  As such, there isn't any "confusion" to fix -- except perhaps among a handful of students.  Implementations are free to use whatever syntax they like, as long as the D specification is not violated.  My Rel2 (see the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>) implementation of <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, for example, added infix versions of the defined prefix operators.}
      </p>
      <p>
        {It's likely that no D implementor has submitted a specification to a standards body because all the implementations (of which I'm aware) are still considered in-development moving targets.  Wait a few years for one or more implementations to stabilise, and then it may be different.} -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
