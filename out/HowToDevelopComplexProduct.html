      </h1>
      <p>

        <em>That's because XP discourages </em><a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>, XP says it's a bad practice and is a waste of time.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Are there any good tips developing the product definition for a hardware/software project such that it can be the input to the planning game?

        <em>Um.. write a feature, then another, then another, after a while... whala... a complex project.  How does a mouse eat an elephant, um... one bite at a time.  Complex project are built from many simple features, not from complex features.</em>
