        Managing Your Muse
      </h1>
      <p>
        You are a creative person (well duh, because you are a software developer and a Wiki contributor!)  Since you are creative you also have other creative outlets... you paint, you play music, you write fiction.  So you know about the Muse.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you go about <a href="ManagingYourMuse.html">ManagingYourMuse</a>?  Or does your Muse manage you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is it necessary to manage a muse?  Well, if you wish to remain a completely WhimsicalPerson then you don't have to manage your muse.  But since a given muse tends to teach you about <a href="TheMediumAndItsProperties.html">TheMediumAndItsProperties</a> you need to allocate your (unfortnately, limited amount of) time to a muse long enough to become a bit of a SubjectExpert to acquire sufficient <a href="DomainKnowledge.html">DomainKnowledge</a>.

           Be a boring person
        </li>
        <li>
           Be efficient at survival skills so you have more time to dedicate to a Muse
        </li>
        <li>
           Be poor (restricted funds reduces your whimsy)
        </li>

          <em>I have to disagree with that last one, by forcing more creativity and less consumerism being poor can actually boost one's 'Muse'.</em>
