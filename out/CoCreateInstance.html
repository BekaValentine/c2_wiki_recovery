        Co Create Instance

      <p>
        <strong><em>It's COMs version of new!</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        (COM = <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>'s <a href="ComponentObjectModel.html">ComponentObjectModel</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Well it's complicated but in a nutshell: COM/COM+ call to instantiate a COM object regardless of it's location and bring it to life, returning an Interface Pointer to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What it does:</strong>
        Given a class id (a GUID) and an interface ID (another GUID), it finds and loads the appropriate component's code, finds the <a href="ClassFactory.html">ClassFactory</a> for the class ID, and asks it to create an instance of that class, and return the requested interface.
        You can ask for the IUnknown interface, supported by all COM objects, but it's more efficient, especially on remote calls, to ask for the interface you really need.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're going to create many instances of a given class, it makes sense to do the work yourself:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Call the CoGetClassObject function to get the class factory, typically asking for the IClassFactory interface -- the standard <a href="ClassFactory.html">ClassFactory</a> interface for creating COM instances.
        </li>
        <li>
           Call IClassFactory::CreateInstance lots of times; once for each instance you wish to create.  It takes an interface ID, for the interface you want to use on the instance it returns.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you want to "pass parameters" to your COM object constructor -- the moral equivalent of "new C<strong>'lassName(parameters)" -- define a non-standard factory interface with an IYourCustomClassFactory::</strong>CreateInstance(your-parameters)" signature.
        Clients will have to use CoGetClassObject to create your instances -- which will be a problem for <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> and scripting languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        See CoCreateInstanceEx if you want better control of where the object will be created -- local or remote, or if you need to create <strong><em>*LOTS*</em></strong> of instances on a remote (network) server.
