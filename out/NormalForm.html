        Normal Form
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a (possibly apocryphal) story I have heard regarding why <a href="DrCodd.html">DrCodd</a> decided to call the various Normal Forms "Normal". It might be more apocryphal than it was when I heard it, because my memory is not what it could be. If anyone knows better, please speak up.
      </p>

        When Codd was developing the theory of relational databases, he was of course thinking in terms of "relations" rather than "tables". He wanted to have a good term for the process of factoring relations to eliminate redundancy, but nothing sprang immediately to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        It happened that, as he was contemplating this element of nomenclature, he saw a report on television that spoke of Nixon "normalizing relations" with China. "Aha!" he thought to himself. "If Nixon can normalize relations, then by God so can I!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence the term "normalizing" as it is applied to relational databases, and the various "Normal Forms".

        I find this dubious. "normal form" is a standard phrase in mathematics; for instance, each permutation has a normal form (namely, a standard way to write it). Is there an online version of Codd's original (1970) paper?

        There seems to be two parts to database normalization. One is factoring out the repetition (<a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>). There does not seem to be much dispute over this aspect. But, there is dispute over splitting tables into smaller tables to offer a field grouping. For example, in an Employee table there might be a few fields that are only used if the employee is a manager. Some designers will create a second table called Managers and put those dedicated fields in it. The problems I see with this is that it creates more tables to manage, and future requirement changes may give non-managers access to perks that only managers used to receive. Thus, I avoid one-to-zero-or-one relationships usually. Similar issues may apply to normalization outside of databases.
