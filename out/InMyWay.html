        In My Way
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="SoftwareUsability.html">SoftwareUsability</a> metric--how much is it <a href="InMyWay.html">InMyWay</a>, as opposed to <a href="OnMySide.html">OnMySide</a>? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Software that is hard to use, for one of the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Too many features(<a href="CreepingFeaturitis.html">CreepingFeaturitis</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           Incoherent feature set(a program that lets you read your e-mail, provides a shell buffer, acts as an image editor, and sports system-wide speech recognition, for instance).
        </li>
        <li>
           Flashy/Useless user interface elements.  Splash screens get in my way, button images that don't make sense are misleading, and dancing paperclips are right out.  Filling up a screen is likewise kiboshed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Gross lack of speed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Instability.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Software that gets <a href="InMyWay.html">InMyWay</a> includes <a href="MicrosoftOffice.html">MicrosoftOffice</a>, <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>, and the <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any program that works more slowly than I do is <a href="InMyWay.html">InMyWay</a>.  If it takes more time to figure out how to do something than to do it, I don't want anything to do with it.
      </p>

        This page also works nicely if you replace "Software" with "Programming Language" throughout. -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Amen to that. --<a href="JoeOsborn.html">JoeOsborn</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        So which <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> has none of the above? i.e.:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Just the right number of features
        </li>
        <li>
           Coherent feature set
        </li>
        <li>
           Nothing flashy or gratuitous
        </li>
        <li>
           Performance
        </li>
        <li>
           Stability
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not starting a LanguageWar, just asking!
