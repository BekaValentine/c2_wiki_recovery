        It seems inevitable, especially these days, that folk come into conflict on c2. <a href="HowToReactToaFlame.html">HowToReactToaFlame</a> doesn't help when someone is dogging you and deleting you.

        If someone does this to you, bug out of here and <a href="LetKarmaDoTheWork.html">LetKarmaDoTheWork</a>. There are plenty of other ways and places to spend your time. This particular hotbed of spammers, flamers, and deleters is obviously dying. Maybe Ward will find some way to save it. More likely, someone else will and the remaining content will be transmigrated. Maybe you can do it yourself if you cut a bit of code. Anyway don't feel angry at the nitwits here - they can't help the way they are. Go do something productive with yourself and give it some time.
