        Naming Conventions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many programming languages, programming language communities, and local <a href="CodingStandard.html">CodingStandard</a>s adopt various <em>naming conventions</em>, wherein the name assigned to an object/variable/type/function/whatever is augmented in some way to convey additional information (besides the basic purpose).  Some of these schemes are commonplace; some are controversial--and some are compiler enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advantages of <a href="NamingConventions.html">NamingConventions</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Provide additional info that the programmer can see everywhere the variable is used.  Especially useful if the information is something that the language implementation (compiler, interpreter) won't check.
        </li>
        <li>
           Resolve potential naming conflicts, such as adding a module prefix to extern symbols in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> (to avoid NamespacePollution)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Disadvantages of <a href="NamingConventions.html">NamingConventions</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           May provide information that the environment (compiler, editor, etc.) can determine for the programmer by other means.
        </li>
        <li>
           May complicate <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a>ing. If the relevant information changes, then the name may have to change too; if it doesn't...
        </li>
        <li>
           The name may become inconsistent with the attribute the name is supposed to encode.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a>.  The encoding of the type of a variable/object in its name.  This has its own page, enough said here.
        </li>
        <li>
           Sigils in languages such as <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> and <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Module prefixes in C, as mentioned above.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of "m_" or similar prefixes (common in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and Java) to identify member variables
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of "g_" or similar to identify <a href="GlobalVariable.html">GlobalVariable</a>s
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of English articles or pronouns (the, a, my) to identify temporaries, member variables, etc.  Common in <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="UncleBobsNamingConventions.html">UncleBobsNamingConventions</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           In languages which don't have implementation-enforced encapsulation (i.e. <a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a>, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>), prefixes to identify what parts of a class are "private" and should be left alone by clients.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use in <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> of ! suffix on functions with <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s, ? suffix on predicates.  Use of -p suffix in <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> for predicates.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of get_, set_, is_ prefixes in many languages for accessors, mutators, and predicates.  Practically mandatory for <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Anyone else seen these?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use of just a "_" prefix to identify system level functions
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of just a "__" prefix to identify "really" system level functions
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of "p_" for pointers
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of "LP" in win32 for pointers
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of "tmp_" or "temp_" for temporary variables
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of "foo_/bar_/cat_/dog_" for variables not meant to be used in production code (i.e. only for tests)
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of "gl" for OpenGL functions
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of "<em>doStuff</em>" i.e. lowercase word, followed by uppercase word for class methods
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (<a href="SmellsLikeJava.html">SmellsLikeJava</a>)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>MixedCase</strong> for class names
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>mixedCase</strong> for most other names
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>UPPER_CASE</strong> for final constants
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>lower_case</strong> for private methods
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>That naming standard is common in the C/C++ world, and certainly predates Java (though it isn't adopted by the C/C++ standard, which use lower_case for just about everything...with a few exceptions I can think of)</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I have one naming convention that I'd like to see:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Lowercase l, the digit 1, and uppercase I are not to be used in names except when the context within the name (ie: spelling) makes it clear which one it is. Ditto O and 0.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Just spent 1/2 an hour trying to connect to SystemServicesS1 when I should have been connecting to SystemServicesSl - the "Sl" is for "StateLess", but being new to the project, I did not know this.
