      <p>
        No.  Forth is weakly typed; it doesn't distinguish between a variable being a pointer and integer.  It uses early binding though; whether you are treating that variable as a pointer or integer is known at compile-time.  As I understand it, <a href="WeaklyTyped.html">WeaklyTyped</a> and <a href="StronglyTyped.html">StronglyTyped</a> tell you how hard the compiler works to make sure type errors don't exist, while <a href="EarlyBinding.html">EarlyBinding</a> and <a href="LateBinding.html">LateBinding</a> tell you when it does that work.  "Weak" and "strong" typing are rather nebulously defined, like "low level" and "high level" programming languages.  -- <a href="SimonHeath.html">SimonHeath</a>

        See <a href="TypingQuadrant.html">TypingQuadrant</a> and <a href="LateVsEarlyBinding.html">LateVsEarlyBinding</a> for more on this distinction.
