        Python And Perl
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page is about <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> and <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, but it is not <a href="PythonVsPerl.html">PythonVsPerl</a> (see <a href="ComparingNotPissing.html">ComparingNotPissing</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Both languages have a lot of character, and they prefer that the programmer work with the flow of the language.

        It sometimes seems like Perl is an analogue to driftwood: organic and interesting and engaging the whole personality of the artist.  Python is more like carbon-fibre-composite: slick and perhaps more appropriate for big high-tech jobs, but also very beautiful in a way.  AllAnalogiesAreFalse.

        In some ways, Python has a lot of the benefits of the Smalltalk philosophy: cleanliness and simplicity.  Conflicts between simplicity and the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a>, are resolved in favour of simplicity.  (Contrast this with Perl, C++, <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> and the <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a>. The length of <a href="ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction.html">ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction</a> at over a thousand pages illustrates what can happen when you scrupulously try to do the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Some generalisations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Perl is about <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Python is about <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Eiffel is about doing the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        For a comparision page, this sure seems to have a bias. Complaints about Perl's cleanliness can be dealt with by a small application of discipline and/or (failing that) <a href="PerlTidy.html">PerlTidy</a>.
      </p>

        Why choose, when you can have both?  See <a href="http://www.zope.org//Wikis/zope-perl/FAQ">http://www.zope.org//Wikis/zope-perl/FAQ</a> for "pyperl", which embeds Perl in Python (Zope support is optional).  (Still in beta state as of September 2000.)
