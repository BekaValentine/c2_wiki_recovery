        Only Ones And Zeros
      </h1>
      <p>
        Pejorative term applied to software implying that it is easy to change because
        it is not physical.

        <em>The more choices there are, the harder it is to choose.  There are a </em>lot<em> of choices of ones and zeros.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's even easier than that.  The zeros are already there, you only need to add the ones!

        Here, write a book on this subject.  Have it done in a week.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sorry, it may take longer than that.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why?  It takes you less than a week to read one, and after all, it's only words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variation:  book=program, subject=problem, week=month (sometimes), words=software.

        I remember a Dave Berg (of MAD fame) cartoon. The man asks for a pack of cigarettes and the clerk behind the counter fires off a litany of choices: king or 100s, menthol or regular, hard pack or soft, filter tip or plain? The man gives up and goes for a pack of gum instead.
