        I have been developing software (OO whenever possible) for the past 8.5 years at NCR, first in the delightful Human Interface Technology Center, and more recently in the Retail Systems Group.

        I became quite fascinated with <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> last year after reading <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>'s book. This summer, I had the excellent fortune to be "reduced in force" at NCR and have landed at Retek (thanks to former NCR colleague <a href="WesHunter.html">WesHunter</a>) in a software development group which is preparing to go "Extreme".

        I am deeply grateful to all the XP pioneers for making programming fun again.

        Just stumbled across this page while googling myself (come on, you know you do it too).
        Thought I should update with the fact that Retek has been bought out by Oracle.
        I'm still hacking away here, working with smart and hard-working folks.
        We're no longer officially doing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, but have, at least,
        kept some of the good habits, particularly <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a>.
