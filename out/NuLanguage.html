        In the <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> family, but using the sophisticated object system from <a href="CocoaFramework.html">CocoaFramework</a> / <a href="GnuStep.html">GnuStep</a>.  I say "sophisticated" partly because it inherits a nice class library, but also because it's based on message passing like <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>.  I think it makes pretty much all the right compromises to achieve this, but it does lose something from both sides: from the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> side, it loses the idea that EVERYTHING is message passing (although all the Cocoa calls are in message-passing style, and you can write all your own functions in message-passing style if you like ... but not macros); and from the <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> side, it loses multiple inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you're not interested in the object system, it's neat to have a <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> that optionally uses message passing and keyword parameters.

        I am currently attempting to install Nu on <a href="UbuntuLinux.html">UbuntuLinux</a> using Nu.0.4.0.tgz. After a while this comes to a grinding halt. I will post the solution when I find it. The answer was that the instructions I was following were out of date. Following different ones I have been able to build the shell for nu. The detailed answer is to follow instructions given for <a href="DebianLinux.html">DebianLinux</a> which involve using <a href="GnuStep.html">GnuStep</a> 1.18.0. --<a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
