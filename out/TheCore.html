        "A collection of ResultsOriented ideas and practices that will reliably yield high performance teamwork for any team committed to achieving it. The name of this collection is <a href="TheCore.html">TheCore</a>. <a href="TheCore.html">TheCore</a> is like an <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>. Instead of running on processors in machines, <a href="TheCore.html">TheCore</a> runs in the minds of people on teams. It is software you run in your head. Those who choose to run <a href="TheCore.html">TheCore</a> will continue to do so only because they find that it favorably affects their results."

        Can someone familiar with this book complete this bullet list of <a href="TheCore.html">TheCore</a> practices, possibly citing existing Wiki pages that might relate? (This might still best belong under the book's page.)

      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Pass / Unpass Protocol</strong> -- You can pass on any activity except voting.  In particular, you can check in without sharing your feelings.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Check-In Protocol.</strong> -- Almost, but not quite, entirely unlike the XP <a href="StandUpMeeting.html">StandUpMeeting</a> and the daily <a href="ScrumMeetings.html">ScrumMeetings</a>.  One shares current emotional state, and commits to participate in the team, but does not share status -- done, todo, blockers.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Check-Out Protocol.</strong> -- If you are not FreshAndReady, take a break.

        </li>
        <li>

        It seems that the Check-In Protocol's model of emotions always being a combination of MAD, SAD, GLAD and AFRAID is similar to / based on / has similar roots with Robert Plutchik's two axis "Rage - Terror / Ecstasy - Grief" "Wheel of Emotions"
