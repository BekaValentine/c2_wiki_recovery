        I was at Oracle briefly, and moved on to a startup; maybe I'm still there...
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was active here I did R&D for a wee software startup, Metagon Technologies, which spun off of, and was later reabsorbed by, a small software company, Decision Support, Inc (<a href="http://www.dsinc.com).">http://www.dsinc.com).</a>  Before that I spent some time at the late ApolloComputer (and its subsequent <a href="HewlettPackard.html">HewlettPackard</a> incarnation), and before that at DartmouthCollege.

        I'm interested in all sorts of things related to software, especially distributed computing and code-simplifying infrastructures or patterns.  I have a long-standing interest in how the "art" of software is acquired and communicated, and I'm particularly intrigued by Patterns as a potential documentary and pedagogical tool.
