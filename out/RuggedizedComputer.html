        Ruggedized Computer
      </h1>
      <p>
        A computer whose physical design is sufficiently robust to survive being dropped, immersed in water, static discharge, nuclear war, use by wife and kids, etc.

      <p>
        In other words, it was designed for <a href="FaultTolerance.html">FaultTolerance</a>?

        <dd><em>No, on second thought, actually not. Ruggedness implies </em>FaultAvoidance, not <a href="FaultTolerance.html">FaultTolerance</a>. <a href="FaultTolerance.html">FaultTolerance</a> is all about detecting that a fault has occurred, and coping with it so that operations can proceed normally. Ruggedness is all about surviving harsh conditions without faulting in the first place.<em></em></dd>

        Dropping the hardware isn't really a fault though. It's more like an invalid input. (See <a href="RoofTesting.html">RoofTesting</a>.)

        <a href="FaultTolerance.html">FaultTolerance</a> implies redundancy so that a failure of any single component will not kill the system. Many so-called fault-tolerant systems only provide redundant power supplies and RAID drives. True fault-tolerance requires multiple processor boards, controller boards, etc. Banks are prime customers of fault-tolerant systems.

        A ruggedized computer, on the other hand, simply implies a higher level of robustness than the typical clone office computer. There are extremely rugged computers that are waterproof, battle proof, etc., but that is a small subset of the genre <a href="RuggedizedComputer.html">RuggedizedComputer</a>.  Enhancements include the ability to be rack mounted (19" EIA rack), more fans (with corresponding more noise), air filters, thicker steel construction, shock protection for components.
