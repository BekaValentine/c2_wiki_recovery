        The Principle Of Equivalent Commitment
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ThePrincipleOfEquivalentCommitment.html">ThePrincipleOfEquivalentCommitment</a> is a mental tool that I use in association with <a href="TheZeroPointPrinciple.html">TheZeroPointPrinciple</a>; actually an extension.  You have a certain relationship with your (Company / lover / dog / whatever) that you strive to maintain as a BalancedRelationship.  Part of this perceived balance is that you get an equivalent amount of (remuneration / love / whatever) for the (effort / love / money) that you provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the other balance you should strive for is a balance of commitment.  Is your (employer / lover / dog) giving you indications that they are making as deep a commitment to you as you are making to them?
      </p>
      <p>
        Just something to consider.
