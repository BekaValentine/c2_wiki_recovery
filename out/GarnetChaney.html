           The idea of a frontpage hosted wiki is intriguing. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The spell checker on this system is nice. Probably it should be made to understand crunched page names, and common words like "Wiki". But then again, maybe not.

        I have been playing with wikis since 2001. (And with MOO hosted virtual environments with Web interfaces since 1994). I have a wiki at [<a href="http://www.chat11.com">http://www.chat11.com</a> Chat11]. I play over at <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Garnet">http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Garnet</a> and at [<a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GarnetRChaney">http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GarnetRChaney</a> wikipedia].

        Some FPWiki bugs (or nonexistent features) that I have found:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Trying out the system.... GarnetRChaney
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I wonder why the above didn't become a link?????
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Trying again with: <a href="GarnetChaney.html">GarnetChaney</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           AHA! The system doesn't like multiple capital letters in a row squeezed together. It doesn't like something that ends in a capital like GarnetR either...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This system doesn't accept pipe link syntax, such as [[<a href="http://www.garnetchaney.com">http://www.garnetchaney.com</a>|Garnet R. Chaney]].

        [<em>Never mind all that - we need better pictures of that beautiful grey and white cat of yours!</em>]

        I agree... I sure wish I could take some more pictures of her. Katya died a couple of years ago while I was in Bulgaria. And just the other day I had to let the vet put to sleep my oldest cat, Bobo... But I still have three cats, and they are getting lots of extra attention. My favorite cat I brought back to USA from Bulgaria, her name is Monkey. You can see her here with her favorite pet from last year, <a href="http://www.garnetchaney.com/mantis2003/">http://www.garnetchaney.com/mantis2003/</a> Ms. Feng Shui. We're now waiting to see if any of Ms. Shui's egg sacks will hatch.

        OK... I've been bold and refactored these to their own pages:

        You mention Bulgaria a lot. What takes you there?
      </p>
      <p>
        I started going there in 2000, after they got things under control to the point where the mafia wasn't just grabbing people off the street. (I heard this was happening just a couple of years earlier.) I was taking a lot of computer projects there for programmers to work on. After I quit working for that employer, I went over on my own and spent a lot of time there in 2001. (That's when I first started playing with <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> software.) I mainly spent time in Sofia, but I also went a lot to Bourgas, a couple of times to Varna, and also visited the Rhodope mountains in southern Bulgaria, near the town of Devlin, which is famous for it's bottled water. I also travelled to Istanbul, and put together a photo essay of shopping at the Grand Bazaar, <a href="http://webmill.com/grand_bazaar/.">http://webmill.com/grand_bazaar/.</a> I also took a train from Sofia to the Ukraine, to visit the cities of Kiev and Kharkov.

        Garnet, it looks like <a href="GarnetsThoughtsOnPseudoScience.html">GarnetsThoughtsOnPseudoScience</a> was crossposted from another wiki. If you intend it be part of this wiki, please change it to conform to Wiki's <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>. (Improving its integration would help too -- right now, it's almost an <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>.)
