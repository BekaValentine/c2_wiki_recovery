        I'm just attempting to get a handle on this wiki, by registering a username as suggested but it looks like as if I've made a hash of it.
        I really do  like the idea of using one's own name - it certainly creates a responsibility.
        Anyway, my biggest problem is patience - orang utan attention span -
