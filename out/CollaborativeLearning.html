        Collaborative Learning

      <p>
        Collaborative learning is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches in education that involve joint intellectual effort by students or students and teachers. Groups of students work together in searching for understanding, meaning or solutions or in creating a product. The approach is closely related to cooperative learning, but is considered to be more radical because of its reliance on youth voice. Collaborative learning activities can include collaborative writing, group projects, and other activities.

        Collaborative learning has taken on many forms. One form is Collaborative Networked Learning for the self-directed adult learner.
