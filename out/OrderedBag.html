        Ordered Bag
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <em></em><a href="OrderedBag.html">OrderedBag</a><em> is a </em><a href="DataStructure.html">DataStructure</a> which combines, in many ways, the properties of both sets and lists.  It operates as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An <a href="OrderedBag.html">OrderedBag</a> contains any non-negative number of <key, value> pairs.  The keys should be immutable, we don't care about the values.  "Null" keys are of course permissible.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unlike a set (and like a bag, or <a href="MultiSet.html">MultiSet</a>), any number of elements in the <a href="OrderedBag.html">OrderedBag</a> may have the same key.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No ordering is imposed upon elements with different keys.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A <a href="TotalOrder.html">TotalOrder</a> is imposed upon elements with the same key.  This differs from the traditional definition of a <a href="MultiSet.html">MultiSet</a>, in which no order is imposed upon elements with the same key.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All sets are also valid <a href="OrderedBag.html">OrderedBag</a>s.   All lists are also ordered bags, assuming the same key (or a null key) is assigned to each element of the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This seems like a combination of map and bag and list. It is confusing.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In what way is a set an <a href="OrderedBag.html">OrderedBag</a>?  You seem to be defining technical terms in ways that are different from and incompatible with technical usage in other fields. This is only to be done with caution.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What is the difference between this definition and a bag of lists?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Why are you dumping all these technical definitions here?  What value do they add to discussions about patterns, people and software?
        </li>
      </ul>

        My personal opinion - to me an "ordered bag" is simply a essentially a list, and it is confusing to describe it as otherwise. A set is a collection where every element must be distinct. A bag is a collection which permits indistinct elements, i.e. an identical element E may occur with say 3 occurrences. Both of these are unordered (unless specified otherwise). Now an ordered bag has (1) non-uniqueness of elements (2) an ordering of elements? How is this different from a list? Thus I say that a list and an ordered bag are the same thing. The definition given above, does not make much sense to me. -- <a href="ZacharyMartin.html">ZacharyMartin</a>

        What practical use is there in having an order for identical keys but not different keys? If we have a surrogate key for identical keys, we might as well use the same mechanism for all keys rather than create condition-based look-up logic. If there is any detectable order to the keys, which is usually the case, then it's essentially a list anyhow because unique keys are have an inherit order (themselves collated) and the "ordered" duplicate keys also create a detectable order by definition.

        It seems that this was an offshoot from something called <a href="BagDiscussion.html">BagDiscussion</a> in 2005, so whoever invented this page is probably not around here now to read this. That does not invalidate any present comments, but means there may not be a response. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
