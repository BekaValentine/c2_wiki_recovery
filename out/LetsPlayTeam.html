        Lets Play Team
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem: </strong>
        Schedule pressure overpowers a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context: </strong>
        A tight schedule, uncertainty of design, uneven distribution
        of skills among developers, and new technologies put a project into
        jeopardy.TK
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces: </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Schedule is paramount; the veins in management's forehead are pulsing
        </li>
        <li>
          Tension and fear are high among team members
        </li>
        <li>
          Project is impossibly behind or wrapped around the axle
        </li>
        <li>
          Performance reviews are due prior to project completion
        </li>
        <li>
          Milestones are primarily paper exercises
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution: </strong>
        Pretend to be a team. Present a unified face through a team lead or
        spokesperson, but otherwise do not collaborate. Ensure every member has
        something to do, but that knowledge is vertical, with little communication
        among members. Assume everyone knows what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context: </strong>
        To management, the team is progressing according to schedule. Members 
        appear to be very busy, and milestones like requirements and design
        reviews are being met. Well, at least some mighty large documents have
        been produced!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        Management is not able to compromise on schedule, afford training, or 
        resolve team conflict. The team is on the hot seat to meet the schedule
        and must preserve that illusion at all costs. Perhaps individual reviews
        will fall within the project life cycle and no one wants to be identified
        with failure or delay. Perhaps management's review or bonus is dependent
        on meeting milestones in a timely manner. The team members may not be
        on civil speaking terms and interaction is painful and non-productive.
        There may be hope that either the project will get canceled in nick of time,
        or that some other effort on which the project depends will be the first
        to admit delay or failure, thus permitting the team to avoid blame for
        delay (See <a href="ScheduleChicken.html">ScheduleChicken</a> and <a href="LongPoleInTheTent.html">LongPoleInTheTent</a>). Any and all of these may justify use of this pattern, and indeed
        have.
