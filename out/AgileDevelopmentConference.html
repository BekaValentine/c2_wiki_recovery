        Agile Software Development is an emerging discipline, where there is plenty to teach, exchange and research. The objective of the <a href="AgileDevelopmentConference.html">AgileDevelopmentConference</a> is increase the amount of experiential data being presented, the cross-over communication between researchers and practitioners, and between different specialists.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The conference is designed to fit people with different experience levels and objectives: tutorials for those investigating a new area of practice, technical exchange workshops for experienced people to trade notes, experience reports, research papers, and an executive track for those reporting to upper management.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="AgileDevelopmentConference.html">AgileDevelopmentConference</a> is to be methodology-neutral, so non-XPers and XPers alike should find discussion, and it aims for both research and practice to be discussed, as well as both social and technical issues.

        <em>ADC 2003: There are positive testimonials on the conference site.  I went and my impressions are similar to the testimonials -- good mix of people, not just XP developers, but testers, PMs, execs, designers/requirements people, other agile-flavored development advocates.  Lots of authors and "thought leaders", everyone very approachable, lots of good conversations.  -- </em><a href="JeffreyMiller.html">JeffreyMiller</a><em></em>
