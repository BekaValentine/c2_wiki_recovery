        Do More With Less
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DoMoreWithLess.html">DoMoreWithLess</a> in an OO context means the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           All attributes should be private. All methods should be public or protected.
        </li>
        <li>
           If a class has more than 3 attributes, consider reducing the number of attributes by creating more classes (grouping few attributes) and adding relations among those classes.
        </li>
        <li>
           If a class has more than 10 methods, consider reducing the number of methods by moving them up in the hierarchy.
        </li>
        <li>
           When the methods can't be moved up, consider creating an intermediate class (in the inheritance relation) to hold some attributes and methods. That intermediate class should have a meaningful name so that it could be inherited by other classes.
        </li>
        <li>
           Similar methods should have similar names.
        </li>
        <li>
           When two or more classes have the same methods, create a class than has those method and make the other inherit from the new class. If inheritance is not an option, use delegation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make each class have one and only one responsibility. If a class has two responsibilities, divide it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Each method should have no more than 10 */ non-comment /* lines. Else consider creating new methods that group some lines. One liners are okay.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This will proliferate the number of classes. I think this is a minor problem if all classes are organized in a single thin and deep tree. By knowing the first 10% of the levels of the tree, you can manage the complexity of the system.

        How do you know if your ClassModel is OO? Only if your <a href="ClassDiagram.html">ClassDiagram</a> is good.
