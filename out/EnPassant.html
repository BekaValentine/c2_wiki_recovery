        A rule in the <a href="GameOfChess.html">GameOfChess</a> that allows a pawn to capture a pawn that has moved two spaces by moving into the empty square through which the captured pawn passed, but only in the move immediately following the two-space move.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term is French for "in passing".

      </code>
      <p>
        Now, $x is "Abc" and $y "Dbc" ($y was declared, assigned "Abc", and substituted upon)
