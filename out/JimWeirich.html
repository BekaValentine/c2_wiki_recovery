        I am a consultant with Compuware in the Cincinnati area. (He's recently been promoted to co-mad scientist, but I just forgot in which company. -- <a href="BorisStitnicky.html">BorisStitnicky</a>) I am interested in all things Object Oriented. I work mainly in C++ and Java, but have a strong interest in the <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a> as well.  I discovered the <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> recently and am very excited about it.  Check it out.

        Jim,

        Good to see you kibitzing on the Python pages again.  You may be interested in adding a Ruby port to the <a href="QueryStringParserTranslations.html">QueryStringParserTranslations</a> page.  Look forward to it if you do. Cheers.  -- <a href="SteveHowell.html">SteveHowell</a>

        <em>Thanks ... I don't want it to seem like I'm barging in on Python users saying "Hey, Use Ruby instead." ... That would be annoying.  But it is interesting comparing different languages.  The </em>QueryString problem looks longer ... don't know when I'll get to it. -- jw<em></em>

        Jim was one of the best debaters I ever encountered: patient, honest, detailed, articulate, asked good questions, and most important knew when things were stuck at an impasse and leaved them that way. --top  (Updated Feb. 2014)
