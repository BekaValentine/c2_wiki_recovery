        Most Extreme Is Heard Loudest
      </h1>
      <p>
        As I finished my case study sketch in <a href="OneLargeEvolutionaryAttempt.html">OneLargeEvolutionaryAttempt</a> I began to think about the reasons of the "super-manager" there in choosing <a href="WaterFall.html">WaterFall</a> to the detriment of his own project and how they fitted with the four options I've posited on Wiki, <a href="IgnoranceFearPrideOrFraud.html">IgnoranceFearPrideOrFraud</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simplifying only a little the results came out as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ignorance 25% 
        </li>
        <li>
           Fear 25%
        </li>
        <li>
           Pride 25%
        </li>
        <li>
           Fraud 25% (not just money in this case but kudos within the organisation)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As others have pointed out, you can view the "it's the only way I know how to control and I can't afford to experiment on this one" as a positive reason in many circumstances so let's add fifth 25% for that, which was certainly present too!
      </p>
      <p>
        This mix (or something better) is very common I'm sure.  But if you dare even to mention the "extreme" possibility of Fraud as a factor in commercial choices, I think people hear you as saying "it's pretty much the only factor" or "by far the most important factor".  In <a href="IgnoranceFearPrideOrFraud.html">IgnoranceFearPrideOrFraud</a> I wasn't asserting that, I was genuinely trying to ask the question of what mix people had experienced. I just couldn't possibly in good conscience have left fraud out completely.

        Here's a parallel example:
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know (and nor do you) what is going to happen as a result of Y2K system failures starting (wrong but give me some slack here) in nine days time.  The probabilities as I see it are (for illustrative purposes only):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No problem at all 25%
        </li>
        <li>
           Minor bump in the road 25%
        </li>
        <li>
           Major depression 25%
        </li>
        <li>
           TEOTWAWKI 25%
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        How come I get attacked for the gravely irresponsible paranoia of the last one but not for the laughable optimism of the first one?

        Because <a href="MostExtremeIsHeardLoudest.html">MostExtremeIsHeardLoudest</a>.

        Now perhaps I understand.
