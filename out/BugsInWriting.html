        <strong>Bugs In Writing</strong> presents 150 <em>descriptive</em>(rather than <em>prescriptive</em>) principles about debugging your writing. She presents each principle in a problem/solution format with plenty of examples. The book is lucidly written and fun too.

        I just started to read this book and I am already hooked. Any more comments on the book? -- <a href="ToddCoram.html">ToddCoram</a>

        Based on Todd's recommendation above, I picked up <a href="BugsInWriting.html">BugsInWriting</a> last week. After reading the first dozen "chapters", I heartily second his recommendation. <a href="BugsInWriting.html">BugsInWriting</a> gets at some thorny (and non-obvious) issues in technical writing in a way that is both precise and fun. It goes well beyond the "how to prepare a technical manuscript" genre, with principles that can easily be applied to much of our day-to-day written communication. -- <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>

      <p>
        Postscript: Well, make that a slightly-less-than-hearty, but still positive, recommendation. A few of the examples seem contradictory or unclear, and the author's tone occasionally borders on preachy, but <a href="BugsInWriting.html">BugsInWriting</a> has made it onto my "keep within easy reach" list.

        It's a good book in many ways, oddly split between usage examples and "how-to"s for technical writers.  My wife (a devotee of copyediting) has already found a few mistakes/misconceptions in usage recommendations (e.g. the discussion of split infinitives), but feels the book is generally sound.
      </p>

        Personally, I'd have preferred more of the "how-to" information and less usage information, but then I have my wife and her collection of usage guides as a resource.  [She will answer any usage question at a low, low price of $40/hr, or a portion of one of her favorite meals. Cajun food can be sent to:....]
