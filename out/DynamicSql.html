        Dynamic Sql
      </h1>
      <p>
        An SQL query that is defined at run-time from variable data.  For example, in PHP:
      </p>
      <code>
        <?php<br/>
        // Connect to a database named "mydb"<br/>
        $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mydb");<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Obtain a random number between 1 and 10.<br/>
        $rnum = rand(1, 10);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Create a dynamic SQL query.<br/>
        $qry = "INSERT INTO records(rnum) VALUES($rnum)";<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Execute the query.<br/>
        $result = pg_query($dbconn, $qry);<br/>
        ?><br/>
      </code>

      <p>
        Usage of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> under the hood wouldn't change your classification it appears because one is talking about the query itself and not necessarily "strings". Thus, even if using a PS with a parameterized value (the random value) where the non-value portion of the SQL is a string literal, using a randomly generated value in the <em>query</em> would make the <em>query</em> "dynamic". You seem to be conflating "dynamic strings" and "dynamic queries" in the PS topics. I don't consider "query" to be excluding values: <strong>the query is the whole shebang:</strong> statements, values, etc. Strings are an implementation detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's the query</em>'ing<strong> that's dynamic, because the specific SQL text is being defined at run-time based on variable data.  Think of it as software-generated ad-hoc(ish) SQL queries.  </strong><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> can be parameterised by passing arguments to parameters when they're executed, but a given <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> is static for at least the lifetime of the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>, and usually the lifetime of the application.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But we are talking about a "query" in an abstract sense, not how the hardware processes queries. Conceptually such a query is "dynamic" because it could have contain value 7 during one run and a value of 4 during another. How the values/literals are processed under the hood is an implementation detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could perhaps say that under typical PS usage, <strong>portions</strong> of queries are statically defined (don't change during run-time), but if some portions are static and some dynamic (values/literals, typically passed as parameters), then generally the entire query is considered "dynamic". Essentially, "static part + dynamic part = dynamic whole" in normal usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The key distinction, in comparison with </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, is this:  If you're not using <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> (i.e., you're using dynamic SQL), every time you wish to run a given query with a different value -- say a value of 7 in one run and a value of 4 during another -- you have to construct and send the whole query to the DBMS for execution.  If you're using <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, you send the query text -- including specified parameters -- to the DBMS only once for definition.  Then you can run it as many times as needed, passing to the DBMS only a reference the pre-defined <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> and the parameter argument values.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        From the application's perspective, it's still a "dynamic query". PS's are essentially caching parts, but that's an implementation detail, as caching typically is. Note that non-PS technology can also use caching or caching-like technology to avoid repeating certain steps also for queries that vary slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You may consider a </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> to be a "dynamic query" in a loose sense, and <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> may -- also in a loose sense -- be "caching parts", but there is a fundamental difference between <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and what is usually called dynamic SQL:  Dynamic SQL -- call it non-<a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, if you feel more comfortable with that name -- is executed in a single step and has no means to define parameters.  <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are defined in one step with explicit parameters and executed in another with parameter arguments.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes one talks about a "pre-compiled query" for PS's, but that's PS-specific terminology. It's perhaps a shortcut for "pre-compiled query plan", but a query plan is not necessary the same as "query" in a colloquial or general sense. The "SQL" is still dynamic if literals can vary from the app's side. Counting the literals as separate from "query" or "SQL" is either wrong or not universal (English being vague as typically used).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The terminology I've used is conventional; that doesn't necessarily make it ideal, but it is what it is.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ditto with mine. English sucks. In practice people tend to use terms <strong>relative to their concern(s)</strong> of the moment. Something would be "dynamic" relative to some point of view they are analyzing. Often one has to ask further questions to understand their intended meaning and perspective. Everything on Earth is ultimately dynamic, a meteor or nearby supernova explosion can make any source code or disk "dynamic" by turning it into fine powder or plasma. It's only "static" relative to some stated event or period. If something is dynamic or static in the low-level guts of an RDBMS, it may not matter to an application developer: it's not something they can directly "see" such that calling their in-app SQL snippets "static" or "dynamic" based on what the low-level guts do is not very useful in practice and may even be misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Be that as it may, the terms "prepared statement" and "dynamic SQL" have specific conventional meanings -- especially in relation to each other -- that are recognised by application developers.  Calling (say) a typical prepared statement "dynamic SQL" is potentially misleading.  It's certainly needlessly confusing.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not aware of that verbal association, but have not taken any formal surveys.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not sure I follow -- you mean you've not heard of a </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> being described as "dynamic SQL", or you have?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't remember ever hearing "dynamic SQL" used to describe SQL that is not associated with PS's. In other words, I've never heard it used as an alternative/contrast to "prepared statements". Typically something like "direct SQL" would be used to describe SQL passed to the database that doesn't go through PS's. Although, I will admit I never paid close attention. Your usage just "rings wrong".
      </p>

        <li>
           My googling does not bear that out at all. "Dynamic SQL" generally seems to refer to SQL statements <strong>generated</strong> (in part) <strong>by software</strong> instead of hand coded by programmers. For example, the criteria (WHERE...) and column-selection (SELECT...) clauses generated by <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a>. One won't know those clauses at software authoring time and thus will not be hand-coding the criteria clauses up front. This software-generated usage is pretty clear from my googling. That fact that you "saw" results that were highly PS-related is yet more confirmation that you hallucinate to <strong>see what you want to</strong> in order to protect your ego from being wrong. You've been caught with your objectivity down again. You are highly biased. Whether or not that's an <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> attack, it's my honest assessment of your personality (and a very common human flaw in general). And if you think I'm wrong, we'll <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> whose hallucinations are correct.

           <em>Curiously, we seem to be in </em><a href="ViolentAgreement.html">ViolentAgreement</a> about what <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> is.  All the <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> examples on this page and on the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> and <a href="ValidatingPreparedStatementDefinitions.html">ValidatingPreparedStatementDefinitions</a> pages are precisely what you described: "SQL statements generated (in part) by software instead of hand coded by programmers."  That's exactly what <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> is.  Note, however, that the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> examples are all static.

           You seem to be extrapolating a very specific and narrow example to PS's in general. I'm talking generalities in this topic. One can use PS's with <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a>, for example, and have the statements generated dynamically by the software at run-time based on user-given selections and input. (It's expected that the "values" will be given through the value-intended portions of PS API's.)

           <em>Yes, you can dynamically construct </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions from a subset of a collection of static strings.  However, by convention, such constructs are not called <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>.

           Note that many may know how to use PS's to get their work done, but may not know or care how they work under the hood. They are just told to use them and find examples showing how to use them, not giving much care about the deep guts. Most developers I encounter are not deep thinkers: they focus on making their customers and boss happy and getting paid.  If the shop tells them to use purple gerbils to process queries and they are paid to use purple gerbils, they will use purple gerbils.

           Bullshit! The API's are almost entirely an arbitrary interface design choice. I will agree that people tend to use them "out of the box" as-is, but that's not an <em>inherent</em> difference, but rather a human preference of a developer/manager/shop.

           <em>The SQL definitions are the same, independent of APIs (i.e., it doesn't matter whether you're using JDBC, ODBC, some native interface, Perl DBI, PHP PDO, </em>PostgreSQL's libpq, etc.) because it's about creating SQL.  <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> are different <strong>in (and exposed by) the DBMS</strong>.<em></em>

           Above you said, "There's no mention here of how <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> "work under hood"...", but NOW you are talking about under the hood ("in...the DBMS"). It appears to be a contradiction to me. The API's typically used by developers generally don't expose the under-the-hood processing difference between traditional processing and PS processing: by adjusting the API's, they <strong>can be swapped</strong> without a developer noticing the difference (under normal circumstances, performance profiles aside). Thus, DYNAMIC-NESS, AS TYPICALLY PERCEIVED BY DEVELOPERS, IS NOT DETECTABLE BY LOOKING AT QUERY-RELATED API'S AND THEIR RESULTS alone (tradition and habit patterns aside).

I.e., the query definition does not change, only the parameter values change.  It's similar to how a function definition can be static, but the parameter arguments it's passed on invocation can change.  <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> requires that the SQL itself changes, which is why it's called "dynamic SQL".  Using the same analogy, it's like writing and compiling a block of code every time some value in it needs to change.<em> </em>

        Okay, I won't challenge that observation of google results. But the fact remains that there is <em>no</em> universal term for SQL that is not processed through PS mechanisms. Nobody has established that "Dynamic Sql" is the hands-down favorite; and per above, strongly leans toward meaning software-generated SQL (which is orthogonal to PS usage).

      <p>
        Yes, it's a query API (middle-ware) design choice. PS's and filters can each use the other "style" if API's are so adjusted. Other than perhaps naming "hints", it tells us nothing concrete about the "guts" of SQL processing or whether program-constructed SQL is ultimately used by PS's somewhere along the line.

And if you do understand the difference between <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and immediate SQL / <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> / executing SQL statements directly, why did you write above that the differences between <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> are "not clear to me".<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your writing is not clear to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You're relying </em>'only<strong> on my writing about </strong><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> in order to understand the differences between them?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, I'm trying to figure out what the fucking hell you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you can't understand the difference between </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>, the problem isn't my writing.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not certain what YOU mean by both those terms. I thought I did early, but peculiar responses by you suggests I got it wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What responses of mine do you think are "peculiar"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd have to empty a new highlighter answering that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's evasive, and borders on being an </em><a href="AdhominemAttack.html">AdhominemAttack</a>.  It suggests that you have no rational answer to my question.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I understand the difference perfectly well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's not the question here.  What responses of mine do you think are "peculiar"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not feel it would help anything to answer that. All instances I checked already indicate problems with the text in replies. It would only create redundancy to duplicate that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think the problem lies entirely with your understanding, not the replies themselves.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You are welcome to your own screwy opinion on that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Again, this is bordering on being an </em><a href="AdhominemAttack.html">AdhominemAttack</a> without offering any new information, evidence, or rhetoric.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Accusing somebody of "not understanding" can also be an <a href="AdhominemAttack.html">AdhominemAttack</a>, AND too general to be useful. It looks like hypocrisy to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If the problem appears to lie entirely with your understanding, then I can only say that the problem lies entirely with your understanding.  That's not an </em><a href="AdhominemAttack.html">AdhominemAttack</a> but an assessment of the situation.  If I said I thought your lack of understanding is because you're an idiot (which I'm not saying, by the way), <strong>that</strong> would be an <a href="AdhominemAttack.html">AdhominemAttack</a>.  You're right that identifying a lack of understanding is too general to be useful, but at this point I'm not sure what would be useful because you seem unwilling to tell me what responses of mine you think are "peculiar".  I am left wondering if that was merely a spurious insult.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If it doesn't convey new and use-able information it probably should be skipped because it's usually considered un-friendly and is often frustrating because it cannot be processed further.
