           The term "Mickey Mouse" can describe Toy code, or unnecessary rules, or anything unsophisticated.
        </li>

           This term is used as a euphemism for any cheap, cheesy, low-budget problem solution. The term has very common usage in the USA. (<a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>)

        <strong>Mickey Mouse used as a pejorative adjective</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the term Mickey Mouse as a pejorative usually implies a stunning lack of insight into the problem domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is used as an adjective or a noun in apposition.</em>

        So, Mickey Mouse was arrested for beating his wife, Minnie.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the trial the judge said, "Now Mickey, I understand that
        you said Minnie was acting very silly recently. But surely that doesn't
        give you the right to hit her."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But your honor", said Mickey "I didn't say she was acting
        silly - I said she was f---ing Goofy!".
