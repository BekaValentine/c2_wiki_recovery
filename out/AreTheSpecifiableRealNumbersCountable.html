        Are The Specifiable Real Numbers Countable
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'll assume this definition of specifiable:
      </p>
      <p>
        A real number is specifiable if it can be written in a finite sequence of symbols from a finite alphabet.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that's the definition you're thinking of, then the answer to your question is <em>yes</em>, since the set of finite sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet is countable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That is not necessarily true for an infinite sequence. See </em><a href="GeorgCantor.html">GeorgCantor</a>'s diagonalization argument (<a href="CantorsProof.html">CantorsProof</a>).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the specifiable real numbers are <em>not</em> a subset of the rational numbers. For example, the definition
      </p>
      <p>
        x = square root (2)
      </p>
      <p>
        uniquely specifies an irrational number using a finite sequence of symbols from a finite alphabet.
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="AreTheSpecifiableRealsWellDefined.html">AreTheSpecifiableRealsWellDefined</a>, though - it's not clear the above is a coherent definition. In fact, it depends on whether the "language" in which the numbers are specified is well-defined - i.e. whether each sequence of symbols maps unambiguously to a real number.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There are numerous interesting (and countable) subsets of the reals (which of course are not countable).
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The integers
        </li>
        <li>
           The rationals
        </li>
        <li>
           The "constructable" numbers -- expressible as a finite sequence of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and Pythagorean sum (sqrt (a*2 + b*2)) -- essentially, those numbers whose magnitude can be computed with compass and straightedge (see SquaringTheCircle)
        </li>
        <li>
           The "simple algebraic" numbers -- expressible as a finite sequence of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and integer root extraction (square root, cube root, etc.). All roots of polynomials of degree 4 or lower are in this category; higher-order polynomials may have roots which are not so expressible.
        </li>
        <li>
           The algebraic numbers.
        </li>
      </ul>
