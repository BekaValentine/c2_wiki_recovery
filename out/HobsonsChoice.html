        Hobsons Choice
      </h1>
      <p>
        Colloquial English phrase for a choice that is not a choice - either there is only one option, or two options that are equally undesirable or virtually identical...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is this the same thing as a </em>CatchTwentyTwo?<em></em>
        No.  CatchTwentyTwo is when both (or all) choices are contradictory.  You have to be crazy to want to fly a mission, so you're grounded.  But if you are scared, you're sane, so you are required to fly.

        Tobias Hobson (c. 1544-1631) was a Cambridge stable manager who let (rented) horses. He insisted customers take the horse in the stall closest to the door (the next one up) or take none at all. Hence, a Hobson's choice is no choice at all. He was made famous by Milton. The phrase dates to 1660.

        <em>Is this similar to being on the Horns of a Dilemma?</em>

      <p>
        <a href="MortonsFork.html">MortonsFork</a> is an example of being on the Horns of a dilemma - it's where you do have a choice, but each leads to you losing.
