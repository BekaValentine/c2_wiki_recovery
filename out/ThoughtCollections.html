        This page is intended as a voluntary writing page, as in poetry, rhyme, short stories, and random discussion. Please contribute, and if you intend to be critical, this is not your page. I (nor any other contributors, hopefully) do not claim to be an artist of any sort, I just recognize the benefit of free flowing thought. So, enjoy!

        Along for the ride<br/>
        too late to sleep now<br/>
        rough night, avoid a fight<br/>
        found a friend in which to confide.<br/>

        Outstretched arms<br/>
        tainted materialistic love<br/>
        can't believe<br/>
        the soft sweet everything<br/>
        and everything <br/>

        Opened eyes<br/>
        inward glance<br/>
        past faults colliding<br/>
        with present lies<br/>
        culminates in future regret<br/>
        self compromise.<br/>

        Too late<br/>
        - far too late, to sleep now<br/>
        awake all night<br/>
        awake in deep sleep<br/>
        dreams disintegrate with broken ideals<br/>
        hard to determine<br/>
        hard to agree<br/>
        hard to consider<br/>
        hard to keep consistent<br/>
        my idea, what is right<br/>

        the world, without filters
        ~ no words...
        awake in deep sleep; 
        finding balance ~ strength, love ~~
        easy to determine...easy to keep
        ...hard to find ? .... the important is inivisible to the eye...
