        I am currently employed as a software engineer at Autodesk. I have been developing CAD and CAE software professionally at both the core and applications levels since 1988. In the four years previous to this (1984-1987), I designed printed circuit boards for custom realtime systems.

        I am also a licensed massage therapist. I am interested in putting technology to work for something other than (or in addition to) the profit motive. Grassroots healthcare education is where I think technology could be leveraged to raise the quality of life baseline for many. I have envisioned a collaborative learning game which I currently call Our Universal Free School of Healing Arts (<a href="OufshaHome.html">OufshaHome</a>). It relies on a learning technology backbone called <a href="ExtremeMeme.html">ExtremeMeme</a>. I recently wrote a personal narrative of how I came to this vision called A <a href="BetterGame.html">BetterGame</a>. If any of this sounds interesting (positive) or infuriating (negative), I would love to hear your comments. Feedback is the easiest way to participate in the game. If you want to take on something more challenging, I have lots of ideas for deep participation.

        <em>A couple of suggestions:</em> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Try refactoring the pages you've written. They're </em>'MUCH<strong> longer than an accessible wiki page ought to be. In fact they're longer than my browser (Internet Exploiter under </strong><a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>) can edit. As is, they might make better standalone web pages than communally owned wiki pages.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Is there any hard limit on how long is too long for a wiki page?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Try placing your pages in context. It's difficult to see just where they connect to other wiki material here. Obviously they're in </em><a href="EasternWuss.html">EasternWuss</a> land, but you could spend quite some time profitably exploring possible connections all over <a href="WikiDom.html">WikiDom</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Try explicitly identifying your intent with these pages. Are you solving a problem, sharing your experience, or proselytizing? If all three, try to make clear which is which.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Try to avoid autobiographical exposition. Your experience can be recast in a form accessible to communal editing. Doing this will probably reveal considerable implications you haven't thought of yet.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Re page size, see </em><a href="TooBigToEdit.html">TooBigToEdit</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>

        In <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExplained.html">ExtremeProgrammingExplained</a>, <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> tells a personal story about learning to drive with his mother. Would you call him an <a href="EasternWuss.html">EasternWuss</a> because he uses this personal experience (Metaphor) to illustrate the general shape of the solution? 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Oh heck yes. Kent's almost as much of an </em><a href="EasternWuss.html">EasternWuss</a> as I am. Check out chapter 2 of <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExamined.html">ExtremeProgrammingExamined</a> if you don't believe that.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a <a href="BetterGame.html">BetterGame</a>, I use personal narrative to bridge the gap between a potential end user community (Oufsha students) and, hopefully, everyone that would want to participate along the entire value chain (open software developers, content authors, curriculum designers, class facilitators, etc). I describe the general shape of both the problem and a potential solution. Some related topics discussed on this site includes <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a>, <a href="CategoryOpenSource.html">CategoryOpenSource</a>, <a href="EducationOnComputers.html">EducationOnComputers</a>, <a href="EducationalGames.html">EducationalGames</a>, <a href="EducationalTechniques.html">EducationalTechniques</a>, and <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Um, yeah, but XPExplained is a </em>'book<em>', not a wiki page. When Kent has participated here, his contributions have observed the form scrupulously. Including all his work on the XP pages here.</em>
      </p>

        Perhaps I should be setting up my own Oufsha wiki. I thought maybe some members of this community would be interested in my ideas. I will try to trim it down. In <a href="ExtremeMeme.html">ExtremeMeme</a>, I am attempting to describe user stories for the technology backbone of Oufsha. I intend to describe a sample implementation. It is my hope that I could find some developers who want to play the Oufsha game by helping me implement the <a href="ExtremeMeme.html">ExtremeMeme</a> technology. I think this wiki is the most appropriate site to ask for help and feedback on my ideas. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, I think it is too. Only talking about form, not substance.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for your feedback. I will try to refactor. However, more concrete questions about the specific bits of content might help me think more clearly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you make your content accessible, they will come.</em>
