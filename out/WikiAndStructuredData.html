        Wiki And Structured Data
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am working on a wiki that supports XmL as a native storage, not to handle <a href="WikiFormat.html">WikiFormat</a>, but to bring JustEnoughStructure to a wiki page. Each page can have an arbitrary set of tags which help to organize the text in a nice way. Inside each text block, <a href="WikiFormat.html">WikiFormat</a> can be applied as usual. --

        Any plans to incorporate xml?

        I can see where some light XML might be useful, not just on the back end
        (heck, it could be there already), but on the front end, as well:  sections of pages could be marked "<a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>", while others could be marked "<a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>".  Then users could search for <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> pages, or combined-mode pages, or whatever.  --<a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>

        <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> offers some XML features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All titles in the wiki as an XML document: <a href="http://moin.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin/moin?action=titleindex&mimetype=text/xml">http://moin.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin/moin?action=titleindex&mimetype=text/xml</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           XML pages and XSLT pages, where the first can reference to the second via the <?xml-stylesheet?> PI: <a href="http://moin.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin/moin/J_fcrgenHermannLinks">http://moin.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin/moin/J_fcrgenHermannLinks</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Wiki pages converted to XML format: <em>not fully implemented yet</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        XML allows a much more powerful markup language than our current "----", tab, and multiple-single-quote conventions.
        But, it would require users to quote characters in entered text, like "&lt;".
        This would be annoying and error prone.

        I've been thinking of <a href="WikiAndStructuredData.html">WikiAndStructuredData</a>, in that the Wiki "philosophy" is incompatible with structured data:
        It works best with free-form data, interpreted by humans.
        Witness the loss of the <a href="EditLinks.html">EditLinks</a> feature; by far the most structured data that <em>used to exist</em> on this Wiki.

        I think a lot about integrating wiki with a KnowledgeBase and StructuredData. I like to have the possibility to include data from a database or have different sections in pages like 'links' or 'see also'. The items of these sections could be shared by different pages, this means some external links belong to several pages (ie);   '...it would require users to quote characters in entered text,...' - Not imperatively: ZWiki uses different page types (stx, +html, +dtml, text+links only etc.), each page can be defined to have these tags rendered or not. (My notes about this are on <a href="NooWiki.html">NooWiki</a>:WikiAndStructuredKnowledge) --<a href="FlorianKonnertz.html">FlorianKonnertz</a>, 11-25

        - What you are describing wouldn't be too difficult to build in Zope.  Some of the slots on a page could be <a href="ZwiKi.html">ZwiKi</a> objects, and you could also use other editable object types available in Zope or build your own.  Would require a little Python along with ZPT or DTML --<a href="DougTruitt.html">DougTruitt</a>
