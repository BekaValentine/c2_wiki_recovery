        Sherlock Holmes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Fictional detective from the writings of Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle, set during the end of the 19th century. Probably most famous for the saying "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."

        Holmes' approach to solving crimes was to pay attention to every detail of the situation (usually finding things significant which had been dismissed as unimportant by other people). He had a vast background knowledge of things related to his work, but disdained knowledge for its own sake.

        He was a master of disguise, an accomplished violinist, and suffered from depression. He lived at 221b Baker Street (in London, England) sometimes alone, and sometimes with his partner in adventure Dr. Watson. He fought his depression with cocaine, of which Dr. Watson strongly disapproved.

        After a long career of foiling crime, he retired to the Sussex Downs to keep bees.
