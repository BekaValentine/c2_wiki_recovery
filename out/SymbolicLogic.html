        Symbolic Logic
      </h1>
      <p>
        The basic symbols are "(", ")", and "->" (or "<img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/rarr.gif" />"), and the "letters" "a", "a´", "a´´", etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        A finite concatenation of these symbols is called a "formula", but we will be interested here only in certain "well-formed formulae" ("wff"s).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Definitions</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Any letter is a wff.
        </li>
        <li>
           If "p" and "q" are wffs, "(p->q)" is also a wff.
        </li>
        <li>
           If "p" and "q" are wffs, "(p->(q->p))" is a theorem.
        </li>
        <li>
           If "p", "q" and "r" are wffs, "((p->q)->((p->(q->r))->(p->r)))" is a theorem.
        </li>
        <li>
           If "p" and "(p->q)" are theorems and "q" is a wff, "q" is also a theorem. This rule is known as <em>modus ponens</em>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Exercises</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        a. Show that if "p" is a wff, "(p->p)" is a theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. Suggest a definition of "proof".
      </p>
      <p>
        Readers are invited to give their answers below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>a. Premise is true by (1), since "p" is a letter. Conclusion is trivially true by (2) and trivial replacement of "q" by "p".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, that only shows that "(p->p)" is a wff. Wff's apparently superset theorems. [That is, not all wffs are theorems.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>b. "Proof" is a chain of any number of applications of the axioms to any valid initial wff.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is neither satisfactory nor clear - it seems to insist there is an initial wff, uses the undefined term "valid", and is vague as to what "any number of applications of the axioms" means.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Naw...</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is an initial wff, yes; you have to apply the axioms to something. Notice that each member of "the set of letters" is an initial wff, in the above.
        </li>
        <li>
           "Valid" did not intend to introduce an undefined term, it meant "whatever the system at hand <strong>says</strong> is a starting point"
        </li>
        <li>
           What is so unclear about "any number"? It means zero or more.
        </li>
        <li>
           See SemiThueGrammars if this entire approach is puzzling you. Fully formal proofs are equivalent to string rewriting systems. E.g. the Peters-Ritchie result.
        </li>

        <em>Definition of "proof"</em>. A proof is a sequence of theorems each of which may be seen to be a theorem by an application of one of the definitions above where, for an application of #5, the theorems there denoted "p" and "(p->q)" both appear earlier in the sequence. It may be said to be a proof <em>of</em> the last theorem in the sequence; it may readily be converted into a proof (in the usual informal sense) <em>that</em> the last theorem in the sequence really is a theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        [That is excellent - the only change I would make is to require the sequence to be finite.]
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be better, for some purposes, to define a proof to be a sequence of <theorem,annotation> pairs, where the annotations indicate which definitions are being applied, what wffs have been used in place of their metasyntactic variables, and (for applications of #5) which earlier theorems are being used. This makes no difference to whether any given wff has a proof.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Good point. Such a sequence can be called an annotated proof.]

        [Almost 100%. I corrected a couple of bracketing slips in the second step.]

The only reason why I didn't say "finite sequence" is that I was careless, by the way.<em></em>

        If "L" is some list of (starting) wffs, we now extend the above definition to allow any wff in L to appear, and call the resulting sequence a proof from L. An annotated proof from L is defined as you would expect. Each wff, "p", in such a sequence is termed a theorem from L,and we write "L <img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/turnstil.gif" /> p".
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that when this notation is used, the fifth rule above is subtly amended so that "theorems" and "theorem" become "theorems from L" and "theorem from L".
      </p>
      <p>
        "<img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/turnstil.gif" />" <em>is "Single Turnstile" </em>LaTeX \vdash. It means "p is derivable from L".<em> We sometimes use "</em><img src="http://w3.rz-berlin.mpg.de/~wm/SYM/dashv.gif" /> <img src="http://w3.rz-berlin.mpg.de/~wm/SYM/vdash.gif" />" for mutual derivability.

      </p>
      <p>
        The next exercise is to show that if L,p <img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/turnstil.gif" /> q (where L is a list of wffs, and "p" and "q" are wffs), L <img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/turnstil.gif" /> (p->q).

      <p>
        The next stage is to introduce symbols for "and", "or" and "not". This will give us the "propositional calculus" (whereas we were previously developing the "implication calculus").
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Specifics please? For instance in ISBN 0-486-26404-1 (page 12), "~" and "^" are taken as axiomatic, a v b is defined as ~(~a ^ ~b), (a -> b) is defined as ~(a ^ ~b). What makes one axiomization "better" than the other and in the one above, how would "and" and "or" be introduced?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, various goodies, including "exists" and "forall", can be introduced to obtain the much more powerful "predicate calculus".
      </p>
      <p>
        The word "better" isn't really appropriate in this context. [There is no hard and fast rule as to which theorems are chosen as axioms.] You can go for (1) as few concepts as possible (so using just implication is nice), or (2) as few axioms and rules of inference as possible (in which case, there are other formalizations of the propositional calculus that use fewer), or (3) as intuitive and easy to find proofs in as possible (in which case you'd want to take "and", "or", "not", etc, as primitive and have lots of axioms and inference rules).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can't define "and", "or" and "not" in terms of implication alone, but given implication and any one of them you can define the others. So we'll need at least one new axiom when moving from the "implication calculus" to the "propositional calculus". Another thing we could add instead of "and", "or" or "not" is "false".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Thanks. Would be grateful to have the new axiom added (say, with "and") together with the definition of the others in terms of it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no great advantage in minimizing the number of axioms. We introduce the symbols "<img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/and.gif" />", "<img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/or.gif" />" and "~", which may be pronounced "and", "or" and "not", respectively. (Elsewhere, the symbol "<img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/not.gif" />" is often used for "not".) The axioms are augmented to involve these as shown below.

        [Thanks again. I had briefly looked at that site, but hadn't realized how useful it is. However, it seems to use a slightly different set of axioms.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [The initial axioms have been rewritten using the "<img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/turnstil.gif" />" notation.]
      </p>
      <p>
        My understanding of "|- S" is as an abbreviation for "{} |- S" where curly brackets are the usual set notation (a theorem is a statement derivable from the empty set). In either case are "|-","," "{",and "}" metasymbols or are they part of the calculus itself? Sorry to be so picky but would be grateful for the clarification.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the "<img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/turnstil.gif" />" is the leading character, it is understood to be preceded by an empty list (rather than set), so no punctuation is needed. Sets are not defined yet (wait for the predicate calculus). The "<img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/turnstil.gif" />" is a metasymbol. Commas and spaces are currently being used as punctuation for clarity. There's not really any difference between saying that and saying they are metasymbols. In contrast, the symbols (such as "{" and "}") needed for set theory are formally added to the (predicate) calculus when we come to introduce set theory.

        <em>The proof for a slightly different problem than the one above is given below in the format I am more familiar with (</em>NaturalDeduction or ND). It would be interesting to compare the proof using 1-5 + others above to see if it is longer or shorter, and number of parentheses. Also how do Assumptions ("A") and Hypotheses (indenting with "|") map to a proof of the same using axioms 1-5 + others (perhaps they could be numbered also?). I can elaborate as to what "vI","~E" etc mean but here I am just comparing forms of derivation.<em></em>

        Here is an example of an annotated proof - it derives a rule which can be helpful in deriving further results.

        An interesting paper on the historic development of <a href="SymbolicLogic.html">SymbolicLogic</a> (especially as it relates to programs) is at <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/frege/frege.pdf.">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/frege/frege.pdf.</a> It can be seen that the formulation at the top of this page is essentially the same as Frege's (1879), which was generalized by Gentzen (1934) by his system of "Natural Deduction" which uses introduction and elimination rules for connectives. He also created an alternative formulation called the SequentCalculus. The <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a> of <a href="AlonzoChurch.html">AlonzoChurch</a> (1932) was shown to correspond to Natural Deduction by W.A. Howard (1969) by the CurryHowardCorrespondence.

        The following <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> code simulates the solution to problem (a) above. It does not search for a solution (though this could be added) but executes the steps specified by the p_a rule at the program start. This calls predicate s(-LineNumber,-Justification,-RuleAndVariables,+Result) and passes each result to the next line. This predicate calls a() which holds each axiom. These axioms do build a structure based on the RuleAndVariables so it helps the user experiment with different axioms and results from previous steps. The output (run in SWI-Prolog) is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           p->q->p                         just([X],rule(#3))
        </li>
        <li>
           (p->q->p)->(p->(q->p)->p)->p->p just([X],rule(#4))
        </li>
        <li>
           (p-> (q->p)->p)->p->p           just([1,2],rule(#5))
        </li>
        <li>
           p->(q->p)->p                    just([X],rule(#3))
        </li>
        <li>
           p->p                            just([4,3],rule(#5))
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        just() is the justification (annotation) and prolog does some simplification of parentheses automatically based on associativity so it is not exactly the same as the answer at the top of page. If nothing else it shows one way of representing such axioms in a programming language.

        A wff A is a Tautology if and only if A is assigned T for every truth assignment of it's variables. Written as |= A. If W is a set of wffs, W |= A if every truth assignment that satisfies W also satisfies A. For both Axiomic and Natural Deduction (ND) systems they are said to be <em>Sound</em> and <em>Complete</em> if the following can be proved:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Soundness:</em> If W <img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/turnstil.gif" /> A then W |= A

        <li>

        (Nice symmetry, eh?) The axioms 1-13 above can be shown to satisfy both properties. Note "axiom" #5 is really a "Rule of Inference" also known as Modus Ponens (MP) and sometimes written as
