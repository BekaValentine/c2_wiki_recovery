        The Jtrix Project
      </h1>
      <p>
        Jtrix is an Open Source, reliable, uniformly dynamic, virtual general purpose computing platform which aggregates administratively heterogeneous resources from many sources on the Internet. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The applications will run on this platform, and use resources which may be discovered and connected dynamically. The applications will be able to adapt themselves to the changing structure of this platform, and adapt their own deployment and composition to the changing requirements placed on them by their users, or by other applications which in turn rely on them to provide resources.

        Jtrix provides a foundation by which many basic technologies may be packaged as components and more freely reused by end user applications. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Aspects such as final deployment and application administration may be packaged. Jtrix works at a lower level than content management applications, so resources may be shared between applications built using different enabling technologies.

        Will this technology prove to be widely acceptable? We will have to wait and see.
