        Refactoring Equals Reparametrization
      </h1>
      <p>
        An allusion to local minima in the software development at the page about <a href="NanoIncrements.html">NanoIncrements</a> made me think about the parallels between optimization algorithms and <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An objection against <a href="NanoIncrements.html">NanoIncrements</a> is that a series of small perturbations in the direction of what seem to be the best direction cannot lead to an optimal system unless the initial design is almost perfect. At some point, the system will appear to be in a local optimum such that we 'must' do a more profound change to the design in order to be able to continue to improve the system by <a href="NanoIncrements.html">NanoIncrements</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the shape of an objective function is given by the parametrization of the solution space. Remember how the logarithmic curve became linear on a logarithmic paper? Similarly the bimodal function y = (x^2 - 1) would become unimodal with the parametric shift t = x^2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <a href="SoftwareHasNoShape.html">SoftwareHasNoShape</a> SoftwareHasNoMetric either, and we can choose the metric as we go. Every time we see a local optimum coming up, we can do a <a href="NanoRefactorization.html">NanoRefactorization</a>, and then continue the walk against the next optimum using <a href="NanoIncrements.html">NanoIncrements</a>. If there's a global optimum it may eventually be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core of several global optimization algorithms work exactly this way:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Walk in the direction of the steepest descent
        </li>
        <li>
           Reparametrize
        </li>
        <li>
           Go to 1
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        [Or nature's analog:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Survival of the fittest
        </li>
        <li>
           Mutate
        </li>
        <li>
           Go to 1.]
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The reparametrization is often the most expensive operation in the procedure, just as it is in software. (A more interesting issue is that the solution the software tries to solve changes over time, which is less common in optimization theory.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So maybe <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> can be formulated analogously as:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <a href="NanoIncrements.html">NanoIncrements</a> + <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s (to go up and prevent slipping backwards)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="NanoRefactorization.html">NanoRefactorization</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Go to 1
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Even if the analogy suggests that it's feasible that <a href="NanoIncrements.html">NanoIncrements</a> and Refactorizations can lead to the global optimum for software, it doesn't suggest that it's faster. As in an optimization problem, iterating from a hopeless starting point can be much slower than carefully seeking (or even randomly drawing!) the best starting point and iterating from there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, well, some people like to say that everything (even life) is an instance of some optimization problem, so that software development fits into that paradigm too can hardly be surprising.
        But anyway...

        There's a very important weakness in drawing an analogy between optimization strategies as computers understand them, and refactoring as a way of getting where you need to be: there's a human driving the refactoring process, deciding what to refactor and how to do so. Just as a computer optimization can be greatly improved by having a human watching and directing, the software project benefits from having brains driving the refactoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, refactoring isn't the only way one discovers optimizations. When a bottleneck (performance or logical) is discovered, the developers think about it and figure out what to try. Then they experiment, then they plug the new implementation into the old system using polymorphism and the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s to be sure it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        My summary position would be that analogies between global optimization theory and human optimization activity are seriously suspect, and conclusions drawn, if any, need intense scrutiny. That is, they're probably wrong. ;-> -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        I tried to carefully avoid drawing any conclusions, just drawing the analogy. So any conclusions must of course be your own. -- <a href="TomHoulder.html">TomHoulder</a> <em>Oh yes. And like most of my conclusions, they're probably wrong. -- R</em>

        I just have to say that while the optimization analogy is suspect, <a href="GroupThink.html">GroupThink</a> and an unconscious inertia could lead a group to feel that their local minimum is optimal. What do I mean by unconscious inertia? Just the things that you would never think of because you are too close to them and they would be too painful.. like switching metaphors in mid-development. Especially when you not only have to change your classes but also your <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. It is a hit x 2. -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>
