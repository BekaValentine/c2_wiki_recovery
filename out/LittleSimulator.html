        All programs are simulators of sorts. However, the degree to which a program must model the world is really brought home in a discrete event simulator. Everyone should write a few of these sometime in their career. Here is the pseudocode for one. 
      </p>
      <code>
        variable time is initially 0.<br/>
        variable events is sorted list initially just startEvent.<br/>
        while events remain<br/>
        remove nearest event from events list.<br/>
        set time to its time.<br/>
        call its handler.<br/>
        ...<br/>
        variable model is as required.<br/>
        startEvent handler.<br/>
        adjust model as appropriate.<br/>
        add future event(s) to events list.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The model for an elevator simulator would have data structures for people, floors and elevators. A random number generator would probably be used to select destination floors for random visits. The output could be simply the list of events that took place, or it could be an animation from one or more points of view.

        For a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> we will need the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1 elevator
        </li>
        <li>
           1 person
        </li>
        <li>
           2 floors
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        Elevator1 can initialize to Floor1<br/>
        Person1 starts on Floor1<br/>
        Person1 requests elevator (pushes button)<br/>
        Elevator1 opens<br/>
        Person1 enters Elevator1 (exits Floor1)<br/>
        Elevator1 travels to Floor2<br/>
        Elevator1 opens<br/>
        Person1 exits Elevator1 (enters Floor2)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Is there anything else?
      </p>
      <p>
        Does <a href="LittleSimulatorInJava.html">LittleSimulatorInJava</a> satisfy the <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>? Please ignore the lack of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. -- <a href="EricHerman.html">EricHerman</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        What I'm wanting to know is, where is the event list and the events? -- <a href="JohnClonts.html">JohnClonts</a> ( see top of page)
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> in <a href="LittleSimulator.html">LittleSimulator</a> does not call for an event <em>list</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We need a second test, using a second person. Now the event list must be implemented.
      </p>
      <code>
        Person1 starts on Floor1<br/>
        Person2 starts on Floor2<br/>
        Person1 to request elevator in 9 seconds<br/>
        Person2 to request elevator in 6 seconds<br/>
        Remove nearest event which is request elevator for Person2 in 6 seconds.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        how can <a href="LittleSimulatorInJava.html">LittleSimulatorInJava</a> be refactored to satisfy the requirements of the new test?
      </p>

        Event lists and object models are one approach to simulation. A <a href="CocoaWorld.html">CocoaWorld</a> offers an interesting alternative. Cocoa is an internet programming language from Apple research. It's Java for kids. It is like the <a href="GameOfLife.html">GameOfLife</a> on steroids.
