        Hearing a disturbance, the master programmer went into the novice's cubicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Curse these personal computers!" cried the novice in anger, 
        "To make them do anything I must use three or even four editing programs.
        Sometimes I get so confused that I erase entire files.  
        This is truly intolerable!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The master programmer stared at the novice.
        "And what would you do to remedy this state of affairs?" he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The novice thought for a moment.  "I will design a new editing program,"
        he said, "a program that will replace all these others."
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly the master struck the novice on the side of his head.
        It was not a heavy blow, but the novice was nonetheless surprised.
        "What did you do that for?" exclaimed the novice.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have no wish to learn another editing program," said the master.
      </p>
      <p>
        And suddenly the novice was enlightened.
