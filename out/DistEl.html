        Distel is a fairly fancy Erlang IDE implemented in Emacs. Homepage at <a href="http://www.bluetail.com/~luke/.">http://www.bluetail.com/~luke/.</a> This is a BragAboutMyFunHack page :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        The name comes from "Distributed Emacs Lisp." Distel's core is an extension of <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> to support a large subset of the Erlang programming model: processes, pattern matching, and distribution. This makes Emacs act as an Erlang node, participating in distributed message-passing with real Erlang nodes, which makes it very easy and natural for Erlang and <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> programs to interact. Since <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> is, like other Lisps, a ProgrammableProgrammingLanguage, the Erlang-like language extensions are implemented simply with Lisp functions and macros.
      </p>
      <p>
        This core makes it easy to write <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> programs that talk with Erlang nodes, and we've implemented an <a href="IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.html">IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment</a> in this way. The current features, mostly based on Emacs's amazing facilities for developing <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> programs, are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Finding function definitions</strong>. This lets you jump from a function call in a source file to the definition of the function being called. It is very similar to the Emacs <em>TAGS</em> feature, but doesn't required a TAGS file. To find the source, it uses the "reflective" capabilities of an Erlang node to find out where a function is implemented.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Completion of module and function names</strong>. Type a partial module or function name, press <em>M-TAB</em>, and it will be completed (if unique), or a list of possible completions will be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Code evaluation</strong>. You can enter an Erlang expression from the minibuffer, have it evaluated on an Erlang node, and see the result.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Online Documentation</strong>. Distel quickly builds and caches a heuristic database of documentation for all Erlang functions. You can query this database with Elisp-style <em>describe</em> and <em>apropos</em> commands.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Refactoring</strong>. Distel has one refactoring command that takes an expression inside a function and refactors it as a sub-function. The argument list is automatically generated by analysing the expression to see which variables become free.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Process manager</strong>. Shows a 'top'-style listing of all Erlang processes running in a particular node, and lets you inspect, trace, or kill them.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Debugger</strong>. Lets you turn on debugging for particular modules and set breakpoints from regular Emacs source buffers. Also supports single-stepping particular debugged Erlang processes from Emacs.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Interactive sessions</strong>. An Erlang version of Emacs <em>Lisp Interaction</em> buffers, where you can enter Erlang expressions or function definitions and have them evaluated. This is closer to a Lisp RePl than the standard Erlang shell.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Profiler</strong>. Painless support for having an arbitrary expression profiled, and inspecting the results.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Distel is now a <em>can't-live-without</em> for me, and it has attracted some cool people to make serious extensions. It's also the program that I'm personally most proud of. Tremendous fun. -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>

        I had some fun presenting it at the conference with a home made slideware program / markup language. For laughs, here is the front slide:
