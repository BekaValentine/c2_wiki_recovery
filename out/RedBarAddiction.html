        Red Bar Addiction

      <p>
        I like <a href="RedBar.html">RedBar</a>. I like writing code, and <a href="RedBar.html">RedBar</a> tells me that I need to do it. <a href="RedBar.html">RedBar</a> even points me at the piece of code I need to write. When I get to <a href="GreenBar.html">GreenBar</a>, I don't know what to do next. I get a coffee and surf the web and life loses all meaning. If I am sufficiently lost, I might even check in. Eventually I figure out what is wrong with my program and write a new test and get back to <a href="RedBar.html">RedBar</a>. Then I am alive again! -- <a href="JohnFarrell.html">JohnFarrell</a>

        <a href="RedBarAddiction.html">RedBarAddiction</a> Patterns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a> - quickly gets you to <a href="RedBar.html">RedBar</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           TriAngulation - when you have <a href="GreenBar.html">GreenBar</a>, write a unit test which will give you <a href="RedBar.html">RedBar</a> AND as an added benefit, any attempt to fix it quickly will result in existing unit tests giving you <a href="RedBar.html">RedBar</a> as well.
        </li>

        I have just finished reading Kent's book on <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, as a way of trying to appreciate the truth behind the fervour of a colleague who is a GreenBarAddict. It seems to me that <a href="GreenBarAddiction.html">GreenBarAddiction</a> encourages you to not write any tests, and <a href="RedBarAddiction.html">RedBarAddiction</a> encourages you to not write any working code :-). For this reason, I reject <a href="GreenBarAddiction.html">GreenBarAddiction</a>, and suggest that there must be a middle path. I don't know what it is yet. -- JF
