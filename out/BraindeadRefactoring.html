        Braindead Refactoring
      </h1>
      <p>
        The great thing about <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> is you don't even need to learn what the code does, first.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I like it!  And when you're done refactoring, you can have wonderful, informative names and comments like:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        // This code has been Braindead Refactored<br/>
        if(IReallyDontKnowWhatThisChecks()) {<br/>
        AndIHaventAClueWhatThisDoes();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Both are wrong. Proper (non-braindead) refactoring is one of the best ways to learn a code base. But you need to be prepared to think and learn while refactoring.
