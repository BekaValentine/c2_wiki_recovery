        Apache Synapse is an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> incubator project ("Web services mediation framework") from a spin-off company called WSO2. It is built on donation from Sonic Software (a well-known vendor in <a href="EnterpriseServiceBus.html">EnterpriseServiceBus</a>). [Not sure on this at all but] I think it purports to support <a href="WebServicesExtensions.html">WebServicesExtensions</a> (WS-* kind) for <a href="InformationSecurity.html">InformationSecurity</a>.

        In <a href="SeptemberZeroFive.html">SeptemberZeroFive</a>, it is getting quite a bit of press coverage; it is said to be significant from both <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> and <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> perspectives.

        This appear to have relevance to WebServicesInteroperability between multiple ESBs, but will it have significance in interoperability between <a href="JavaAndDotNet.html">JavaAndDotNet</a>? If so, should companies that are entrenched in the <a href="MicrosoftWay.html">MicrosoftWay</a> disregard the technical implications of these <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a> initiatives?
