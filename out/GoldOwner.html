        Gold Owner
      </h1>
      <p>
        The world contains a consultant named III (pronounced three), who refers to himself as a "jiggler". He jiggles people and projects until they change. And I'm quite sure they usually change for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
        III defines a project role "<a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a>" or "<a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a>". These are the people about whom the famous "<a href="GoldenRule.html">GoldenRule</a>" is written.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a> is funding the project; the <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a> defines what needs to be done. 
      </p>
      <p>
        These can be the same individual or separate individuals. In most projects, I suspect, the real <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a> and <a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a> aren't the same person. Sometimes we forget that there may be a <a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a> behind the <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a>, another individual who must be satisfied by the project, often in a more tangible way than the <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>'s <a href="ExtremeRoles.html">ExtremeRoles</a>, we call the <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a> the Customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that when the <a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a> and <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a> do not have consensus, the project is usually doomed (see <a href="CthreeProjectTerminated.html">CthreeProjectTerminated</a>).  See also <a href="OnConsensus.html">OnConsensus</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Apparently on Cthree the </em><a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a> was changed out completely,  and some of the <a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a> <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/87070,">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/87070,</a>  so with no docs and no plan it was cancelled (the new set of <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a> didn't want to touch it).  Suppose c3 had had docs,  maybe would survive?   Is this why docs is important,  not to devs,  but supposing mgmt is regularly turned over on both sides?<em></em>

        Is a lack of consensus between the <a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a> and <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a> the type of thing that is dealt with in
        <a href="BarryBoehm.html">BarryBoehm</a>'s MBase: <a href="http://sunset.usc.edu/research/MBASE/">http://sunset.usc.edu/research/MBASE/</a> -- <a href="DmytriKleiner.html">DmytriKleiner</a>
      </p>

        Let's see what the definition is. 'MBASE focuses on ensuring that a project’s product models (architecture, requirements, code, etc.), process models (tasks, activities, milestones), property models (cost, schedule, performance, dependability), and success models (stakeholder win-win, IKIWISI - I’ll Know It When I See It, business case) are consistent and mutually enforcing.' Well they got the models covered I guess, when does the working software get delivered? --<a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

        Seems to me that if the <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a> is not representing the <a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a>'s interests, the <a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a> needs to find another <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a>. --<a href="MarcThibault.html">MarcThibault</a>

        Or vice versa. --<a href="BillSeitz.html">BillSeitz</a>
