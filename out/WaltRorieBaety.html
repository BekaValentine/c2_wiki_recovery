      <p>
        I'm interested in programming languages.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm especially interested in powerful languages, large and small like <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>, <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>, <a href="IoLanguage.html">IoLanguage</a>, <a href="LuaLanguage.html">LuaLanguage</a>, <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, KLanguage,  et al.  I've used many others, including <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>, <a href="IconLanguage.html">IconLanguage</a> (thank you, University of Arizona!), <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, and of course, the unavoidable <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Background: I've had a few years (25+ yikes!) as a programmer and electronics tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        My programming-based blog is <a href="http://effing-ineffables.blogspot.com/">http://effing-ineffables.blogspot.com/</a> and I spend most of my free time lurking on the #haskell channel (as BMeph) on Freenode.

        <em>Hi Walt those languages suck try </em><a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, and try <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> (UofA doubtless taught you all about that) - aaaaand you forgot a .net or .biz or something on your domain! --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a><em></em>

        Thanks, <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>, but I've tried Ruby before, and no offense meant to Matz' amazingly good work in such a short time, but...I'm not impressed. Also, I'm surprised that a <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> advocate like yourself would be so rude to just declare "those languages suck" for seemingly no better reason than that those languages aren't Ruby. Maybe in the next decade, I'll give it a try.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, TDD doesn't impress me either - but then, as a <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> fan, that shouldn't be a surprise. -- <a href="WaltRorieBaety.html">WaltRorieBaety</a>
