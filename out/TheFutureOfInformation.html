        It's full of great zingers like 'Two cheers for the web'. But seriously, it is quite provocative on the subject of <a href="WebArchitecture.html">WebArchitecture</a> and <a href="SoftwareArchitecture.html">SoftwareArchitecture</a> in general.

        At my request, he sent me the fulltext of the book, and I converted it to HTML with sections and links and such. I asked him if I could publish it via HTTP, and he said no, he's holding out for transcopyright for that. I even sent him a tarball of the whole thing so he
        could publish it, but no. Sigh. -- <a href="DanConnolly.html">DanConnolly</a>

        Much of the good stuff is in <em>Ted Nelson's Computer Paradigm, Expressed as One-Liners</em> <a href="http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/TN/WRITINGS/TCOMPARADIGM/tedCompOneLiners.html">http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/TN/WRITINGS/TCOMPARADIGM/tedCompOneLiners.html</a> [<a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> 2005-06-07]
