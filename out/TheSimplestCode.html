        The Simplest Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        Beck describes the simplest code this way, in priority order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Runs all the tests.
        </li>
        <li>
           Contains no duplication.
        </li>
        <li>
           Expresses all the ideas you want to express.
        </li>
        <li>
           Minimizes number of classes and methods.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        (Sometimes he reverses numbers 2 and 3. Interesting thought problem.)
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are considering YAGNI (<a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>) and DTSTTCPW (<a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>), you must consider these rules. Generating <a href="TheSimplestCode.html">TheSimplestCode</a> is not complete unless you have refactored according to the rules above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nearly every objection and concern about YAGNI and DTSTTCPW is about leaving cruft in the code. <a href="TheSimplestCode.html">TheSimplestCode</a> says you must not do that. Defense rests.

      <p>
        One class with one method? Hmm. <em>It would be very hard to do that, without violating rules 1. and 2. in anything but the simplest case.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you define what is minimal?
