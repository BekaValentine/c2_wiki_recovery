        Hyper Visor
      </h1>
      <p>
        In computing, a <a href="HyperVisor.html">HyperVisor</a> (also: virtual machine monitor) is an <a href="OsVirtualization.html">OsVirtualization</a> platform that allows multiple operating systems to run on a host computer at the same time. The term usually refers to an implementation using full virtualization. Hypervisors are currently classified in two types:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Type 1 hypervisor is software that runs directly on a given hardware platform (as an operating system control program). A "guest" operating system thus runs at the second level above the hardware. The classic type 1 hypervisor was CP/CMS, developed at IBM in the 1960s, ancestor of IBM's current z/VM. More recent examples are Xen, VMware's ESX Server, and Sun's Logical Domains Hypervisor (released in 2005).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Type 2 hypervisor (is software that runs within an operating system environment. A "guest" operating system thus runs at the third level above the hardware. Examples include VMware Server (formally GSX) and Workstation, as well as Microsoft's Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual Server prodcuts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The term hypervisor apparently originated in IBM's CP-370 reimplementation of CP-67 for the IbmSystemThreeSeventy, released in 1972 as VM/370. The term hypervisor call referred to the paravirtualization interface, by which a "guest" operating system could access services directly from the (higher-level) control program â€“ analogous to making a "supervisor call" to the (same level) operating system. (The term 'supervisor' refers to the operating system kernel, which on IBM mainframes runs in supervisor state.)
