        A NearLink in the context of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> means a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> that is easily accessible by a person with a specific context. <em>[Note: your grammar is unclear here, obscuring the meaning of this sentence. Please </em><a href="RefactorMe.html">RefactorMe</a>]<em> See also </em><a href="TheFirstFiveClicks.html">TheFirstFiveClicks</a> and <a href="SixDegreesOfSeparationTheory.html">SixDegreesOfSeparationTheory</a>.

        For example, a lot of new users do not know the benefits of adding a CategoryHomePage to their <a href="WikiHomePage.html">WikiHomePage</a>. And they would probably get curious about the addition of that category by a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>. So in that sense CategoryHomePage is a <a href="NearClick.html">NearClick</a>  for a <a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a> making their first contributions.

        Note: <a href="NearClick.html">NearClick</a> is not NearLink, the latter being a term coined at <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> to refer to links to different sites.

        <em>Thanks Earle for correction. I do not have a good rephrase of the first sentence. I think I meant something like the intention of the page is relevant to "a role" - a person with a NewUser hat. Too complicated for me now and I am very hungry and tired today.</em>  BTW I hope <a href="ProceedWithFear.html">ProceedWithFear</a> is more readable now, takes a while to improve my pages, but I do not forget them -- dl <a href="DeleteWhenRead.html">DeleteWhenRead</a>
