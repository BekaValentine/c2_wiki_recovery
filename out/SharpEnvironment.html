        Sharp Environment
      </h1>
      <p>
        SharpE is a free <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> shell replacement developed by Low Dimension International. SharpE works on all ranges of Windows but to be able to take full advantage of it we strongly recommend using Windows 2000 or WindowsXP.
      </p>
      <p>
        SharpE completely replaces your regular Windows desktop with all new powerful tools all designed to enhance your computing experience. Things like taskbar, tray, desktop and startmenu all have their counterpart in SharpE in the form of a Sharp component, like SharpTray, SharpTask, SharpDesk and so on, all these components joins together in SharpCore, the integral part of SharpE.
