        A commercial software programmer in San Jose, California. I have about 10 years experience in OO, including Java, C++, and Object Pascal. Current interests include JML and AOD. I am very much an Extreme Sceptic, having found in my own experience that (a) requirements are usually out there if you are willing to work for them, and (b) designing for change is less work than fixing it later.  In other words, I find that going to the polar opposite of the waterfall is just as harmful to the development mindset as the waterfall was in its time.
