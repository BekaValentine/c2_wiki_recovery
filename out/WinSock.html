        Win Sock
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WinSock.html">WinSock</a> is <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>'s version of BerkeleySockets.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually MSFT did not come up with Winsock, it was spec'd and implemented back in 1993 independently of MSFT by Mark Towfiq (then of Microdyne) and a number of other smart folks from various vendors who wanted TCP/IP to work on winDOS but didn't have a common interface for socket programming.  They did have help from and work with a number of folks in MSFT, though. Remember, at that time MSFT had not even begun to care about the Internet.  Do the names Gupta, Spry, FTP Software, Beame & Whiteside, </em><a href="NetManage.html">NetManage</a> and Wollongong ring any bells?

        Also the API is not compatible with BerkeleySockets, although there were 100% compatible sockets implementations available when the API was drawn up.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Just enough incompatibility to be annoying; not enough for a compatible implementation to succeed instead.</em>
