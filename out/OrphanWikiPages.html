        Here is a script that will find all <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s. There are several thousand. Some are gems that should be cited from more familiar pages. Many others should probably be deleted. But, please, let's not delete too many at once. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        As of March 2006, there are over 2500 entries in <a href="http:orphanWikiPages,">http:orphanWikiPages,</a> although many of these appear to be <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>s. <a href="OrphanNonHomePages.html">OrphanNonHomePages</a> points to a list of those orphan pages that do not have the <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a> tag. There are over 1400 of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        As wiki's page count increases, it would be beneficial for readers to spend a while exploring the list of orphan pages to see if they can be usefully integrated with the rest of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the orphanWikiPages script does include some of the ChangesIn<Week> and ChangesIn<Month> pages, which would better be ignored, especially considering that clicking the title does bring up some backlinks.
