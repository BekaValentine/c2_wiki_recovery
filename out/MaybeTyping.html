        Maybe Typing
      </h1>
      <p>
        I know that there are many dynamic typing fans and weak typing fans or typeless programming fans on this wiki... but...
      </p>
      <p>
        Some think that dynamic typing and weak typing are <strong>bugs</strong>, not features. I think dynamic typing and weak typing are "maybe" typing. I describe these type systems (or lack of) as: possibly, maybe, kind of, sort of.Your typing system is "maybe" working, and your type is maybe an integer, maybe a string, maybe not. Maybe anything. Maybe nothing. Muddying the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it a string? Maybe! Who cares! Typing is a waste of time...
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I've talked to perl programmers who actually say that thinking about your types is a waste of time and you'd be better off getting on with programming real code, instead of worrying about types. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What type are you working with? I don't care! Maybe! Or maybe I do care. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now on the other hand let's be fair: there are times where you want a one off hack and don't care - you need something terse. Dynamic terse magic typing languages (or languages that hide types from you) are kind of like a regex. A terse regex can get things done which would otherwise take a long page of code to write. Dynamic typing allows you to write terse quick and dirty code, like regexes offer you this power. Just look at perl and ruby code: it's sort of like how a regex offers you terse <a href="ExpressivePower.html">ExpressivePower</a>. But in the long run a terse regex may get hard to maintain and debug because your typing system relies on "maybes" instead of disciplined sterility.

        Types are a tool. They can help us reason about code. But, at least today, types have a large cost in productivity and oft make our code brittle to extension. Other tools - e.g. <a href="ZeroButtonTesting.html">ZeroButtonTesting</a>, <a href="DynamicLanguageLint.html">DynamicLanguageLint</a>, AutomaticTestGeneration - might cost far less in productivity but offer similar or greater benefits. Language designs, too, can allow much reasoning about safety without types - we don't need static typing for secure <a href="ObjectCapabilityModel.html">ObjectCapabilityModel</a> reasoning, for example.

        The phrase `<a href="MaybeTyping.html">MaybeTyping</a>` reminds me of Gilad Bracha's proposal for optional, pluggable type systems (<a href="http://bracha.org/pluggableTypesPosition.pdf).">http://bracha.org/pluggableTypesPosition.pdf).</a> The idea is to separate language semantics from the type system, such that we can provide safety analysis as a third party service. Gilad Bracha is not some anonymous Perl hacker; he is a principle designer of Java.
