        I protest. I deny discussing in "bad faith". I am not consciously bad or evil on this wiki. From my perspective, it <strong>honestly appears</strong> to me that you guys reject science and instead rely heavily on <a href="ArgumentByElegance.html">ArgumentByElegance</a> because certain concepts titillate you personally, regardless of their practicality or empirical road-testing. That is honestly how the on-going conflict with "the academics" here appears from my perspective. That's my conscience reality as it is in my head. If I am delusional and seeing it all wrong, I can't do shit about it. There's no self-correcting mechanism kicking in right now to reboot my outlook. As far as I can tell, I'm perfectly logical and rational in general. (I suspect you are the delusional/misguided one(s), but that's another story.) I do try hard to explain why I see things the way I do, and am not trying to "trick" people. -- top

           <strong>Top</strong>:  to me you are completely rational and valid.  I think what you're witnessing is an actual undiagnosed insanity that manifests whenever there is some sort of important concept that they (wrongly) feel needs protecting.  I've seen this behavior on the Python mailing list.  It's very weird and anti-rational, but hyper-rational from their own flawed premises.  In fact that is what it is, you're presenting something that goes against a long-standing, internalized, and so unspoken premise, yet they either have not the ability to re-evaluate it or desire. --<a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

        I suggest we find a way to <strong>nail down and document</strong> our differences in this on-going academics-vs-practitioner battle. It may not resolve the root conflict, but at least clarify where and why we differ. Reinventing half the debate wheel over and over is better than reinventing it all. I don't like the repetition anymore than you do. I'm not against theory; I just want to see it road-tested before being placed in mainstream tools. Some want to skip that step. If that's truly a heretical position, then maybe I am delusional after all. It's perfectly normal within my <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>. -- top

        <em>Sorry, topper, ol' buddy, but you </em>continually<em> argue in bad faith. The whole middle section of </em><a href="SoftwareDevelopmentIsGambling.html">SoftwareDevelopmentIsGambling</a> shows evidence of that. This is why most Wikizens have just given up on you and dismiss you out of hand. I still read your tripe because you are a pretty smart guy and even a stubborn, closed-minded, jackassian, stupidly self-blinded pig finds an acorn once in a while. However, I have to admit that it gets harder all the time to muck through your drivel looking for the occasional gem. They are still there - but getting harder to find all the time.<em></em>

        I believe that the biggest difference between us is that I hold dear to <a href="GoodMetricsProduceNumbers.html">GoodMetricsProduceNumbers</a>, while you don't. If that belief makes me bad, evil, stupid, ignorant, dumb, foolish, lazy, stubborn, a bad-dresser etc., then so be it. I'd like to hear a good argument that such is an <strong>irrational position</strong>.

        I believe I provide the valuable service on this wiki of forcing people to face the dearth of evidence for their sacred cows. People don't like it when their sacred cows are attacked and criticized; they grow defensive and sling insults in retaliation. It's human nature, and having a PhD doesn't make one immune to such human emotions; It's in our genes. The criticism process starts them thinking, and eventually they may become sufficiently self-critical of their work to either develop better metrics or to abandon their sacred cow. <strong>Bitter medicine is often the most effective</strong>. Someday you may thank me. -- top

        Since Top counters (eventually) every discussion of programming practices and tools other than his own with demands for his idea of acceptable evidence, I'm left wondering how many of his own preferred programming practices and tools meet these standards -- and if they don't, then on what basis he prefers them and rejects others. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>

        I generally don't claim my pet approaches are <em>objectively better</em>. It's up to the objective betterment claimer to provide evidence/proof, not alternative tools and techniques. Some of you seem to think there's an <strong>equal burden</strong>, but logic and debates don't work that way. The difference of value between two tools is UNKNOWN by default. If I claim you don't have objective evidence that A is better than B, that's NOT the same as me claiming B is objectively better.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, the "mind" in my handle (<a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>) is based on my long-running and controversial suggestion that outside of machine performance and duplication factoring, the value difference between tools/paradigms/languages/techniques (tools for short) are largely tied to <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, AKA psychology and physiology, which is often individual-specific. The computer doesn't care how you write the software, only the humans do. Computers don't maintain software, humans do. And, I will do my best to explain my personal <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> processes where appropriate.

           From <a href="AreOoAndRelationalOrthogonalDiscussionThree.html">AreOoAndRelationalOrthogonalDiscussionThree</a>, "OO and relational tend to have a higher overlap in my observation of their usage in practice.

To avoid violating <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> (a <a href="MirrorModel.html">MirrorModel</a>), we ideally don't want employee-related attributes to be cataloged and tracked under both relational and OOP."

        That being said, I still value the idea of numerical metrics because it can help us make better choices by understanding the impact of our design choices on the economics of software creation and most importantly maintenance. Specific tools may work somewhat better under different design assumptions. But overall, I don't think any are a net <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>. (I also believe that there is value in mastering a few select tools rather than try to master combining gajillion tools.) The value of such metrics is generally within the variations offered by a given tool, not in choice of tool. And possibly to "prove" to others that tool choice does not matter much from an objective standpoint, which implies that <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> does. In other words, <strong></strong><a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> is the overriding factor when objective differences are minor<strong>.  </strong>

        It's unfortunately that <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> is not easily measured and/or inconsistent between individuals. But I'm just the messenger. Software engineering is about a model's interaction with the human mind. It's not really about machines. I wish it was about inanimate objects or rules, then we could analyze it without getting into the messy world of psychology and <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>. But reality is not always clean and nice to us. -t
