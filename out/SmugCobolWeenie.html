        <em>Not true. I worked with one a couple of years ago. He kept saying things like: "The Mainframe will never die" and "Java has only one future, to become </em>JavaBOL".<em></em>

        He is probably right. It is the backbone of too many mission-critical apps. It is the cockroach language: it would survive a nuclear war.

        Are they anything like "The Seasoned COBOLer" (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030615143550/http://www.ai.mit.edu/~gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg02770.html)?">http://web.archive.org/web/20030615143550/http://www.ai.mit.edu/~gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg02770.html)?</a>

        <em>What's </em>FoRK? I subscribed to all 3 kragen lists a month or two ago and there's been almost no traffic at all. 1 post, I think.<em></em>

        The biggest <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a> weenie has to be Charles Townsend <a href="http://www.legacyj.com/cobol/cobol_future.html">http://www.legacyj.com/cobol/cobol_future.html</a>

        <dd>I see a long fruitful life ahead for COBOL. COBOL remains the best implementation language for business applications and will retain that distinction for the foreseeable future.</dd>
