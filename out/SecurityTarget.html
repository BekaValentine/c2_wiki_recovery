        Security Target
      </h1>
      <p>
        Its obvious that a physical device (Bank ATM) will have different security needs compared to an email client (Outlook).  Therefore, the <a href="CommonCriteria.html">CommonCriteria</a> defines a method to compose these differing security targets.
      </p>
      <p>
        A physical device might need - TamperResistant, WipeSecurityKeyOnTamperDetection, NetworkEncryption.
      </p>
      <p>
        A single player computer game needs very little security - EncryptPlayerSavegames, InstallationKeyAuthorisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="SecurityTarget.html">SecurityTarget</a> is usually composed as a description of what needs to be done to protect the <a href="TargetOfEvaluation.html">TargetOfEvaluation</a> against ThreadAgents.
