        <em>Absence</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To those who care 8-) , I apologise for my unannounced absence. I took an impromptu WikiHoliday in about August 2003, mostly due to pressure of time. Having lost the immediate <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a> habit but retained the background urge to know all changes that had been made, I couldn't face the growing mountain of changes that must surely have been made during my absence. Yes, of course this is silly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shall return <a href="RealSoonNow.html">RealSoonNow</a>, and bring back here some parts of my other conversations.  In the mean time, the rest of this page is probably a little out of date. -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a>, 2003-12-30

           In the interest of <a href="SavingOrphans.html">SavingOrphans</a> perhaps, and so I can find them later, I think some pages deserve a mention.  Which isn't to say the the ones I haven't mentioned aren't worthy, just that .. (OK, I'll StopDiggingNow)

        PairWikiSpringCleaning? Not really. You did the work, deletion just takes two people.
      </p>

        I linked <a href="WindowsWay.html">WindowsWay</a> from <a href="OneMicrosoftWay.html">OneMicrosoftWay</a>. It seemed appropriate. -- m

      <p>
        I suppose this is as good a place to ask you a question as any.  I'm very interested in this <a href="WikiSquatting.html">WikiSquatting</a> concept. I thought, by definition, <a href="WikiSquatting.html">WikiSquatting</a> can't occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           a wiki is a publicly editable web space
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           a wiki is owned by the collection of writers to that space
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           disputes in the community are resolved by editing (largely by those most committed to editing in time and quality)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           wiki is proven to work
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This would seem to indicate that there is 'no such thing' as a topic to be 'on'.  In fact, the topic 'is' whatever the writers of the wiki write at the time they write it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, if you think something is <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, remove it, if they put it back with more zealous aplomb than you remove it, then they are right about the topic and you are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might say, being <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> encompasses both subject and dedication (or rather your dedication in comparison to the dedication of those who think it's <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>) to that subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reaction? I'm new to all this, so I don't have a wiki page (DavidDickens is blank), but I'll be sure to check back here to see if you've replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sorry I didn't write some kind of reply earlier.  I think I broadly agree with you, but also I think things have stayed the same while the paradigm has shifted slightly underneath, since we wrote about these things. -- m</em>
