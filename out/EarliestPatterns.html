        It is about 3500 years old and is said to have been the pattern for a sculpture. It is a front view and at first glance, one immediately thinks of one located nearby. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Or could it be a sketch of an already existing sculpture?
      </p>
      <p>
        What is shown appears to have been sketched in a 4 high 5 wide grid, with the image being symmetrical upon a centerline drawn vertically at the middle of the third grid boxes. 
      </p>

        Also apparent are 90 degree circular arcs, parabolas, and other mathematical shapes. It is amazing and heightens my curiosity as to the degree of knowledge of mathematics of the ancients. It is apparent that it was well developed.

        Could it be related to [the sphinx]: <em>Probably not. They may look similar to a non-Egyptology student, but a large number of images and carvings looked roughly like that, and the details are not especially compellingly similar (there are sketches predating Napoleon using the Sphinx for target practice).</em>
