        Non Wiki Values
      </h1>
      <p>
        From <a href="SociologyWiki.html">SociologyWiki</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Free to explore the possible rather than always grounded in experience. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Embraces differences of opinion rather than striving for common ground. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Encourage conflict on issues of substance. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Any viewpoint not supported by reason and scholarship will be permitted only at the forebearance of the community. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Allow any respectable scholarly viewpoint, no matter how offensive to the general population. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Utmost respect for intellectual honesty and minimizing of deceit. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Permit honest and justified value judgements. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now my total dismay is why values like the above (<em>scholarly</em> is a bit to tough of a word for wikis) should apply to chatting on sociology wiki while they obviously don't apply to chatting on software development? Or is this yet another reason for <a href="WhyWikiWorksNot.html">WhyWikiWorksNot</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        They may apply to chatting about software development on <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, but they certainly don't apply to chatting about politics on <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. Try saying that the USA is a rogue terrorist state or that Americans are insane and watch what happens. This is because WikiValues are restricted to what most people are already experts in, or are willing to become experts in. On <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, that's software and not politics.
