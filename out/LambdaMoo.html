        Wow, I haven't been on there in at least four years. Do they still have the <a href="RubeGoldberg.html">RubeGoldberg</a> device? -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        <em>Yes, the last time I checked they still have the Rube Goldberg device.</em>

        The powerful <a href="TextBased.html">TextBased</a> <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> multi-user world server, LambdaMOO (<a href="http://www.moo.mud.org)">http://www.moo.mud.org)</a> uses a <a href="PrototypeBased.html">PrototypeBased</a> <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>.  Instead of using classes, every object in the world inherits from another object.  It's been about ten years or so since I played with MOO, but if I remember correctly, the four direct descendants of the root object, which virtually every other object in the system inherit from are Room, Player, Exit and Thing. Users can create their own objects which inherit from these (or their descendants) and customize them by setting properties and adding or overriding methods. -- <a href="BruceFancher.html">BruceFancher</a>
