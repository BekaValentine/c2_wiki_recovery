        Nested Continuous Integration
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="NestedContinuousIntegration.html">NestedContinuousIntegration</a> (a term I just made up) occurs when you are practicing <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> and as you are making a change (let's call it Change A) that you had hoped to integrate next, you discover that this change can be viewed as dependant upon a smaller increment of change (say Change B) that is worthy of its own independant integration.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So, you set aside your current effort on Change A for a while, and work on the smaller increment of change as a separate isolated change using an isoloated development environment that doesn't see the Change A's partial work.  This may only take a few minutes or an hour or two.  After this is complete, you integrate it, and then you are able to use those changes in your work on Change A.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mechanics of this can be interesting.  If Change A and Change B are not sufficiently de-coupled, you may have source file overlap (i.e. Change A already has some edits made to foo.java, and now change B needs to make edits to the same file.)  
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending upon your development environment, and your ability to instantiate a separate, isolated development environment that doesn't "see" the other environments pending changes,  this approach may work out great.  
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are pairing, you may just leave one person's workstation, and start using the other person's workstation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <a href="PerforceVersionControl.html">PerforceVersionControl</a>, I have been able to do this very easily on a single workstation, using multiple "clients" (a Perforce term)  After submitting the the nested change, I refresh my other environment and resolve/merge the changes into the other change.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, I currently have two changes on hold, while I'm working on a third, and all three have some common files involved.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this approach a good idea?   I think that it is, as it has been working for me, but I'm curious if others have done this as well?   -- <a href="JohnVriezen.html">JohnVriezen</a>
