        Tao Of The Software Architect
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a very liberal reading of <a href="LaoTse.html">LaoTse</a>'s <a href="TaoTeChing.html">TaoTeChing</a> for the use of
        software architects, based on various French and English translations. The
        number refers to the original tablets.

      <code>
        The architect observes the world<br/>
        but trusts his inner vision.<br/>
        He allows things to come and go.<br/>
        His heart is open as the sky. (12)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The architect doesn't talk, he acts.<br/>
        When this is done,<br/>
        the team says, "Amazing:<br/>
        we did it, all by ourselves!"  (17)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        When the architect leads, the team<br/>
        is hardly aware that he exists.<br/>
        Next best is a leader that is loved.<br/>
        Next, one who is feared.<br/>
        The worst one who is despised. (17)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        A good traveler has no fixed plans<br/>
        and is not intent upon arriving.<br/>
        A good artist lets his intuition<br/>
        lead him wherever it wants.<br/>
        A good scientist has freed himself of concepts<br/>
        and keeps his mind open to what is.<br/>
        Thus the architect is available to everybody<br/>
        and doesn't reject anyone.<br/>
        He is ready to use all situations<br/>
        and does not waste anything.<br/>
        This is called embodying the light. (27)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        If you want to shrink something,<br/>
        you must first allow it to expand.<br/>
        If you want to get rid of something,<br/>
        you must first allow it to flourish.<br/>
        If you want to take something,<br/>
        you must first allow it to be given.<br/>
        This is called the subtle perception<br/>
        of the way things are.<br/>
        The soft overcomes the hard.<br/>
        The slow overcomes the fast.<br/>
        Let your workings remain a mystery.<br/>
        Just show people the results. (36)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        When the process is lost, there is good practice.<br/>
        When good practice is lost, there are rules.<br/>
        When rules are lost, there is ritual.<br/>
        Ritual is the beginning of chaos.   (38)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The architect concerns himself<br/>
        with the depth and not the surface,<br/>
        with the fruit and not the flower. (38)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The architect allows things to happen.<br/>
        He shapes events as  they come.<br/>
        He steps out of the ways<br/>
        and let the design speak for itself. (45)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The architect gives himself up<br/>
        to whatever the moment brings.<br/>
        He knows that he is going to leave,<br/>
        and he has nothing left to hold on to:<br/>
        no illusions, no resistance in his mind.<br/>
        He holds nothing back from the project,<br/>
        therefore is ready for departure,<br/>
        as a man is ready for sleep<br/>
        after a good day's work. (50)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The great way is easy,<br/>
        yet programmers prefer the side paths.<br/>
        Be aware when things are out of balance.<br/>
        Remain centered within the design. (53)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The architect's power is like this.<br/>
        He let all things come and go<br/>
        effortlessly, without desire.<br/>
        He never expect results;<br/>
        thus he is never disappointed.<br/>
        He is never disappointed,<br/>
        thus his spirit never grows old. (55)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Those who know don't talk.<br/>
        Those who talk don't know. (56)<br/>
        Or: Those who do not have a clue<br/>
        are still debating about the process.<br/>
        Those who know, just do it.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The architect is content<br/>
        to serve as an example<br/>
        and not to impose his will.<br/>
        He is pointed, but doesn't pierce.<br/>
        Straightforward, but supple.<br/>
        Radiant, but easy on the eyes. (58)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        If you want to be a great leader,<br/>
        stop trying to control.<br/>
        Let go of fixed plans and concepts and<br/>
        the team will govern itself.<br/>
        The more prohibitions you have,<br/>
        the less disciplined the team will be.<br/>
        The more coercion you exert,<br/>
        the less secure the team will be.<br/>
        The more external help you call,<br/>
        the less self-reliant the team will be. (57)<br/>
