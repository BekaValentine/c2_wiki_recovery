        <em>Someone asked </em><a href="news:comp.software.testing">news:comp.software.testing</a> what a job listing for a QA Analysis role would read. A local <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> replied: <em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Try this:
      </p>
      <p>
        We are looking for a senior troublemaker and troubleshooter, with experience
        working directly with teams and customers to convert high-level requirements
        into testable specifications. The successful applicant will maintain a rig
        of acceptance tests in a format that our customers can edit and launch. You
        will assist developers to integrate this rig with their unit tests, and you
        will help research how to test difficult situations. You will automate a
        test server that will run the entire test corpus each time our codebase
        changes, and will escalate issues via e-mail and via green and red lava
        lamps.
      </p>
      <p>
        To track progress, you will instrument these tests to collect metrics
        appropriate to our business situation. You will store these metrics in a
        light database, and publish a daily "burn-down" chart of these metrics, to
        publish on our walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        To detect bugs, you will research advanced stress-tests and cross-tests that
        assault our code with sick scenarios, looking for gaps between the
        requirements and our developers' implementations. You will assist in each
        weekly release, and demo our product to customer representatives.
