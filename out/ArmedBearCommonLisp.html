        Armed Bear Common Lisp
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ArmedBearCommonLisp.html">ArmedBearCommonLisp</a> is an implementation of <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> running over the JVM. You can find it in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/">http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/</a>
        </li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Used to be called <a href="ArmedBearLisp.html">ArmedBearLisp</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weird part about it is that the lisp interpreter is well hidden inside a java text editor, J (a BadName for software, if you ask me). You can run it stand alone this way:
      </p>
      <code>
        java -cp j.jar org.armedbear.lisp.Main<br/>
      </code>

      <p>
        I am trying it out currently. It is a good idea, because you can call the java libraries (which are BIG), and makes ABL portable, two of my main objections about Lisp. See <a href="WhyWeHateLisp.html">WhyWeHateLisp</a>. -- <a href="JuanPabloNunnezRojas.html">JuanPabloNunnezRojas</a>.

        Recently (during the summer of 2004) I used ABCL to develop scriptable test tool for a communication library written in java. With ABCL just coming into its own it wasn't as pleasant as it could have been, but I was still impressed by the long strides it made in a short time. It is an almost complete CL implementation. With its active and responsive developers, I can recommend trying it out.
