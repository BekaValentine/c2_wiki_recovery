        Extreme Programming Tattoo
      </h1>
      <p>
        Look for these at the upcoming OOPSLA.  Extreme programmers have elaborate skin-colored tattoos all over their faces and bodies.  Rather like Maori tattoos, except Extreme. The <a href="ExtremeProgrammingTattoo.html">ExtremeProgrammingTattoo</a> can only be awarded by an <a href="ExtremeProgrammingMaster.html">ExtremeProgrammingMaster</a>.  This year I'll be tattooing the women, because Kent wanted to do the men.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        <em>Is there any other way we can discern the XPers?  Everyone I saw at OOPSLA last year was covered with skin-colored tattoos.</em>

      <p>
        Yes, there is.

        <em>Skin colored ? I thought the tattoos were flesh-tone.</em>
