        Someone asked in <a href="MicrosoftIncompatibleDependencySuite.html">MicrosoftIncompatibleDependencySuite</a> what a <a href="DotNetAssembly.html">DotNetAssembly</a> is, how it is different from the registry, and how it gets rid of <a href="DllHell.html">DllHell</a>. The <a href="DotNetAssembly.html">DotNetAssembly</a> is metadata that travels with the application and is in the directory that conatins the application. The metadata consists of
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Description of a <a href="GranuleOfDeployment.html">GranuleOfDeployment</a> (called an <a href="DotNetAssembly.html">DotNetAssembly</a>)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Name, version, culture
        </li>
        <li>
           A public key for verification
        </li>
        <li>
           Types exported by the assembly
        </li>
        <li>
           Dependencies - other assemblies which this assembly depends on
        </li>
        <li>
           Security permissions needed to run
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This metadata is one of the ways that the <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a> can support a wide variety of languages and tools. Some of the possible tool consumers of the metadata are designers, debuggers, profilers, Proxy Generators, Other Compilers (to find out how to use a component in their language), type/object browsers, and Schema generators.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the unit of deployment is a <a href="DotNetAssembly.html">DotNetAssembly</a>. It can consist of one or more files and is self-describing. It contains a manifest which holds the metadata I have described above describing everything exported from the assembly, and what's needed to deploy and run a <a href="DotNetAssembly.html">DotNetAssembly</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="DotNetAssembly.html">DotNetAssembly</a> has its own version. Assemblies are combined to form Applications. An Application has one or more dotNet Assemblies and also may contain application-specific files or data. <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> applications <em>can</em> install simply copying the files described above to a directory and run. <strong>No registry, no component registration.</strong>

        The above description may be so complete that it confuses people or makes things sound more complicated than they are.  In the real world, there is usually a one-to-one correspondence between an assembly and a single DLL or EXE.  The code, metadata, and manifest are usually all in the same file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing that the parts can be split apart in various ways may be useful, but it is not too much of an oversimplification to say that a .NET assembly is basically a DLL/EXE that contains .NET code and metadata.
      </p>

      <p>
        So it's like the JAR manifest and the WAR/EAR deployment descriptor for Java applications.  Is it in a nice standard format, like XML?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Is it a brand new source of bugs like all metadata?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a rather silly attempt at bashing .NET.  Any part of a system can be a source of defects, whether it is code, data, hardware or the user.  Automatically-generated metadata in a standardized format is almost always less defect-prone than the hand-rolled alternatives many systems rely upon.  The most metadata-rich programming platforms available include Smalltalk and Lisp--does the existence of metadata make those platforms buggy?
