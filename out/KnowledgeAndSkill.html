           <em>Having been employed doing "programming" and "engineering", not to mention "designing", it is easy for me to distinguish between "applications" and "implementations" and between the processes involving physical things and those involving abstractions. It might seem strange to a "programmer" that an engineer is able to understand and cope with the programming of applications concerning the physical things ((i.e. electronics, mechanics, physics) and also be able to think in abstractions (i.e. mathamatics, semantics, algorithms, constants, variables, strings, procedural issues, language constructs, etc.). Knowing the rules of the first group and applying the processes, order and methodology of the second group do not involve insurmountable barriers, particularly when presented with a tool as versatile as is VB or other Visual Language. On the other hand, it might also seem strange to an "engineer" that a programmer is able to understand and cope with the application of programming skills to the solution of physical problems and things "engineered". It might seem strange to both that there exists those who were originally "engineers" or "programmers" that have found it is possible to be knowledgeable and skilled in both disciplines to the point where solutions become pre-eminent. People of both disciplines can achieve mutual success if they are oriented toward the "success" to be arrived at, submersing the feelings one group may have toward the other.</em> -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

        That is very interesting and thank you for bringing it to attention. Personally, I trained as an engineer and became a programmer by interest (or perhaps addiction). I have come to realise that programming has given me an instinctive attention to detail of a text. As I am an academic, that is useful for work e.g. on a Ph.D. thesis. It is also useful as detail is important for safety in engineering (see <a href="TheChemicalEngineeringCulture.html">TheChemicalEngineeringCulture</a>) because of the consequences of failure. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
