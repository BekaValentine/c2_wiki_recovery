        Delete When Cooked

      <p>
        A <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a> invented for the purpose of appending a signed comment to make explicit the fact that the following are recognized:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           it may have been inappropriate to not sign my comment, therefore I signed it
        </li>
        <li>
           when it comes time to remove the comment, the gentle <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> may appreciate a green light
        </li>
        <li>
           it may not be necessary or appropriate to assimilate it, so <a href="OpenAuthor.html">OpenAuthor</a> doesn't quite fit
        </li>
        <li>
           some folk (including me) like to keep a signature somewhere on the page just for its <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a> value and the possibility of wondering what has happened if I come back after a month or three, as mentioned in <a href="WikiSignature.html">WikiSignature</a>; but in this case I don't care
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It might be best read as permission, perhaps sometimes an invitation, but not an imperative. You could instead just delete the <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a>, and perhaps the signature too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On the name,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I avoid saying DeleteWhenImplemented (in the context of a feature request) because I appreciate that ResolvedWontFix may be a valid response.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On the usage,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose it is superfluous when applied to <a href="WikiMail.html">WikiMail</a>, but some might feel that comments made should be left for fear of offending the sender? I don't know, maybe I'm just a bit touchy. 8-)
      </p>
      <p>
        I realize we already have a drawer full of very similar tools for jobs like this, and the creation of another (with a slightly perverse name to boot) may not be necessary or welcome. Will the world perhaps suggest an alternative before consigning this page to the <a href="BitBucket.html">BitBucket</a>?
