        Web Three Point Zero
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="AjaxWebApplications.html">AjaxWebApplications</a>, a.k.a. <a href="WebTwoPointOh.html">WebTwoPointOh</a>, deeply suck. Here's why:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Multiple implementation languages (<a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> {or is that <a href="EcmaScript.html">EcmaScript</a> or hey is <a href="JscriptDotNet.html">JscriptDotNet</a> alive?} + a soft language {<a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a> [call that a language?] ...} + Webserver configuration + a hard language {yeah right, you don't need to <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>, all that I/O means you're never CPU bound ... right? Um, I said right? Um, is this thing on?} + <a href="SqlLanguage.html">SqlLanguage</a> wrapped in one of a million almost identical <a href="ObjectRelationalBridge.html">ObjectRelationalBridge</a>s {because, heck, you really don't know which database is going to perform best this week, or which one is legacy from last week, do you?}
        </li>
        <li>
           Multiple data interchange languages {<a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> / <a href="JavaScriptObjectNotation.html">JavaScriptObjectNotation</a> / <a href="SimpleObjectAccessProtocol.html">SimpleObjectAccessProtocol</a> [whaddya mean SOAP? SOAP's the <a href="RemoteProcedureCall.html">RemoteProcedureCall</a> language, not the data interchange language ... well, unless you use it as the data interchange language; it all depends on where you want to encode your semantics today ...]}
        </li>
        <li>
           Multiple representation formats {HTML, DHTML, <a href="CascadingStyleSheets.html">CascadingStyleSheets</a>, <a href="XsltLanguage.html">XsltLanguage</a>, <a href="XformsTechnology.html">XformsTechnology</a> [Hey, you dope, this is all open hooey, what you really want is <a href="MacromediaFlash.html">MacromediaFlash</a>! AFLAX! or, um, what is Adobe doing now?]
        </li>
        <li>
           You're not cool if you're not <a href="ExtremelyInterstrangled.html">ExtremelyInterstrangled</a> with <a href="RssFeeds.html">RssFeeds</a>/<a href="RdfLanguage.html">RdfLanguage</a>/<a href="MicroFormat.html">MicroFormat</a>s/IJMTAUAIGA {I'm Just Making These Acronyms Up As I Go Along}
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="WebArchitecture.html">WebArchitecture</a> is broken. No, I don't mean just badly implemented, or all fscked up with commercial and open pissing matches, or just difficult to visualize. I mean it's the wrong architecture for most of the apps it hosts. Its address oriented where everything we're writing is content oriented. The only way you can host a content oriented site like, say, this here wiki, and all them there wikis, is to glom stuff together inside a single server and rely on <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a>es / inextensible <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> hacks that don't even support <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s and don't scale ...
        </li>
        <li>
           Because the architecture is broken, there are lots of <a href="StrangeLoop.html">StrangeLoop</a>s in it. For example, Google is a proprietary application server rather than, as it obviously wants to be, a protocol!
        </li>
        <li>
           Need I go on? <a href="TimBernersLee.html">TimBernersLee</a> invented a panacea and we all know that <a href="AllPanaceasBecomePoison.html">AllPanaceasBecomePoison</a>. Always.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In other words what we have here is a royal <a href="PatternOfBabel.html">PatternOfBabel</a>. Let's chuck it and start over. This page is about trying to figure out a simple <a href="WebArchitecture.html">WebArchitecture</a> that does everything the <a href="ShonkyVille.html">ShonkyVille</a> approach above does, but simply, with elegance, and without a trace of the backward compatibility that has caused the <a href="ExtremelyInterstrangled.html">ExtremelyInterstrangled</a>-ment to occur.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Start with the architecture. What we intend when we use a browser is to see current information. We're not interested in stale information. And we're not interested in navigating to get it - hence the need for Google and its kin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The fundamental should be <a href="PublishAndSubscribe.html">PublishAndSubscribe</a>. A web address and a search string will be one and the same thing. We simply upgrade DNS with RDF and cut out about a dozen layers of middlemen. Well, we have to Sweeten RDF. Then dump Google in the ocean as a legacy boat anchor.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="UniformResourceLocator.html">UniformResourceLocator</a>s have arbitrary semantics. This sucks because we never know how to map to them - hence the whole mess of REST/SOAP/CherryPy/what-have-you conventions not to mention various layers of obscurantism on top of that. And now, with <a href="AjaxWebApplications.html">AjaxWebApplications</a>, much worse, more layers in front of them too, all written in bigomegahelpus <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          -part Turing complete URLs. If the first part of a URL names a collection of resources - courtesy of our RDFDNS (RNS?) - then the next part can be a program that translates them into another resource. And the last part can be a set of tags on which you publish that resource.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Ah, but what is the <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>? That's easy: XSLT. But, hey, XSLT is ugly as sin! Sure, but it's Turing compatible. Consequently we need merely pick another Turing-compatible language as the standard, and stick to it. And that choice is damn simple: <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>. There's not a soul here who'll argue with this. All that's wanted is a bit of syntax extension to understand RDF and <strong>We're Done.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="XmlSucks.html">XmlSucks</a> so much that people are falling back into JSON (<a href="JavaScriptObjectNotation.html">JavaScriptObjectNotation</a>) for AJAX. But JSON isn't anywhere near so powerful as XML, and that pushes way too much work down into the private programmatics inside your servlets (a.k.a. CGI blahblahblah, don't get hung up on the buzzwords). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        What we need is to beef up JSON until it can represent all the XML semantics - but with generality and <a href="SyntacticSugar.html">SyntacticSugar</a>. Then write a translator and forget XML forever. What motivates people to ditch XML? Well, maintainability, readability, speed, reduced staff churn ...

        <em>I detect the telltale traces of </em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a> above. What is that phrase? Oh yeah - <a href="LetsBlowUpTheUniverse.html">LetsBlowUpTheUniverse</a>!<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I cannot tell a lie, it was me. I blew up the universe. Okay, let's start by replacing all the front end junk with <a href="AjaxSmalltalk.html">AjaxSmalltalk</a>. We then replace the XML/XSLT/XForms junk with ... <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> via <a href="SeasideFramework.html">SeasideFramework</a>. And then on the back end, let me see, what about oh, I dunno ... <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>? There's lotsa connectivity/persistence choices there but <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> anyone? Oh, and there's still that RDFDNS google-killer thingy ... how about we implement that in <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>? Hey, and one more idea: let's have the server provide P2P access by mapping its RDFDNS to the respective client IP #s.  Add the <a href="CocktailPartyMetaphor.html">CocktailPartyMetaphor</a> and <a href="ManaMana.html">ManaMana</a> to that and away! --Pete going "Woo Woo!" like <a href="SteveBallmer.html">SteveBallmer</a>. And then "Kapwing!" like <a href="CalvinAndHobbes.html">CalvinAndHobbes</a>.

      <p>
        <em>Ya know, just a hint, but it may be time to </em><a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> this page. Just a little. So maybe someone could understand it. If that's not too much trouble ...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You're forgetting that this page is a <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a> production.  It's <em>not supposed</em> to make sense.  Oh, hey, Pete!  We were just talking about you.  How's it been?  :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        In all seriousness, I believe <a href="PhilipWadler.html">PhilipWadler</a> is working on some language implementation where you write in a SINGLE language, and it compiles to server-side Java, client-side Javascript, and handles all the IPC requirements between the two on its own.  The problems that Pete declares above are already well know (at least to Wadler).  --SamuelFalvo

        <em>You do it all in </em><a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> these days. Works great so long as you stick to the synchronous stuff. If you want asynchronous you just bolt a message queue onto the model. And with Rubinius a month or two from launch that's that, everything makes sense again.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Except, well, you're working with (shudder) Ruby.  Java is markedly faster than Ruby, which makes it more suitable for large-scale business use.  There's a reason why Google doesn't use Ruby.  --SamuelFalvo

        For observational, consumption, and archiving of WebContent, I just use <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a>: It captures a page I am interested in with a ReasonableRendering and finishes off with the NavigationUrl where it originated, while making its contents reachable with its own <a href="SearchEngine.html">SearchEngine</a>.  That may not have been the original idea of what it is supposed to do, but that is how I use it. It is a terrific way of gathering "favorites" as well as a way of storing information of interest which is searchable and making it reachable at the same time. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.20100822
