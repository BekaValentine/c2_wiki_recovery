        You know you shouldn't, but you do. You get so excited by the possibilities of your proposed class and its responsibilities, you turn the <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a> over and start scribbling an implementation down. This reifies your thinking on the topic. This is good, as it gives you confidence that a class is implementable, like a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>. This is bad, as it locks you into one implementation before you've fully explored the problem domain and the collaborators involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore,</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hold off on turning that card over. Push the implementation in your head aside; almost all really great ideas benefit from a little fermentation. Argue about the collaborations a little more with other designers. If you absolutely can't resist, as a last resort, push the <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a> away from you and pick up another card to scribble implementation details.
