        More Heat Than Light

      <p>
        Arguments generate <a href="MoreHeatThanLight.html">MoreHeatThanLight</a> and I like this analogy.

        "Heated Arguments" communicate a lot of information quickly, but it also creates lots of friction, and we end up missing out on any flashes of enlightening insights.

        If you wish to use this as a <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a> alert on what is happening in a series of rapid-fire exchanges between opposing viewpoints, I suggest one of many ways is to insert a post like this
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "<a href="MoreHeatThanLight.html">MoreHeatThanLight</a> alert!"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Better done by a person previously uninvolved in the debates who feels that there could be points on both sides.
