        <strong>What Wikis are</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being unique in many ways, Wikipedia is still a wiki. Despite being unique in many ways, wikis are still online systems for discussion and collaboration. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being unique in many ways, online systems for discussion and collaboration are <strong>examples of group behavior</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is human to think that much of what we are, much of what we do, and much of what we perceive is unique and special. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Greater wisdom and perception comes as we realize that our interactions are one-offs - that share patterns with other like things.

      <p>
        Despite participating in Wikipedia, it is not who I am; I am no more a product of Wikipedia than I am of (pick one) usenet, compuserve, the Well, mil-veh.org, est, high school football, or the Democratic Convention, though I have taken lessons in how people interact from all these places.

        One of Wikipedia's shortcomings is that its participants think it is just tickety boo, and like nothing else in the world. Let us not make the same mistake. -- <a href="LouisKyuWonRyu.html">LouisKyuWonRyu</a>
