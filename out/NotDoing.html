        Not Doing
      </h1>
      <p>
        A technique of the ToltecTeachings. (Google search for "Theun Mares", "Carlos Castaneda".)

        When we are faced with a situation, we usually tend to react in a few limited ways, based on our past experience. For instance, a female raising her voice in anger might make one flinch and feel (and act) defensively. <a href="NotDoing.html">NotDoing</a> could be, for instance, reacting in a friendly way, or laughing aloud, or anything out of the ordinary.
      </p>

        Some of the ideas behind the technique are:

           A hunter that is predictable leaves himself open to being hunted.
        </li>
        <li>
           By practicing <a href="NotDoing.html">NotDoing</a>, one becomes more flexible.
        </li>
        <li>
           Practicing <a href="NotDoing.html">NotDoing</a> allows one to experience new things (consequences of a situation, etc.), thus enriching oneself.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Is there any language that would have a verb for <a href="NotDoing.html">NotDoing</a>, a verb that would allw one to express <a href="NotDoing.html">NotDoing</a> as doing something <em>other</em>? Something like <em>taire</em> (in French), <em>schweigen</em> (in German), <em>tiga</em> (in Swedish) means <em>not saying</em>; deliberately, actively, obstinately keeping quiet.
