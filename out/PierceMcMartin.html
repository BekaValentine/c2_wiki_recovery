        I work for a small company that provides engineering services to government customers.  I work mostly in space-related software applications, and have been involved in several C++ developments.  I have a little bit of Java experience, and have done a little Eiffel programming.

        In the early 80's I was developing engineering software, and three or four of us  did most of our programming in pairs for a time.  This turned out to be very productive.
