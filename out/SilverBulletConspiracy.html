        Silver Bullet Conspiracy
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <em>Silver Bullet Conspiracy</em> is a belief that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There exists some technology which is a <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a>--if deployed, this technology would increase the productivity of programmers by an order of magnitude.
        </li>
        <li>
           This technology is being suppressed, for various reasons, including:
          <ul>
            <li>
               By vendors of competing technologies, seeking to keep a <a href="DisruptiveTechnology.html">DisruptiveTechnology</a> (which would shrink the overall market size for their products) out of the hands of customers.
            </li>
            <li>
               By vendors of competing/complementary technologies, seeking to maximize revenue by introducing the technology to the marketplace gradually (and thus requiring multiple upgrade cycles--the <a href="SergeiBubkaStrategy.html">SergeiBubkaStrategy</a>)
            </li>
            <li>
               By the programming community, seeking to prevent the appearance of something that would make 90% (or whatever ratio seems appropriate) of programmers obsolete; thus resulting in massive unemployment and paycuts among programmers.
            </li>
            <li>
               By the MilitaryIndustrialComplex (just to tease <a href="MichaelMoore.html">MichaelMoore</a>)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sometimes, it is unspecified what the <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a> alledgedly is.  Other times, a particular technology which is widely praised but a commercial failure (<a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> for instance) is claimed to be a <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a>, and its failure in the marketplace is ascribed to the <a href="SilverBulletConspiracy.html">SilverBulletConspiracy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most if not all allegations of the <a href="SilverBulletConspiracy.html">SilverBulletConspiracy</a> don't hold water.  Most proposed silver bullets have been found to be made of lead or other base metals (occasionally one may find a silver alloy); and in the days of <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software it would be nigh impossible for any vendor to actively suppress any technology.  (Even with patents; the patented <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a> would have to be described in the patent application; it couldn't be kept secret).

        <em>Is this a joke?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No... I've seen it suggested before.  And not just in the SW industry; it's an oft-repeated canard that Detroit is capable of producing whiz-bang automobile engines that get 70MPG or whatever with no loss in performance, but is withholding such engine technology at the behest of Big Oil.  
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Sure, I've heard it applied to machinery (cars that run on water, washing machines that don't need detergent, etc) - but never to software. Can you give an example?</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <a href="JayOsako.html">JayOsako</a> suggested as much on <a href="HowToMakeGoodLanguagesFail.html">HowToMakeGoodLanguagesFail</a>.

                       See that link for my rebuttal. I never said anything about a conspiracy, and the explanation doesn't require one. Indeed, my statement is actually an argument <em>against</em> the existence of a conspiracy - what appears to be malicious activity is in fact a result of market forces.
