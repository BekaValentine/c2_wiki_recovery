        Survivor Bias
      </h1>
      <p>
        Survivorship bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that "survived" some process and ignoring those that didn't. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It can lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than being just lucky.
