        <em>It is such a large subject that I cannot really go into massive detail without getting really boring. However, basically it is running over the Kernel named Darwin which is (largely) </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>; In fact it has even been able to be installed on intel hardware (admittedly with limited support). Darwin is actually a complete operating system in itself.

        After <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> was released, <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a>s were available from Tenon, XFree86 (initially ported by <a href="JohnCarmack.html">JohnCarmack</a>), and maX (<a href="http://www.materialarts.com/maX/index.html).">http://www.materialarts.com/maX/index.html).</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        In January, 2003, Apple released a beta X11 server, based on XFree86 4.3, available at <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/.">http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/.</a> It had the benefit of being faster than previous ports, tight Quartz integration (Aqua window manager, compositing, and anti-aliased fonts) and official support from Apple.

        Apple's <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a> is now in production and automatically bundled on the 10.3 install CD. Nice!

        Quick summary: If there's any good reason to prefer <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> to <a href="LinuxPpc.html">LinuxPpc</a>, it hasn't yet come to light.
      </p>
      <p>
        This one looks like a matter of taste or personal preference. <a href="LinuxPpc.html">LinuxPpc</a> lets you run a linux OS on a PPC processor. <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> gives developers the choice of Darwin, Java, Cocoa, Carbon and Classic (explaining these terms, Classic is old mac software under emulation in its own protected task, Carbon is the name of the library that allows code to run on OS 8, 9 and X, Cocoa is the rejuvenated <a href="OpenStep.html">OpenStep</a> environment (see <a href="CocoaDev.html">CocoaDev</a> for a wiki dedicated to Cocoa development), Darwin is the <a href="FreeBsd.html">FreeBsd</a> variant on top of the Mach 3 microkernel).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How do I run my existing Mac software on </em><a href="LinuxPpc.html">LinuxPpc</a>?  How do I run the Mac user interface on it?  Are there drivers for all my peripherals?  (Also, maybe you shouldn't characterize something as a summary unless it accurately summarizes what follows it.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        running Mac software on <a href="LinuxPpc.html">LinuxPpc</a> would require a Mac emulator for linux, and these probably only exist in experimental form.
      </p>

        OK .. my 2 cents.  <strong>Mac software running on </strong><a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a> works fine.  Look at the MacOnLinux (MOL) project.<strong>  It runs </strong><a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> 8-9 under Linux, either in a window, or full-screen.  The compatibility and speed have said to be excellent - better than <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>'s compatibility features.  Also, Linux will be much faster than <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> and require fewer resources.  Take a look at the MachKernel .. its known for some flakyness in how it handles VirtualMemory.  Also, Mac isn't trully Unix.  Like <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a>, it uses NetInfo instead of /etc based configuration, and handles user accounts and root access and such very differently.  Its very close to Unix, but its not.  Its <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a>/<a href="OpenStep.html">OpenStep</a> with a slightly prettier GUI and the annoyance of forcing your CPU to grok postscript (or in this case PDF).  As for <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, Darwin might be, but its just a BSD server for the Mach kernel - add it to the list of already available free implementations of BSD, and its not even one of the better implementations ... so there is nothing there really.  The GUI and Object system (still based on <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>) is nice, but no longer fully <a href="OpenStep.html">OpenStep</a> compatible that I know of.  Once they release the API and allow <a href="GnuStep.html">GnuStep</a> to become binary compatible so we can OS X apps under Linux PPC, then I'll respect Apple a lot more, and we'll see just how special/efficient their OS really is.  The NeXT has been reborn as a new Mac, but I still see it as a NeXT.  I already have one, and I much prefer my Linux box.  The only Macs I found that felt right to me had dual Ghz CPUs and a GB of RAM, and I wanted a 3 button wheel mouse for it bad and LinuxPPC with Gnome. The OS is a hog.  Menus shouldn't be so far away (I tear mine off and move then around - can <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> do that?).  And even with all that horse power under <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>, I still found the annoying spinning color-wheel cursor on occasion (which looks just like the one on my color NeXT).  I'm yet to be impressed. -- <a href="EvanLanglois.html">EvanLanglois</a>

        Above is FUD. Linux is not MUCH faster than <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>. <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> has a modified Mach kernel. <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> is a Unix. If you deny this, then you have not a clue about Unix at all. Unix is not about (/etc). Ever used a Solaris box and NIS??? I use a mouse with 3 buttons and a wheel all day. It works out of the box.

        Actually <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> 10.2.4 is pretty cool! And it runs perfectly on some of the best computers available.

        I keep thinking: Darwin + (TinyX + xDgs) + gnustep = openstep reborn.  I guess that <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> is probably OK, but I really liked <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> and I assume I'd equally like <a href="OpenStep.html">OpenStep</a>.

        First thing I did with <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> was to connect Perl up to the CPAN archives and start downloading packages. Wonderful to be able to do this on a Mac.

        I think <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> is great now its running on unix. My iMac is so super and it running Perl, joe, emacs, mysql, sshd, apache.
