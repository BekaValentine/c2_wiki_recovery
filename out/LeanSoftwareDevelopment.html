        This book models programming as an assembly line. Each piece on the line is a change request. The goal of software development is to treat the assembly line as a <a href="ValueStream.html">ValueStream</a>, and minimize the time a request spends on the line. That requires distributing control to the workers, and mistake-proofing all aspects of the line.

        Inventory, in software development, per the Poppendiecks, is partially done work. Partially done work (<a href="SoftwareInProcess.html">SoftwareInProcess</a>) is an investment that has not yet yielded a return. And not even been deployed to where it could yield a return. Therefor minimize inventory by frequently delivering small complete units of working functionality to the customer.
