        Tom and MaryPoppiendeck recommend starting with <a href="FixedLengthIterations.html">FixedLengthIterations</a>, and they go so far as to say that it is the  starting point that "always works." The reason is simple: if you install a two week fixed length iteration into a shop that's been used to lollygagging around for six months between starting requirements analysis and deploying the
        product, *everything* is going to have to change to accommodate it.
