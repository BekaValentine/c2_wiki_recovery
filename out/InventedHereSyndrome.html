        Invented Here Syndrome
      </h1>
      <p>
        Typically exhibited by companies who immediately buy in consultancy to provide a solution to problems.
        Often consultants can listen to people within the company who know how to solve the problem, and present that solution back to management, who only then trust their own solution. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Results from lack of organisational self confidence.
