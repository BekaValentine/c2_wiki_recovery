        Some definition is required in order for one to understand queries:
      </p>
      <p>
        Queries are made of various sources of information in an attempt to extract filtered information required to complete some task or fulfill some need:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rlz=1T4SUNA_enUS221US222&defl=en&q=define:query&sa=X&oi=glossary_definition&ct=title">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rlz=1T4SUNA_enUS221US222&defl=en&q=define:query&sa=X&oi=glossary_definition&ct=title</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most often a query is made in recognition that needed information is organized and reachable, and that processes have been designed in such a manner as to respond to inquiries made in certain pre-designed ways. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Databases often are queried through the use of QueryLanguages such as SQL. A query not only can specify the nature of the information desired, but also the form and destination of the results. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The data in a database is organized (normalized) in such a manner as to allow for fairly direct and easily formed queries.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Possible definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A non-<a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> expression that returns data.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Why do you believe queries can't be <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>?  And do not Prolog and related queries constitute a sufficient counter-example?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A query is just an inquiry for information (says dictionary). An SQL query or TutorialD query is just that.. inquiring for information on a database.
