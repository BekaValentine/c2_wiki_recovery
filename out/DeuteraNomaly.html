        Deuteranomaly, or is the most common type of so called <a href="ColorBlindness.html">ColorBlindness</a>. Specifically it is not blindness to any color but a weakness to green. Like most people, they have three channels but their green channel is sifted towards red. This can cause dark green to appear back, red-green color on background combinations to jump out less and reduces distinctions between small hue differences in the red-yellow-green region, but also provdes an advantage in distinguishing shades of yellow, tan and khaki. <a href="http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=2202">http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=2202</a>
