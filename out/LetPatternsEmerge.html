        Let Patterns Emerge
      </h1>
      <p>
        I find it easier to let patterns emerge when I am
        programming, than actually build them in from the get go.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see patterns emerge if you 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           make objects to introduce points of variation, so that supplying a different object changes the behavior of the client
        </li>
        <li>
           make smaller objects that make up another when it becomes too big
        </li>
        <li>
           pass an object around when some method requires too many parameters
        </li>
        <li>
           you find two similar ways to do something, so following <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> you make objects to capture the similarity
        </li>
        <li>
           the oldie but goodie, make objects so that data and functions remain together.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It seems that most patterns arise out of these manipulations. Or maybe
        it seems like that, now that I already know the patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, I have seen developers put in too many classes in the
        name of following patterns. I got a couple of them into the
        habit of discovering the need for patterns instead of anticipating it.
