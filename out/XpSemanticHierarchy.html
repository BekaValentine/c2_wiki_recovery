        Xp Semantic Hierarchy
      </h1>
      <p>
        On the <a href="HamburgXpUsersGroup.html">HamburgXpUsersGroup</a> meeting on march, 17 there was the question how
        <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> ensures that the customer goal is really reached/approached.
        Or how and if the process fills the <a href="SemanticGap.html">SemanticGap</a> between the customer's wishes
        and the actual implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        XP was challenged by the critique that XP has <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s only on the
        lower (semantic) level, and that there is no process control, that these
        low-level tests match up and build up to the customer goal at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        The example was driving by car from Hamburg/Germany to New York - which will fail if I look only at the local problem at hand: I can drive all around Eurasias coasts without ever getting nearer than the French coast.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result of our discussion was the following hierarchy (high to low abstraction) :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           CustomerSatisfaction
        </li>
        <li>
           common ProjectVision (see also <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s
        </li>
        <li>
           PlainOldCode
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The lower we go the faster the goal changes and the more relevant sub-goals exist. In a way the project vision is broken down into <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, which are prioritized and broken down into parts and then assigned time and people. <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s are broken down into parts and drive the development of the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s which again drive a actual implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implicit hierarchy ensures, that the sub-goals add up to the ultimate customer satisfaction if XP is done properly.
