        Of particular interest is the exploration of highly interactive processes like those being used on this site.

        Still have not learned enough of the protocol to contribute, but have good intentions now that <a href="DenhamGrey.html">DenhamGrey</a> has encouraged me.

        Greetings Ward,
      </p>
      <p>
        I think you will find this system has some significant advantages for 'cleaning up' conversations, annealing, developing unique indexing systems and allowing the emergence of very interesting social protocols. I'm looking forward to exploring this further with you and <a href="PeterMurchland.html">PeterMurchland</a>. -- Denham
