        It was justified for various reasons. If I was more magical, I would have removed the recursion, making the check nearly useless, but it would still have to remain to avoid the ugly <strong>if( pComponent )</strong> pComponent->destroy().

        <strong>Language law</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding to protect yourself against those instances where undefined behavior (dereferencing a null pointer) happens to behave as you anticipated? That looks to me like a Bad Idea Tm. What aren't you telling us here, Sunir - does your implementation offer guarantees about the behavior here? As written, it isn't portable, and I would certainly hope that the real life instance of this code confirms the host implementation during the compile phase. -- <a href="DanilSuits.html">DanilSuits</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not <em>undefined.</em> You don't have to dereference the instance pointer to make a statically bound call. The behaviour fully defined in fact (see below). However, I'm open to the fact that it won't work at some point. Fix it then. However, if I was still working on that contract, my "fix" would have continued the progression towards C. Then it would become <strong>Component::destroy( pComponent )</strong>. Don't forget that <strong>pInstance->method()</strong> is just syntactic sugar for <strong>Class::method( pInstance )</strong> unless <strong>method()</strong> is virtual. No constructors, no virtuals. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

          2.5/2 and 5.2.5/3 seem to be the most obviously relevant bits of the standard, in particular that <strong>E1->E2</strong> is converted to the equivalent <strong>(*(E1)).E2</strong> and yes, the first part of that is evaluated. I don't believe you can manage that without dereferencing the null pointer... -- <a href="DanilSuits.html">DanilSuits</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You can evaluate the expression without dereferencing the pointer. There are multiple evaluation phases defined in C++. <strong>*(E1)</strong> may be evaluated statically at compile time within the <em>type system</em> of the program, well before runtime. This is fully within the expectation of the language design. To be more careful with the standard, when the semantics of one expression is described as an isomorphism of another, you have to continue reading the semantics of the second to understand what's intended. Here's the appropriate language lawyering (in my reading).
      </p>
      <p>
        In an earlier draft version, 5.2.5/1+footnote5 actually describes how the expression before the dot or arrow is evaluated regardless of necessity, which is more to your point. However, this doesn't mean what you think it does.
      </p>

          2.2 <strong>expr.call</strong> gives us this (bold mine):

        <dd>The function called in a member function call is normally selected according to the <strong>static type</strong> of the object expression, but if that function is <strong>virtual</strong> and is not specified using a qualified-id then the function actually called will be the final overrider of the selected function in the dynamic type of the object expression</dd>

        <dd>the interpretation of the call of a virtual function depends on the type of the object for which it is called  (the  dynamic  type), whereas the interpretation of a call of a nonvirtual member function <strong>depends only on the type of the pointer or reference</strong>  denoting that object (the static type)</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        So, although Steve Clamage claims it is <em>undefined</em> (<a href="http://cpptips.hyperformix.com/cpptips/this_eq_null),">http://cpptips.hyperformix.com/cpptips/this_eq_null),</a> he's wrong (although not for classes with virtual functions).
      </p>
      <p>
        I think you'll find that, even if the above interpretation were correct, you'd still run afoul of 9.3.1 <em>If a nonstatic member function of a class X is called for an object that is not of type X, or of a type derived from X, the behavior is undefined.</em> As I understand it, the thing on the other side of a null pointer of type X is not an object of type X. -- <a href="DanilSuits.html">DanilSuits</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>pComponent</strong> is not a typeless null pointer (i.e. not a constant-value expression evaluating to <strong>(void*)0</strong>), but a pointer to type <strong>Component</strong>, making the static type clear and obvious. Consider that in your argument, we would have to wait to <em>runtime</em> to determine the <em>static</em> type, as it is not clear what the value of pComponent is at compile time. Even if <strong>Component* const pComponent = 0;</strong> 4.10.1 describes the appropriate null pointer conversions. A constant 0 can become any pointer, including a pointer to function or pointer to member function, or in this case, a pointer to an object type. Don't forget that C++ is a strongly typed language. If 0 was not a subtype of T *, it would be impossible to compile anything requiring an cast from 0 to T*, such as a variable assignment or a function parameter binding, without an explicit cast. Indeed, this is the problem with NULL, which is <strong>#define NULL ((void*)0)</strong> typically, and <strong>void*</strong> does not automatically convert to every type (in particular, pointers to functions and member functions), unlike 0. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, but apple juice. The static types of the elements of the expression have nothing to do with (this==0). How are you supposed to have reached such a state without invoking undefined behavior? You can't have dereferenced a null pointer (1.9/4), which means you can't have used indirection (index), so you can't have used unary * (5.3.1/1), so you can't have used the -> operator (5.2.5/3). And even if you could somehow manage to bypass all of that, 9.3.1 says you have to have an object. Yes, an implementation could invoke the function as you expect it to, there is sufficient information present. It could also launch Quake without sacrificing any conformance at all.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't see how it could be any clearer. Component::destroy() is non-virtual. The object-expression after equivalence from pComponent->destroy() to (*pComponent).destroy() is (*pComponent). The type of pComponent is Component*, so the type of the object-expression is Component. The method destroy() is selected from Component and then invoked statically liked a normal function call. Your insistence that the value of pComponent is important to this invocation doesn't make any sense because the value is not known at compile time. Further, a static invocation doesn't dereference the object pointer ever for anything. -- </em><a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a><em></em>

      <p>
        <em>I agree, I don't see how it could be any clearer either. Component::destroy() is a non-static [remember, static is overloaded in c++]member function. 9.3.1 requires that calling a non-static member function requires (1) an object and (2) that the object be of the correct type. "this" is the address of that object, by 9.3.2. We agree that, if there is an object, that it will be of the correct type, but I don't see anything that suggests there is an object. We agree that we have a null pointer of type Component, but I don't see any justification for assuming there is an object associated with that pointer. So the behavior is undefined. Certainly the static analysis you suggest makes it clear which function is intended, by under the hypothetical conditions where this==0 could be true, a conforming implementation is not required to call that function. -- </em><a href="DanilSuits.html">DanilSuits</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You claim that because it is a null pointer, there is no object, and therefore no valid call. I don't think that's consistent with the rest of the specification, especially the definition of static-type in 1.4 <em>I think you mean 1.3.11 [defns.static.type] -- dps</em>

      </code>
      <p>
        After all, if the program has undefined behaviour depending on the <em>runtime</em> value of pComponent, then the static type lookup required by a nonvirtual member function invocation would be invalidated, which is illegal by the definition of static type.

        In practical terms, there is not much to argue anyway. As I said, even if the team encounters a strange compiler that did a 0-value check before each invocation (some did exist a long time ago during the experimental C++ compiler period), the solution is just to convert the expressions into the equivalent C calls as is the ultimate intent anyway a la <em>cfront</em>. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        You're absolutely right, that if Foo is virtual a null dereference of the instance pointer to do a polymorphic dispatch would cause an explosion.

Fortunately, that isn't the case either. (Typically, one uses a <a href="SmartPointer.html">SmartPointer</a> wrapper to manage dynamic code, not <strong>delete this</strong>.)

        <strong>Optimization</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this is merely the old debate on whether to include guards within the called function or push them back onto the calling function. In either case, I would recommend replacing the test with a more informatively named inline function, for example "bool hasBeenDestroyed(void) const". This would give the poor maintenance programmer a hint at what you are trying to accomplish as well as open doors to replace the evaluation should it lead to problems. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Guards inside vs. out.</em> Maybe, but in most ways it's more efficient to put the test in one place instead of holographically throughout the code. (<a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>) The only advantage would be saving execution time, <em>perhaps</em>, but that's very dubious. I would think on a Pentium III <strong>if( 0 == this ) return;</strong> takes one cycle due to pipelining and branch prediction whereas <strong>if( pComponent ) pComponent->destroy();</strong> would take a dozen cycles if 0 != pComponent. (And maybe the code cache takes a hit.) So, then you have to measure it empirically against real data, and then balance this against the complexity headache. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Be careful about optimizing on the fly. First point, you optimized the exception case not the main case. Second point, subroutine calls and returns, which involve stack manipulation, tend to be some of the more expensive operations you can perform. Most guidelines for optimization that I have seen recommend pushing guard code back to the caller if this level of optimization is needed. Third point, if your system requires optimization of the microprocessor cache in order to work, you are in a highly risky situation. Either recommend faster hardware or change software. You can go from an OO approach to a functional decomposition approach (i.e. go from C++ to C) and even fall back to assembly. For best results, use your programming language in its most common form. If you cannot do this, if you cannot use constructors or destructors in C++ or need to code for caching efficiency, switch to a language that meets your needs. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's exactly right; however we develop for <a href="HandHeld.html">HandHeld</a>s, which have different considerations. For instance, we can't control the hardware, and the hardware capabilities could <em>degrade</em> as we move to future platforms, not increase. Code size is an important optimization target as well. Optimizing a subroutine call away during runtime trades off against extra code throughout the system, which is also not good. (The rationale: how often do you destroy()?) You're right about how tricky this is; the cache argument was just a suggestion to why it's difficult to argue about optimization in a theoretical context like Wiki. Finally, removing constructors and destructors is how you go from C++ to C, which was one aspect of the exercise. Another aspect was code size reduction (25% decrease). -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        <em>I am saying the code gives no clue as to why the pointer might be NULL. This certainly smacks of superstitious code; I don't know why this pointer may be NULL, but bad things will happen if it is, so I'd better check for that case.</em>

        <strong>Maintenance Programmers</strong>

        I think the "poor maintenance programmer" is a myth. Everyone either knows or, if not, they run the unit tests. A general maintenance tip: If you want to know what a line of code does, delete it and then run the program. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

      <p>
        If the maintenance programmer is touching the code, it means there is something to be changed and the existing unit tests are not of value. There is really no need to write unnecessarily cryptic code; it takes little skill and only minor thought to right clear code.

      <p>
        <em>If unit tests have no value whenever you change the code, why write unit tests? -- </em><a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unit tests are of value in refactoring, but if you are changing code, one of two cases exist. One, the unit test failed to catch a problem found in the code, or two, a new function is being added to the code and a new unit test is needed. The existing unit tests cannot verify the new functionality and the new unit tests are as of yet unverified.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But they very much </em>'can<strong> verify that existing functionality continues to work after the new is added. If you're adding functionality that must break an existing unit test, perhaps there is cause to pause and reconsider. -- </strong><a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a><em> </em>

      <p>
        However, the comment that initiated this was that unit tests could be used in place of clear programming to guide a maintenance programmer in changing code. My point is that although unit tests are of value in verifying that code has not changed, they are not a substitute for clear code when code does have to be changed.

        Actually, assignment to <strong>this</strong>, as well as checking for <strong>this</strong>==0 at the beginning of some constructors, was legal and useful in cfront 1.2 (1987), and became obsolete only when cfront 2.0 was released (1989). -- <a href="NikitaBelenki.html">NikitaBelenki</a>
