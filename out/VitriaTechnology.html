        Vitria Technology
      </h1>
      <p>
        Vitria is message oriented middleware (MOM) with business process management (BPM). There are four main development components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Automator</strong> - visual development tool for implementing BPM
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Events</strong> - The messages that flow through the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Channels</strong> - Persistent Message Queues
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Connectors</strong> - Translate, route, and transport events between external systems and Vitria Channels.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Vitria implementations require different patterns and concerns than other architectures. Also, the pitfalls are equally as different.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vitria Problems</strong>
        Vitria, through an effective architecture, solves most middleware problems. However, from an implementation standpoint, Vitria fails in many regards.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Error Handling - Vitria libraries never declare an exception or throw a runtime exception. Returning null is NOT effective error handling, especially when many interfaces are based on String arguments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Container Servers Cannot effectively handle Exceptions - if an exception is thrown, the container server will become unstable and retry the transaction until it blows up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Confusing and overly complex Interfaces
        </li>
        <li>
          Obfuscated Packaging - Why is it that when I'm trying to find a class I feel like a rat in a maze?
        </li>
        <li>
          No use of polymorphism or inheritance for ANYTHING. See Over use of static methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over Emphasis on Automator - Slow, full of bugs, flaky behavior, hard to test, and the list goes on and on. Despite all its shortcomings, it is nearly always required at every Vitria project b/c every client says Automator is the reason they bought Vitria.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over use of static methods - Objects! Who said we need objects?
        </li>
        <li>
          No understanding of API deprecation - A class or method is not "deprecated" until the compiler says so. Vitria seems to believe that a class can be deprecated simply by adding a line to the documentation or by telling people not to use it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The com.vitria.fc.io.Log was deprecated. This was the only class with an effective, simple interface, so Vitria decided to get rid of it. They replaced it with a confusing overly complex framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where do my System.out's go? Vitria, demonstrating their lack of simple Java understanding, failed to realize that the System output and error streams can be redirected to a log. Therefore, messages printed to System.out or System.err will go to never never land (an unviewable console).
        </li>
      </ul>
