        Now you have an outline with a bunch of holes. Fill in the holes and you have a book.

        It works <em>very</em> well if you have a muse. I don't (and more's the pity) but I know people who do.

        <em>A 'muse'?</em>

        muse (IMAGINARY FORCE) noun [C] LITERARY
        an imaginary being or force that gives someone ideas and helps them to write, paint or make music:
        The muse has left me - I haven't written any poetry for months!
        Juliet was not only the painter's best model but also his muse (= the person who causes him to have the most ideas for his work).
      </p>
      <p>
        Muse noun [C] LITERARY
        in ancient Greek and Roman stories, one of the nine goddesses who were believed to give encouragement in different areas of literature, art and music

        <a href="GeraldWeinberg.html">GeraldWeinberg</a> does something similar. He writes pages at a time, and files them. Eventually, some collection of writings form the sketch of a book.

        I once read that KarlFriederichGauss did the same thing - he edited a journal at one point and received a manuscript with a proof in it. He then digs through his own pile of papers, pulls out a half-finished paper of his own that expanded upon the proof that was submitted, finishes it and publishes it too. -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>
