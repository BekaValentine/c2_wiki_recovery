      <p>
        There is a link on <a href="http://67.81.72.42:8000/dave/screen">http://67.81.72.42:8000/dave/screen</a> which points to an empty file. It is not in google's cache or at archive.org. Anyone have the content?
      </p>
      <p>
        Note (20040616) from lists+screen@bigfatdave.com (the guy running 67.81.72.42:8000, which bigfatdave.com is a shortcut to, incidentally): It appears the contents of that file were lost during the Great Crash (TM), while I was trying out reiserfs on my main data partition.  I lost many good files that day and did many restores during the following couple of weeks, but I'm way too lazy to dig up my backups from that far back now.  If anybody really wants the control key remapping, I'm willing to reconstruct the file from scratch.  It won't take me very long, so don't feel bad about asking; I just need somebody to actually care about the thing to make it worth my time to redo the silly file.  (Note to anybody who knows how to use Wikis: I've got no clue, so feel free to fix my style or whatever.  I won't bite; promise.)

        Would You be so kind and reconstruct this file? I thought gnu screen is a great solution for keyboard layout, until I encountered issues with control keys. Please!
