        Posix Standard
      </h1>
      <p>
        POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is an operating system interface standardized by ISO/IEC, IEEE and The Open Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a bunch of standards for "<a href="UnixLike.html">UnixLike</a>" APIs, all called POSIX followed by some obscure serial number. Adhering to the <a href="PosixStandard.html">PosixStandard</a> is supposed to make a system sufficiently <a href="UnixLike.html">UnixLike</a> that porting programs to it is easy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can download the standard at <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/publications/catalog/t912.htm.">http://www.opengroup.org/publications/catalog/t912.htm.</a>
