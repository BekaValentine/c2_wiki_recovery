        From any two-year-old's repetoire of annoying behavior:
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask "Why?" To the response ask "Why?" Continue until smacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        This technique is useful in:

           Simplifying requirements and dealing with <a href="LeadingRequest.html">LeadingRequest</a>s

        I used to get caught in the <em>why-cycle</em> with my children until I chose to interpret the question as "tell me more about that". For each "Why?" I would offer a different observation without straying too far from the original point. Each response would elicit another "Why?" until I finally hit on the desired information and got a simple "Oh" in place of why.
      </p>

        Asking "Why store that?" remains a great way to transform attributes into requirements. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        But some times, the Customer doesn't believe you need to <a href="AskWhy.html">AskWhy</a> (<a href="OnlySayThingsThatCanBeHeard.html">OnlySayThingsThatCanBeHeard</a>) and in those cases, it can be really difficult to find a way to ask why without asking why.
