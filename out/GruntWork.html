        Grunt Work
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="GruntWork.html">GruntWork</a> has to be done, and it is trivially done, but a lot of programmers just don't like to waste their time doing it.It is the kind of work that a <a href="GruntProgrammer.html">GruntProgrammer</a> does well, repetitive stuff like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          renaming variables
        </li>
        <li>
          adding references to already designed style sheets
        </li>
        <li>
          making sure that the button to to X is 3 pixels to the right and not 6 pixels to the right of button Y
        </li>
        <li>
          adding the images for all those buttons
        </li>
        <li>
          renaming database elements (refactoring database)
        </li>
        <li>
          detect all the unused variables and delete them
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In summary the kind of work that a good quality IDE or Framework can make unnecessary (or at least far less boring and repetitive).
