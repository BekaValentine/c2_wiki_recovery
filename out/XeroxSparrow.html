        The current state of the web is strongly biased towards reading previously authored documents. Changes and additions to the page are solely the purview of the original author. Sparrow promotes a different genre of web page: the community-shared page. Like any web page, a community-shared page is originally crafted by a single author, who defines the initial content and scope of the document. But unlike other web pages, a community-shared page can be modified or added to by any interested contributor, and the barriers for doing so are lessened by allowing changes to be made in a lightweight manner. Community-shared pages increase the collaborative capability of the web.

        After a quick look, Sparrow looks quite interesting, but also more complex than
        a Wiki Wiki. It's not publicly released (yet), but you can see examples at the
        web site. -- LairdPopkin
