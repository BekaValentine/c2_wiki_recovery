        <em>Hi Bob. You might want to look at the </em><a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a> and not use mono-space - it's easier to read if you use bullet points for example. Welcome to <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, you might want to read <a href="WelcomeVisitors.html">WelcomeVisitors</a>, and we look forward to your contributions.<em></em>

        You also seem to be heading to a bit of a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>, which is frowned upon here. If you think it is relevant to the purpose of this wiki, then linking pages like <a href="ActionResearch.html">ActionResearch</a> into relevant other pages might help (as it happens, this author does have an interest in <a href="ActionResearch.html">ActionResearch</a>, but that may not be widely shared by other readers)
