        Pass The Book On
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you're finished with an exceptionally good book, for instance, it has sat gathering dust on your shelf for a year, write:
      </p>
      <p>
        PASS THIS BOOK ON
      </p>
      <p>
        on the book and write your email address in the book. Then give it to a friend. Tell her to pass it on when she's done.
      </p>

        A problem with this is that you miss out on the benefit of re-reading a book over time ("You never cross the same river twice - because you have changed, and the river has changed." (<a href="RiverOfTime.html">RiverOfTime</a>))
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe buy two copies of a book that impacts you so significantly that you can't decide whether to <a href="PassTheBookOn.html">PassTheBookOn</a> or to keep it.

        Well, I wrote this topic because I have a bunch of books on my shelf that I have not referenced in years (a few remain unread... never buy more than one book at a time!). I am now inclined to take the writer's advice below and recycle most of them.

        <strong>Don't pass on mediocre books: recycle them.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Only pass on the good books. If you thought reading the book was a waste of your time, recycle it.

        <em>Shouldn't you try to sell it to someone else, first? Just because the book was useless to you doesn't make it useless to everyone.</em>
