        It has a few limitations, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The numeric tower isn't fully implemented (missing rationals)
        </li>
        <li>
           eval only accepts one argument, so you can't pass it an environment
        </li>
        <li>
           non-hygienic macros
        </li>
        <li>
           macros do not allow top level definitions.  <em>i.e.</em> (macro (foo args) (`(define (bar) ....))) is invalid.
        </li>
        <li>
           only "macro" and "define" are allowed at the top level of a source program
        </li>
        <li>
           no native error/exception handling.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Despite these limitations, <a href="LispMe.html">LispMe</a> is still good to work with.

           You have a pocket REPL to play with.  Learn Scheme on the bus! On the toilet! In a long queue at the bar!

           <a href="LispMe.html">LispMe</a> makes a great calculator.

           With Rsrc Edit (A <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> based resource editor for making gui's), you can make your own simple palm applications in hours, or less.

        <li>
           Use PluckerSoftware, get yourself a copy of <a href="StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.html">StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms</a> and away you go.  Same goes with <a href="HowToDesignPrograms.html">HowToDesignPrograms</a>.  Hours of learning fun!

        It would be nice to have a couple tests to show common uses such as memo read/write, pen events, graphics, controls, <em>etc</em>. The <a href="LispMe.html">LispMe</a> page has examples but these are a bit verbose. I'm thinking something built on the <a href="LispMeObjects.html">LispMeObjects</a> (for example (class 'file ...)) and posted here.

        <em>I am slowly but surely working on a </em><a href="CellularAutomata.html">CellularAutomata</a> program, and I will eventually have it draw the CA on screen.  Once I have that finished, I'd be willing to post the code here.  A set of <a href="LispMeObjects.html">LispMeObjects</a> that talks to memopad, graphics, and even a Graphical toolkit would really be the Cats Buttocks. What do you say we make it go?  -- <a href="JonathanArkell.html">JonathanArkell</a>

        <em>Actually, the more I use </em><a href="LispMe.html">LispMe</a>, the more I think that trying to build some kind of LispmeFoundationClasses would be like putting legs on a snake. The built-ins seem quite useable and elegant.  I guess we will see how that changes after 6 months however. ;)<em> -- ja</em>
