        Test Database
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TestDatabase.html">TestDatabase</a> is a <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> or <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> for 
        mocking a database.  It uses a genuine database as the <a href="MockDatabase.html">MockDatabase</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>One Context:</strong>  (There are probably others that this pattern applies to.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The GUI and most business logic are written in Microsoft <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> 6.0 using ADO -- it expects the <a href="ConnectionString.html">ConnectionString</a>s anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data is stored in a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>, such as Microsoft Sql Server.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You do not want to mix production data and test data, for fear of:
          <ul>
            <li>
               contaminating (or accidentally deleting) your production data
            </li>
            <li>
               production data changes, causing false alarms in the tests.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Possibly, your DBA may prohibit have tables in the production database that are used only for testing.
        </li>
        <li>
           Your DBA may be willing to provide a database on a test server where you are the database owner, and you can change the test database's schema arbitrarily.
        </li>
        <li>
           It is awkward to change SQL queries to call test tables in a production database (as opposed to production tables in that same database).
        </li>
        <li>
           If there are separate test and production databases, and the schemas of the databases match closely enough, the same SQL queries can be used against both databases.
        </li>
        <li>
           Visual Basic 6.0 does not support <a href="ImplementationInheritance.html">ImplementationInheritance</a>, so it is easier to call a real database for testing purposes than to call a set of objects that pretend to be a database.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Possible Solution:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Build 2 relational databases.  
          <ol>
            <li>
               One is the production database, and contains production data.
            </li>
            <li>
               The other is the test database.  Its contents can be changed arbitrarily, and the users will never need to know.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The program has 2 modes:  testing and production.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Write a single function, such as TestAll.IsInTestMode(), that returns the mode.
            </li>
            <li>
               Optionally, the TestAll.TestAllModules() subroutine sets the mode to test mode at the beginning of the tests, and restores the mode to production mode at the end of the tests.
            </li>
            <li>
               Optionally, the program executable can have a /testdb flag that sets the mode to test mode.
            </li>
            <li>
               By default, the released program is in production mode.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All code that calls the database makes its connections based on a <a href="ConnectionString.html">ConnectionString</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               There is a single function that returns the <a href="ConnectionString.html">ConnectionString</a>.  It calls TestAll.IsInTestMode() to choose which <a href="ConnectionString.html">ConnectionString</a> to return.  
            </li>
            <li>
               The only code that hard codes or constructs a <a href="ConnectionString.html">ConnectionString</a> is in this function.  
            </li>
            <li>
               Any code that calls the database must (via program convention) use this function.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Build the following schema verification code into your test harness:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Does every (tested) table or query in the production database exist in the test database?  And <em>vice versa</em>.  
            </li>
            <li>
               Does every (tested) field in the production database exist in the test database?  And <em>vice versa</em>.  
            </li>
            <li>
               Does every (tested) field in the production database have the same / close-enough data type in the test database?
            </li>
            <li>
               Does every (tested) view in the production database have the same / close-enough SQL code as the corresponding view in the test database?  And <em>vice versa</em>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When needed, the test harness can delete all data in the test database table(s).
          <ul>
            <li>
               Small amounts of test data can be replaced using hard-coded queries.
            </li>
            <li>
               Large amounts of test data can be loaded from text files.  The text files can be (excerpts of) snapshots of the production database.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>HighRisk:<strong>  Maintenance programmers need to know not to hard-code </strong><a href="ConnectionString.html">ConnectionString</a>s to the production database.  If an insert or delete query is made to the production database using a hard-coded <a href="ConnectionString.html">ConnectionString</a>, there is a HighRisk that calling the test code will modify the production database.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Duplication:</strong> Parts of the database schema are stored in three places:
          <ul>
            <li>
               The production database.
            </li>
            <li>
               The <a href="TestDatabase.html">TestDatabase</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               The files and hard-codings used to store the test data.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Repeatable Demo Data:  Optionally, the test data can be left in the <a href="TestDatabase.html">TestDatabase</a> after the test run is completed.  This allows the developers to demo the software, either using the /testdb flag, or in the debugger with the mode set to test mode.  At any time, the demo data can be reset to standard values by running the tests.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Discussion:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is <a href="TestDatabase.html">TestDatabase</a> a pattern - or is it an anti-pattern?  Time will tell.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may be a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>, not just a single pattern.
      </p>

        ' <em>Large amounts of test data can be loaded from text files.  The text files can be (excerpts of) snapshots of the production database.</em> '
      </p>
      <p>
        Or you can generate it even <em>before</em> you have the production to take a snapshot of. For that you need a <a href="TestDataGenerator.html">TestDataGenerator</a> tool.
