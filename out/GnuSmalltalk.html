        Unlike <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a>, <a href="GnuSmalltalk.html">GnuSmalltalk</a> isn't a full environment.  However, it also doesn't tie you down in a really ugly environment.  Given bindings to good <a href="GuiToolkit.html">GuiToolkit</a>, this Smalltalk could be really good.

        <em>What is not full about it? It does have a class browser and all that.</em>

      <p>
        Recent(6/2004) versions have an IDE based on the TK toolkit.

           This comment appears to have been made prior to 29 Jul 2003, since apparently there was such an announcement for the <strong>stable</strong> version on that day. (I wish people would date comments when they say "today". It's not going to be "today" for very long.)

        I've been having a few problems getting <a href="GnuSmalltalk.html">GnuSmalltalk</a> to compile on <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>. Has anyone else tried this? -- <a href="ChadThompson.html">ChadThompson</a>

        I tried to do that today.  I couldn't even get ./configure to work, as it froze while "checking whether a fault handler according to <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> PowerPC works..."  Has anybody had any success? -- Andy Greenberg

        <em>I just [2004-04-13] tried 2.1.7 on </em><a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> 10.3.3+fink 0.7. configure does lock up there, but a few lines back it tells you "If something locks up here, please reconfigure with --disable-generational-gc". Using that option it configured, but compilation failed with an infinite #include loop on /usr/include/sys/poll.h. Fiddling with that I got it to compile, but it won't install, some of the makefiles has some error where it's missing a parameter on a mkdir. Well, it's at least partially installed, and I can get into the interpreter, but I can't figure out how to get the browser to come up yet. Not sure it's all there right.<em></em>

        The last version of GNUSmalltalk I got to compile under Solaris 8 was 2.1.3; I had to d/l and install the latest version of autoconf and regenerate the configure script (from configure.ac) just to get it to run, but it fails to compile. With some ham-handed meddling with the code I've gotten it to compile, but it won't run (not surprisingly).
      </p>
      <p>
        Under Linux, the configure script complained a lot less, and with some minor meddling in the code (not quite so ham-handed), I got it to compile and to run, but I've misplaced my notes as to how to set up BLOX (the gui environment), so I haven't played with that one TOO much.
      </p>

        I haven't tried to configure & compile it on <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> yet.

        The <a href="GreatComputerLanguageShootout.html">GreatComputerLanguageShootout</a> uses this version of <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> for their benchmarks, where it is currently last on the list!  <a href="SmugSmalltalkWeenie.html">SmugSmalltalkWeenie</a>s wanted to bring it up to date with the rest of the languages.

        It is not actually part of the <a href="GnuCompilerCollection.html">GnuCompilerCollection</a>; <a href="GnuSmalltalk.html">GnuSmalltalk</a> doesn't use any of the front-, middle-, or back-end of the <a href="GnuCompilerCollection.html">GnuCompilerCollection</a>.  It isn't even a native-code compiler; it compiles to a Smalltalk <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> (as is standard for Smalltalk).
