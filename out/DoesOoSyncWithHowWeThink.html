        Does Oo Sync With How We Think

        The paper just says that C++ is a shitty language. A lot of people on this wiki agree with that. I really don't see any evidence that programming in <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> or <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> or <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> is worse. Also, the projects that it compares are significantly different. (<a href="AurelianoCalvo.html">AurelianoCalvo</a>)
