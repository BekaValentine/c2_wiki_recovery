        Competitive Salary
      </h1>
      <p>
        Competitive, of course depends on who the company feels it competes with.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I worked at Chevron, they said, "The top three oil companies."  
      </p>
      <p>
        At GE, they said, "Upper third of industrial research labs and national labs." The national labs, of course, do not pay nearly as well, in many cases, as more risky industrial jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        At CTC, they said, "National medians for similar positions in industry and the government."  Here we're no longer trying be at the front of the pack, but are aiming for the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, who are you competing with?

        What if you are producing a <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a> ( no known competitor )?

        Isn't the company competing with you? --ss

        A <a href="CompetitiveSalary.html">CompetitiveSalary</a> might not be enough for a company to retain its top talent.
