        <a href="WikiCourier.html">WikiCourier</a> is a temporary ID set up in Mar05 to assist with people caught by ?temporary changes at C2 to stop the flood of abuses to the site.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It signifies the attempts made by the person(s) with C2 edit access (sporadic at this moment) to transport IMPORTANT changes (e.g. home page contact info) from another wiki site (currently at Meatball, see CtwoHomePageChangeRequest there).
      </p>
      <p>
        No warranty on accuracy of changes. Please check and inform errors made in transfer (at temp site).
