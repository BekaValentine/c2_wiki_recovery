        Make Loops Apparent

        Pattern: <strong>Make Loops Apparent</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        ...this pattern helps complete the <a href="SimplyUnderstoodCode.html">SimplyUnderstoodCode</a>
        pattern. This pattern helps solve the problem of making loops
        easy to understand in a chunk of code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loops are an instance of code that might not be read from
        top-to-bottom and therefore can be disorienting
      </p>
      <p>
        People prefer to read code from top to bottom because that is how they
        read text. When a program cannot be understood reading linearly,
        disorientation can occur. A program that cannot be understood reading
        linearly typically has a non-linear control structure, and people
        sometimes need to read such programs in control-structure order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Few programs have a purely linear control structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most common examples of a non-linear control structure is
        the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if a loop can be understood as whole or as a black box, the
        loop can be considered as an atomic unit in the program, and
        top-to-bottom text reading can be maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore,</em> Make loops apparent and make their expression as idiomatic as possible.

        There are various ways to achieve this. One is to use the loop
        operations in the programming language you're using. There is
        sometimes a temptation to use lower-level operations in the language
        to implement your own loops, but rarely does this result in easily
        understandable code. See the pattern <a href="UseBuiltInLoops.html">UseBuiltInLoops</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to achieve simply apparent loops is to use the mechanism
        for defining functions or procedures in the programming language you
        use. If you imagine that the parameters are the local variables in
        your loop, and a recursive call represents an iterative step, such a
        loop might be easily understood. See the pattern <a href="FunctionsForLoops.html">FunctionsForLoops</a>.
      </p>

        Bad PHP programmers often find a new way to make loops unapparent, to wit:
      </p>
      <code>
        {<br/>
        ... pages and pages of code<br/>
        } while (condition)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It's bad enough I already have to decipher PHP ;), but not even knowing you're in a loop until I get to the end makes Hulk very angry.
