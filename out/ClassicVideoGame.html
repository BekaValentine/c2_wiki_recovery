        Classic Video Game
      </h1>
      <p>
        Usually an old <a href="VideoGame.html">VideoGame</a>. One that is remembered by hoards of pasty faced geeks with fondness. I guess you could also include the really good modern games such as Q3 and the wonderful Half-Life too.
      </p>

        <em>I would consider Quake to be a classic. Quake III isn't even close.</em>

        There are a few key terms which differentiate periods of VideoGameDevelopment. These are common terms, and the exact dates vary somewhat.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>classic</em> - generally refers to vector-graphic games, like Asteroids.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>classic arcade</em> - pushes forward into the first primitive sprite-based games, like Joust, <a href="PacMan.html">PacMan</a>, DonkeyKong, and the like. Yes, <em>classic</em> games are already arcade-only.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>old school</em> - almost interchangeable with "original Nintendo game" or other game of the mid-80s. Once millions of people were playing Video Games at home, a precedent was set. With this era, the <em>classic</em> Video Game became well-defined as a period.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>older</em> - any primitive 3D game with flat-shaded polygons falls here. <a href="PlayStation.html">PlayStation</a> games, N64 games, and 3D PC games.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Video Game</em> - whatever is currently in vogue with a large player base. Grand Theft Auto is a current example.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Next-Gen</em> - a game which is planned for release in the next technology-cycle, or a game which is thought to be indicative of trends which will carry over into the next technology-cycle.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Classic games must pass the same test as any classic. There's a reason why a Mustang is a classic but a Pinto isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Cars are one of the poorest examples you can give, because there really are "hard definitions" of classic: for example, see </em><a href="http://www.dot10.state.pa.us/pdotforms/fact_sheets/fs-ant.pdf.">http://www.dot10.state.pa.us/pdotforms/fact_sheets/fs-ant.pdf.</a> Legally, a Pinto is a classic. On the other hand, I don't know of any video game aficionado who wouldn't consider, for example, MULE or Civilization or Balance of Power to be a "classic".<em></em>
