        Non-editable <a href="BackUp.html">BackUp</a> pages corresponding to past versions of wiki pages. On this wiki, they have a limited life (see below), and successive history pages correspond to different editors.

        The history pages are deleted by a cron script to save disk space when they are over some fixed age on the order of four days. Also, the page save logic keeps only the last of sequential saves from one author with the consequence of suspicious but harmless gaps in numbering. But, until recently, deleting a page would reset the revision number leading to overwriting of history in the presence of delete wars. This undesirable behavior was fixed in mid October, 2004, by checking for history when creating new pages. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        This site is now keeping additional <a href="HistoryPages.html">HistoryPages</a> beyond that offered by <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>. Volunteers who take care of the occasional lost page will find some old pages stored in plain text at <a href="http://c2.com/wiki/history.">http://c2.com/wiki/history.</a> I intend to limit their retention to only a few days. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
