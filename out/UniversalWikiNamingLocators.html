        Universal Wiki Naming Locators
      </h1>
      <p>
        Universal Wiki Naming Locators is an abstraction waiting to be objectified.
      </p>
      <p>
        The potential of linking wikis has been discussed utilizing a number of concepts. Some say that the concept and implementation is <a href="TooComplex.html">TooComplex</a> to be realized. This page is an attempt to MakeTheComplexSimple and is a <a href="CallForCollaboration.html">CallForCollaboration</a> in the design and specification of a process or technique which would utilize an apparatus called <a href="UniversalWikiNamingLocators.html">UniversalWikiNamingLocators</a> as a HyperlinkingProcess which would be based on slightly modified <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is different from URLs in that multiple locations could be displayed when more than one link is located for the next link.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not about a new protocol. This location system would utilize HTTP and URLs, and not require alteration in any way of existing browsers, protocols, and wikis. A prefix method where hyperlinks would be could be enhanced to refer to more than one page or site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The change could be present in a base wiki-engine, running on the machine connected to the Internet. It could handle references by way of hyperlinks, and could be continuously present as the display frame for the wiki-session. The representation via the browser could utilize the frame mechanism already present in HTML and XML.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe a page can be created using frames where one or more of the frames can be browsing windows to the Web. This is the concept. As stated in the introduction, this "is an abstraction waiting to be objectified." 
        This is the place where the realization of such a concept can be discussed and where collaboration on making it a reality can occur.

        Wikis download every time a link is clicked. This proposal doesn't change that. It does change the downloading possibilities to multiple links, similar to the offerings a search engine presents when a search term is presented. While similar, there is a difference in that a resident filtering mechanism exists which limits where the acceptable links are located.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Possible Configurations</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        PrefixConfigurations 
      </p>
      <p>
        Three Proposals
      </p>
      <p>
        A universal wiki prefix configuration (let's call this one dynamic) 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           with the list containing the prefix (all that would go before the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> in securing the link) 
        </li>
        <li>
           This would be maintained on one of many specialized wiki search engines. Let's call the first one temporarily "WikiFind" 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A short list of an example of a list now exists as InterMapTxt. 
        A filtered wiki prefix configuration (let's call this one static)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           with the list containing entries which are preferred wikis arranged in order of preference. 
        </li>
        <li>
           sent as filters with the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> to WikiFind and would shorten the return matches to only those the inquirer wishes to query
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An alternate wiki prefix configuration 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           which would contain a list of wikis which have existed in the local area network or intranet of the inquirers machine
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Flexibiility Comprehensiveness and Speed
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This setup would leave the door open for a great number of wiki page search engines 
        </li>
        <li>
           The resulting competition might lead to the emergence of one or two predominant search engines
          <ul>
            <li>
               providing fast response
            </li>
            <li>
               and most complete coverage
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You would not have to change the browser if the search engine returns the responses as a wiki page which you could save to your machine (in my case to my <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>). As a result of the collaboration here, the design of the returned page could be structured as a multiframe page.
