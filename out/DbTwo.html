        <a href="DbTwo.html">DbTwo</a> (DB2) was probably the second commercial implementation of a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>. <a href="DbTwo.html">DbTwo</a> was originally named DRDA and was first introduced on the IBM MiniComputer System/36. Note <a href="DrCodd.html">DrCodd</a> laid out much of the theoretical foundations which we now take for granted.

        Some said it was offered to companies free of charge initially to entice them to use this <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> product over <a href="IbmIms.html">IbmIms</a>, then go buy more <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> machine to keep it running, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this date, <a href="DbTwo.html">DbTwo</a> remain one of the most important <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> databases. It probably lag in features when compared to competitors, but had been remarkably reliable on what it could do.

        <strong>Discussion</strong>

      <p>
        <em>I wonder whether it means the </em><a href="LegacyApplication.html">LegacyApplication</a> and <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a> developers all have to learn Java or plan to retire?  What about those people who has become <a href="MicrosoftSlave.html">MicrosoftSlave</a> through successes of <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        'The pre-retirees aren't sweating this too much. RPG on the IseriesPlatform is very ingrained and Java is seen as upstart by managers for the most part unless of course J2EE & Websphere is a part of the tooling for the company' -- 216.191.144.242

      <p>
        I'm presently working on one of those so-called <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> machines. It's the iSeries (aka AS/400). Java is seen as the new comer and it's adoption is pretty slow on the iSeries. The most common language on the iSeries is the <a href="RpgLanguage.html">RpgLanguage</a>. Just as a side note <a href="RpgLanguage.html">RpgLanguage</a> runs only on the iSeries. <a href="RpgLanguage.html">RpgLanguage</a> is pretty limited and people are used to that little box as to what they can do. I'm sure the old timers are pretty intimidated by Java and all its Strange New Functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've presently got 1 project that runs in Java on the iSeries and we had to fight to keep Java development going. I've just pitched in to help out with that as I'm one of the only other developers here who have experience on other platforms beyond the iSeries. -<a href="JoshuaRobinson.html">JoshuaRobinson</a>

        <strong>Second Opinion</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I too am presently working on a <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> machine, only in my case it's an IBM System/390 (soon to be zSeries) Mainframe.
        My banking/brokerage application suite (consisting of many hundreds of batch and online programs--not sure of exact number) is written predominantly in COBOL/CICS/<a href="DbTwo.html">DbTwo</a>.  There is a Web-based interface, but I am not sure whether it uses <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> or plain old <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, VB, ASP, <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>, and probably a sprinkling of <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.  In any case, from the point of view of the Web application, the Mainframe serves purely as a data base server.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I opine to my mainframe colleagues that in twenty years (at most), <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> applications will be virtually extinct, meaning no more COBOL or CICS, and that the DB2 will run in conjunction with languages like Java and paradigms such as Web Services, I am regarded as slightly mad, or at the very least a heretic.  -- <a href="JohnReynoldsTheStudent.html">JohnReynoldsTheStudent</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You may be right, except for the "</em><a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> applications will be virtually extinct" and the "no more COBOL or CICS" part.  Twenty years ago, people were claiming exactly the same thing, though you can replace "languages like Java and paradigms such as Web Services" with the more generic "PC technology."  We've yet to see it happen, and given the fact that for things <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> machines do, they do really, really well, I think it's unlikely.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        "We have yet to see it happen..." Indeed, The Voorhis has not yet seen it happen, because nothing happens before the fullness of time.  Ripeness is all, as the bard says.  <a href="JohnReynoldsTheStudent.html">JohnReynoldsTheStudent</a> merely points out that in its fifth decade, mainframe technology is very ripe, perhaps pungently so.  And as for the things that <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> machines "do really, really well"--what exactly are the insurmountable technical limitations which, in twenty years time, would prevent PC technology from doing those things equally well, or better?  Inquiring minds want to know. 
        --<a href="JohnReynoldsTheStudent.html">JohnReynoldsTheStudent</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A good question.  What </em><a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> machines do very well is support exceedingly high transaction rates exceedingly reliably (uptime measured in decades) with relatively low software development and deployment costs, relatively low management, maintenance and running costs, and centralised, highly manageable and verifiable security.  You can achieve effectively the same thing with a cluster of PC technology machines, but at the expense of more complicated development and deployment, and the expensive of higher maintenance costs due to unit failures.  For certain banking applications or large databases like the UK's TV license records, this can be significant.  Perhaps not significant enough that clusters of cheap computing units won't be used effectively for certain new applications, but significant enough that existing applications often do not warrant redevelopment, and significant enough that certain new applications will warrant <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a>.

        <em>BTW, I wonder if this exchange might be better suited to the </em><a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> page than <a href="DbTwo.html">DbTwo</a>.  Any objection if I move it there?<em> -- DV</em>

      <p>
        The article pointed to in the link is noteworthy for a number of reasons: (1) While the article speaks a good deal about customers' interest in running JAVA, UNIX and LINUX on IBM Mainframes, it makes not a single mention of either COBOL, CICS or DB2 (or, for that matter, the more recent MQ Series)--supposedly the workhorses of IBM Mainframe technology;
        (2) the article is written by an IBM marketing "guru" (3) the main audience for this article would appear to be governmental entities in the UAE, which may say something about where IBM perceives the bigggest growth opportunities for mainframes to be.
