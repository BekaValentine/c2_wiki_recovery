      <p>
        F: Anybody here knows what a LikeButton is?
      </p>
      <p>
        J: Yes, you find it in most of the <a href="SocialNetwork.html">SocialNetwork</a>s
      </p>
      <p>
        F: You know what effect it produces?
      </p>
      <p>
        J: Yes, if a person in Facebook e.g. gets Likes, then this improves his/her EdgeRank, that is something similar to a <a href="PageRank.html">PageRank</a>...
      </p>
      <p>
        F: Now I suggest a <a href="LikePlusButton.html">LikePlusButton</a>, that works like the LikeButton but in combination with <a href="MicroPayment.html">MicroPayment</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        J: I think this could be done as an app for all appropriate <a href="SocialNetwork.html">SocialNetwork</a>s that offer some API.
      </p>
      <p>
        F: You see the additional benefits for this game-like improvement?
      </p>
      <p>
        J: Yes, a LikePlus really produces a sort of income for those people who give the most pleasure or usefulness to their peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        F: We need <a href="MicroPayment.html">MicroPayment</a> providers with a zero provision for the Microtransactions, delivering an IframePayButton, that can be used on Websites, Blogs, and as an app in <a href="SocialNetwork.html">SocialNetwork</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        J: I hope that there are enough providers, who allow a  provision of zero percent apart from transmitting the accumulated money back to one's own bank account.
      </p>
      <p>
        F: Really, how about the initial load?
      </p>
      <p>
        J: The initial load with some cents, can be done via lossless micropay for the receiver.
      </p>
      <p>
        F: And the transfer from the Micropayment Account to the convential Home Bank Account of the owner?
      </p>
      <p>
        J: .. can be done via e.g. <a href="PayPal.html">PayPal</a> with their usual fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        F: Can you tell me the social provider of Micropay transactions who offers zero cost transfers as an option.
      </p>
      <p>
        J: Yes, it's <a href="http://YourCent.com">http://YourCent.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        F: Is there a Facebookpage for YourCent?
      </p>
      <p>
        J: Yes you can find it via internal FB search.
      </p>
      <p>
        F: I suggest two things.
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) If someone in the target wikis or forums (to which this Pad is copied) doesn't want to have their contribution under <a href="CcBySa.html">CcBySa</a>, please mark it explicitly so that we don't copy it back, but only
      </p>
      <p>
        quote it under fair use.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Write an app for Facebook and make possibly 750 Million people happy to earn possibly a lot of pennies even with oneliners.
      </p>
      <p>
        J: Let me quote the WelcomeMessage of the <a href="WikiLike.html">WikiLike</a> <a href="PiratePad.html">PiratePad</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        " Welcome to <a href="PiratePad.html">PiratePad</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        This pad text is synchronized as you type, so that everyone viewing this page sees the same text. This allows you to collaborate seamlessly on documents with no EditConflict s! "

        The author also posted this post on the twinpage <a href="http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/LikePlusButton,">http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/LikePlusButton,</a> where some more <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> links might be resolved.

        <em>Somebody deleted my page, why that? I think it is such a useful contribution to the community, that it doesn't deserve it. -- </em><a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a><em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {I recall the deleter (not me) described it as "spammy".  It looks somewhat like a thinly-disguised promotion of what appear to be commercial ventures: <a href="http://YourCent.com,">http://YourCent.com,</a> <a href="PiratePad.html">PiratePad</a>, etc.  Certainly the tone is more promotional than scientifically critical, and that tends to raise a bit of suspicion these days.}

      <p>
        <em>Dear anon, thank you for your feedback. I reformulated my contribution, that it becomes obvious, that it is no promotion with a commercial interest. Indeed I am not affiliated in any way with the quoted entities. </em><a href="PiratePad.html">PiratePad</a> is AFIK the highest developed <a href="EtherPad.html">EtherPad</a>, because it allows Wiki links. YourCent is to my knowledge the only <a href="MicroPayment.html">MicroPayment</a> provider who allows the user to determine their support by zero to hundred percent. So I claim it as a useful contribution to the community, especially the programmer community of <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>. -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a><em></em>
        <em>PS.: By the way: I see that in c2 nobody has mentionned the </em><a href="EtherPad.html">EtherPad</a> technology yet, that allows JointEditing in modeless Wysiwyg with a couple of persons, eliminating EditConflict s, marking individual contributions in different colors. However, if their <a href="CcBySa.html">CcBySa</a> document relocates in the Web as black and white, this information gets lost. To keep it, we develop a new conversational style, where the tweetlike microcontributions are preserved via Shortcut Signatures.<em></em>

        This looks very interesting to me and I had not heard of it before. I have started to explore <a href="PiratePad.html">PiratePad</a> and also expand these pages. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
