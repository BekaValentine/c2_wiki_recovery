        Helper Function
      </h1>
      <p>
        Functions have two main purposes: aiding code reusability and breaking down a task into smaller logical units.  Functions that do not aid code reusability are helper functions; their sole purpose is to "help" a single function by cleaning the code and making the logic clearer.  The opposite of a helper function is a library function, which focuses on code reuse.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Helper functions are often very concrete as each one is used in a small section of code.  On the other hand, library functions are very abstract, allowing them to be used in multiple projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a function is only used a single time, it is probably a helper function.

        From the below quote, it appears that what I call a library function, others call a helper function.

        From <a href="AreLongAndDescriptiveRelated.html">AreLongAndDescriptiveRelated</a>:
        In my book, a function that is called more than ten times in a program is almost certainly a "helper" function.)  I and my friend, we do not, because the longer the names of "helper" functions are, the less they "help"...
