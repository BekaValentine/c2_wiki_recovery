      <p>
        Susan Lilly is a software engineer, knowledge hacker, model maker, and sometime cartoonist at SRA Incorporated, a technology service company in the Washington, DC, area. (Yes, she's is the same Susan Lilly who used to work at IBM, and wrote for Object Magazine.)

        You can reach Susan at: <a href="mailto:susan_lilly@sra.com.">mailto:susan_lilly@sra.com.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        She's currently working on an internal project to put together an infrastructure for knowledge sharing on a range of technical subjects. After hearing her gripe about her desire to remove the <em>gatekeeper</em> mentality, MaheshDodani told her she should check out <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. He was right.
