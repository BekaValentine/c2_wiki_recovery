        I must have read it the first time when 12 or so, but didn't remember its title and only stumbled upon it 20 years later here on c2. I was astonished how much I remembered. I once considered using mycroftxxx as a password, but considering the renownedness of the book (which I didn't expect) not using it seems to have been wise. -- <a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a>

           One of his 4 <a href="HugoAward.html">HugoAward</a> winners; Heinlein considered it his best book, and most agree; a classic; one of the best 100 <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> novels of all time in every such poll; I've read it at least a dozen times over the decades. Don't bother borrowing it before buying. Run, do not walk, to your nearest bookstore/amazon web page. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        The late "Gharlane of Eddore" / David Potter responded to a critic of this book: <em>Of course, the fact that it's the single best historical novel, and analysis of the economics of revolution, ever penned, might have something to do with it.</em>
