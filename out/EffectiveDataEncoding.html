        Effective Data Encoding

        It must be made clear that we are talking about data encoding, not algorithm coding (i.e. writing an algorithm in a programming language). 
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to collect on this page answers to questions such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Why encode data?
        </li>
        <li>
           What are the best encoding mechanisms?
        </li>
        <li>
           When should data not be encoded?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Why encode data?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is encoded for efficiency of storage, and efficiency of entry (notes that storage efficiency is applicable to any storage medium, a hard disk, or a price sticker). I think we can generalize and say that data is encoded for efficiency of usage.

        <strong>Example</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like "Net 30" for "The total of this invoice (product total plus taxes and shipping, minus discounts = net) is due to be paid in full within 30 days." Or, one might use "N30" in a computer system to avoid parsing "Net 30", "Net30", "net 30", etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't like this page's definition of encoding. The sentence in the above example is also an encoding. It puts a concept into bytes. "Why encode data?" is a silly question, since it implies that data would be data without being encoded. But if data is in the computer, it must be encoded, some way or another.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Quite right. The string, "The total of this invoice (product total plus taxes and shipping, minus discounts = net) is due to be paid in full within 30 days.", is encoded as a sequence of <a href="AsciiCode.html">AsciiCode</a> characters. (...or <a href="UniCode.html">UniCode</a>, depending on your rendering mechanism. ;-)

        The main reason I started this page is that I wanted to read more about data coding, as I read about it in the Kendall & Kendall systems analysis and design book. Unfortunately, the word coding, at least on this wiki, is used only to refer to coding programs, and program's code. I want to learn more about data coding but I can't find good material.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know how appropriate it would be to just summarize what I learned from Kendalls' book in here, since 90% of what I know on the topic is the few pages I read in that book. But if I can't repeat what I learned, how can it become useful?
      </p>
      <p>
        The book talks about data coding as a means for efficient data entry - a system user uses a code to refer to something or describe something. Data codes are not just reference, since they can carry information. For example, an employee code can be RND-1003-SA; this can be decoded to mean Systems analyst hired on October (10th month) 2003. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The book says codes can serve many purposes and have many types; a code can be use to
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Refer to things
        </li>
        <li>
           Hide/conceal information
        </li>
        <li>
           Reveal information
        </li>
        <li>
           Request action
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you think of a code only as a relational database primary key, you will confuse yourself, since most designers will use separate columns to refer to many things, and will use a different mechanism to conceal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, as systems developers, you might be asked to code or encode (I am not sure encode is a better word, code seems fine) data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe new <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> approaches made data coding a less popular topic. [<em>Less popular than what?</em>] But still I find data coding a worthy topic, and a worthy mechanism to achieve a system objective.
