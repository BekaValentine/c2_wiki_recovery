        The Smalltalk source code of TheAnalyst from XeroxSpecialInformationSystems was always good for a few chuckles. Here are some favorites from memory:

           a comment next to some recursive code that caused slide-off menus to display: "Shazam!"

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then there was a snippet from a CASE tool implemented in Smalltalk:
      </p>
      <code>
        somethingHappened := <some message expression>.<br/>

        somethingHappened ifTrue: [...]<br/>

        But I think my favorite of all time is this little passage from the <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>/S 4.1 Programming Guide, in reference to the fact that class Metaclass is an instance of an instance of itself:

        Some versions of the documentation for <em>awk</em> on Unix contain this explanation

        <em>statement</em><br/>

        foreach (keys %some_hash) {<br/>

        The library routine names in the Playstation apparently were translated phonetically from Japanese to English. So instead of MergePrim() we got to call MargePrim(), and had documentation referring to a "clit index" instead of a CLUT index (Color LookUp Table index). I did play QuakeII online as "marge prim" for awhile, 'cause it made such a cool name. :-)

        On refactoring the help system for our application (originally written by a *very* junior programmer who among other things didn't know what an 'else' was), I found three variables in a block:

        Continuing in a musical vein... I wrote some marshalling/demarshalling code for a C++ middleware platform. Data sent between machines of different endianness needs to be byteswapped by the receiver. The sender needs to set a flag in the header to indicate its endianness. Some systems (CORBA for example) compile the middleware libraries to know their endianness, and send a boolean flag indicating big-endian (true) or little-endian (false). As we were planning to port the system to different architectures, I didn't want to have to maintain a list of endian flags by platform as #ifdef's in the code. Instead, I used a 2-byte field in the header of each message. The sender would set the field to a well-known numeric value, each byte of which was different. The receiver would check the field in received against the well-known value. If they were different, the receiver would have to byte-swap values in the message.
      </p>
      <p>
        The well-known numeric value was 57005. I called the header field 'elvis'. Why? Because the code that checked the value then looked like:
      </p>
      <code>
        Message msg = ...;<br/>
        uint16 elvis;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        msg >> elvis;<br/>
        if( elvis != 0xDEAD ) {<br/>
        ... must byteswap data in the message ...<br/>

        It's surprising how many puns you can make with the letters A..F, and whatever letters you can represent with the digits 0..9. E.g. The Java virtual machine expects the first 32 bits at the front of a class file to be 0xCAFEBABE. I have also seen code that uses 0xDEADBEEF to represent uninitialized data.

        Also from early 1970's Burroughs 17xx MCP, I recall a routine named Interrupt Handler that did pretty much what you'd expect. It was preceded by a LOONNGG comment block that talked about dispatching processes from the ready queue and other such Impressive Terminology, and concluded by saying that

        Once I had a junior programmer writing VB code that needed to know the day of the week. He decided to write his own code, and read something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (day = 1) or (day = 8) or (day = 15) or (day = 22) or (day = 29) then<br/>
        weekday = "Monday"<br/>
        elseif (day = 2) or (day = 9) or (day = 16) or (day = 23) or (day = 30) then<br/>
        weekday = "Tuesday"<br/>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Trying to be educational I asked him for his opinion about his own code, and he said that he would simply modify it every month.

        You know, that can actually be hard to avoid, thanks to the way Java implements callbacks. For example, if I want to make my class implement the <em>Runnable</em> interface, I have to expose a public run() method, even if I don't really want just any passer-by to call it. Of course, the right thing to do is to use inner classes. Unfortunately, the way these are handled in Java is IMHO bloody inconvenient, particularly if one is writing something simple like an Applet. -- <a href="IlmariKaronen.html">IlmariKaronen</a>

        I was deep in the innards of a system application, I think it was Smalltalk (at least that's what I'll use in this telling). The module was attempting to do massive cleanup and finalization, and multiple paths lead to a routine that managed instances of a HUGE object that was the root of an enormous directed graph. The routine itself was long, and at the critical point I found something very much like this:

        <em>It's "Keyboard error (or fault, can't remember)." and you could generate it oj early PCs by booting up while holding a key down...</em>
      </p>

        Actually, on the PCs I've used in the past, if you left a keyboard unattached, it literally would
        display the aforelisted error message, character for character.  --Samuel A. Falvo II

        In Java, we had class A with private member variable aIndex. In the derived class B the programmer had private member aIndex. B's programmer was too lazy to type in the names of the accessors for A.index and instead thought that redeclaring would cause the two variables of the same name to refer to the same entity. He was even thoughtful enough to mark his obfuscation with a comment, "/* redeclared here for clarity */". We all had a good laugh, except for the person that had spent a week trying to track down the bug caused by this stupid programmer mistake.

        Working with FTX on Stratus, one day I decided to play around with the various implementations of FTP I had available to me, (AIX, HPUX, FTX, VOS). On the FTX machine using the man-page example I tried to tell FTP to use different ports (just for the fun of it, to see if it would even attempt to connect). The system responded <em>You must be kidding</em>.

        I used to work with a programmer who seemed to name variables by whatever was on his mind -- or the radio. His code was littered with function, array, and variable names like: Jocko, Bunny, Coffee and Gilligan. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So it was not uncommon when reading his handiwork to encounter code that used Jocko to index into Coffee after passing Bunny to Gilligan. <em>Oh, now that's just </em>'wrong<em>'!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        He also preferred to copy code rather than to type it, and would grab a chunk that did something like he wanted to accomplish (comments and all), paste it where he was adding functionality, and then hack it until it worked (based on his definition of worked). I found this out when trying to understand what some Gilligan-like function was doing when I realized that a comment I was looking at, not only didn't refer to the program I was working on, but was from code in a program for another client altogether -- I know that because the other client's name was in still in the code of the client whose code I was looking at.

        After much staring and some refactoring, I finally came up with:
      </p>
      <code>
        int is_xilinx_programmed(softc_t *sc)<br/>
        {<br/>
        return (sc->status & XILINX_PROG) && (sc->status & XILINX2_PROG);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This was in the same system that had undocumented utilities with argument checking code like:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (q == 1) {<br/>
        printf("Silly user, you must enter the correct syntax "<br/>
        "-i1 through 5 or\n -s1 through 5 and -d1 through 5\n");<br/>
        exit(0);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        <em>Neither of these examples is "ha-ha funny", and the first example isn't "peculiar funny", either; it's standard bit flag stuff. Woe unto any C programmer doing XILINX work who has trouble understanding the code as it was first written; you'd better brush up on your bit manipulations if you expect to understand XILINX devices, let alone C. Those who hate bit manipulation shouldn't be in that line of work.</em> Look again. The author's problem was not with the use of bit masks (indeed, his solution shows that he understood them better than the original coder did), but with the facts that a) the comparison was poorly written (if nothing else, the original coder should have factored out the repeated bitwise OR term to a temp variable), and b) the if clause and the returns were <strong>completely unnecessary</strong>, as the function was effectively returning a boolean based off of a single extended comparison. I agree that it wasn't funny, though, so much as sad. - <a href="JayOsako.html">JayOsako</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What? No. If you mean for efficiency, there's no need to factor out the repeated part, because the OR of the two flags is performed at compile time (or if the flags were variables -- they're not -- an optimizing compiler would easily factor out the repeated subexpression itself).
        </li>
        <li>
           Or if you meant that should be done for stylistic reasons, yes, it's generally not desirable to repeat things unnecessarily, but in this particular case it seems a matter of taste, because typically there would be similar code nearby that did things like
          <ul>
            <li>
               (flag & (X | Y)) == (X) and
            </li>
            <li>
               (flag & (X | Y)) == (Y) and then finally as above,
            </li>
            <li>
               (flag & (X | Y)) == (X | Y)
            </li>
            <li>
               ...so that what looks like unnecessary repetition out of context, is often just part of an overall consistent coding pattern.
            </li>
            <li>
               There is then a second argument for hiding the pattern in a macro, but in this case again that would be a judgement call, not just automatically right or wrong.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Using a conditional to return 0/1 rather than returning a boolean expression used to be <strong>necessary</strong> if the caller really needed 0 or 1, because long ago it wasn't guaranteed that TRUE would equal 1 -- this code may date back to that era.
        </li>
        <li>
           So I see no clear evidence that the code should necessarily be called badly written, nor evidence that the second author clearly understood bit masks better than the original coder.
        </li>
        <li>
           I do prefer returning a boolean expression directly, so I do like the rewrite, it just seems like a pretty minor thing to bring up as an example...was that really the worst piece of code that was run across on that project? If so then I am very impressed; usually there's lots and lots of code much worse than that.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Suppose sc were volatile and reading the status cleared it.  Then the original code should remain.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The second example is somewhat lacking in context, but it looks like the point is that some hardware engineer chose somewhat opaque syntax - as they usually do.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The original code was perfectly reasonable for its context, and the replacement code isn't even sure to be functionally identical! The original test did a single read of a status register, an operation which can often have side effects in embedded systems, and then a single mask and comparison. The replacement does two separate read, mask, and compare operations...the second of which may end up testing a flag automatically cleared by the first. And as mentioned, explicitly returning 1 or 0 avoids problems with strange definitions of boolean values. True and false values weren't always standardized, and development environments for embedded systems are particularly prone to odd deviations from standards. The flags should be given a separate define to make things a bit clearer, but that's all.</em>

        <em>The PDP-10 Reference Handbook (1969) contained a footnote on the first page of the documentation for DDT that illuminates the origin of the term:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        : <em>Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1 computer in 1961. At that time DDT stood for "DEC Debugging Tape". Since then, the idea of an on-line debugging program has propagated throughout the computer industry. DDT programs are now available for all DEC computers. Since media other than tape are now frequently used, the more descriptive name "Dynamic Debugging Technique" has been adopted, retaining the DDT abbreviation. Confusion between DDT-10 and another well known pesticide, dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane C14H9Cl5 should be minimal since each attacks a different, and apparently mutually exclusive, class of bugs.</em>

          one could probably make some significant contributions to the Linux codebase simply by doing this, then seeing if they can figure out how to fix the problem the coder was griping about. Hell, there are probably several Linux kernel hackers who do just that, though admittedly a lot of the problems are related to bizarre hardware or outside software which the system has to interface with, which the coders can do much about. Even so, it would probably be a useful thing to do. KiboDebugging?

        We sent the firmware of our device to the manufacturer in Japan who modified it to create the manufacturing tests. When we got it back I looked over it and had a surprise. They abbreviated their variables, but any variable that had the word "count" in it was abbreviated not by dropping the "ou" but just the "o". It was really hard to read that code with a straight face.

        So we had this class, among the instance properties of which was a reference to an output stream that it would ultimately send - effectively - itself down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recipient then typically reset that stream to point to a new destination. However, it was typical for the old stream to need cleaning up (exactly how, needless to say, woud vary from stream type to stream type), so setting a new stream would begin by telling the old stream to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        So before the stream for the object to go down could be set, it had to be made ready. ReinitialiseOutputStream()? Nah...:

      <p>
        I don't know about the <strong>logic</strong>, but I see often enough similar code written (or copy-pasted) by colleagues from India:
      </p>
      <code>
        for(coln = FIRSTCOLUMN; coln <= LASTCOLUMN; coln++)<br/>
        {<br/>
        switch(coln)<br/>
        {<br/>
        case FIRSTCOLUMN: <some stuff...> break;<br/>
        case SECONDCOLUMN: <some stuff...> break;<br/>
        <....><br/>
        case LASTCOLUMN: <some stuff...> break;<br/>
        default: <error handling code> break;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Using the defined names you can reorder columns just by changing defines, but I still don't see the point.
        Naturally, I remove all this alien code and write a strafe forward <stuff> (without for and switch), which is more readable, easier to debug and maintain.... and - not surprisingly enough - works just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        And believe it or not, I have seen a lot of similar examples on MSDN.

        Apparently a past developer for OpenSim had a bad day. Found in the DataSnapshotManager.cs file:

      <code>
        String[] annoying_string_array = config.Configs["DataSnapshot"].GetString("disable_modules", "").Split(".".ToCharArray());<br/>
        foreach (String bloody_wanker in annoying_string_array)<br/>
        {<br/>
        m_disabledModules.Add(bloody_wanker);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Also found:
      </p>
      <code>
        m_gridinfo.Add("Name", config.Configs["DataSnapshot"].GetString("gridname", "harbl"));<br/>
      </code>

           quote: "lSASS.EXE" is the Local Security Authentication Server. It verifies the validity of user logons to your PC or server...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Does this mean it verifies if somebody "<strong>is</strong> an <strong>ass</strong>"? (It's an "L", not an "I", but it can look like an I in certain fonts.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>LSASS.EXE = "Local Security Authority Subsystem Service".  It should be noted that there are versions out in the wild that certainly behave as </em>'asses<em>' i.e.: isass.exe Trojan/virus/whatever, and lsass.exe running in the wrong place = Trojan.  I like your analogy of it deciding whether a person who attempts to logon is and ass or not! :)</em>
