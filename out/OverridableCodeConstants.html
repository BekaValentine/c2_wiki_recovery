        Overridable Code Constants
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="OverridableCodeConstants.html">OverridableCodeConstants</a> is a configuration design pattern that attempts to blend the advantages of CODE_CONSTANTS with the flexibility of using values loaded from XML configuration files.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's both traditional and convenient when coding to put literal values into code constants, because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Multiple uses of the value can be controlled from one place. (Don't Repeat Yourself principle)
        </li>
        <li>
           The value can be given a DESCRIPTIVE_NAME that also distinguishes its role as a constant from variables.
        </li>
        <li>
           The value can be a documented public, read-only feature of the class, exposed through metadata, which is helpful to users of the class who might need to pass as a parameter to a method.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But its not convenient when you need to change these constants any more than infrequently, which is why configuration files, registry settings and the like are so universal, because commonly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Different release versions of the app need different values
        </li>
        <li>
           Different installation of the same release need different values
        </li>
        <li>
           Different invocations of the same installation need different values
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Static constants are typically assigned when a class is loaded to their value. The OverridableConstants pattern checks a backing configuration file at this time, and sets the constant to the value specified by the file, or to a default value otherwise. A Java example:
      </p>
      <code>
        package model;<br/>
        class ModelRunner {<br/>
        public static final int THREAD_COUNT = Config.getInstance().getInt("model.ModelRunner.THREAD_COUNT", 1);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        What's nice is that: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It can be done in a single line of code
        </li>
        <li>
           The default value is clearly visible
        </li>
        <li>
           Finding a collision-free name for the configuration key is trivial using the constants qualified name.
        </li>
        <li>
           If we want to get clever we can derive prefix "model.ModelRunner." automagically from the class.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some implementation notes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I have done this in conjunction with <a href="EasyFindMutableConfigFilesInJava.html">EasyFindMutableConfigFilesInJava</a> and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/configuration,">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/configuration,</a> in such a way that all the features mesh well. Other languages and techs may not work so smoothly.
        </li>
        <li>
           The static "Config.getInstance()" may worry people, because it's a naughty static singleton and because so far I've swept the question of how it gets created under the carpet.
          <ul>
            <li>
               At class load time, when static init code is run, we don't have access to any instances. A static access point is convenient, unlike any alternatives I considered.
            </li>
            <li>
               While lazy creation of the configuration is possible in getInstance(), I don't like it because any exception thrown loading the configuration files is given to the client, who cant usefully do anything but fail. I prefer to add a one-shot setInstance() method that code early in startup in responsible for calling. I've used such a pattern over some years with success.
            </li>
            <li>
               Config.getInstance() returns a Configuration interface (org.apache in my case), so we aren't committed to a concrete implementation (just that we use the same one everywhere in our system). 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The default Apache configuration XML layout treats "." as a delimiter and maps key names onto a simple nested element structure that intuitive groups together values by package and class:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        <config><br/>
        <model><br/>
        <ModelRunner><br/>
        <THREAD_COUNT>5</THREAD_COUNT><br/>
        </ModelRunner><br/>
        </model><br/>
        </config><br/>
      </code>
