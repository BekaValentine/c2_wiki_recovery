        Refer Dont Delete
      </h1>
      <p>
        Why delete a page if you can repoint the reader to the content they wanted when they got there?  A good example of this is "<a href="TruckFactor.html">TruckFactor</a>" vs "<a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a>".  Both page names are valid enough, so put the content on one and put the "See: OtherPage" reference on the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Avoids rework.  If I expect a page to exist, but find that it doesn't, I'll create the page.  I might spend time researching the topic, thinking about it, etc.  Now, I've created duplicate information.  All because someone couldn't tolerate a "See: <a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a>" link?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Searchability.  You can't search the titles of deleted pages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Costs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A nominal amount of disk space.
        </li>
        <li>
           That icky feeling that refactorers get when they don't completely, thoroughly destroy duplicated information.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>Maybe something like </em><a href="DeletedAndRefactored.html">DeletedAndRefactored</a> (in the same vein as DeleteTestAndWelcome) would be OK? That way the original person is responsible for cleaning up after themselves but if they don't, then the page will still get cleaned eventually...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that's not what I was intending.  The whole idea is to <strong>keep</strong> the suboptimally named page.  This way avoids allowing someone who doesn't know about the better name to write up new content under the old name.  If the old name has a "See BetterName", they'll update their links and not waste time re-creating obsolete pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(Personally, I don't like "</em><a href="TruckFactor.html">TruckFactor</a>" -- I'd delete it.  But I think "<a href="ReferDontDelete.html">ReferDontDelete</a>" does make sense on some other pages. -- jtg)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with that is that someone else <em>does</em> like "<a href="TruckFactor.html">TruckFactor</a>", and being ignorant of <a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a> will create the page for this important concept ... only now it won't have a handy reference to <a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a>, being a brand new page. Consequently content (possibly redundant) gets added the <a href="TruckFactor.html">TruckFactor</a> page, which creates a refactoring problem for those that do know of <a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But then you end up with a bunch of pages, half of which refer to </em><a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a> and half of which refer to <a href="TruckFactor.html">TruckFactor</a>. 100% of the pages <strong>mean</strong> to refer to the same page but they don't because they weren't refactored. I don't have a problem leaving pages that are often misspelled (like <a href="YouArentGoingToNeedIt.html">YouArentGoingToNeedIt</a> vs. <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>) but referring pages should be refactored to point to the canonical page as soon as possible so that the content is in one place <strong>and</strong> it doesn't take four clicks to get to it... just my $0.02 CDN<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find a link which points at a reference, then fix the link. Simple. Ask yourself, which is easier for the <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s to clean up: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a link which points at a reference, or
        </li>
        <li>
           a blossoming page with extra content to be either merged with the canonical page or deleted because it's redundant, and then also going back and fixing the link which points at the page you are about to delete?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One problem though -- if the links are getting fixed, you wouldn't be able to tell if that wrong name page is something really obscure and no one ever linked to it ever (in which case the page should actually be deleted), or alternatively its a common mistake to use that wikiname but the evidence keeps getting cleaned up. Suggestion: if a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> does fix a double-reference link they could also add a "fixed [offending page]" to that referring page. Over time there will accumulate the history of mistakes, making it plain it's a common mistake.

        <em>I'm refactoring </em><a href="UnitTesting.html">UnitTesting</a> -> <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing (and may do UnitTests -> <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, if I'm <strong>really</strong> bored). I rewrote UnitTests to say "see <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>", followed by a suggestion to the reader to fix the UnitTests link on the referring page. Also, I've kept a count of decreasing numbers of backlinks as I've refactored. I was planning to remove the countdown when refactoring was done, but I may leave it to indicate how many links there used to be. <em></em>
