        Annotations Over Naming Conventions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many libraries, frameworks and systems manipulate Java objects and classes through reflection.  Examples include <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> tools that persist objects to databases, XML binding tools that map XML documents to and from Java objects, serialisation libraries that write and read objects to and from streams, test frameworks that load and run tests written as Java classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        These reflective systems work at the <a href="MetaLevel.html">MetaLevel</a>, manipulating Java classes, methods and fields and untyped objects.  From this meta-level representation they must infer information to guide their operation.  An object relational mapper must determine how to map the features of an object to database tables and columns.  An XML serialiser must determine how features of an object are represented as XML elements and attributes.  A serialiser must determine how features of an object are represented as a stream of bits.   A test framework must determine which classes contain tests and which methods of those classes are tests and which are called from the tests and can't be run directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to Java 5, reflective code had to infer this information from coding conventions, such as <a href="TagInterface.html">TagInterface</a>s, the inheritance hierarchy and <a href="NamingConventions.html">NamingConventions</a>, or used configuration files.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Naming conventions can restrict the vocabulary used by the programmer too much.  <a href="TagInterface.html">TagInterface</a>s abuse a language feature and so make it harder to understand the code.  Forcing classes to have a specific base class makes it harder to use existing code with the reflective tool or to refactor inheritance hierarchies to remove duplication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java 5 introduced a new language feature, annotations, borrowed from C#.  An annotation is an explicit piece of <a href="MetaData.html">MetaData</a> attached to a class, method, field or variable.  A language element can be given as many annotations as necessary.  Annotations are interpreted by a reflective tool that can understand them.  This lets the programmer integrate their class with different reflective tools without needing to follow any prescribed coding conventions or design styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the annotation syntax is ugly and many annotations make the code cluttered and hard to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        When should you use annotations instead of naming conventions?
      </p>
      <p>
        ... to be done...

        Rewritten above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to Java 1.5 <a href="TagInterface.html">TagInterface</a>s are used to provide <a href="MetaData.html">MetaData</a> about classes. What about methods? Unfortunately, whilst reflection allows introspection about the class hierarchy - and hence implemented <a href="TagInterface.html">TagInterface</a>s, there's no such similar mechanism that can be used for methods. What can be known about a method includes its name; hence the <a href="MetaData.html">MetaData</a> is intertwined with the method name. For example <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a> should use methods that begin with 'get' and 'set' to allow <a href="BeanBox.html">BeanBox</a>es to set and get properties for a VisualClass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Annotations provide a more flexible mechanism. One possibility to replace the get/set convention above would be to have two annotations, @BeanGetter and @BeanSetter. Or perhaps just a @Bean annotation parameterised with an enumeration: @Bean(MethodType.GETTER), @Bean(MethodType.SETTER). A <a href="BeanBox.html">BeanBox</a> would then use the annotation information associated with the methods rather than the name.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, annotations are ugly and clutter the code compared to using a well chosen <a href="SystemOfNames.html">SystemOfNames</a> that expresses the same information.
      </p>

        <em>Please add to </em>NamingConventionsOverAnnotations! I prefer annotations so I've avoided doing the page myself.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They are both patterns, so are applicable in different contexts. The pages should compare and contrasts those contexts, not document personal preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed, which is why I've avoided interjecting any personal bias.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, what I meant was that there are situations where annotations are more useful than naming conventions and other situations where naming conventions are more useful than annotations.  Personal bias doesn't come into it, so there's no reason why you can't write the page yourself.

        Actually, Java Beans do <em>not</em> have to use "get" and "set" prefixes. The mapping of named properties to getter and setter methods is defined by the bean's BeanInfo class and the "get" and "set" prefixes are used when the Beans API must <a href="FallBackOnReflection.html">FallBackOnReflection</a> to generate a BeanInfo for classes without explicitly defined metadata.

        A better example might be JUnit 4 or TestNG that use @Test annotations to identify methods to run as tests, while JUnit 3 looks for methods that start with "test".

           Hibernate 3 uses annotations to define how an object maps to rows in a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>. <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a>' <a href="ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> uses naming conventions.
        </li>
        <li>
           JAXB 2 uses annotations to define how an object maps to an XML document, and how a class maps to an XSD schema. XStream (<a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org)">http://xstream.codehaus.org)</a> uses naming conventions, mapping class, property or field names to XML element and attribute names.
