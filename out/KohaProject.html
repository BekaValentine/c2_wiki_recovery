        Koha Project
      </h1>
      <p>
        Koha is <a href="FreeSoftwareForLibraries.html">FreeSoftwareForLibraries</a>.  It is a platform providing
        <strong>CIRC</strong> (CirculationModule) and <strong>OPAC</strong> (OnLinePatronAccess).
        It uses the <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> and MySQL, and the <a href="MarcRecord.html">MarcRecord</a> module.
      </p>

        <a href="http://www.koha.org">http://www.koha.org</a> and <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/koha">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/koha</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Koha was initially developed in 1999, and was first deployed in
        January of 2000.  It has been in production since that time.  Koha is
        currently installed in a number of libraries on at least four
        continents.  While the initial development work was done by
        KatipoCommunications and funded by the HorowhenuaLibraryTrust (both in
        New Zealand), the developer base is now international in scope.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 1.2.0 release of Koha was made on June 14th, 2000.  Work on this
        branch is continuing, and a new 1.4.0 release is being planned which
        will feature a number of key features including MARC compliance.

        The development of Koha is also undergoing a transition.  It was first
        developed in the CathedralStyle within KatipoCommunications.
        Gradually, OutsideDevelopers started to work on the system.  Recently,
        responsibility for the direction of the project was passed to <a href="PatEyler.html">PatEyler</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new development is geared to establish several things:  a larger,
        more vibrant KohaCommunity; a better FreeLibrarySystem; increased
        recognition for Koha in the library community; and a move to better
        programming methods including <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Another new development is the investment in Koha by libraries.  Nelsonville
        Public Library has announced that they will be migrating to the Koha system
        and will be releasing a series of three RFPs, the first one is out at 
        <a href="http://pate.eylerfamily.org/geek/MARCRFP.txt,">http://pate.eylerfamily.org/geek/MARCRFP.txt,</a> for work they'd like to see 
        done on Koha.
