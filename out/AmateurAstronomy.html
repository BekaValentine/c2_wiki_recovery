        Amateur Astronomy
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="AmateurAstronomy.html">AmateurAstronomy</a>, is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the NightSky (and the day sky too, for SunSpots, eclipses, etc.), and the plethora of objects found in it, mainly with portable telescopes and binoculars. Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets. Such efforts are one of the relatively few ways interested amateurs can still make useful contributions to scientific knowledge.
