        I was described once as an iconoclast who considers IBM ante-deluvian. I like that.

        Saw your remarks in <a href="KaiZen.html">KaiZen</a> page some time ago and wonder whether you have more to add there, like whether it is a fad that passed away at the sites you know of? Or better, some success stories that last.

        <em> I could not write a good summary of the book. What it did for me was cement a belief I held for a while, and this belief was at the time the reason I was succeeding technically. This idea of stopping the entire production line when an exception occurs - effectively, whatever is started will succeed, or all bets are off.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> I believed that there should be no error paths in application code. This is the same philosophy - if a process is triggered, it either succeeds in doing what it is supposed to do, or the entire process tree halts - drops into an error state. I had written code to do this in the applications I was building at the time.</em>

      <p>
        <em> Doing this makes a process invocation an assertion - any exception generated within can be handled by an external error processor</em>
