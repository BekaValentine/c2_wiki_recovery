        Stephen Hawking
      </h1>
      <p>
        Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. One of the world's experts on <a href="GeneralRelativity.html">GeneralRelativity</a>. Discovered a mechanism (<a href="HawkingRadiation.html">HawkingRadiation</a>) by which <a href="BlackHole.html">BlackHole</a>s can shrink and eventually evaporate. His book "A BriefHistoryOfTime" was a best-seller.

        Hawking also has the disease variously known as Motor Neuron Disease, Motor Neurone Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's Disease <em>("Lou Gehrig died of Lou Gehrig's Disease... how the hell didn't he see that one coming?" --Dennis Leary)</em>. It's a degenerative brain disorder whose only good feature is that it doesn't damage the mind. Hawking is confined to a wheelchair, uses a computer to speak (very slowly!), and certainly can't do such things as scribbling an equation or drawing a diagram. That he manages to do first-rate Theoretical Physics in spite of this gives some indication of the quality of his mind.

        As a much less known side career, Stephen Hawking performs gangsta rap. See <a href="http://www.mchawking.com/">http://www.mchawking.com/</a> for details.

        When he guest-starred on TheSimpsons, was that really him or did they just rent a narration device like his? -- PCP

        He was credited, so I guess we can assume it was him. But I really have no idea. -- <a href="CorwinLightWilliams.html">CorwinLightWilliams</a>

        I'm pretty sure it was really him. -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>

        "For Shame." -- <a href="StephenHawking.html">StephenHawking</a> on TheSimpsons

        It was him. He is a great fan of the Simpsons. I watched a documentary, where he had Homer running away from a <a href="BlackHole.html">BlackHole</a>, in a demonstration of what might happen when a <a href="BlackHole.html">BlackHole</a> bends space. Most amusing (and interesting).
      </p>

        <em>That's from </em>'TheSimpsons Treehouse Of Horror VII<strong>, when Homer discovers a hole leading into the </strong>ThirdDimension. An excellent episode. Of course, <a href="StephenHawking.html">StephenHawking</a> also featured in an episode of <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> The Next Generation, something which I'm surprised hasn't been mentioned here yet!<em></em>

        And, of course, he was also on Futurama, as part of Vice President Gore's team of super-nerds charged by the Constitution to protect the space-time continuum. Al Gore was also credited in that episode. Suffice it to say, this guy is on TV a lot. He's the Dr. Joyce Brothers of physics, except he's also good at physics.
