        Mental Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        Mental Processes and Cognitive Process are what make it possible for us to make sense of the environment in which we find ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        We 
      </p>
      <code>
        Perceive, Imagine, Conceive, Reason, Remember and Believe<br/>
        Inspect, Recognize, Compare, Decide, Wonder, Engage, Avoid, and Sense <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Our Mental Processes have been used to help us to survive and prosper. The excellence of our faculties have enabled us to overcome obstacles and barriers by invention and application, overcoming our environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        By exercising our MentalProwess, we are able to do almost anything we can imagine as physically and economically possible. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What is it that governs the application of these abilities and supplies the initiative, vision and will to use these powers? Why do some people use nearly all of their abilities, and still others almost none? What makes us bright one day and dull on another day? What effectt does our diet have on our mental processes? Why do chemicals and drugs affect our physical and mental performances?
      </p>
      <p>
        Can we individually decide to make the most of all of this? What can we read to help us understand this?
