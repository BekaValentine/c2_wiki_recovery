        <a href="YourJobIsNotYourLife.html">YourJobIsNotYourLife</a>, and neither is your career. Young people are realizing today what has been predicted for over a decade: that most people will go through several careers in their lifetimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is an appropriate strategy?
      </p>
      <p>
        How about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="JustGetAnyJob.html">JustGetAnyJob</a> and <a href="ExtremeBudgeting.html">ExtremeBudgeting</a> to keep fed, and buy you time to think what next.
        </li>
        <li>
           Do not relax if your basic needs are met, because you need to <a href="PrepareForNextCareerNow.html">PrepareForNextCareerNow</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Contemplate <a href="LifeAsaDream.html">LifeAsaDream</a>, and run your <a href="LifeAsaBusiness.html">LifeAsaBusiness</a> so you will have the spirits and keep your spirits high
        </li>
        <li>

        I've opened this page half a dozen times now.  Something's been bothering me about the basic premise.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I have a handle on it now.  All irony aside (and that's <em>tough</em> when talking about <em>life</em>), for many people it seems their job does indeed wind up being their life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not that it should.  However, there are a couple of factors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Having no long-term objective (something to attain regardless of employment) the thing they do most often becomes the defining attribute in their lives.
        </li>
        <li>
           (... and a little harder to articulate ...) The living of life really should be more than the mechanics of staying alive.  If you can get good at a trade/profession/whatever and get useful, remunerative work done in progressively less time, you eventually should have a sort of time (and maybe money) surplus that can be used to do a little (or a lot of) living.  
          <ul>
            <li>
               If one were intent on keeping a population off-balance and disoriented and therefore incapable of doing a serious job of enjoying life, one could ensure that employment conditions made it necessary to continually retrain in ways that constantly invalidate previously accrued knowledge or expertise.
            </li>
            <li>
               If, on the other hand, one were interested in improving the opportunity for individual quality of life for a population, then it would seem prudent to establish conditions that made it possible to 
              <ul>
                <li>
                   1) accrue skills and knowledge, and thus personal value; 
                </li>
                <li>
                   2) continue to obtain compensation commensurate with this increased personal value.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Doesn't sound much like the current "market-driven" "shareholder-benefit" society, though.  I probably need to refine this for the sake of consistency, but for now let's see how this plays.
