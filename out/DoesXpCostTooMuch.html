        Does Xp Cost Too Much
      </h1>
      <p>
        It seems much has been said about the value of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and <a href="AgileMethodology.html">AgileMethodology</a>, but since QuestionsMakeGoodPage, let me ask, "Does <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> cost too much? Was cost a factor in the demise of some of the failed attempts to utilize Xp? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Cost can be analyzed, when applied to such matters, as costs due to the time spent, and costs due to the rate of pay of those who are Experts in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it is evident that a beginning programmer is not well suited to being used in the small teams which Xp and Agility demands, could it be that <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> relies more heavily on experience and knowing what to do than it does on knowing a set of rules defining what <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> does?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there a mentoring strategy involved in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>? One may immediately point out <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> as a mentoring process. Is it? If so, one may also ask is it the least expensive thing that can possibly work in training an expanding, competent work force. How much does it cost to train a new programmer and bring them to a level of expertise which produces optimum results?
      </p>
      <p>
        The flip side of the question on this page might be, If Xp is inexpensive, why aren't more people using it?
