        Illustra Database
      </h1>
      <p>
        Illustra was an object relational database server. In the late 1990s, it got bought by Informix, which used it to add object capabilities to their Informix database server, since that was the cool thing to do. Illustra was largely sold as a database good for multimedia work.
