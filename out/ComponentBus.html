        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A system is constructed from components in which components are <em>created and destroyed at runtime</em>. These components execute within some environment that contains other components and support services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        How can you reduce a component's dependence on the environment in which it is executed?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Components need to communicate.
        </li>
        <li>
           You want to achieve <a href="ContextIndependence.html">ContextIndependence</a> between components
        </li>
        <li>
           Components need be dynamically added to and removed from the system at runtime.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Have components communicate indirectly through a software "bus".  The bus manages the routing of information between components, from components that produce information to those that consume that information.  Routing of information is managed dynamically: as components are added to the bus they register their interest in the information they require.  When a component places information onto the bus it is delivered to those components that have registered an interest in that information.  
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Define <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a> by which components communicate with the bus.  Components must announce data onto the bus, get notifications of new data from the bus and must be able to structure and type data so that they can define higher-level protocols in terms of the bus-level protocol.
        </li>
        <li>
           Implement the bus to perform its roles of the <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Implement components that plug into the bus by implementing the other roles of the <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a> and use the bus to implement application-level communication protocols.
        </li>
        <li>
           In your system, instantiate the bus and plug components into the bus.  This can be done through <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a>, but it can also be done implicitly if the bus is part of the <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of a bus removes the need for explicit bindings between components.
        Components can be removed from and plugged into the bus without involving the other components with which they communicate.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to dynamically reconfigure the components communicating through the bus makes it easier to migrate components in a distributed system; e.g. for load balancing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In using a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> you are really building <a href="LayeredFrameworks.html">LayeredFrameworks</a>. Components interacting through the bus are actually interacting via <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a> that are defined in terms of the bus protocols.  These <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a> are not encoded as interfaces or otherwise visible in the implementation language, and so must be carefully specified elsewhere, as documentation, state charts etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Components have a direct dependency on the bus interfaces, but not on other component instances with which they communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because components only communicate through the bus interfaces there is no need for <a href="ComponentGlue.html">ComponentGlue</a> to adapt between incompatible interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dynamically removing components from the bus may disrupt a stateful inter-component protocol that is implemented in terms of the bus protocol. Because components interact only through the bus, it is not obvious which components are interacting and how removing a component will affect other parts of the system.  If application protocols are stateful, it might be better to use <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a> to make interconnections explicit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The architecture of the system is not easily visible from the source code or at runtime. A <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> is like a supporting scripting language: You can understand how the system works, but not how it is being used. To understand use, you need the schematics: In scripting systems, the scripts; In <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> systems, the component and bus configurations.

        Having worked on a number of these systems, I feel that they are not really workable unless you have some sort of 2D visualization system in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linear code systems are good for relatively linear code. But these <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> systems just fly out in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading straight text, you have to draw a diagram on paper, in order to conceptualize the inter-relationships sensibly.
      </p>
      <p>
        These bus systems feel much more like biology to me, than traditional programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel that they are <em>much</em> more powerful, and give you the benefits of reusability that OOP was <em>supposed</em> to give us.

        <em>What are the distinctions?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="PluggableArchitecture.html">PluggableArchitecture</a><em> tends to imply more specific interfaces. You might have 4 avenues of communication- say, 4 function calls, and each function call may have very specific type information for each parameter in it. Commonly, but by no mean always always, pluggable architectures do not have much communication between plugins. Rather, communication is between the system and the plugin. It is also common for the plugin to be the "recipient" of information from the system, and then return some information back to the system. The central system comes "first," and the plugin is "second."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a>es, on the other hand, tend to have wide open gates, where you both send and receive any sort of information. The underlying system very rarely has any concept of just what's in the information. The architecture is far more decentralized, and may even have no "center," beyond the bus system itself, which just dumbly passes messages between components, and provides a life tick to each component.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="DataBusPattern.html">DataBusPattern</a> is, I believe, the exact same thing as the <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a>. Just a different name. I mean, read them. It's the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know enough about the <a href="InformationBus.html">InformationBus</a> to talk about those. We don't have much data here.

        <em>The </em><a href="DataBusPattern.html">DataBusPattern</a> is, I believe, the exact same thing as the <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a>.<em>  I would say that's not true, but rather that </em><a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> is an application of the <a href="DataBusPattern.html">DataBusPattern</a>.  The relevant distinction here is that ComponentsAreNotObjects.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a>, the components are entirely separate applications, and are generally not objects (though the bus adapters for the components might be objects), and messages are generally in a generic format such as plain text.  The <a href="DataBusPattern.html">DataBusPattern</a> would encompass that just fine, but it could just as well encompass the system I wrote in Access last week that allows VBA class instances to subscribe and publish messages with Variant content that hold VB primitives, an arrays, or object references.  In that case, there is only a single application, and the data is in a language-specific format.  That system clearly implements the <a href="DataBusPattern.html">DataBusPattern</a>, but is not a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A Data bus is distinct from a </em><a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> in that A <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> must manage the lifecycle of the component. A DataBus is much dumber than that. Usually. But we are talking definitions so I am only one voice. For all I know people conflate the two things. Also, a component usually is an object, but an object is usually not a component. The distinguishing attribute is that components are relatively independent. Same caveats apply.<em> </em>

        The defining features are:

        Content neutral (as in <a href="EnvelopeLetter.html">EnvelopeLetter</a> idiom).
        Routes messages from source to destination.
