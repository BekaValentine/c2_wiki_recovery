        I am a bit of a newcomer to the patterns movement. Although I have been aware of patterns for quite some time, it wasn't until fall 97 that I really started reading the literature & mailing lists.  At the moment, I am more concerned with learning from and using patterns than the creation of new ones.  Much of the appeal that patterns have for me is their language neutrality since I am a consultant for <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>, and as a result I have used all the major Smalltalk flavors in the last year, as well as Java, C, and C++ as occasion dictates.  It is a great help to have a common vocabulary to allow me to discuss concepts in any of these languages without resorting to code samples in a language that whoever I am talking to may not understand.
