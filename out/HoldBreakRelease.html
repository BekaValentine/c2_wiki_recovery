        When approaching a new discipline,

      <ol>
        <li>
           First you adhere to the dogma. This teaches you the classical ways, and gives you a good start when in unfamiliar territory.
        </li>
        <li>
           Then you break the dogma. This will rejuvenate the learning process, though it is likely to have some pain.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ol>
