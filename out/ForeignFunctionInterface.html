        Foreign Function Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="ForeignFunctionInterface.html">ForeignFunctionInterface</a> (FFI) is an interface that allows calling code written in one programming language, from another that is neither a superset nor a subset.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The term comes from </em><a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>; though it's applicable to any such interface.  Other language communities don't use the term FFI as much; some languages such as Java have their own term -- Java refers to it as the <a href="JavaNativeInterface.html">JavaNativeInterface</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The most common cases are interfaces that allow calling <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> or <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> from a higher-level language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>...with the caveat that the collection of functions that are callable in </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is restricted -- generally things that are callable from C.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are implementations for many languages to call <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> in <a href="SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator.html">SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator</a> (SWIG).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Implementing an FFI can be done in several ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Requiring the called functions in the target language implement a specific protocol.  JNI works in this fashion; any C/C++ function called by JNI must be defined in terms of a specific set of Java-compatible datatypes.  Converting this stuff to standard C datatypes and back is (or at least was) the responsibility of the called native code.  JNI also provides ways for C code to call back Java code -- necessary in many cases, especially if the C code needs to "hold on to" Java objects.  The Java <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a> does not examine the native code for references, so C code that holds on to Java objects must explicitly mark them reserved/unreserved (this is not necessary for objects which are arguments to native functions, but whose native functions go out of scope when the function returns).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Implementing a wrapper library that takes a given low-language function, and "wraps" it with code to do data conversion to/from the high-level language conventions. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Examples are the FFIs of Squeak

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Requiring functions declared native to use a subset of high-level functionality (which is compatible with the low-level language).
        </li>

        <em>If we refer to the low-level language as the "host" language and the high-level language as the "guest" language, then these three approaches boil down to ways to bridge the gap between them, as follows.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The host is expected to bridge the gap. You have to write host-language functions specifically to be called from the guest. An API may be offered for the host language to use to communicate with guests.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The gap is bridged by some kind of tool that does not belong strictly to either the host or guest languages.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The guest is expected to bridge the gap. This means the guest language can call any host-language function, but the guest language now has to have support for many low-level features, in order to communicate with the host language effectively.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It seems that many <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> programs use "components" written in C.
