        Shortest Wiki Contest
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ward's Wiki code (<a href="WikiBase.html">WikiBase</a>) is amazingly elegant and short. But it was just a bit of Perl-4. What's the shortest piece of source you can write that will implement a fully-featured wiki? Use any language you like. See <a href="WikiPrinciples.html">WikiPrinciples</a> for a list of the (minimum) requirements for a wiki.

      <p>
        Of course, the shortest source implementing a fully-featured Wiki is written in the WikiPlusPlus language (implementation of which is left as an exercise to the reader). It looks something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        wiki^standard: run<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>I got a "Cross-Search Time-out Error on Line 1". Can you help me fix it? :-) </em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Does storing the HTML as templates in separate files, rather than in the source code count as SLOC? Could be a loophole there.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Since mixing HTML and code is generally discouraged, I would have to say templates are fair. Templates will also be small and not interesting to optimize anyway.</em>

      <p>
        Thanks for your confidence Tim. My wiki/4 was 220 lines of perl in its first working version, though it has grown since. I got rid of dispatching by writing it as cooperating cgi scripts: wiki.cgi, edit.cgi, post.cgi, search.cgi and changes.cgi. I bet it could be done in 100 lines. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
      </p>

        Perl is definitely the language. I'm not sure Ward is twisted enough to win. -- <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's mighty big talk round these here parts, Clifford. Me, I'd back python/zope to beat out perl in shortness on account of there seems like a lot in zope to leverage. But I also wonder whether some Interdev magic might put the freeware to shame... -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

      <p>
        I'd bet that the proprietary <a href="KayLanguage.html">KayLanguage</a> from <a href="http://www.kx.com">http://www.kx.com</a> will surpass any 0known experience with concise programming. When programming in K, one refers to characters of code, not lines. And there are usually no loops. -- <a href="EricNewhuis.html">EricNewhuis</a> <em>that sounds a lot like APL, which was much more widespread.</em> The <a href="KayLanguage.html">KayLanguage</a> is a descendant of APL, among others, so that isn't surprising. APL is very concise but not 'optimized' for web/text processing, so I doubt it would be *the* shortest.

        Can't? Why not? "What is the shortest time a third party reader needs to understand another person's <a href="WikiSource.html">WikiSource</a>?" That would be a more useful measurement.

        <em>I concur. I looked at a short perl wiki, and it left me aghast. Then I looked at wypy with all the lambda and RE, and was again floored. When I look at my VERBOSE procedural programming, it reads like Dick and Jane at the compsci lab. Which means any reasonably literate wannabe geek can comprehend it.

      <p>
        The 23 line Python contender <a href="WyPy.html">WyPy</a> currently (2003-08) wipes the floor with all the other submissions, but I wouldn't call it exactly readable, unfortunately. Still, <a href="ObfuscatedPython.html">ObfuscatedPython</a> is possible then...

        I see <a href="WyRiki.html">WyRiki</a> was just added - at 20 lines of Ruby. But I'm sure that a bunch of useless new lines could be removed, to make it "shorter."

      <p>
        I'm sure that something like "#!/bin/sh\nGET <a href="http://wiki.tld/">http://wiki.tld/</a> | perl" would make for a much shorter wiki, but that'd be cheating now, wouldn't it? Perhaps it's as best to limit this competition to some major languages (Python, Perl, Ruby, PHP seem the best contenders)? I hope that everyone enjoys the new <a href="WyPy.html">WyPy</a>: <a href="WyRiki.html">WyRiki</a>'s introduction was quite a challenge! -- <a href="SeanPalmer.html">SeanPalmer</a>

        Anybody up for the challenge of SmallestXhtmlWikiContest?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Why? The difference in HTML used by a wiki versus the XHTML equivalent is quite trivial; you could just convert any of the existing entries to XHTML, in about 5 minutes, and be done with.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It appears to me that it would be quite different as simple regular expressions no longer work. When you see \n\n, a simple implementation will put in <p>, an xhtml wiki has to analyze all the appropriate closing tags before continuing. I'm also curious about how implementations deal with such things as between <strong><em><strong><em></em></em></strong></strong> and <em></em>'<em><strong></strong><em>'</em></em>. I'd also expect as much semantic correctness as possible. For example consecutive list items should be contained within <ul></ul>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well since <a href="XhtmlIsDead.html">XhtmlIsDead</a>, I see this as rather pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
        How about a MostReadableShortestWiki, what good is code that can't be read in any decent timeframe?

        It would seem that the challenge has come to the point of counting in characters instead of lines.
