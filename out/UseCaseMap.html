        Use Case Map
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="UseCaseMap.html">UseCaseMap</a> is the weaving of multiple <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> threads into a tapestry.
      </p>
      <p>
        On <a href="CritiqueOfUseCases.html">CritiqueOfUseCases</a>, I babbled that
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Consider a system to be a volume in a discrete space. A discrete space is built out of indivisible quantized partitions, like pixels on your screen. It's discrete because your computer is. It's that Turing guy again.. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>If you consider that, then each feature, or <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>, is like a point inside this volume. A <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> is like a path through the volume. A diagram is like a surface inside this volume. </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        A <a href="UseCaseMap.html">UseCaseMap</a>, then, adds an extra dimension to the one-dimensional <a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a>. (*)
      </p>
      <p>
        The very simplest <a href="UseCaseMap.html">UseCaseMap</a> is purely linear and looks very much like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        r1<br/>
        @__________|<br/>
        r2  |<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Where @ is the start of the use case, | is the end of the use case and r1 and r2 are responsibilities of the use case.
      </p>
      <p>
        This would (maybe) represent a <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> that looked much like this for, say, someone hitting <ESC> on her keyboard:
      </p>
      <code>
        Actors: User, keyboard, OS<br/>
        Precondition: The keyboard is in its default state (all keys up)<br/>
        Triggering event: User presses <ESC><br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        r1. Keyboard sends an <ESC> make message to the OS.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        r2. OS beeps.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Postcondition: The <ESC> key is currently down.<br/>
        Resulting event: none.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The @ (which is really a solid dot) is the precondition and triggering event all in one. The | is the postcondition and resulting event all in one. The actors come into play during the bound map (see below).
      </p>
      <p>
        A more complex example would look something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        _____|<br/>
        r1        /  r4 |<br/>
        @____________/<br/>
        r2  \_____|<br/>
        r3 |<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The fork is an or-fork. That is, one of r3 or r4 will be executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.usecasemaps.org">http://www.usecasemaps.org</a> can likely tell you more about the notation than I could. UseCaseMaps look like squids to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <em>bound use case map</em> or, simply, <em>bound map</em> is a <a href="UseCaseMap.html">UseCaseMap</a> layered on top of a non-empty set of components. For example, if A, B and C are components:
      </p>
      <code>
        +---------+<br/>
        |    B    |<br/>
        +----+       |   ______|__|<br/>
        |  A |       |  / r4   |  |<br/>
        |    |       +-/-------+<br/>
        |r1  | +------/-----------+<br/>
        @__|____|_|_____/   C        |<br/>
        |    | | r2  \            |<br/>
        +----+ |      \___________|___|<br/>
        |         r3       |   |<br/>
        |                  |<br/>
        +------------------+<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The responsibilities r1 through r4 have been bound to components here.
      </p>
      <p>
        (*) Actually, a <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> is probably more than one-dimension. However, just note that there is a total ordering between the dimensionalities of { <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>, <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a>, <a href="UseCaseMap.html">UseCaseMap</a>, the whole system }.

        I don't see much benefit in drawing UseCaseMaps. They smell greatly of <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> because I don't know what components I'll need. And if I misattributed r2 to component C instead of component A, refactoring the code requires changing the <a href="UseCaseMap.html">UseCaseMap</a>. Moreover, I won't really know until I write the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        They do provide a greater dimensioned slice of the system, but that should come after it's written, not before. This is very abstract, and <a href="AllAbstractionsLie.html">AllAbstractionsLie</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a benefit, though, you can tie various UseCaseMaps together into a <a href="ScenarioCluster.html">ScenarioCluster</a> and you can show interactions between various <a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a> here. But, that's tying the requirements down pretty solidly which assumes requirements are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another benefit proposed is ease of using formal methods and simulation to determine whether requirements are correct and consistent, and high-level design decisions aren't faulty (e.g. by providing race conditions). Well, requirements are going to be incorrect and inconsistent as a matter of course anyway. So, if you need a prototype to discover this, you might as well make your prototype your first iteration. It's cheaper.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for race conditions or high-level constraints: in my experience, constraints invariably get violated at the lowest level in the design, not the highest. If it isn't obvious the design at a high level is correct, the system is too complicated. (this should be fractally applied throughout the system; cf <a href="FractalComprehension.html">FractalComprehension</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll likely have more to say and statements to retract after I draw more UseCaseMaps over the next few weeks. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
