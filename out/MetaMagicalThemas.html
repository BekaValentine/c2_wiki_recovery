        Meta Magical Themas

        The name of <a href="DouglasHofstadter.html">DouglasHofstadter</a>'s column in the magazine <a href="ScientificAmerican.html">ScientificAmerican</a> published from circa 1981.

        The name is remarkable because it is an anagram of MathematicalGames, which was the name of the same column when <a href="MartinGardner.html">MartinGardner</a> was writing it. A book of almost the same name:

        [ISBN 0465045669] collected the columns and, I think, some related material that did not make it into <a href="ScientificAmerican.html">ScientificAmerican</a>. The book is a collection of <a href="DouglasHofstadter.html">DouglasHofstadter</a>'s columns, each paired with a reflection on the column written by Hofstadter. I am under the impression it was published in order to maintain his public presence while he worked on other books -- I seem to recall his writing something to that effect in his <a href="LeTonBeauDeMarot.html">LeTonBeauDeMarot</a>.
