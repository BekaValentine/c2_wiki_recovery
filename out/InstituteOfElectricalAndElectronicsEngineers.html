        Better known as the IEEE; a professional society of (as the name suggests) electrical engineers. (The society has been around a while, the name suggests a dichotomy between those EEs which use semiconductors and those which don't; a dichotomy that hardly exists these days). Also includes many computer science professionals among its ranks.

        Among the activities of the IEEE are publication of numerous academic journals on all sorts of topics; development and promulgation of technical standards, including

        <strong>Recent events</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently announced a policy of refusing to accept papers from nationals of certain alleged "terrorist" states (including Cuba, which hasn't engaged in any terrorism that I can recall). This has, to put it mildly, been quite controversial. IEEE claims that this is necessary to comply with US laws; however, no other US-based standards body or professional society of IEEE's stature has followed suit.
