        <strong></strong><a href="YpsilantiEyeball.html">YpsilantiEyeball</a><strong> was an experimental Wiki designed to serve the community needs of Ypsilanti Michigan.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It currently lives at: <a href="http://replay.web.archive.org/20050424002751/http://sknkwrks.dyndns.org:1957/writewiki/wiki.pl">http://replay.web.archive.org/20050424002751/http://sknkwrks.dyndns.org:1957/writewiki/wiki.pl</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretty soon (some time in the next year or so), we're going to move it off onto a public server and put up a more spiffy front page.  The objective of the Wiki part will be to let interested people in the community exchange information.  I have friends on several public commissions who are interested in using it to post meeting minutes for public perusal.

        Several friends and I are also putting together an artist resource center that will have conventional and high-tech art production tools.  I imagine that we'll either carve out a corner of the <a href="YpsilantiEyeball.html">YpsilantiEyeball</a> for our purposes, or else we'll set up another database.

        By the way -- I use about a half-dozen other private Wiki databases for fact collection, drill-down and trouble-ticket tracking for mission critical software projects.  It works great, but only if you figure out how to make it work.  Unlike bug-tracking databases where everything is pretty much spelled out, you have to design an intelligent structure.  The best thing is that you can add more information and structure free-form as you go, so the system morphs to fit your changing needs -- without a significant investment in software or database development.
