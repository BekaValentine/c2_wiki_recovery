      <code>
        cat foo.txt | less<br/>

      <code>
        less foo.txt<br/>

      <code>
        cat foo.txt | grep fribble.\*zot<br/>

        but this last is a matter of preference; some people worry that the latter could destroy the contents of foo.txt with only a single-character typo.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yeah, but the first command with a single letter typo can destroy some_command_which does_not_take_a_file_name.  Just try cat foo > some_command when you meant cat foo | some_command sometime when other people depend on some_command and you have write access to it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Only if you specified some_command_etc with a full pathname.</em>
      </p>

        Pipes in fact tend to be monstrously inefficient, but the mode (StatisticalFunction) development machine has enough CPU time that nobody would ever, ever notice, except when it's playing <a href="QuakeGame.html">QuakeGame</a>.

      <p>
        <em>OTOH...  If you don't know how to avoid writing </em>'rm -rf /<em>' when you don't mean it, don't use shell.  ;-></em>
      </p>

        If I'm developing a complex pipeline and the input file is long, I'll often start the pipe with head
      </p>
      <code>
        head long_file | monstrous catenation | of | awk | and | cut and |sed<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When the answer looks right, I just replace the head with cat.  If efficiency matters, why are you using the shell anyway?
