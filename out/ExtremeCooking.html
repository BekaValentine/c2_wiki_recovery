        How would you apply XP in the kitchen? It can be done - see <a href="IronChef.html">IronChef</a>.

        I wouldn't.  But I have seen "plan to throw one away" (from Brooks' <a href="MythicalManMonth.html">MythicalManMonth</a>) applied with some success. When cooking something new, follow the recipe exactly the first time. Then, the 2nd through Nth times, customize.

        I like to do this in the standard XP way - small changes for each iteration (this is how I created my pancake and soup recipes).

      <p>
        This I understand for soup, but pancakes? C'mon :)

        I notice that much of this page assumes that the result of <a href="ExtremeCooking.html">ExtremeCooking</a> is minimalist cooking.  But also consider your requirements.  Do you just want to keep yourself alive, or do you want to have fun and/or enjoy what you eat?  Are you cooking for yourself, or friends and family, or customers?  Are you cooking for someone you'd like to impress, or see naked, or get out of the house as soon as possible?  Or all three?  What works for one situation might be inadequate or excessive for another.  --<a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        Well, the principle of <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> would seem to indicate that we should just go to various restaurants instead of bothering to cook.  Or maybe skip real food and just take our nutrients in the form on pills and tasteless sludge.

        <em>Only if you apply it to eating, not cooking. It's the simplest way to eat.</em>

      <p>
        <em>If you apply it to cooking, you could make it work on the level of buying prepared ingredients at the store instead of fashioning your own, i.e. buying curry powder and seasoning packets instead of grinding and drying your own spices and making your own seasoning mixes.</em>

Make sure you have the basics, and that they're all high-quality.  Only buy utensils when you've demonstrated a need for them.

        <em>Perhaps </em><a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> means you should only eat the number of calories your body needs.  Then you won't have to <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> (diet) later<em></em>

        <em>My Mom does this: She keeps only those recipes that everybody likes (to various extents), and if she tries a recipe that people don't like, she immediately throws it away.

        <a href="TestDrivenDesign.html">TestDrivenDesign</a>: Make sure all your ingredients are ready before you start to cook.  It's so frustrating to be halfway through preparing a meal and realize that you don't have enough of one ingredient.  Also, try out a recipe for yourself before trying it out with guests.
