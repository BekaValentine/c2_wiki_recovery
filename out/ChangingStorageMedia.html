        Storing DigitalStuff (including my programming and educational stuff) is a task made easier and more compact by faster computers and modern MicroMedia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my present collection
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The earliest and largest volume of DigitalStuff is on FloppyDisks of the 5 1/4 inch type.
          <ul>
            <li>
               While much of what is possible to transfer to better media has been done, transfer is neither complete or optimized yet.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The second most volume of DigitalStuff  is on FloppyDisks of the 3 1/2 inch type.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Some of the 5 1/4 floppies were earlier transferred to this media type, and all 3 1/2 floppies need to be transfered.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The third most volume of DigitalStuff is on Original Installation Disks and data disks of type CD.
        </li>
        <li>
           The fourth most volume of DigitalStuff is on Original Installation Disks and data disks of type DVD.
        </li>
        <li>
           The fifth most volume of DigitalStuff is on Fixed Disk Drives in or removed from LegacyComputers.
        </li>
        <li>
           The sixth place in volume of DigitalStuff goes to Flash Drives serving as portable memory devices, or on MemoryCards containing photos.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All six of these are soon to be stored on portable UsbDrives, of what I call the note card size, being 3x5x0.375 or less than 6 cubic inches in volume.
        Total being 7 such drives with a total of less than 50 cubic inches of volume (about 10 terabyte capacity in all) which should do it for a little while.

        Storing Audio and Video stuff is also one of the things <a href="ChangingStorageMedia.html">ChangingStorageMedia</a> can make such that it may be played anywhere I am.
