        Unit Tests Reconsidered
      </h1>
      <p>
        To improve focus, the discussion of "XP does not use the <a href="StandardDefinitionOfUnitTest.html">StandardDefinitionOfUnitTest</a><strong>'s" moved to </strong><a href="XpVsStandardDefinitionOfUnitTest.html">XpVsStandardDefinitionOfUnitTest</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="UnitTestIsolation.html">UnitTestIsolation</a>]
        The whole point of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s is to reduce the scope of the system under test to a small subset that can be tested in isolation. Thus, by the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a>, we reduce the number of variables that may affect the results so we can derive useful information on whether the unit is actually correct.
        <em>[Discussion in </em><a href="UnitTestIsolation.html">UnitTestIsolation</a>]<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are often used in a sort of "<a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>" (although that's once again using the terms wrong), in order to ensure that an interface conforms to its predefined specification. These sorts of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s aim to be complete, testing boundary, failure, average, and interesting cases. Thus, if the implementation coded to this <em>reference</em> test suite passes, we can be assured it conforms to the specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking this even further, we can code a constraint harness for a unit after we've written it to ensure functional equivalence before and after <em>refactoring.</em> See <a href="WhatIsRefactoring.html">WhatIsRefactoring</a> to understand how functional equivalence is important to refactoring. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On this page, I consider <em>some</em> arguments for <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and rebut them. The point is to show that <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are not the right solution in <em>every</em> case - and to be "eXtremely" anal about showing that. On the other hand, it should be clear by now that they do serve a purpose - like the Java Compliance Tests, to isolate bugs to a given unit, and to force functional equivalence during tricky refactoring, and definitely others that should be obvious to every software engineer by now. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, we (i.e. I) should make this discussion less anal, and more constructive. It's more valuable to demonstrate not just <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s can fail, but where and how, and what to do about that. After all, one of the main points was that <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are not a <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a>, so what else can we do?  -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        Most of the discussion below is anecdotal. Please upgrade/downgrade statements as facts are discovered. A good resource is <a href="CodeComplete.html">CodeComplete</a>, chapter 25, which has a lot of hard data.
