        River Of Time
      </h1>
      <p>
        Heraclitus, an Ionian pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, made the point that you can not step into the same river twice. He believed that all was flux and change. The <a href="RiverOfTime.html">RiverOfTime</a> is a metaphor of that change. We are each threads which the fates spin, measure and cut, in the mythology of the past. The notion of threading, sequence of events, BeadsOfPearls is fundamental to the analysis of computer applications.

        A former thesis advisor of mine, Dr. Bo Sanden, was working on something he called EntityLifeModeling which focused in on this existential thread as a fundamental aspect of the analysis of applications. -- <a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>
