        Two Dollars And Fifty Six Cents
      </h1>
      <p>
        The reward from <a href="DonaldKnuth.html">DonaldKnuth</a> for the first discovery of a significant error in <a href="TheArtOfComputerProgramming.html">TheArtOfComputerProgramming</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Knuth has written many such checks; the vast majority of them have never been cashed.  (Instead, they occupy scrapbooks, and reportedly more than a few have been framed and placed on a wall).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone have a check (from <a href="DonaldKnuth.html">DonaldKnuth</a>) for $2.56?
      </p>

        To be precise, I think he doubles his reward every time a bug is found in one of his opuses (TAOCP or TeX).  For Tex, I think the "bounty" is up to $10.24.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So, does that mean if I find 22 more bugs, I'll receive a check from Knuth for $42,949,672.95?  That one I might cash...though I suspect it would bounce - being a college professer doesn't pay </em>that<em> well...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Knuth is not just a college professor ...
      </p>

      <p>
        I seem to recall that the bounty tops out at 2**15 cents.
