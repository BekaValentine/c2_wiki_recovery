      </h1>
      <p>
        A wiki-like site is a web site that has some or many of the characteristics of a wiki, but in fact is not a wiki. For example, it may use <a href="BumpyCase.html">BumpyCase</a> Words to create links, and it may have very limited formatting capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a site is most likely created by a wiki enthusiast who has realized that it makes content management a snap, but who doesn't want to open up the site to random edits by passers-by.
