        Create Flexible Messaging
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Pattern Name:</strong> <a href="CreateFlexibleMessaging.html">CreateFlexibleMessaging</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Aliases:</strong> Universal Data Type, Generic Message Channel
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> Systems exist that communicate for a variety
        of different reasons. The data that they exchange is configured
        for the set of problems that the different systems are collectively
        solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> New functions must be supported which have no
        place in current messaging formats. Each system can be redesigned
        to support the required functions, but the messaging channel must
        be adequate to support the new data types as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong> Current data formats are optimized to support the current
        set of functions. Adding new types may force current functions to be more
        inefficient. The systems may require additional infrastructure
        to support new functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Use a data type that can be converted to the forms
        that each system and function require. Add a typing component (meta-data)
        to each message that indicates the category of data as well as any other
        characteristics that may help administrate the interaction between the
        systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong> An extensible data type will enhance the future
        flexibility and applicability of all the systems involved. The price that
        is paid by supporting extra infrastructure and transmission bandwidth
        will easily be compensated for by the gains in ease of use, administration,
        and viability of the system as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Design Rationale:</strong> Systems designed with only current needs in mind
        have limited lifetimes. New requirements will make the existing system
        obsolete, and the ideas that the system embodies will not be as re-usable.
        The system will not stimulate new functions to appear because it is rigid
        and unable to accommodate change.

        On carrying a type reference in your data: this introduces scalability concerns. Communicating and caching types is an involved business. An alternative is the Perlish method of <a href="CompositeTypes.html">CompositeTypes</a>. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        <em>If the types are maintained in a central data space, it's not so bad. Interpreters, the </em><a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a>, the <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a>, etc. all do this. If the types are <strong>distributed</strong>, then all hell breaks loose. -- David<em></em>
