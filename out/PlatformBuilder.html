        A tool used to "build platforms" for embedded devices (Win Ce and Win Ce Dot Net)

        <em>Microsoft® Platform Builder is an integrated development environment (IDE) for building customized embedded platforms based on the Microsoft Windows® CE .NET operating system (OS). Platform Builder comes with all the development tools necessary for you to design, create, build, test, and debug a Windows CE–based platform.

           Books are pretty rare. SamPhung has the only one that is current.

           MSDN has loads of walk throughs.

               Be forewarned, it is probably the most complex tool you're ever used (unless you've done embedded OS development before) and it takes a long time to get proficient in it. I'd highly recommend gettting actual in-person training.

        The basic idea is okay, but the execution is horribly wanting.

        But I'm sure, once I understand it better, there will be SweetnessAndLight.
