        Design Versus Results Evidence
      </h1>
      <p>
        A contentious theme to many debates is about what kind of evidence is accepted or how much it is weighed. It can be roughly partitioned into "how" mechanisms and "why" consequents, either of which may be subject to measurement or precise qualification.  Examples:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The How</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Write Code, Get Started, <a href="JustDoIt.html">JustDoIt</a> - fundamental.  If we could just 'think' software products into existence, we'd be out of jobs... and there'd be a high risk that at least some of the software products would be sentient and want to kill us.
          <ul>
            <li>
               agile methodologies, <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>, <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, etc. focus on hammering in just how important this step happens to be.
            </li>
            <li>
               beware that metrics for code written aren't typically as valuable as feature throughput while maintaining some level of correctness and reliability.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of typing and type-checking to obtain proof of safety and resist regression.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of unit-tests to obtain confidence in correctness.
        </li>
        <li>
           Modularity of code, to improve reuse and 'grokkability', and also to make other 'how' factors like unit-testing easier.
        </li>
        <li>
           Do the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a> the first time - a 'how' not available in all fields.  Avoids a great deal of rework.
        </li>
        <li>
           Simplicity - a property for any component in a model or design of containing the necessary or <a href="EssentialComplexity.html">EssentialComplexity</a> to avoid burdening the users of the component, while simultaneously avoiding any additional complexity.  This relates to the <a href="EinsteinPrinciple.html">EinsteinPrinciple</a>: <em>As simple as possible, but no simpler.</em>  Both halves of that principle are equally important.  The goals of simplicity are to reduce maintenance costs, make correctness more provable, sometimes to increase 'grokkability', etc.
          <ul>
            <li>
               There is such a thing as <em>too</em> simple.  A component is <em>too</em> simple if a significant portion of distinct components in the overall system that interact with this component need to add similar or identical forms of complexity in order to make up for its deficiencies, such as carrying around state or re-implementing parsers and constraints checkers per-application, or start putting 'if NULL' on every statement, etc.  In these cases, this complexity should have been part of the component or model in question.  The word for too-simple things is <strong>"simplistic"</strong>.   One might say that simplistic approaches cause users of the model to start <a href="AddingEpicycles.html">AddingEpicycles</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               It should be noted that <strong>simplicity DOES NOT offer "grokkability".</strong>.  While that may be an aim for simplicity, it usually fails unless the simplicity is of a form that users <em>already</em> grok.  The problem is that, once people grok a simple concept, it seems <em>really</em> easy to grok; at some point the concept 'clicks', and from that day forward they JustGetIt, and, short of brain damage or a medical condition, they won't forget it -- much like riding a bike.  We don't remember how difficult we found counting and negative numbers and fractions and functions and recursion and the concepts of propositional and predicate logic.  That doesn't mean they were easy to grok; it only means that the brain forgets the struggle to acquire such 'simple' concepts when memory of that struggle isn't bound to our memories under conditions of having to memorize vast sums of raw data; people remember that learning organic chemistry or calculus is difficult because they do it in part by memorizing a large number of formula, but only <em>teachers</em> can truly appreciate how difficult it is for even the brightest of people to grasp advanced concepts of symbolic logic and algorithmic performance.  That said, many people even on this <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> have difficult grasping monads and the basics of <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>, both of which are extremely simple as concepts.  In fact, I suspect that all cases of true simplicity are like the <a href="GameOfGo.html">GameOfGo</a> - extremely simple to define (e.g. an accurate description type-theory or category-theory or set-theory or monads can be often done in less than a page), rather difficult and slippery to grok (often requiring enough effort and play with the idea to earn a 'eureka' moment), and a lifetime to master... and anyone who tells you different is trying to sell you something.  [<a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: This should probably be moved to another page, perhaps just keeping the bold declaration and a link.  Perhaps 'ToGrokTheSimple' as in "It is difficult ToGrokTheSimple"]

               <em>Personally, I understood the reasons for Monads and Haskell as soon as I heard an audio speech from the inventor. Before hearing that speech, I didn't understand the purpose of them simply because no one had clearly explained it in clear English what their purpose was (all I heard was </em><a href="BuzzPhrase.html">BuzzPhrase</a>'s, and Modularity wasn't really mentioned). Most likely the problem stems from <em>the people</em> that try to describe Monads who aren't capable of describing it in clear English (whereas the inventor of Haskell was able to, in his audio speech).  If one cannot understand something as simple as modularity and Monads, it may not be due to Monads or Modularity - it may be that we can blame the person who did not describe it clearly and concisely with clear English. Whether or not Monads and Haskell in practice actually live up to their claims is another story (for example I'd like to see some real world large complex systems using multiple (hundreds) of processors with it).<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Understanding <em>the reasons for</em> X doesn't mean understanding X.  Understanding the reasons for accounting doesn't mean you understand accounting.  Understanding the reasons for statistics doesn't mean you understand statistics.  Understanding the reasons for type-theory doesn't mean you understand type-theory.  And understanding the reasons for monads doesn't mean you understand monads.  Perhaps you understand both, but I do wish to note that this difference is often critical.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>The Why</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Obtain 'services' or 'features' - similar to '<a href="JustDoIt.html">JustDoIt</a>', service is the <em>fundamental</em> reason to write any software.  This 'service' can range from 'entertainment' (for a video-game) to manufacturing to automated delivery of drugs to translating natural languages, etc.  
          <ul>
            <li>
               The word 'feature' is more often utilized relative to a base 'package' of services and in comparison to other products that offer the same base package - i.e. a "web-browser" offers a vague but commonly-understood set of services, and "tabbed browsing" (to avoid window-clutter) are 'features' atop that.
            </li>
            <li>
               Feature and service metrics by Qualification are somewhat difficult to compare on any absolute scale.  Where one product <em>fully</em> eclipses another (such that the feature/service set is a strict superset of the other) then one can say for certain that it is 'higher' on this metric - such happens in practice most often between versions of the same product.  Otherwise the feature-set can only be compared to similar products based on the context of use.
            </li>
            <li>
               Features by themselves are useless.  Features with a customer are useful.  The value derived by a feature depends on the number of and degree to which users rely upon it.  Based on this, it might be possible to come up with a pseudo-metric regarding total derived value.  High-value features are those useful for a variety of purposes and that are difficult or too painful for users to obtain without dedicated support for the feature - examples include <a href="KeyLanguageFeature.html">KeyLanguageFeature</a>s, noting that total added value for adding a new feature that can already be easily emulated is very low.
            </li>
            <li>
               Note that 'services' and 'features' must also answer to various restrictions.  While such things as performance guarantees and small package-size, simplicity, minimal bloat, etc. could be considered 'features', they aren't <strong>service</strong> features and so aren't included under this heading.
            </li>
            <li>
               If customers of a product include the developers and the maintainers, then features <strong>internal</strong> to the design <strong>also</strong> qualify as features.  This can include support for reflection, debugging, rapid addition of new features, good support for unit-tests, etc.  This may be a critical point in some arguments, and for many products (especially those that are never 'feature-complete'), is largely true.  For code that is just going to run a few times, it isn't quite as important.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           To make <strong>money</strong> - a not-so-fundamental reason to develop software, but an often important one.  In this case, the following might also be aims to further the making of money, and metrics to examine your success: time-to-market, monopoly, vendor lock-in, maintaining incumbency, theft-prevention, reducing opportunity-loss, and sales.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Note that ethics often fail to maintain any grasp on people focused on making money.  Use of FUD, bully-tactics and legal threats, patent-hording, bribery of reviewers, buying up potential competitors before they become competitive, etc. are all quite common.  That isn't to say most people who work on such products aren't perfectly good; it's more of an institutionalized evil, as seen with the (* self-censoring for <a href="GodwinsLaw.html">GodwinsLaw</a> *)...
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Avoid ReWork
          <ul>
            <li>
               Feature extension without re-deployment or modification (often via plugins, aspect-oriented, <a href="FirstClassTypes.html">FirstClassTypes</a>, functors, blocks)
            </li>
            <li>
               Portability (ability to use the same product without modification on a variety of platforms)
            </li>
            <li>
               Precision (just reuse the pieces you need; reduced requirement for 'baggage'.  Often sought by modularity.)
              <ul>
                <li>
                   related to <a href="CouplingAndCohesion.html">CouplingAndCohesion</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Correctness - a state in which software <em>performs as required</em> when operating within expected conditions (distinct from robustness, resilience, and reliability).  Not all macro-level products can be qualified here because the <strong>"as required"</strong> clause is often not resolvable (e.g. what is 'correct' for a video-game? what are the requirements?).   But many domains do have clearer requirements (e.g. software for a pacemaker) and almost all software domains can discuss 'internal' correctness at the sub-component level (e.g. the 'scheduler' is minimally 'correct' if processes authorized to share time do receive it).  It should be noted that software can provide services and features in excess of its requirements; these features, even if incorrect, do not affect the correctness of the product unless and until they are added to the requirements (though the requirement for their correctness may be implicit).
        </li>
        <li>
           Provable Correctness - distinct from merely <em>being</em> correct; provable correctness is itself a valuable property to end-users in many domains (e.g. aviation, medical, aeronautics, deep-sea, robotics and manufacture, etc.).  Can sometimes be achieved deductively with aide of 'design by contract' or advanced type-systems.  Otherwise, can be partially achieved inductively via other forms of correctness testing.  In systems that continue to receive service updates, provable correctness must be maintained across updates.
          <ul>
            <li>
               This can go under either. Formal proofs are one way to achieve reliability ("why"), but it is one technique ("how") among many.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Eh, as you've redefined it below, <em>anything</em> can go under either (depending on stated goals of the customer and the degree to which the developers/maintainers are allowed to qualify customers).  
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>That's why we need to rethink our categories here. Who is requesting the goal or metric may matter more than what is being measured.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   As stated here, provable correctness is a product of its own - something you can sell to customers in many domains (i.e. "I'm not just <em>saying</em> it's correct.  I can <em>prove</em> it's correct.")  
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>Yes, but it may crank up the cost, hurting another factor.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   Indeed.  After all, handing the client <em>nothing</em> at all is very cheap; <em>anything</em> beyond that cranks up cost, reduces grokkability, introduces potential for unreliability, is less likely to be portable, etc..  
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>This appears to be an exaggeration. There's lots of factors involved, and its often the case that most need to meet a minimum level to be acceptable to the customer. This should go without saying.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   What appears to be an exaggeration is your implication that aiming for provable correctness 'cranks up the cost' more than do other properties useful to the customer.  
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In any case, <em>Correctness</em> is not and does not imply <em>Reliability</em>.  Software can be reliable and completely wrong, or correct but unreliable, or reliable and correct, or incorrect and unreliable.  Obviously 'reliable and correct' is best, but if you have to choose just one then which is 'better' depends on context (I generally prefer reliability > correctness so long as the degree of error is predictable).  In terms of a <a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a>, reliability might be measured by the system's average weekly uptime where it serves pages under a regular load (i.e. excluding periods where it is down or deadlocked), while correctness would be serving the right pages, executing the right server-side scripts, using the right CGI environment variables, etc.  Simple type-systems target 'safety' only, rather than correctness or reliability, but safety in particular is useful for reliability (albeit not necessary for it).  A way of improving reliability that would have nothing to do with safety would be to have a heartbeat monitor that periodically (e.g. once every two minutes) requests a few pages to see if the <a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a> is working, then takes action to restart the <a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a> if not.  
          <ul>
            <li>
               Predictability - ability for a user to predict program behavior.  Only slightly related to grokkability - a simple AI or random-number based scene-graph builder could be easily grokked but still be unpredictable.  In terms of correctness, a system can be incorrect but predictable if the degree to which the system is incorrect is predictable.
            </li>
            <li>
               Reliability - a state in which software is actually <em>operating</em> under expected conditions (distinct from correctness).  It shouldn't be difficult for people to think of unreliable but correct software, such as a calculator that occasionally crashes.
            </li>
            <li>
               Proof of Reliability - 
            </li>
            <li>
               'Grokkability' - a property of being readily 'grokked', or understood.  This is not really measurable, since it depends so much upon the education and experience of an individual, but a useful property.  Perhaps best measured by having children use it (e.g. children trying out a prototype flight cockpit and simulator for an F-22, and skilled behaviorists tracking their activity and the time it takes to accomplish pre-determined tasks).  
            </li>
            <li>
               Productivity - again, not easily measured, though expert vs. expert productivity is possible to compare for select tasks.  Depends heavily on HCI.

        <em>Why did somebody move </em><a href="CodeChangeImpactAnalysis.html">CodeChangeImpactAnalysis</a> to design? Amount of code that needs changing is a "result", not something you do at design time. Well, I suppose we could split it to test scenario CCIA before release and actual CCIA.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe the amount of code that needs changed to get a <em>new</em> capability or result is intrinsic to the <em>design</em>.  A great number of design features, such as modularity, plugins, aspect-oriented programming for cross-cutting concerns, domain-specific languages and abstraction and <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> so code-changes don't need to be duplicated, and even <a href="KeyLanguageFeature.html">KeyLanguageFeature</a>s and <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> to help do the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a> - or a more <em>flexible</em> thing, such as <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> - the first time so you spend less time needing to duplicate code and less time needing to change code later to add new capability, are all aimed at (at least partially) reducing maintenance costs and total costs for code-changes.  CCIA is something often considered greatly at design time; in many ways, it's among the reasons programming languages, libraries, and frameworks were designed and now exist.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>But that is true of anything. The internal design will of course *affect* any metric having to do with change (including time spent fixing bugs). But the design affecting the metric and the metric being classified as "design" are two different things. "Affect" is not sufficient. It is a results metric.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           If you believe that CCIA is a 'result' metric, then so must be proof of safety or correctness, <em>"Element ratios, such as lines per function, methods per class, tokens per statement, etc."</em>, security, <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> in the code, modularity, centralization of cross-cutting concerns in the code, etc.  These are also 'results' of the code and analysis over it.  CCIA is just the result of analysis over code, just as much as <a href="StrongTyping.html">StrongTyping</a>.  If you're going to split 'design' from 'result', you're going to need to find a consistent means of doing so.  I see three justifiable possibilities:
          <ul>
            <li>
               (1) <em>Properties</em> observable in the end-result are always 'result' rather than 'design'.  This would include all properties that affect further 'development', such as typing properties, element ratios, CCIA, tokens per statement, security, <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, modularity, <a href="CouplingAndCohesion.html">CouplingAndCohesion</a>, code organization, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
               (2) <em>Properties</em> observed by <strong>users</strong> of the product are 'result' and everything else is 'design and development'.  In this case CCIA, typing, element ratios and such would NOT be 'results', but would be 'design & development' issues.  
            </li>
            <li>
               (3) Split the above two categories into three: design, development (including property-results of design and all previous development), and end-user results, and attempt to properly divide them.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           If you can find some other <em>consistent</em> split that seems practical, please let me know.  Otherwise, please carefully reflect upon your <em>motives</em> for seeking placement of CCIA into the 'results' list.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Besides, CCIA is about stuff in the 'black box', observing properties over the code just as much as looking at safety, correctness, fault tolerance, or anything else.  Customers (outside the aviation, medical, NASA, etc. industries) don't <em>overtly</em> care about these things.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>I disagree. It is not a black box to the maintainer. Targeting developer maintenance is just as important as user-side issues. The program code is the "interface" to the developer. The design hopefully is geared to help in servicing the program. How easy a Ford allows a mechanic to change the transmission is a results metric, not a design metric. If you want to make a new classification: user-side or user-interface metric, be my guest. But, that is different than result metrics.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           A 'maintainer' is just a late life-cycle developer.  Targeting developer maintenance is a <em>design and development</em> issue.  CCIA isn't any more of a 'result' than is 'final code organization', 'design patterns actually used', 'proof of correctness', and 'total lines of code'.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Users observing results DO care about time-to-completion (feature requests / throughput - i.e. avg. latency between a request and an update that services it), which is affected by the cost of code-change and the cost of getting the code correct, but whether the reason it takes a long time to fix code is the lack of refactoring tools, the amount of code that needs to be changed, the difficulty in identifying <em>which</em> code needs changed, the difficulty in determining whether a change doesn't break things, or the cost of fixing actual breakage, is all quite irrelevant to them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you feel like splitting things, and you don't believe the 'latency' measure is sufficient, you can add it to runtime as well.  You can also add <em>design</em> correctness vs. <em>result</em> detectable error, <em>design</em> safety vs. <em>result</em> detectable safety failure, etc.  I would not object.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It seems we need to come with a clearer definition or description that separates the two. Result metrics focus on "why" while design metrics on "how". Result metrics are what one is trying to achieve for the "customer" when making or choosing design metrics. (The customer may be future code maintainers, not just users.) For example, some suggest that methods should be kept small. This is allegedly to make it easier to grok the code and system in parts. The "why" is grokkability for the developer/maintainer. Design metrics are "how" rules for how to satisfy the "why".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In that case, any developer is always his own customer.  The future starts </em>'now<strong>... no, wait for it,  </strong>NOW!<em>'  Darn.  Missed it again.</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you seek to divide the evidence along this dimension, I'll help you do so, but calling it 'Design Versus Results' evidence seems misleading.  Both vision AND results are "why" issues, and 'design' is always part of 'vision' (you never have a 'vision' without knowing where it fits into some greater 'design').  The 'how' is everything between the two.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A better page-title might be: </em>WhyVersusHowMetrics<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps our dichotomies are too simplistic of a classification system altogether. This page has gotten away from my original intention. People injected their own personal view of TheOneRightWay into it, melding together stuff I was trying to keep apart.  Thus [1], I'll try again:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a>: Customer
      </p>
      <p>
        Try 2: <strong>Engineering Metrics Versus Customer Metrics</strong> - Engineering metrics are the "how to achieve" side and customer metrics are related to "what to achieve". Customer-side metrics focus on what the "end-user" ultimately wants. For example, a customer wants a car that's cheap to buy, cheap to maintain, uses minimal fuel, has plenty of room, and has decent power [along with a hundred unnamed metrics and qualities, such as being street-legal, not blowing up after a rear-end collision, being reliable, having good visibility, and tons of other things that are invariably desired but rarely named] {Many of these can be rolled up into "safety"}. The engineer may propose various ways to achieve this and even have their own metrics, such as power-to-weight ratio. Whether these match up to user-side metrics/desires or not depends. An engineer may claim that rotary engines are the best way to maximize these goals, but another engineer may have a different opinion. Ultimate user-centric tests such as test-driving and Consumer Reports Magazine will settle such issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        For software development and maintenance issues, things get a little tricky because the end-user may also be the engineer. If they rotary engine (car) proponent above had to also serve as the builder or auto-mechanic on his/her own designs and not just be a "drawing board" engineer, he/she may fill a similar role as the software developer or maintainer.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's true sometimes the customer focuses on engineering-side metrics. They may read an article on rotary engines and then decide that they "must have rotary engine" as one of their requirements. Similarly in software, one may convince the customer that "provably correct software" is the way to go because one can use math-like precision to guarantee results. However, if they later learn how expensive and time-consuming it may be (hypothetical only), they may back away from endorsing this one particular way of achieving accuracy. The typical customer of course wants accuracy, but they also want to keep the costs down. If formal methods can't achieve such, then forcing it down their throat is not the way to go. You cannot make it a customer-side-metric just because you like the technology. You have to show the customer how it maximizes *all* their weighted goals in terms of the <em>customers</em> goals themselves. If you want to use your own engineering metrics, you need to convince the customer that your metrics are a good stand-in or ruler for theirs. This is the way it is because they are paying you. If you give the customer what <em>you</em> think they want instead of what they want, you may found yourself with a different customer or none at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I want to emphasize is the separation between the nuts-and-bolts and what the customer actually wants. Somebody who wants to get to the moon only cares whether there's a choice between solid or liquid rocket fuels if and only if it affects their weighed goals (safety, cost, accuracy, time, etc.). 
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I can agree with your sentiment as it is reworded here.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I would note, however, that as <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> becomes a <em>real</em> discipline, it becomes <strong>OUR</strong> responsibility - not that of the customer - to enforce certain parameters.  An Architectural Engineer of a skyscraper would never be forgiven intentionally skimping on safety features such as state-of-the-art resistance to Earthquakes and fire simply because the customer, who wasn't planning on living in the building, wished to keep costs down.  The same thing will become more and more true of software designers as the field matures.  Not all software projects are safety or security or performance or correctness critical, but since these all are <em>emergent</em> properties (requiring <em>pervasive</em> implementation) that are desirable in almost all fields, it will likely become more and more the case that <em>every</em> software product needs these properties simply to be able to integrate with every <em>other</em> software product that might run or interact, even indirectly, with a secure/safe/correct system... which, in accordance with <a href="SixDegreesOfKevinBacon.html">SixDegreesOfKevinBacon</a>, will likely mean every product.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Are there any topics here related to "properties needed to integrate"? We seem so far away from such a standard(s) existing right now that is almost not worth considering. -t
        </li>
        <li>
           Not worth considering from an application standpoint, certainly.  But worth considering when comparing methodologies or performing language design for a new <a href="GeneralPurposeProgrammingLanguage.html">GeneralPurposeProgrammingLanguage</a> or seeking to build the next generation <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>.  I think that depends on your purpose, really - what should we be doing in the future? or what should I be doing yesterday?

        For the moment, we can get away with whining, pouting, throwing our hands in the air about how difficult everything is, etc..  <a href="RealProfessionalsGetSued.html">RealProfessionalsGetSued</a>.  Real professionals are expected to know more about their field than the customers do.  And, as a consequence, real professionals can't blame the customer for everything wrong with the product.  But, at the moment, we aren't real professionals; we're just a bunch of hackers with a bad case of <a href="DisciplineEnvy.html">DisciplineEnvy</a>, and (until we get our act together) that is how we <em>should be</em> viewed by big business.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We are indeed supposed to know more about our field than the customers, but this is where communications comes in. We need to describe the trade-offs. If they want it cheap or sooner instead of reliable; as things stand, that's their decision. Our responsibility is merely to communicate the trade-offs, not select them. (You can walk out if you want and give the job to somebody else, and I've done that before, but it hurts the wallet.) Product, civil, and building engineers have safety regulations and trial lawyers breathing down their backs as an incentive. It would be nice if we could get customers to sign off on risky decisions. The Ford Pinto and O-ring Shuttle engineers sort of were off the hook because documents found indicated that managers ignored engineer recommendations or concerns. But if people don't die from our software, no such conventions or regulatory body or paper trail will likely exist, at least not in the USA. The problem is that people usually don't die from software. Thus, </em><a href="SafetyGoldPlating.html">SafetyGoldPlating</a> (in a good sense) is not valued by customers. Sure, they grumble about a report with wrong numbers, but they also grumble equally about costly software contracts.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You often have the choice to pay up front or pay out the back.  Many tradeoffs that exist today don't seem to be consequences of <a href="EssentialComplexity.html">EssentialComplexity</a>; they are consequences of <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a>, myopic Simplicity, and other forms of <a href="PrematureComplexity.html">PrematureComplexity</a>.  But I understand that you can't easily justify passing off costs to a small-business customer - e.g. there is no way <em>you</em> could quickly tweak an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> RDBMS like MySQL then push the updates back out to the public repository just to have the features you want for a particular business venture.  OTOH, that isn't necessarily the case for much bigger business ventures... nor is it the case for the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> persons who are starved for money no matter which choices they make.  Problem is, these 'up-front' costs are often huge and beyond easy reach without more capital and time than a typical hobbyist programmer possesses - the low-hanging fruit has already been picked, and the more software designed on any modern platform, the further the next platform would need to catch up just to match what has already been done.  Inertia is a b*tch.  But we'll get past it.  Somehow.  <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> as a field is really only fifty years young.

        <li>
           <em>There's a lot of unstated implications in this such that it is hard to make heads or tails of. What is a "public repository", for example?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Sorry about the logical leap there.  If you had the <strong>capability</strong> to change an RDBMS for a small-business customer, it would need to be <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>.  And <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> projects have public repositories - <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>, for example.

      </ul>
      <p>
        And, besides, more people will start to "die from software" as more systems become reliant upon it, and thus we won't have that - what did you call it? - <em>"problem"</em> anymore.  ^_^  As a note, military now uses software quite heavily for targeting, communications, etc.  Medical now uses software quite heavily to track prescriptions, remote operations, etc.  Aviation now uses software quite heavily for navigation, autopilot, collision detection and avoidance.  Automobiles now use software more heavily for fuel-injection, maintenance, braking, wheel-power-distributions, etc.  Traffic now uses software quite heavily for lights and control.  Firefighters, Police, the list goes on.  Fortunately for software, it's just one component so deaths can rarely be attributed solely to it.  It would be nice, though, if people collected enough stats to add software-failure to the death counter (<a href="http://www.cavernsofblood.com/deathcounter/default.html).">http://www.cavernsofblood.com/deathcounter/default.html).</a>  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, and such software is usually much more expensive per feature. In many domains, management does not want to pay the "medical" rate for stuff. They want it cheap and nimble.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe it is more expensive per feature only because we haven't paid the big up-front costs to make it cheap per-feature for certain classes of features that are commonly desired from one project to another.  As I was saying: you pay up front or you pay out the back.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Heavily-engineered systems tend to stay heavily-engineered and remain maintenance-heavy. Maybe you know how to do such systems right; but if so, that is not the norm.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Will you please define "heavily-engineered"?  And would I be right to infer that you are <em>assuming</em> that obtaining such features as safety and provable correctness <em>require</em> "heavy engineering" and are <em>necessarily</em> maintenance-heavy?  I find myself very skeptical of that pair of assumptions - I expect at least one of them is false no matter how you choose to define "heavily engineered".  I do agree that codebase inertia is a rather fundamental property - a bit like 'mass' in physics - so that if something qualifies as "heavily engineered" it is unlikely to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is an observational anecdote only. The counter-evidence is probably also anecdotal. "Heavily engineered" here are usually projects that involve critical line-of-business transactions (usually financial) or human safety. They have teams of at least 3 developers, formal version tracking, QA staff, and formal logged non-originator code reviews. They usually used compiled languages and strong typing. ("Heavily-engineered" could also mean lots of bell-and-whistle features in some contexts, but not meant that way here.)</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This all very much reminds me of the dichotomy between assets and liabilities in financial accounting.  For example, <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> would be an asset, but for the project to be "balanced", its use be balanced by some kind of liability.  In other words, for every piece of design, there must be a balancing, measurable result. --SamuelFalvo
      </p>
      <p>
        The equation, IIRC, is <em>Assets = Liabilities + Owners Equity</em>, or <em>Owners Equity = Assets - Liabilities</em>.  There isn't any reason that Owners Equity couldn't be very, very positive.  I'll admit I don't much respect the field of accounting and its voodoo arts for deciding values or costs of labor and services and everything else - any profession with competing models for <em>hedging</em> ought to do some serious reflection!  But if you were going to place it, <em>access</em> to <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> would be an asset - the liability being restricted choice of programming language (which might cost very little or a great deal depending on context).  However, <em>use</em> of <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> would be a liability - a statement of properties <em>you</em> are required to meet (and continue meeting), which is some metaphorical equivalent to services and such.  I.e. Using <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> voluntarily restricts your own behavior, and is thus a liability.  The balancing asset would be the guarantee that those properties are implemented correctly in accordance with a code-proof - i.e. a guarantee of correctness, resistance to regression, etc.   (Not that one can easily place dollar values on such restrictions or guarantees... but you can always hedge!)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think you're confusing basic accounting with </em>CreativeEconomics.  Economics, as a whole is the study of resource allocation.  CreativeEconomics is what happens when economists attempt to game the system for their benefit, trying to pass off their crimes against humanity as valid economics.  At any rate, assuming no code ownership (which I find is increasingly prevalent in organizations today), owners equity will always be zero, so in my opinion, my original analogy still stands.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That being said, I like your precise example </em>'much<strong> better than mine! --</strong>SamuelFalvo<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is always code-ownership, just not always exclusive code-ownership.  Public domain = owned by everyone who manages to get themselves a copy.  How well does accounting deal with open source?
      </p>
      <p>
        {Easily.  The asset value of <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> source code is zero.  The (tangible & intangible) asset values of producing <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software are derived from expertise, support or consulting contracts, associated publications, promotion, goodwill (in the classic sense), etc.  The asset values of using <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software derive from modifiability, reduced licensing costs, and whatever value using the software is to the organisation.}

        What is 'correct' for a video-game?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What's wrong with "It plays the game the developers intended it to play."?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        First, it doesn't touch on any service goals, such as entertaining those who play it.  Second, which developers, among a group, get to answer that question?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Which question?  The "Is the video game correct?" question or the "What is the game we are intending to build?"?  The former would be answered the same way it would in other domains.  They would pick a level formality (ranging from not answering to formal proofs) and do that.  The latter requires an answer in any case, and would be done as it is now.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Correctness doesn't cover every goal for software in other domains, why require it to do so in gaming?  I wouldn't consider the entertainment value of a game as part of its correctness.  I don't find tic-tac-toe particularly entertaining anymore, but I would still consider software that plays it to be correct if it actually plays tic-tac-toe.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Correctness for a <strong>well-defined</strong> game, like Checkers or Chess or Tic-Tac-Toe, would be easy to determine.  A Checkers game is correct if it puts the initial pieces in the right spots, allows you to move them along diagonals, allows you to leap other pieces, takes the pieces you leap off the board, kings your piece when it touches the end, otherwise supports and enforces rules, properly determines the winner and terminates the game when all is done, etc.  The 'service' here is the automated provision of a particular game. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Correctness doesn't touch on reliability or maintainability or money acquired or any of those other features.  However, it <strong>does</strong> relate to services and features - it is defined, after all, in terms of meeting service requirements.  So, except where there are clear service requirements, there is no clear definition for 'correct'.  Any software product that provides services <em>in addition to</em> its service-requirements is simply offering <em>more</em> than is required to be 'correct'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with most video-games is they possess no clear idea of the service they intend to provide.  What is the service provided by 'The Sims'?  How do you know when <em>Harvest Moon</em> is 'correct'?  You are correct that if someone can  (with authority) answer this question in a manner that lends itself to measurement or objective qualification, we could determine correctness.  If it goes unanswered, however, we can only presume that the intended service is to impart some measure of entertainment upon players of a target audience, and, perhaps, to tell a story.  For edutainment, one might also attempt to teach a skill.  And, perhaps, creating then servicing an addiction by manufacturing then appealing to a lust for cheap rewards is an aim for certain games (e.g. World of Warcraft or Ecchi).

        In any case, video-games are just <em>one</em> example of a field in which there is often no clear definition of 'correct'.  I invite you to properly contest it in the general case, though, as it would be really neat to find a clear understanding of 'correct' for video-games and other things with vague requirements - something you could post in a gaming journal, perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I would define it just as was done for other domains, </em>"a state in which software <em>performs as required</em> when operating within expected conditions"<em>.  You appear to be including the step of finding out what those requirements are as part of this.  While I don't want to downplay how important that step is, I don't include that as part of correctness.  It's a prerequisite to be sure, but a separate issue.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps we're just viewing these from slightly different points of view.  You're applying the definition of 'correct' as though it were universal and takes two arguments (requirements and product) and returns a logic-value (from <a href="MultiValuedLogic.html">MultiValuedLogic</a>).  I.e. <strong>correct :: Requirements -> Product -> Logic Value</strong>.  I'm using the word 'correct' in a <em>particular context</em>, in this case 'video-games', implying that the product and requirements are available in the context.  In this case, the Logic Value associated with 'correct' is simply not defined, or perhaps (a possibly better word) not <em>resolved</em>, until both the requirements and the product are resolved.  As such, I say that 'correct' isn't well understood for video-games.  I can't disagree with your view, but  but I can say we have likely been talking past one another a bit.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, the original definition I provided for 'correct' doesn't need to change at all, but it is still important to recognize that it isn't necessarily <em>meaningful</em> in a given context, and communicating this was my original intent.

        [Well, back in the day, I got a ninety nine percent grade in accounting in high school and I hated it, so I dropped out of that class the next year instead of continuing. Understanding Monads is wonderful - but proving that it actually works with some supportive multi processor benchmarks/demos such as how Google has offered us information on how Sawzall works - would be far better than simply rambling on about how Monads does this and does that. In theory, and on some web page, Standard Pascal could be the greatest language in the world - until it is tested in the <em>real world</em> by some pragmatists like Pike, Kernighan, Richie, Thompson.. these people who had real world experience implementing compilers (and pages such as <a href="FutureOfProgrammingLanguages.html">FutureOfProgrammingLanguages</a> neither have real world pragmatic public tests yet - so be careful about what we predict on such pages.  We might need a team as large as GNAT Ada to implement any of it. So <a href="RightBackAtYou.html">RightBackAtYou</a> - understanding programming languages is not about just having idealistic wiki pages about them.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The above wasn't an attack on you, though you seem intent on making it into one.  And I agree - an idealistic wiki page about programming languages (such as <a href="FutureOfProgrammingLanguages.html">FutureOfProgrammingLanguages</a>) does not mean an understanding of programming languages.  OTOH, a bunch of pragmatic wiki pages about how to implement and analyze various aspects of languages and interactions - ways that have often been tested and proven already and exist in various languages around this world - do, if combined into one person, form the basis for a claim of understanding programming languages.  And designing and implementing lots of <a href="LittleLanguage.html">LittleLanguage</a>s and compilers/interpreters helps, too. 
      </p>
      <p>
        [Already tested/proven and already exist in various languages - sounds a lot like <em>'reinventing</em> and reusing <em>old ideas</em> and tweaking them for the future.]
      </p>
      <p>
        That doesn't seem so relevant to this context.  And tweaking is fine... it's the other half that is implied to not be so good: taking an old idea and <em>thinking it your own</em>.  People who twitter "I am great! Look how high I am!" like little birds upon the shoulders of giants are <em>amusingly</em> arrogant.

        As far as hypocrisy goes, I've made no claims of old ideas as my own... in fact, I search and find <em>most</em> ideas I think were original have already been done or are shortly put into progress by some company or another - sometimes the idea is just 'ripe', I guess (<a href="YouCantLearnSomethingUntilYouAlreadyAlmostKnowIt.html">YouCantLearnSomethingUntilYouAlreadyAlmostKnowIt</a> applied globally, much like various mathematical discoveries performed independently within years by different people across the world).  It saddens me to know I could still get a patent many of these old ideas in a jiffy, just like Microsoft does.  In any case, I suspect I've rarely come up with a fully original idea in my life.  I just happen to think that coming up with ideas is not particularly valuable - it's making them work that is ultimately of consequence - only 1% inspiration, after all.

        <em>Far simpler solutions,  such as using dangerous freehand Cee functions like memalloc and realloc.. Yes that often saves the day.</em>

        Hmmm? Is <a href="CapArray.html">CapArray</a> somehow avoiding any memalloc (or equivalent)?  And, being a big fan of safety and correctness and concurrent programming, I'd never suggest use of <em>freehand</em> memalloc and realloc.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Whether it uses memAlloc or 10 assembly calls at a low level for its implementation is not applicable when understanding the pattern and concept. If it uses setLength, and setLength indirectly calls memAlloc somewhere - this again does not matter when understanding the pattern. It's like discussing whether or not a copy() function uses assembly calls or operating system library calls. This, does not help, anyone understanding the high level abstract concept of a pattern.

      <p>
        <em>Yes, how patronizing. We all know what a </em>'dynamic<strong> array is. Freepascal and Delphi have had them built in for </strong>years<strong> now. That is what triggers one to </strong>avoid<strong> using built in dynamic arrays - since a dynamic array algorithm can <em>vary</em>.  Apparently, you still don't understand - nor will you probably ever - I'd suggest you'd just use </strong>realloc<strong>, setlength, and </strong>hash<strong> tables. Or use a hashlist - no one is stopping anyone from doing that. Or just use a <em>dynamic array</em>. Whatever a </strong>dynamic array<strong> is. Well it isn't static - so what's the </strong>algorithm behind the dynamic array<em>' (rhetorical question).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you had bothered reading, the algorithm behind the dynamic array growth was on that page, in the section on 'geometric expansion and amortized costs': grow bigger => resize by multiplier (<em>but it isn't clearly labelled as some pattern we can easily coin, which is what this wiki is all about</em> (so... <strong>"geometric expansion"</strong> doesn't count, I suppose.)), copy from older array, properly discard older copy of array.  It works pretty darn well until concurrency or versioning or backtracking or transactions are thrown in - and no worse than the <a href="CapArray.html">CapArray</a> under those or other circumstances.  So, maybe I don't understand the value you see in it; maybe I never will. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "The" algorithm? There is "one" algorithm is there? The implementation of a dynamic array varies, which is the <em>entire point</em> being made. Rhetorical questions will be clearly marked in the future.. sorry.

        <em>It is a replacement for regular arrays when you need to access a[1], a[2], a[3].  It's not so great for inserts - but many of my programs do not require random inserts (and if they do, they are sometimes very rare - and it wouldn't matter - this is where profiling comes in handy). Wikipedia explains a whole bunch of </em>'dynamic arrays<strong> without ever clearly labeling the </strong>cap dynamic array pattern<strong>.  A </strong><a href="CapArray.html">CapArray</a> is a form of <strong>dynamic array</strong> and is just one choice we have. Instead of calling it a <a href="CapArray.html">CapArray</a>, people resort to long sentences and phrases like "this array here uses a technique that has some initial length set and then later it automatically resizes unlike a typical dynamic array". Why not just call it precisely by its <strong>pattern</strong> instead of reinventing/re-explaining it each time - is my point. That is what this wiki is all about - labeling common patterns.<em></em>

        <em>Some who discover the </em><a href="CapArray.html">CapArray</a> don't even quite understand the <a href="CapArray.html">CapArray</a> and just see it as some basic dynamic array, too. i.e. maybe it needs even clearer explaining of how and when I've used it and found it handy. Sadly, I see hundreds of freepascal and delphi programmers (and Cee programmers) reinventing the <a href="CapArray.html">CapArray</a> in their programs using SetLength and ReAlloc - which causes bugs because humans don't always index the array properly, don't allocate enough memory, forget to free memory, etc etc. That is why I labeled the pattern and wrote about the pattern.
