        Basic Support For Cooperative Work
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some say that BSCW (<a href="http://bscw.fit.fraunhofer.de/)">http://bscw.fit.fraunhofer.de/)</a> is Wiki-like. But unlike <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, BSCW is structured. Very structured with folders like the directory tree on a computer drive. Messages are separate from documents and documents are separate from links. However, each type of object has its own format, which gives more direction to the user. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The BSCW document object enables shared work by uploading and downloading the shared document. The messaging, or articles, are in a tree format like most Web message boards. Another helpful feature is a utility for calling meetings. (<a href="JohnDeBruyn.html">JohnDeBruyn</a>, 6/2/98)

        The new version is a bit simpler - eliminates the tree format for discussions. However, discussions are a species of folder, existing for the collection of notes on a particular topic. The tree structure could be replicated by organizing discussions into folders and subfolders.
      </p>
      <p>
        The notes themselves are a bit, just a bit, Wikish. The <a href="mailto:userid.domain">mailto:userid.domain</a> is converted to a mail hook and <a href="http://whatever">http://whatever</a> is converted to a hot link. In addition users can edit each others notes making for some collaborative writing. Since each discussion (group of notes) and each note has a Web address of its own, the hot links within notes could be used for cross references. Certainly not as slick as <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> though. (<a href="JohnDeBruyn.html">JohnDeBruyn</a>, 6/26/99)
