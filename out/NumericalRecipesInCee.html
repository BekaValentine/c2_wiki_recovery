        This is a good source of information about <a href="NumericalAnalysis.html">NumericalAnalysis</a>. It also contains codes, and there are many other codes available for most of these things.

        <em>The original </em><a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a> version of <em>Numerical Recipes</em> was widely reviled by quite a few professional numerical analysts. Anyone know whether later versions, such as this <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> version, addressed the original criticisms?<em></em>

        I believe that the comments were about the quality of the source code rather than the mathematics. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        For information about Numerical Recipes, including discussion forums, see <a href="http://www.nr.com/.">http://www.nr.com/.</a> The site also leads you to free PDF downloads of <em>Numerical Recipes in C</em>, in Fortran 77, and in Fortran 90. You need to pay for <em>Numerical Recipes in C++</em>, however.
