        General Protection Fault
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Microsoft equivalent of a <a href="SegmentationFault.html">SegmentationFault</a>.  MoreOrLess. GPF is a memory protection violation (a process stepping on memory not belonging to it). On older versions of Windows, this was a VerySeriousMatter. But <a href="WindowsNt.html">WindowsNt</a> and its mutant offspring have "Memory Protection", which supposedly ameliorates the catastrophic nature of this error.

           You get a <a href="GeneralProtectionFault.html">GeneralProtectionFault</a>.  In most cases, the program will terminate.  If you have <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> installed, you'll get the infamous "press OK to stop, press cancel to debug" message--one wonders why Microsoft couldn't be bothered to label the buttons "halt program" and "debug program"... at any rate, the important thing is that a null pointer derefence (or any pointer outside the process's address space) will not crash the OS.  In <a href="WindowsNinetyFive.html">WindowsNinetyFive</a> and such; crashing the OS was an easy thing to do.

        Yep, that's the site for the online comic strip by that name.  Also published on dead trees by <a href="PlanNinePublishing.html">PlanNinePublishing</a>.  Intrigue, conspiracy, romance and general geeky wackiness ensue as the strip follows the work and social lives of the employees of the unfortunately-acronym'd company, 'GPF Software'.  Fun stuff.
