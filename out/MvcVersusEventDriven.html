        Mvc Versus Event Driven
      </h1>
      <p>
        How does a <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> GUI system differ from an <a href="EventDrivenProgramming.html">EventDrivenProgramming</a>-based model?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Apples and oranges.  MVC describes large scale structure, </em><a href="EventDrivenProgramming.html">EventDrivenProgramming</a> describes how flow is controlled.  One can use both simultaneously.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Events don't really control the flow, other than requesting actions, such as asking to open a new form window. Perhaps you are suggesting that the underlying framework, the one that is often hidden explicity or implicitly from event-filling application developer, can be made with MVC. <strong>In </strong><a href="EventDrivenProgramming.html">EventDrivenProgramming</a>, an application developer does not concern themselves with the "controller"<strong> code. That is an implementation detail that is expected be abstracted away. MVC implies that they should be on equal footing. Under </strong><a href="WhatsaControllerAnyway.html">WhatsaControllerAnyway</a>, it seems what exactly is a controller is kind of vague.
