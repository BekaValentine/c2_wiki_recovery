        OOPSLA is one (albeit large) part of a larger,
        world-wide community drawn together by a common
        interest in the object paradigm.
        This community is fragmented by geography, which has led to multiple
        conferences around the world.
        ECOOP has its own focus and constituency,
        which differs slightly from those of OOPSLA.
        Each conference has its own structure, which
        breaks the sense of community.
        The geographic distances make it impractical
        to staff both committees with a critical mass
        of the same individuals.

        <strong>Therefore</strong>, seed the program committee with
        the chairs of other conferences with shared interests.
        Program chairs can represent the interests of their
        communities, and can take ideas and concerns back to
        their own communities, engaging appropriate people.

        This pattern has become a tradition, but extending the
        formal invitation is part of the tradition.

        One benefit of this cross-fertilization is to detect
        duplicate work, as when an author submits the same paper
        to multiple conferences.
