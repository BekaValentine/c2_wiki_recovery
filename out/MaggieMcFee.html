        <em>I am a programmer/sysadmin/godknowswhat with the Intel Corp. currently involved in helping whip our little design team (under </em><a href="SteveWilloughby.html">SteveWilloughby</a>) into XP fighting weight. After having our eyes opened by <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> a while back, and after the eventual subsidence of our abject fawning and gushing over his class, we began to buckle down and begin the task of taking our sorry asses from a bunch of <a href="DesignByCommittee.html">DesignByCommittee</a> drones and become a lean mean XP coding machine. Or something like that. We may have still been all fanboy and fangirl over Ward at the time we said that...<em></em>

        I no longer work for Intel, but I'm still a fan of Ward. I now live in Australia and program the days away listening to odd exotic birds outside my window. One of which sounds like a hurt baby. This irritates me to no end. Ninja Turtles are suspected.
