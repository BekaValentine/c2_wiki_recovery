        Wiki Access Rate Limited
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Symptom</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        Too many posts from your-site. Your changes not saved.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanism</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki checks when persistent pests have last posted and reports this message when they come back too soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rationale</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In an effort to avoid outright banning any individual, I devised this scheme to give volunteers a chance to keep up with a persistent pest. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>History</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This mechanism was installed in 2004 and only applied to two people. It had some positive effect, but not enough. The machinery is still there but the people in question have been otherwise restricted or denied.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Recourse</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Moderate your posting. After a month or so, write me and explain how your attitude toward posting has changed. If you are the original pest, don't bother writing.
