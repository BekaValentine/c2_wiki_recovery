        An <a href="ExtremeProgrammingMaster.html">ExtremeProgrammingMaster</a> adds value to the development process by removing that without.

      <p>
        ... or those without ...

        Who is the <a href="ExtremeProgrammingMaster.html">ExtremeProgrammingMaster</a>?  What does he want?

        Kent is one, Ward is another. He wants to make your programming life better. See <a href="ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap.html">ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap</a>.

        The <a href="ExtremeProgrammingMaster.html">ExtremeProgrammingMaster</a>s possess understanding<br/>
        So profound they can not be understood.<br/>
        Because they cannot be understood <br/>
        I can only describe their appearance:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Cautious as one crossing thin ice,<br/>
        Undecided as one surrounded by danger,<br/>
        Modest as one who is a guest,<br/>
        Unbounded as melting ice,<br/>
        Genuine as unshaped wood,<br/>
        Broad as a valley,<br/>
        Seamless as muddy water.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Who stills the water that the mud may settle,<br/>
        Who seeks to stop that he may travel on,<br/>
        Who desires less than may transpire,<br/>
        Decays, but will not renew.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Lovely, but Cautious? Undecided? Modest? Deponent thinketh not.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ah, but you are cautious; you don't rush to solution, but only do what you need right now. And you're undecided; you don't do <a href="AjiKeshi.html">AjiKeshi</a>, but rely on empiricism to make your choice for you. You're modest; as <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> you try to demonstrate respect for others whenever you're able. No?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OK ... we'll rename it Wimp Programming. ;->;</em>

        In the future, I'll always think of you as "Seamless as muddy water" :-) --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Oh.  I thought it was a misprint.  I thought it was spozed to be 'Sings less than MuddyWaters'.  My bad. -- <a href="MichaelHill.html">MichaelHill</a>
