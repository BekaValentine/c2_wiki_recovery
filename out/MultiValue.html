        This link describes <a href="MultiValue.html">MultiValue</a> - it may be a bit of overkill though. And I am sorry that it is a PDF.

        Since I would not attempt to describe <a href="MultiValue.html">MultiValue</a>, because it is one of those Gnostic things - you need to experience it to appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could describe one of the benefits though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MultiValue.html">MultiValue</a> concepts, at least those manifest in Pick and the many Pick derivatives, transcend the usual distinction between process and data. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They permit the development of systems which directly model the solutions to the requirements at the source code level. Familiarity with <a href="MultiValue.html">MultiValue</a> concepts allows the closest I have seen to <a href="ExecutableSpecifications.html">ExecutableSpecifications</a>. UML claims to lead at present, but it will never reach the clarity of <a href="MultiValue.html">MultiValue</a> as long as it is constrained by underlying relational database concepts. And IMHO UML has lost the plot - it is becoming self-serving - the target of development improvement has been lost in the target of diagrammatic modelling tool improvement. -- <a href="PeterLynch.html">PeterLynch</a>

        This paper interests me greatly since I have sort of stumbled toward <a href="NestedRelational.html">NestedRelational</a> as a universal data format in some of my own amateur hacking. It's very similar to <a href="ResourceDescriptionFramework.html">ResourceDescriptionFramework</a> in a lot of ways, although slightly simpler and more powerful, I think - you could base <a href="NestedRelational.html">NestedRelational</a> on pairs of (name,property) where (property) can be either a Boolean atom or a thing described by a set of properties, rather than triples of (subject,predicate,object) or (object,slot,value). 
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple Lispy syntax for such relations might be:
      </p>
      <p>
        (name property property...) 
      </p>
      <p>
        eg
      </p>
      <p>
        (cat (name Fluffy) (owner Schroedinger) (in box) alive hungry (likes tuna salmon))
      </p>
      <p>
        Our primary datastructure is therefore a named, one-column table, which can be nested indefinitely, unlike SQL tables which can only be nested one level deep (or two if you include the system data dictionary as a 'metatable' of table names). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Having created such a nested-table structure, we can then uniquely identify an attribute like 'cat name' as a path from the root which returns a table, or a path like 'cat likes tuna' as a path which answers a boolean yes/no query. This also seems very much like a string of <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> message-passes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately I'm not a professional logician or KnowledgeRepresentation guru so I haven't yet worked out exactly what this sort of data model would imply, but it seems to me like it has the potential to be a very simple and powerful format midway between SQL, RDF and OOP.
      </p>
      <p>
        A similar idea appears to be implied by some of <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a>'s writings, though I'm confused as to whether or not Date thinks relation-valued attributes are acceptable or not. (I think he's saying they are, but perhaps hasn't quite fully realised that that's indeed what he's saying.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also intrigued by the idea of ExecutableDatabases. It seems to me that if we have <a href="NestedRelational.html">NestedRelational</a> and can therefore let the value of any column be a table, we should be able to trivially extend this and let the value of any column be a *view* (computed from a query). If we do this, we may have a PureFunctional <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> data description language which could be used for <a href="DynamicProgramming.html">DynamicProgramming</a>. For instance, we could define a full <a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a> built from <a href="TheHumbleDialogBox.html">TheHumbleDialogBox</a> components, each being a <a href="NestedRelational.html">NestedRelational</a> 'view' or 'query' over a live dataset, which is itself composed of a series of views over views over views... going all the way back to the raw 'live' data sources, which could be files or <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a> services. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems like it would be very similar to what some of the people working on <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a> and <a href="FlowBasedProgramming.html">FlowBasedProgramming</a> are looking at, only integrated deeply into a relational <a href="DataModel.html">DataModel</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If I could figure out how to develop this data model into an actual programming language I'd be very happy. (Some of the hangups at the moment include: does an empty property set indicate TRUE or FALSE? Are queries lists or sets? Could this be cleanly expressed as <a href="JavaScriptObjectNotation.html">JavaScriptObjectNotation</a> object graphs?) -- NateCull

           years ago NateCull wrote this. I wonder how it is progressing. In relation to true/false value, i have found the most convenient to be null and zero and undefined as false, anything else as true. This allowed statements like -
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        If (Record = ReadRecord(File, Key)) then<br/>
        Process(Record)<br/>
        End<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        (cat (name Fluffy) (owner Schroedinger) (in box) alive hungry (likes tuna salmon))
      </p>
      <code>
        cat = AlterData("Cats", "name",  "", "Fluffy", cat)<br/>
        cat = AlterData("Cats", "owner", "", "Schroedinger", cat)<br/>
        cat = AlterData("Cats", "location", "", "in box", cat)<br/>
        cat = AlterData("Cats", "status", "", "alive,hungry", cat)<br/>
        cat = AlterData("Cats", "likes", "", "tuna,salmon", cat)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or in a more <a href="MultiValue.html">MultiValue</a> style
      </p>
      <code>
        AttributeNames = BuildTuple("name", "owner", "location", "status", "likes")<br/>
        AttributeValues = BuildTuple("Fluffy", "Schroedinger", "in box", "alive,hungry", "tuna,salmon")<br/>
        cat = AlterData("Cats", AttributeNames, "", AttributeValues)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Nate's version is succinct.
