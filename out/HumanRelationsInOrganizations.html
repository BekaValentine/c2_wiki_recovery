        The way people relate to one another in any organization is a key factor in the success or failure of that organization. Whether it is a CommercialForProfit OnGoingConcern, or a NotForProfitOrganization for the assistance of individuals or groups, the interrelationships which exist are crucial factors.

        <em>No kidding. That must be why the topic receives much attention in pretty much every course/book/magazine on organization. Sometimes I despair at the determination of the Wikizens to ignore the existing body of learning on people, organizations and management</em> This topic is posted for the purpose of "not" ignoring the body of learning, It is posted for the purpose of recognizing the "Human Factors" in an organization, and how individuals can relate and react within the organizations to which they belong. To have a course/book/magazine/body of knowledge, is not enough.
        To apply that knowledge/information in the everyday human interactions is what is needed. To do what one knows, not just an awareness of the existence of the forces involved.

        In the book <a href="HumanRelationsInOrganizations.html">HumanRelationsInOrganizations</a> ISBN 0-07-243645-X, the not so clear and abundant <a href="CommonSense.html">CommonSense</a> necessary is explained in great detail and with clarity. Gems appear on almost every page. A definite MustRead for anyone who frequents this Wiki.

        <em>Why? What does this book have that the many other books on the subject are missing?</em>

        It is in <a href="MyLibrary.html">MyLibrary</a>, It is concise, It is clear, It is well-written, It is comprehensive, It is compact, It is understandable, It is practical, and it is applicable.

        If the many other books you are referring to also accomplish this as well in one volume, and they are in your library, and you have read them and do not need to know any more, then you do not need to read this book!
