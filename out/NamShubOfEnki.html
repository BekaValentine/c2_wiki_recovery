        Nam Shub Of Enki
      </h1>
      <p>
        The original <a href="NamShubOfEnki.html">NamShubOfEnki</a>, popularized by Stephenson's <a href="SnowCrash.html">SnowCrash</a>, was the word "I".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That doesnt explain much to me. Is Enki referring to the Sumerian god who supposedly created the Tigris with his penis? And what is </em>nam shub<em>?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nam shub</em> is <a href="NealStephenson.html">NealStephenson</a>'s mangling of the Sumerian <em>me</em> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_%28mythology%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_%28mythology%29</a> for details). Stephenson's <a href="SnowCrash.html">SnowCrash</a> defines <em>nam shub</em> as a <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> for the human subconscious.

      <p>
        It's also related to the Leibnizian idea of a language of nature in which any distinction can be modelled purely as a number. Rather than look a word up in a dictionary, as you must with any human language, in the Leibnizian vision you'd know what the word meant just by parsing it lexically - as you understand any arithmetic number. Cf. <a href="LeibnizianDefinitionOfConsciousness.html">LeibnizianDefinitionOfConsciousness</a>.
