      </p>
      <p>
        The assertion that on matters of opinion (and sometimes even on matters of fact!), all beliefs are equivalent no matter who holds them.  More specifically, the belief that the opinion of a layperson should carry as much weight as the opinion of an expert in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually asserted by the layperson when confronted with expert opinion.  Often provokes a response of <a href="IdontSufferFoolsLikeYou.html">IdontSufferFoolsLikeYou</a>
