        Actually, this should be "robots.txt". 
      </p>
      <p>
        As described on <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html,">http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html,</a> robots.txt is a standard file which you can place on your Web server to influence the behavior of WebRobots when they hit your Web site.  If the file <a href="http://c2.com/robots.txt">http://c2.com/robots.txt</a> contains
      </p>
      <code>
        User-agent: *<br/>
        Disallow: /cgi/<br/>
        Disallow: /cgi-bin/<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (which it once did), then this wiki should not show up in <a href="SearchEngine.html">SearchEngine</a>s, and it shouldn't be crawled by robots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, a WebRobot must adhere to this, otherwise it won't work. There's no way to prevent a poorly-behaved WebRobot from ignoring robots.txt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ward's robots.txt is now (2006-10-17) as below.</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        User-agent: *<br/>
        Disallow:   /wiki/history<br/>
        Disallow:   /~ward/morse/ve<br/>

        Would it hurt for Wiki to be indexed by search engines?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The biggest issue at the time was "spam" web spiders traversing the </em><a href="ReverseIndex.html">ReverseIndex</a> links ("clicking" on the page headers), causing the database to be locked.  See "denial-of-service protection" on <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a>.<em></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>The issue is more often the load on a dynamic page generation system like Wiki.  In other cases, it can be be misleading to index (and archive, in the case of Google) outdated pages with volatile information.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That something has been removed from Wiki doesn't mean nobody is interested in reading it anymore. It's nice to have the possibility to find removed stuff in the Google cache.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The search engines frequently index the "edit" page too, which may confuse the casual visitor and lead to strange edits.  Sometimes the </em><a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a> occurs too, which seems a little wasteful.  The scary one is <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:c2.com+%22entry+point%22&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&start=30&sa=N">http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:c2.com+%22entry+point%22&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&start=30&sa=N</a> which (at 2003-07-05) links to the <strong></strong><a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a><strong> of </strong><a href="OnMonads.html">OnMonads</a>.  This invites the casual visitor to roll back someone's change.<em></em>

        <em>One solution would be to split </em>'wiki?FOO=page<strong> off into several </strong>FOO?page<strong> scripts, and then turn all the </strong>wiki?FOO=<strong> pages into redirections or 400-series errors.  While this might be the </strong><a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a>, it could be easier just to stick a <em><meta name="robots" content="noindex"></em> tag in the top and hope for the best. -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a><em></em>

        I periodically google search c2.com to find things in the wiki, and would love it if somehow <a href="EditPage.html">EditPage</a> and <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> pages could be excluded from the search. I'm afraid Edit and Copy are too common for adding -edit and -copy to the search to remain effective.  Maybe I'll try -<a href="ConvertSpacesToTabs.html">ConvertSpacesToTabs</a>. (ooooh yes, that works pretty well!) --<a href="KeithWright.html">KeithWright</a>
