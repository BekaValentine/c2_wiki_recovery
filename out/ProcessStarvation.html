When a process is not blocked but doesn't make any progress nonetheless because it repeatedly tries - but is always outcompeted by another process.

        A situation or construct used in synchronization or locking schemes based on polling, especially <a href="LockFreeSynchronization.html">LockFreeSynchronization</a> when without hardware support like CompareAndExchange or TestAndSet. The idea can be demonstrated with this code fragment...

      <code>
        function increment( const int * cell, const int sz )<br/>
        {<br/>
        int ref = *cell + sz;<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          cell = ref;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        while ( *cell != ref )<br/>
        {<br/>
        ref = *cell + sz;<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          cell = ref;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This code can be used to securely perform serial increments in a multi-threaded environment, so that you don't lose the result of one increment being overwritten by another. Unfortunately, under the right circumstances that might take a very, very long time. One thread might take ages to complete before it happens to not get interrupted between the new assignment and the loop test.

        <em>Ugh!!!  Even assuming each line is atomic gives the following race condition.  (Luckily it won't compile).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>a is initially 0.  Thread 1 calls increment(&a, 1).  Thread 2 calls increment(&a,2). Thread 1 sets ref to 1.  Thread 2 sets ref to 2.  Thread 1 sets a to 1, checks that a = ref, and exits.  Thread 2 sets a to 2, checks that a = ref, and exits.</em>

        Also any such code written in a high level language (<a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>) is generally broken as well. (See compiler reorderings, single-core single pipe-line hardware reorderings, and cache coherency problem.) The above code only works on a hypothetical machine with a very strict memory model which is basically non-existent. You would need memory barriers inserted in the correct places to make that work in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> + Posix, for example.
