        <a href="WisdomBegins.html">WisdomBegins</a> by acknowledging most human endeavours, including <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s such as this one, have a <a href="UseByDate.html">UseByDate</a>.

        <strong>The illusion that all pages are still fresh is a </strong><a href="DeceptivePractice.html">DeceptivePractice</a>. -- from TemporalContext at <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a><strong> </strong>

        <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s can have more potential, in terms of <a href="LifeTime.html">LifeTime</a>, than static writings from literary giants, but they do need maintenance from time to time. Even the best pages require <a href="RepairingContextualDamage.html">RepairingContextualDamage</a>.

      <p>
        I again urge people to consider the use of <a href="UseByDateException.html">UseByDateException</a> <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a> to draw attention to pages with outdated information.

        If we accept a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> has <a href="UseByDate.html">UseByDate</a>, then is it useful to add an entry like 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           UseByDate Mth-yy + X mths, where Mth-yy is the creation date of the entry? Purpose is to give reviewers more information to determine whether a page should be touched/refactored, deleted or left alone. (e.g. pages on OO conferences of dates past) 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The above thought came about when I encountered pages I am not sure whether the contents are still relevant. The syntax mentioned would provide a reference point relative to the creation date of the page.
