        Life Is Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="LifeIsProgramming.html">LifeIsProgramming</a> is when programming is the most salient feature of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a variety of causes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You're working on an extremely exciting project.
        </li>
        <li>
           You're defining yourself by what you do (i.e. you link project success with personal worth).
        </li>
        <li>
           You haven't had a taste of how good a balanced life can be.  <a href="SteveMaguire.html">SteveMaguire</a> talks about this in <a href="DebuggingTheDevelopmentProcess.html">DebuggingTheDevelopmentProcess</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           You work for a company that thinks developers working eighty-hour weeks are better for the product than those that work <a href="FortyHourWeek.html">FortyHourWeek</a>s.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Well balanced life? You mean program an equal amount in the morning as you do in the evening?
      </p>
      <p>
        No, "balanced" as in B-trees. It's when you have your routines correctly indexed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Balanced" as in balanced reporting: it's when you do all the things I think you should do.
      </p>
      <p>
        How about "balanced" as in the number of bugs fixed today is equal to the number of new bugs discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Balanced" in the emotional state between fear (which motivates you to work) and hopelessness (which makes you want to give up).
      </p>
      <p>
        Balanced: Your two personal computers have the same amount of free hard drive space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps he means when all the developers are scheduled at 100% load in MS Project?
      </p>
      <p>
        A programmer has a well balanced life when he spends as much time programming for personal projects as for personal projects. <em>You mean "professional projects"?  or is that part of the joke?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Balanced: you are devoting equal development time to <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>, Windows, and <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a>.  This may be forced by long (balanced) compile times.  The same sentiment applies to your N favorite programming languages.
      </p>

        Of course, you could always <a href="GetaLife.html">GetaLife</a>.  <em>True, </em><a href="GameOfLife.html">GameOfLife</a> helps while away the time when not coding.<em></em>
