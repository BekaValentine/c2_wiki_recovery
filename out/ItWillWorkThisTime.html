        It Will Work This Time

        After an idea is tried and has failed, been tweaked and tried again, been tweaked and tried again, etc., my inclination is to reject the idea and look for alternative solutions.

        However, management (and colleagues) frequently claim that that they "know why it didn't work", proceed to address the most obvious manifestation of problems with shallow solutions and chant "<a href="ItWillWorkThisTime.html">ItWillWorkThisTime</a>". (They disapprove of my "negative attitude".)

        This happens all the time in the sciences as well. Someone will do some experiment and get "the wrong answer" or have it fail for technical reasons. Later, management gets someone else to try more or less the exact same thing because, "It will work this time." Of course, if fails in exactly the same way. This seems to be a significant management <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

        I have seen quite a few similar cases too, I am thinking that this is the result of a combination of <a href="FirstLawOfBadManagement.html">FirstLawOfBadManagement</a> and the <a href="SomethingMustBeDone.html">SomethingMustBeDone</a> mindset. Another very similar situation is when the idea is new, but management still thinks "<a href="ItWillWorkThisTime.html">ItWillWorkThisTime</a>" and simply refuse to consider the possibility of failure. It results in "plans" where everything is perfect, no problem is expected, and so no contingency plan exists. Calls such contingency is met with "That is very unlikely" or "We will handled that when it occurs". Not surprisingly, problems do occur and chaos ensues, often result in <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a> or similar heroic efforts. -- <a href="OliverChung.html">OliverChung</a>

        I once heard a manager on a large struggling project say: "This time we will stick to the plan no matter what!" Still makes me smile every time I think of it. -- <a href="DavidPlumpton.html">DavidPlumpton</a>
