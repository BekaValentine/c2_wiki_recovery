        Perhaps this should be merged with <a href="TranslateExceptions.html">TranslateExceptions</a> and/or other related pages (I did this once, and the original author ignored the merge and restored this page)

        <strong>Context:</strong> You <a href="LetExceptionsPropagate.html">LetExceptionsPropagate</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> You are getting similar exceptions from all over. You don't know what went wrong because all exceptions are simply <strong>Exception</strong> or <strong></strong><a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a><strong> or something similar.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> <a href="MaskExceptionsAppropriately.html">MaskExceptionsAppropriately</a> where they are thrown or rethrown.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is similar to <a href="ConvertExceptions.html">ConvertExceptions</a>, without hiding where the original exception was thrown. The original exception must be wrapped into the new exception; see <a href="NestedException.html">NestedException</a> to know how. The idea here is that you should create new exceptions that closely and explicitly indicate what went wrong, as is explained in <a href="RefineExceptions.html">RefineExceptions</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DontThrowGenericExceptions.html">DontThrowGenericExceptions</a>. Also avoid <a href="ExceptionTunneling.html">ExceptionTunneling</a>. GenericExceptions are considered bad style. Whenever a generic exception is thrown, you should mask it into a more meaningful exception.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> should be mapped to a meaningful exception like ConnectionException at the database level or to TransactionException at the application level.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="HomogenizeExceptions.html">HomogenizeExceptions</a> by doing the following: <a href="ConvertExceptions.html">ConvertExceptions</a> at package boundaries so that they make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now when catching exceptions, try to be as general as possible. Possible in this context means useful and meaningful. Catching <strong>Exception</strong> all the time is also bad style. See <a href="HomogenizeExceptions.html">HomogenizeExceptions</a>.
