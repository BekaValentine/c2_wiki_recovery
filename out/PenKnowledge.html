        <a href="PenKnowledge.html">PenKnowledge</a> was a company formed in Birmingham, Alabama to create a computerised patient records system, with Pen Computers and wireless LANs, in the early 1990s. The vision was way ahead of the technology available and the doctor's mindset was hard to change. A few people from the computer science department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham provided the software engineering manpower to build the solution envisioned by the founder Bill Council. The company was later sold to Riteaid pharmacy.

        What happened to the vision, did it die with the Acquisition, or does it live somewhere else? It sounds like a practical solution to the needs of doctors to be mobile, accurate and timely. What in a doctor's mindset works against this?
