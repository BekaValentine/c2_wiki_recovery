        Way back in June of '96 Bob began a new job as a Software Engineer at <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> Systems, Inc (located in Beaverton Oregon) after completing a stint at FPL and doing many years of OO development at Chubb & Son Inc.

        Before becoming a bit-twiddler he worked for a long time in technical theater. Lighting and scenic design, stage electrician/carpentry. Really fun stuff! If you're interested, he'll bend yer ear on it for hours!  It was those computer controlled lighting systems that got him interested in computer technology.

        After a stretch at WebMD in 1999/2000 where he was the Technical Director for the first release of <a href="http://health.excite.com,">http://health.excite.com,</a> and then building some Program Management practices into the chaos, Bob returned to <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> where he has since been consulting in both <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> Smalltalk and Java.

        Prior to the Great Layoff of '09, Bob was keeping the MagLev Ruby project glued together at <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>. Bob landed on his feet in Atlanta, where he's currently serving as a <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> Smalltalk contributor to the ICE Trading Platform at IntercontinentalExchange.
