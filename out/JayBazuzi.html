        I used to work for Microsoft on the Visual Studio product. I worked on the C++ debugger, which eventually became the Visual Studio Debugger. I also worked on the C# editor.

        My work in development tools and the Wiki's discussion of development practices have a lot of overlap.

        While at Microsoft, I wrote a blog about my work that may be of interest: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaybaz_MS/.">http://blogs.msdn.com/jaybaz_MS/.</a>
