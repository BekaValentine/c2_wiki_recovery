        The space between the double lines is to be used as a common bulletin-board. Here leave notes passing a message along. The notes in the space will scroll off as new items are added at the count of ten or so notes - ( please add newest note at top, just below the first double lines )

        I intend use an old page for my own categorization effort, one which be included on page DonaldNoyesDiscussion (an existing Page) which as a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>, I will try within a week to assign a reasonable Category. I will probably keep the list on that page short (less than 10).  -- <a href="DoingStuff.html">DoingStuff</a>.<a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.20141109
