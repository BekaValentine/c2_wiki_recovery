        Actual Gummi Bears For Estimation
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>
        You need a unit for estimating the complexity of a task in a project, something more descriptive, yet more abstract, than "ideal time to completion". Ideally you'd like a unit of <strong>complexity</strong> rather than <strong>time</strong>, because programmers are not automata, and work at different rates due to any number of factors BeyondYourControl.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> can't grok why a three-IdealEngineeringDay-project isn't routinely completed in three days. You need to be able to provide more accurate estimates than <a href="CountTheHands.html">CountTheHands</a> in order to satisfy the <a href="PowersThatBe.html">PowersThatBe</a>. You know approximately what <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> your team can expect to maintain over the next little while, but simply aren't that good at estimating task size yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The notion of "<a href="GummiBearsOfComplexity.html">GummiBearsOfComplexity</a>" as a unit of project complexity already exists, thanks to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           You need some test data, measuring task <strong>complexity</strong> rather than <strong>time taken</strong>, in order to calibrate future measurements.

      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>
        Each programmer gets a bag of real, physical gummi bears at the computer, to munch on while programming. The contents are counted out before and after a programming session. Programmers should be instructed to eat them at at least a certain "baseline" rate representing work done while motivated and yet not required to think - say one per fifteen minutes of perfectly InTheGroove work - but without an upper limit. But a programmer who notices a sharp increase in his/her own (or partner's, in the case of <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>) <a href="GummiBearsOfComplexity.html">GummiBearsOfComplexity</a> intake should treat this as a ThoughtSmell, and step away to think about the task at hand (or switch roles).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>
        Each programmer develops his/her own metric for task complexity - based on past history, s/he can expect to "eat X many gummi bears" while completing the next task, following the usual practice; based on current load conditions, s/he can then translate that into a time estimate if need be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawbacks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Two programmers' <a href="GummiBearsOfComplexity.html">GummiBearsOfComplexity</a>Metrics may not be directly comparable, though I would expect they'd at least be close to linearly related in most cases. But then, the same would appear to be true of imaginary-bear metrics or time metrics.
        </li>
        <li>
           While the steady gummi-bear consumption may help with blood-sugar levels (presumably this is much of the reason for <a href="ThereMustBeFood.html">ThereMustBeFood</a>), it doesn't exactly constitute the healthiest possible diet. Especially not for the teeth.
        </li>
        <li>
           You'll kill any diabetics on your team. 
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Known Uses</strong>: None yet? Does anyone out there <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>? I would have thought this was how the idea originally came about. No?
