           Is there any qualitative difference between one of my thoughts and one of your thoughts? More than between one of your thoughts and another one of your thoughts? 
        </li>
        <li>
           In understanding my thought, and distinguishing it from your thought, is there any qualitative difference between my thought in my brain and my thought in your brain?
        </li>
        <li>
           As you express your thought and I express your thought, is there any qualitative difference between our perceptions of these thoughts?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Consider the proposition that there is no such qualitative difference. Then we are merely the elements of one <a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a>, the accessible surface of <a href="UniversalLife.html">UniversalLife</a>. When we think, we do not think within our own heads; we reflect and refract the thoughts of <a href="UniversalLife.html">UniversalLife</a> within the limitations of our form. We are ripples on the great river of thought and form, and our individual minds/selves/souls are merely the glittering images of these ripples in each other. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        David Hume was able to explain something that happens to everyone in their life but never was sure how it happened. He was able to explain how humans are able to think of complex and imagninary beings, such as Pegasus, without ever actually seeing one. He determined that through sense perception, we are able to piece together parts of animals or things (wings on a horse=pegasus) to create a new image which we would never be able to see. It is quite fascinating to think about how something so simple can have an complex background.

        What kind of definition of "mind" do you have in mind (pun intended)? Or how much do you abstract away?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           social - the mind is what is socially relevant of your thoughts. With such a view there is little individuality indeed and we are all part of <a href="UniversalLife.html">UniversalLife</a>.

           psychological - left to the reader
        </li>
        <li>
           biological - there are surely quie some differences in your brain, that influence (not to say determine) the quality of the relations ou can think of in one thought. You can make up
        </li>
        <li>
           chemical/physical - the actual brains are quite different, because the wiring of all the neurons is not fix, but depends on a quite random process. The quality of the wiring of the nets may be alike, but the connections are not. The number of transmitter molecules produces for any given sensation is probably quite differnt between individuals too (though the range is determined biologically).

        <em>All of it. I'm defining </em><a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a> as the surface of <a href="UniversalLife.html">UniversalLife</a>. No society intrinsic to that. The other contexts you introduce are still rooted in phenomenological concepts of life as an attribute of distinct things called organisms. That may seem a natural starting point, but it's unnecessary. If there's only one life, there's only one mind. Then to psychology, biology, chemistry and physics we can ascribe the epithet, epiphenomena. This is not to throw them out, but to challenge them for the title of basis.<em></em>

        Even if two minds are similar it doesn't make them the <strong>same</strong> mind.

        At the top of the page you seem to base your argument on the lack of "qualitative differences" between minds.  I was trying to point out the fallacy behind that approach.  It's trivially obvious that two minds are part of the same universe, but that is not what you mean by a universal mind, is it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, it's not. I'm suggesting that, rather than self-contained bubbles of thought in a Cartesian continuum of forms, we regard the interplay between thought - representation - and form - behaviour - as a universal process, a metaphorical field generated by the intrinsically mysterious life - life as a physical process underpinning what you'd call entropy. Phew! You see why this is hard to say without poetry! To talk of "two minds in the same universe" falls out of this suggestion and back into Cartesian dualism.</em>

        I am thinking that there seems to be a confusion between thinking and expression. Expression is what you make your thoughts become in an exchange with others, and usually the expression does not measure up to the thought that went into its creation. What one thinks and what one expresses may never approach the certainty that definition seems to require. What I have had to say on this page is illustrative of that.

        The question "Who's on first? is an attempt to make thoughts of different persons to come into agreement. Each observer and interpreter will make of the question and the substance of the expression meant to be an answer to be a potentially agreeable statement which will evoke the response of "Yes".

        The question of mind is always going to run into the limitation of language and it’s inherent parameters. The question of universal mind is driven by the very mind that is limited by the perceived perceptions and actual boundaries of the aforementioned mind. So, the conundrum takes hold. Fortunately, this is an existential question. No amount of thought will provide an answer. In fact, the only amount of thought that could possibly provide even a hint of the truth would be the total exhaustive type. What if the mind could possibly be silenced…. Enter <a href="LaoTsu.html">LaoTsu</a>!!! Enter Jesus! Enter Buddha! Enter Bahgwan! Enter Shakespeare! Enter Gurdjieff ! Enter Krishnamurti! Enter Gibran! 
      </p>
      <code>
        Lao Tsu (based in the above excerpts) is painting a picture of the limited human mind and, also, portraying what the experience is to be beyond the mind. Unfortunately, the mind can only seem limited or unlimited to someone that has not gotten beyond they’re own apparatus. I am not saying that a person cannot comprehend the limitations or lack of limitations of the mind as it pertains to theory. It is only through the direct experience of existence that this conundrum can be solved. <br/>
        In terms of universal mind, this is more a matter of awareness of self, or better yet, awareness of lack of self. To discuss any type of universality, whether mind, entity, power, or one-ness seems almost like debating the texture of moon sand without ever having been to the moon. The other kicked is, you probably won’t give a s#$% when you get there. Thanx!!!<br/>

        I finally read this page a long time after someone first suggested it to me. The absolutely strangest thing is that I arrived at this conclusion <strong>BEFORE</strong> I ever even read the page or anything like it, including derived conclusions like "identity is really meaningless".
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is how it happened:
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, I don't believe that any configuration of matter, no matter how elaborate, can ever really perceive things outside of itself or, more importantly, think on its own, any more than your computer can think or feel on its own.

           <em>I don't understand what you mean when you talk about "things outside itself". What does inside/outside mean to </em><a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a>? And I don't understand what "on its own" means. Finally, I don't understand why you feel a computer can't feel, or think it can't think. <a href="ChuangTsesFish.html">ChuangTsesFish</a> is swimming circles around me. ~Pete<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Perhaps I misapprehended the article, or believe a slightly different version.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With that said, I had no choice but to suppose that there is an 'other' or 'others' that, together with a body and physical mind (all the grey and white stuff) completes the experience of consciousness and thought.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The notion on </em><a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a> is that we are thoughts, not thinkers, waves, not rivers ... that these distinctions you draw between body and mind, between body and non-body, and between self and other are just arbitrary lines on a map. I only say this, of course, so that I don't disappear up my own wazoo. ~Pete<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now, to the question of whether there is a single 'other' or 'others' (plural). Most religious people believe an 'others' model; IOW, they believe in a soul that animates life. There are problems with this, though. "What creatures have souls?", "When do they get souls?", "In clinical death, do souls leave the body?", just to mention a few.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>We are waves on a river. Our souls are the sunlight reflecting and refracting. You are buddha, I am buddha, you are Jesus, I am Jesus, you are nothing, I am nothing ... splish splash I'm taking a bath. ~Pete</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="OccamsRazor.html">OccamsRazor</a> suggests, therefore, that there is a single 'other' that permeates the Universe. The CNS would be a highly specialized organ system to interact with it. Do individual cells participate in it? Maybe. Was the process of evolution guided by it? Probably.

      <p>
        <em>Your belief in no way changes the very real possibility that a configuration of matter can perceive things outside of itself, or indeed "perceive" at all.

           I read an interview with Damasio and a few other articles, found it interesting, but not a comprehensive description of his (their?) thoughts by any means. Please explain briefly; I'm in college now and can't afford to buy such texts. To me, the properties of the physical Universe explain adequately how, e.g., a simple cell works, because most of its behaviors are known and understood; cells have even been 'brought back from the dead' in a lab by replacing their nuclei. However, the image I am looking at on this monitor, the slight concavity of each plastic key I press, and the sour remnants of tomato sauce in my mouth do not really exist anywhere. They aren't defined by mechanical motion or electrical charges. It's like one of the special forms in <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, such as 'quote': it can't be defined in terms of the language itself, and is encoded somewhere else. -- tp

        Pete, (please consider the following an exchange of info, not a religious discussion) I find it fascinating that your idea, here, is possibly the exact same thing, or extremely close, to something taught by Jesus.  He said "I am the life" and those in Him have a "river of life flowing" through them.  The only thought or action that is acceptable in that life are those flowing from Him through us.  Those not in that Life are like <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a>.  Those in it are like <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a>, but driven by the <a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a> of the good kind.

        Yes, <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> really isn't a great analogy, since the individuals added to <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> no longer have individuality.  Whereas, in the Christian <a href="WorldView.html">WorldView</a>, people are intentionally given uniqueness and talents, like your creativity.  Are individual traits, in your <a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a> model, just various expressions of the <a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a>?  -- <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>

        Well, the first impression I had when I saw the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> <a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a> was that it was one other expression selected as a substitute for God (infinity, light, truth, etc). There is a known representation of perception as something like a cummulative probability distribution, where for all practical purposes, if the stimulus exceeds a given threshold (or falls below one) there is no change in the output any more. In this sense, when creating (thus being Gods as per your poetic assertion) we are responding to stimuli beyond the threshold of output differences (ie differences are 0) so our mind is blended into the "God's mind" or <a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a>. To discern differences the stimulus must be "small", not godly, human, pigly, not-constructivist, destructivist, of a drank, etc.

        Your references to prophets made that first impression even more founded.

        I guess I vulgarized this a bit :) In any case this is what I got from this. --ArbenTapia
