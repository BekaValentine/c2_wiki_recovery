        Ideal Estimates
      </h1>
      <p>
        From <a href="LoadFactorArithmetic.html">LoadFactorArithmetic</a> about the C3 project: <<Developers consistently report ideal estimates and ideal actuals>>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an interesting assertion or statistic. I have never been on a project where the people's estimate after the fact was anywhere close to their estimate before the fact. Usually, if I show them their estimate from before the fact, they just laugh hysterically that they could have produced such a ridiculously low number.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am guessing the close correlation on the C3 project is due to lots and lots of 3-week cycles. Anyone else have experience on pre- and post-estimates of <a href="IdealProgrammingTime.html">IdealProgrammingTime</a> for a task?

        Recall that we are estimating <em>ideal</em> time, which makes the problem easier since overhead is factored out by the <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> (or so I claim).
      </p>
      <p>
        I can think of two explanations for the fact that they do in fact generally show a good correspondence among incremental estimates on the same task:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Learning effect due to repeatedly estimating: they get to do it a number of times every week. In the <a href="IterationPlanning.html">IterationPlanning</a> meeting, they estimate the task the first time, then a time or two every week they are asked, How many ideal days do you have in so far, and, How many ideal days do you have to go.
        </li>
        <li>
           They could be remembering what their original estimate was, then saying to themselves, I'm about half done, therefore I have one day in and one day to go.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I believe the former more than the latter because often they will report one day in on a three day project and only one day to go (because they got a break or a good idea, or one day in on a two day project and three to go (because they got something wrong). If they were using method 2, errors would show up in load factor rather than done / to go numbers. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
