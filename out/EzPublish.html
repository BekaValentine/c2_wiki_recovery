        Version 3.0 was released March 2003 and is a massive re-factoring with code emphasis on layering, design patterns etc as well as a fascinating approach to handling content with "Content classes" and "Content objects", both of which are stored in the eZ publish database. That makes it possible to create new elements for publishing on a site (e.g. FAQs, Articles, Cars etc.) without any programming. There's also a related data typing system which allows definition of web related data types, e.g. an email address or an ISBN number. There's even support for workflows using a "trigger system" (observer pattern). Despite what you'd think, it's also a lot faster than version 2.x.

        Be sure to benchmark this one with real data - 2.x can be extremely slow. The admin interface can generate a couple thousand queries per page request.

        Is there any tutorial for this? I downloaded it and could not make it take dynamic RSS news feeds on the Home Page.
