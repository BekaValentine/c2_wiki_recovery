      <p>
        My name is Daniel Weinreb.  My resume briefly goes:

      <ol>

        Title: "Hacker"<br/>
        I am working on building a new airline reservation system.  The initial customer<br/>
        will be Air Canada.  I'm working on the "core" part of the "server" part.<br/>
        The server is written in Common Lisp.<br/>

        <li>
          /20/02 - 1/20/06 BEA Systems, Inc.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        Title: "Technical Director"<br/>
        BEA Systems makes infrastucture software; its best-known product, the<br/>
        <a href="WebLogic.html">WebLogic</a> Server, is a J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition) application server.<br/>
        I am the "Platform OA&M Architect".  "OA&M" means operations, administration,<br/>
        and management.<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          /1/02 - 9/3/02 Smartleaf, Inc.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        Title: "Lead Architect"<br/>
        Smartleaf does financial portfolio management and optimization,<br/>
        to be used as part of an integrated wealth management system<br/>
        that is particularly useful for managing large numbers of<br/>
        individually/separately managed accounts.<br/>
        I was hired on a three-month trial basis; if they liked me, I'd<br/>
        become Chief Technology Officer.  The president, Jerry Michael,<br/>
        fired me after two months for reasons that remain unclear.<br/>

      </ol>
      <code>
        Title: "Distinguished Engineer", co-founder<br/>
        Participated in team that designed and developed and maintained<br/>
        the <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> object-oriented DBMS, then and now the best-selling<br/>
        OODBMS worldwide.  <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> is written in C++ and was originally designed<br/>
        to be used from C++; it can also be used from Java and Microsoft ActiveX.<br/>
        Co-holder (with Sam Haradhvala) of the company's<br/>
        only patent (5,649,139) issued 7/15/97 (don't worry, it's pretty<br/>
        narrow, and since Rel 6.0 <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> doesn't even do half the<br/>
        stuff that's in the patent).  I then participated in a team that<br/>
        designed, developed, and maintained "PSE Pro for Java" (Personal<br/>
        Storage Engine), a low-end single-user language-transparent Java<br/>
        DBMS with real atomicity, consistency, and durability (but no<br/>
        isolation, it's single-user), with a very small runtime footprint.<br/>
        I then went back to <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> for a year, writing a fancy<br/>
        asynchronous B-tree in support of Dave Moon's extensive revisions<br/>
        of the <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> server for Rel 6.0 (Houdini).  For my last few<br/>
        years I participated in a team that designed, etc, etc what was<br/>
        originally called the "Business-to-Business Integration Server"<br/>
        and later the "Business Process Manager", written in Java, a<br/>
        product sort of competing with Microsoft <a href="BizTalk.html">BizTalk</a> Server and IBM's<br/>
        Process Integrator and BEA's one and HP's one, which sort of made<br/>
        it hard to sell despite its technical virtues.  However, since then,<br/>
        eXcelon has been bought by Progress Software, and I'm happy to see<br/>
        that they intend to continue to develop and market this product.<br/>
        I am very hopeful that Progress will do a better job of marketing<br/>
        than eXcelon did and I wish my friends who are now at Progress the<br/>
        best of luck.<br/>

      <code>
        Title: "Technical Director", co-founder<br/>
        We licensed the Lisp Machine technology from MIT.  (Please note that<br/>
        the decision that the technology should be proprietary was made by<br/>
        MIT, not Symbollcs.  Symbolics paid substantial royalties to MIT.)<br/>
        We marketed our hardware and<br/>
        software principally to <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> researchers and<br/>
        practitioners.<br/>
        I was sometimes an individual-contributor software developer,<br/>
        and sometimes a manager (Director of System Software); I turned<br/>
        out to be better at the former than the latter.  I worked on so<br/>
        many aspects of the software that it would be tedious to try to<br/>
        list them here.<br/>
        Participated in the design of Common Lisp (one of the five main<br/>
        codifiers, I was one of the co-authors of "Common Lisp: The Language",<br/>
        with Guy Steele, Richard Gabriel, David Moon, and Scott Fahlman).<br/>
        Led a team that designed and developed a first-generation object-oriented<br/>
        DBMS called Statice (with Dan Gerson, Charlie Lamb, Neal Feinberg, and Sonya<br/>
        Keene), which was ready to ship (Rel 1.0) when Charlie and I left,<br/>
        with Sam Haradhvala, to go join in co-founding Object Design.<br/>

        I mainly did system programming for the Lab's Lisp Machine<br/>

        the second Emacs ever written, entirely in<br/>
        Lisp.  I also wrote a debugger, a local-area network control program,<br/>

        Recently (October 2000) I have read <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>'s "Extreme Programming
        Explained" and have gotten very interested in the topic.  My group
        at eXcelon looked into the practices of Extreme Programming and
        considered what we might do along those lines.  While researching
        XP on the web I came across this Wiki site.  Our group adopted XP
        practices to certain extents and were extremely pleased with the
        results.

        Recently (Fall 2002) I was on the Program Committee of the
        second Lightweight Languages Workshop given at MIT (see
        ll2.ai.mit.edu for more info).  This was a lot of fun and,
        in my humble opinion, a great success.

        For trivia fans, it has come to light that Dan is "the MIT guy" in <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a>. The New Jersey Guy is <a href="BillJoy.html">BillJoy</a>. (Source: <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/~gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg01821.html)">http://www.ai.mit.edu/~gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg01821.html)</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I had always recognized the other guy as Bill Joy, that was clear, but that the other participant was you/Dan I hadn't figured out. What was the context of the conversation? A conference or something?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, we were just talking, with nobody else present, in the U.C. Berkeley computer science building. I had recently been studying the ITS timesharing system, and one of the most interesting things was the PCLSR concept (see <a href="http://www.linearity.org/bawden/ftp/pclsr.memo.gz).">http://www.linearity.org/bawden/ftp/pclsr.memo.gz).</a>  I was wondering how the new Unix operating system dealt with these issues, so I asked Bill Joy, after some back-and-forth to explain what I was asking.  The answer was that for "short" waits you just can't PCSLR, and for "long" waits, you return from the system call with a stupid error code.  I have since come around to the opinion that this is not nearly as evil as I had originally thought, particularly since direct access to system calls is usually hidden by a library these days.
