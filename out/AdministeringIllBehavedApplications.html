           Pro-active monitoring: It's better to fix a problem before it happens than react to it after it does real damage.  Watch for things like disk space getting low >instead< of waiting until "out of disk space" messages crash your apps.

           Automate monitoring tasks: Have the system notify you when things are going bad, rather than having to devote your time to tracking it. Computers have more patience and free time than you.
