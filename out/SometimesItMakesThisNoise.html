        Sometimes It Makes This Noise
      </h1>
      <p>
        Your car makes a strange noise. You take it into the mechanic but the noise has stopped.  You say "Sometimes it makes this noise."
      </p>
      <p>
        The mechanic replies "Sometimes I can fix that!"
      </p>

        Once upon a time, many years ago, radios were different. A mother was at home with her young son and the radio went <strong>bang</strong>. She told her husband when he came home and he said <em>Radios cannot do that.</em> This was repeated several times. Then one day it went bang when he was home. Then he fixed it. I am the youngster, no longer 2 years old. Actually, 59 now. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <em>So what caused it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It shouldn't work at all if a tube blew.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>After some thought I finally had the notion that a small, infrequent spark might get amplified into a bang, since both are approximately impulses. Was that it?</em>
