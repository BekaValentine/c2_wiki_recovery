        Power Of Plain Text
      </h1>
      <p>
        Original assertion: storing resources as plain text makes them easier to view, maintain, increases their longevity, and/or makes it easier to share information with multiple languages and systems. Popularized by the <a href="UnixWay.html">UnixWay</a>.

      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>: a program needs to store resources in persistent form. Common choices for this are plain-text formats and binary formats in the filesystem, or some sort of database.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>: the choice of a storage medium and format for persistent resources usually has far-reaching consequences on both the design and the ergonomy of an application. If we have formally expressed requirements that favor one medium or format over all others, we will let those dictate our choice; however there are situations in which the functionality we are implementing demands some form of persistent storage, but no particular choice of medium or format seems to be particularly appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           plain-text formats imply some parsing overhead
        </li>
        <li>
           plain-text formats encourage user experimentation
        </li>
        <li>
           binary formats are difficult to understand, test, and debug
        </li>
        <li>
           binary formats usually imply proprietary formats
        </li>
        <li>
           object or relational databases hinder portability
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Consider also</strong>: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the volume of information to be stored
        </li>
        <li>
           whether the resources may be accessed by other applications
        </li>
        <li>
           whether it is appropriate for the information to be user-accessible
        </li>
        <li>
           how resistant to user-originated corruption the resource should be
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>: unless you have definite indications that a different format is more appropriate, consider storing resources as plain text. This is particularly useful when storing configuration information, but will also apply to application "data" in some instances.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting context</strong>: during development, it is much easier to see what is happening to your stored resources. Plain-text format can be parsed or deserialized "by eye"; spotting data corruption due to your application is easy. Plain-text resources can be placed under version control, where a quick "diff" will usually narrow down why something broke.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting problems</strong>: it <em>might</em> be harder to provide a user interface for modifying resources than if they were stored in some sort of binary format (e.g. serialized object graphs). If you have large volumes of plain-text data, and parsing the entire resource for each use is not appropriate, you will need some scheme for random access. (However, plain-text makes it easy to provide modularity in the form of include/import directives.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If the application is used internationally, formats for numbers and character encodings may vary. Likewise the different end-of-line conventions used for text files stored on different platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        A plain-text format which is trying to do too much will show a tendency to degrade into a complex vocabulary, soon becoming impossible to understand for an average user or developer. Consider <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>.

      <p>
        Disadvantages

      <ul>

           Size (though text files compress well) <em>You still have to uncompress it in order to read it, compression is "binary by nature" after all, so the size issue will come back to haunt you.</em> << Editors can transparently de/compress archived files for editing. And we're talking about config files here. If your config files are large enough to require compression, you don't need a binary file format, you need to Greenspun a programming language to do your config in.

           Character set issues (Unicode? {Dos|Mac|Unix} text files? <em>This is not really a character set issue but an issue with choice of line separator.</em> Using a non-Western language?)

        <li>
           Internationalization issues (Does this locale use "." or "," as the decimal point? What if we want to exchange files between locales?)
        </li>
        <li>
           Security (because security has to be placed on the file instead of on the file's editor, because it's not possible for text editors to grant access to parts of a text file while denying access to other parts, because encryption is binary by nature and harder to use in text files, and because it takes less brains for a user to change something he's not supposed to in a text file)

           <em>Most users overwhelmingly prefer a structured preference editor over having to edit text configuration files with vi.</em> True, but that has nothing to do with whether the preferences are stored in a binary code or a plain text file - many preference editors read and write from text files.

        Not really. Far too many people design special, custom binary formats that are <em>larger</em> than compressed text files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, a .DWG ("efficient binary") file is shorter than a .DXF (more text oriented) file representing the same image. But DXF is best because .DXF.ZIP files are shorter than either one (even shorter than .DWG.ZIP).
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, a .pdf ("efficient binary") file is shorter than a .ps (plain text) file representing the same document. But .ps is best because a .ps.gz file is shorter than either one (even shorter than .pdf.gz). See <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/~anton/why-not-pdf.html">http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/~anton/why-not-pdf.html</a> and <a href="PdfSucks.html">PdfSucks</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        {The above is an unfair characterization. Not all forms of "efficiency" are aimed at spatial optimizations, and not all spatial-optimizations are aimed at on-disk space. Encode time, Decode time, Memory Overhead, Indexing, Partial Edit Performance, etc. can all be forms of 'efficiency' that may reasonably apply. If you look at .ps.gz just in terms of space-on-disk, it might be better. How does it compare regarding other performance features?}
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this illustrates <a href="PrematureOptimization.html">PrematureOptimization</a> -- the misplaced focus on making individual parts of the binary file small interferes with the real goal of making the entire file small. If you're only allowed to look at one part at a time, the best you can do is a Huffman-style compression. But if you're able to look at even 2 or 3 parts at a time, you can often get much better compression -- LZ, LZW, and similar kinds of compression.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is worth highlighting; if space is your concern, compression algorithms are going to do a better job of "designing" your binary format then you could ever </em>'hope<strong> to. My experience is that "compressed text with XML-type formatting" is typically still much smaller then "the plain text alone", and at best, your binary format can only aspire to such 0-byte overhead. Letting a compression algorithm do the work can result in your shiny new "binary" format having </strong>negative<em>' overhead.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Compressed text is almost never as fast or space efficient as the compressed form of a good binary format. XML is particularly inefficient. Consider the test results using a binary form of XML, versus a compressed text form: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-exi-evaluation-20090407/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-exi-evaluation-20090407/</a> . No one knows how many coal fired power plants have been built to supply the power for the extra processing required by inefficient formats such as XML.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Are you, by chance, defining "good binary format" as one that is designed for high-performance interchange (as is EXI)? Most "good" binary formats I've written or used tend to be aimed at high-performance linear indexing, memory-mapping, partial writes (i.e. modifying specific values), and sometimes even garbage-collection, allocation, and durable transactions (e.g. binary database files). Many of them will not compress well because they are not designed for that purpose.}

      <p>
        Random access doesn't necessarily require rereading the entire text file. Consider the Adobe Structured <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> conventions; the preamble contains the fonts and operator definitions, while individual pages are set off by special comments. It's easy to view a particular page in <a href="GhostScript.html">GhostScript</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider a well-written <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> file; commands are defined in the preamble, and it's easy to render a particular chapter or section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You still have to serially read through the data, parsing it as you go, to find the special comments. On the other hand, random access in a file with fixed-size records can be implemented by seeking by byte index.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Not entirely true, you can also lseek() over the sequential file and read until you see a page-marking comment, then do next lseek() based on that information. This way, you can implement a binary search.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then use a subdirectory instead of a single file. You can randomly access every file in the subdirectory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That depends on the file system. Many Unix file systems do a linear search through a directory for each directory look-up. This becomes a problem when you have thousands of files in a directory. This is why databases are implemented as files containing fixed-size records, or bypass the file system and access the disk directly.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        -- Then don't have <em>thousands</em> of files in a single directory. Have ten subdirectories with a hundred files in each, or ten subdirectories with ten sub-subdirectories in each and ten files in each sub-subdirectory. Write your program's file search system so that the subdirectories are transparent (no text file when naming another needs to be aware of the subdirectory system in use). On second thought, maybe this is too complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ummm... It would seem to me that the power of binary files to allow random access comes entirely from forcing fixed length records. The same can be achieved using plain text as well, it's merely a matter of providing padding. Further, for the case of variant-size records, databases don't handle those too well, while plain text can. Above and beyond those arguments though is the fact that if random access is an important requirement, it can be designed into plain text file formats as easily as binary file formats. I could choose to divide up my file into fixed length blocks and create a plain text b-tree representation. In fact, if speed of access was <em>really</em> an issue, I'd do the same thing people do with databases, i.e. have index files optimized for speed of search and access. Indexes, by virtue of being a controlled subset with a specific purpose, can be designed to be plain text with fixed length fields. The only difference would be that current binary index formats probably encode file offsets into the database as a 4-byte binary integer representation, and the proposed alternative would use a 10-character text integer representation. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

These contain some summary information about each piece of email -- the From, To, Subject strings, some other bits of information, and the *exact* byte offset of the corresponding email in the "mailbox" file. This makes some common types of searches *much* faster than sequentially scanning through the text mailbox files. I assume these are binary files.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All the real data is in the "mailbox" files. If the program ever suspects that something smells fishy (say, the file modification date of the "mailbox" file is later than the file modification date of the corresponding index file), then the program deletes the index file. If I'm moving/archiving the mailboxes, I can delete the index files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever the program needs the index file I just deleted, (for example, when I ask it to search for something), the email program regenerates it from the corresponding mailbox file (this takes a tiny bit longer than just searching the mailbox file directly, but then the *next* time I do a search, the index file will make that search run much faster).

        We should also be open to the possibility that the traditional 7-bit <a href="AsciiCode.html">AsciiCode</a> might be preventing us from moving forward. For example, I used to use Nisus (a Macintosh word processor that stored text in one fork, formatting commands in the other) as a source code editor, and found the ability to annotate source code with bold, italic, even colors, did wonders for source code. Which got me to imagining other, more automated, uses for the extra bits. For example, imagine a programming language in which recent changes 'automatically' changed color to glow red hot, and 'automatically' "cooled" to black over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, experience with getting X-windows, Apache, and JServ configuration/properties files to do the right thing make me wonder if such files aren't the problem instead of the solution. I feel far more confident changing real code in a programming language like Java or Perl than I do changing properties files, if only because languages tend to do a better job with error messages than property file readers do. Maybe wider adoption of XML will help, but I tend to doubt it.... Tomcat's XML configuration process is about as fragile as JServ's property files in my experience.

        I'd say that <a href="PlainText.html">PlainText</a> is even more important for ProtocolDesign than for storing data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mistake #1: Newbies at protocol design frequently jump straight into binary representations thinking that bandwidth must be conserved at all cost, whereas if bandwidth is a concern the protocol will be far better off if it is designed to use plain text but compressed before going on the wire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mistake #2: Those who have designed programming language APIs frequently design a protocol the same way, and then send '0' or '1' instead of 'true' and 'false'. Now, a protocol and an API are very similar constructs, but the differences are enough to lead designers easily astray. Protocols must usually be supportable by many platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reasons for designing protocols in <a href="PlainText.html">PlainText</a> and using expressive language:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Debugging is easier if I can sniff the wire and read off it.
        </li>
        <li>
           The protocol is more likely to be interoperable.
        </li>
        <li>
           Error code space (e.g. HTTP error codes) is usually limited. Error message space is not by nature, yet can be by specification.
        </li>
        <li>
           Specification is easier to read, criticize and improve.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        -- <a href="LisaDusseault.html">LisaDusseault</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This depends on the protocol, and how its used. If you're dealing with something like IP, UDP, TCP, ICMP, DNS, ARP, ... that are frequently manipulated in hardware, then its important to use a good representation from which hardware can easily extract information. When dealing with fixed size frames other details are important. For example, protocols that are framed by IP will place important identification information in the first 64 bits (e.g. port numbers, sequence ID) because ICMP error notifications include these first 64 bits in their packet.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in any protocol design, the abstract sequence of events and state machines can, and should, be verified independently of the representation. -- <a href="DaveWhipp.html">DaveWhipp</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You better believe that bandwidth is an extremely important part of communication protocol design and you will never find any ASCII text compression technique that will come within an order of magnitude of the level of efficiency in using binary codes. Aside from dedicated office LANs, most communications media suffer the problem that as the bandwidth needed for a channel increases, the number of channels available must decrease. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Can we please differentiate between WireProtocols and ApplicationProtocols? All of the protocols mentioned by Dave are WireProtocols. The <a href="PowerOfPlainText.html">PowerOfPlainText</a> for application protocols is amply demonstrated by the <a href="RequestForComments.html">RequestForComments</a>. Having written a couple of application protocols for toy applications, I can testify to this. To appeal to authority, I recommend people have a look at BXXP, the new meta-protocol(application) designed by MarshallRose. -- <a href="AndraeMuys.html">AndraeMuys</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        In the example given, sending the ASCII text "YesNoYesNo" takes 102.4ms.
        Sending a single binary bit (the fastest possible binary code) takes 100 ms.

        <em>But the registry is already readable through either tools like regedit or a simple program using documented API calls. The binary format is only trivially more secure than a text version would be.</em>

        <em>I think the distinction here is that in NT, the registry file is maintained by the operating system, and security can be set on different parts of it given that non-disaster-recovery access is exclusively through the registry API.

        The problems with the Windows Registry are not because of it's in-system representation. If it were all text, it would still be a huge pain. The problems are multiple:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           no docstrings or comments. If the name isn't informative, you're SOL.

        <li>
           Guids-as-keys not being represented in a useful way by the registry editor. Nobody needs to see that slooge of hex unless they ask for it.
        </li>
        <li>
           No useful scripting system.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        PowerOfText wouldn't be necessary if there was a solid universal scripting system. The argument for text is always "I can script it" - well, if I could pop open a console and say "help(myapp)", review the api, and then say "foreach doctype in myapp.settings.doctype doctype.showicon := false" I would be a damn sight happier than I would be with a text editor. Windows tried to do this with the Windows Scripting Host, but we all know what a fiasco that was. I guess I've been spoiled by Python, where the lines between a module, data, program, and documentation are pleasantly fuzzy.

        Things I love about text files that were mentioned above, such as editing in an editor, I will not rehash, but I didn't see anyone point out that verification of the correctness of the contents of a text file can be done more easily than the verification (visually, in an editor or some other tool) that the contents of the file have not GoneToHellInAHandbasket.

           I can search my appointments and contacts using grep and find. (No need to load a big bloated, monster application.)

        <li>
           I can write simple shell scripts to selectively archive, copy and index the data.
        </li>
        <li>
           This storage format means I can write simple GUI tools using file associations, or servlets whose model is part of the file system. This is easy to do incrementally, because I don't have to unpick a binary format.

      </ul>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        The primary problem with plain text is that there really is no such thing anymore (if there ever was). For starters, there are encoding issues, but let's assume that you use one encoding (e.g. UTF-8) everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problems start at a very fundamental level if you want to keep things simple enough for most people reading/editing your files to accurately mentally model the format and not get bitten by stupid things (such as invisible characters being significant). Invisible characters are e.g. white space at the end of a line or white space not recognized as white space by the software in the middle of white space that is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unicode 4.0 has 26 white space characters, some of which are produced simply by pressing spacebar in some input systems. (CJK, their characters are of fixed size and take more screen space than Latin characters, so they have their own space character) ALT+space produces \xa0 (non-breakable space) on many systems, and it looks just like a space. Most software doesn't consider it as white space, which results in confusion. When some software does and some doesn't, there's even more confusion (similar to broken HTML "just working" until you try to look at the page using your mobile phone's browser). Not surprisingly, many popular formats don't get white space quite right.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many end of line conventions, and XML 1.1's got patched because 1.0 apparently didn't get them right enough. Python has significant white space, and it's commonly accepted that mixing spaces and tabs when indenting is bad due to different tab widths in different editors. Mixing them is allowed by Python and is considered to be a misfeature. Makefiles allow tabs only, which is considered brain-damaged (and annoying) by many.
        (see <a href="TabsVersusSpaces.html">TabsVersusSpaces</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        When people see white space, they often expect it not to be significant, as it's sometimes impossible to visually distinguish from lack of characters (at end of line or end of file). They also often expect different white space characters to have the same meaning because they are hard to distinguish from each other. Programs, however, have problems in determining what exactly is white space, and of what kind, and it can be expected that many programs' idea of white space is " \t\r\n", and assuming anything else will cause compatibility problems. Even this set of white space characters isn't safe, though. (carriage return and line feed handling is broken in programs on various platforms, make barfs on spaces, YAML parsers barf on tabs)
      </p>
      <p>
        When people see plain text, they expect different things depending on their experiences. Programs that process plain text expect wildly different things, and as many of them are being patched to work with multiple encodings their behavior becomes even more unpredictable (and dependent on the locale) due to white space, sorting order, etc. sometimes depending on the locale. In contrast, when you have a binary format, nobody usually expects anything, so you get to make its specification clean and concise.
      </p>
      <p>
        No wonder many projects just use XML. All the more or less arbitrary decisions are already made for you by a more or less arbitrary decision process, but at least the format is in common use and well defined. Yet white space haunts us even here: non-validating parsers can't tell the difference between all significant and insignificant white space, so they just give them all to you. The problem is much simplified, though, and you can always do a validating parse. But is all the complexity of the XML really necessary for most things? And how is e.g. YAML any simpler, the spec is rather long? How do you know any random YAML parser is correct, given that YAML is used much less than XML and the parser implementations are moderately complex stuff?
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, so that was kinda long :-) But this page depicted too rosy a view of plain text formats so I had to complain a bit. I myself like plain text, but would like people to standardize on something simple, unambiguous and not obviously broken (backwards compatibility be damned, having a zillion different end of line markers is just drain-bamaged (<a href="BrainDamage.html">BrainDamage</a>)).

        Type-free and to a lesser extent dynamic typing sort of borrows many of the ideas of <a href="PowerOfPlainText.html">PowerOfPlainText</a>. It is easier to transfer data between systems if the source and destination are not as picky about types. Fiddling with type conversions between databases often consumes a lot of tedious busy-work time. For example, validation must happen before the load process if you use required types. However, type--free allows one to load stuff first, and then validate it after loading. This can simplify a lot of validation algorithms.

        What The World Needs, Next:

        It seems to me, that Computer Kings need to mark their Carriage Returns on all Computer Keyboards, better, in order to reduce the confusion to Printers, who seem to guess if the typist wants a Single Spaced Carriage Return, or a Double Spaced Carriage Return, which often results in a Random Spaced Carriage Return in most my perfect e-mailed letters.

      <p>
        Actually, some computers THINK that my Carriage Returns are Paragraph Markers, which causes a lot of headaches to many, like me, who type with only two fingers, and who don’t need “Default’s” help, and find it extremely difficult to type an Upper Case Carriage Return in order to get any Carriage to Return, on most Computers.

      <p>
        So, I hope someone creates Dictation Software, soon, which types as fast as me, with no more Carriage Return errors!
