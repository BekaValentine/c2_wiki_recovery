        Think About It
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Think about it!" is a phrase uttered by a person who has the delusion that whoever is listening will be enlightened if he only would think about it. Sadly, the set of beliefs the person is trying to communicate is often a perfect reflection of said person's mind. Thinking about it is therefore the very last thing you want to do if you're going to entertain such beliefs.

        <strong>Thinking is a rational process</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        While some try to "sell" an idea by saying something over and over again to make it so.  When you think about it, you may come to another conclusion. SayingSomething DoesntMakeItSo, no matter how many times you may hear it.

      <p>
        Why not?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because truth reinforces itself. It is based on how well it matches what we see and know as well as what we feel. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You know not only by facts, but also by experience. Thinking relates both of these into something we comprehend and perhaps even have a name for. Naming is an important process, and is vital in speech, in writing and in learning. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of what we think or feel does not have a word or words which allow full expression. When you ask a team member of a team which has just won a championship, or an individual who has just won a gold medal, how they feel or what they may have to say about that accomplishment, words fail to describe.
