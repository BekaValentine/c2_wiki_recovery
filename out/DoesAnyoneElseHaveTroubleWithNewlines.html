        Does Anyone Else Have Trouble With Newlines
      </h1>
      <p>
        On the current version of <a href="WhatMightHappenInaStoneWiki.html">WhatMightHappenInaStoneWiki</a>, there's a layout problem: some blank lines in the edit text don't show up as paragraphs in the rendered page. Attempting to copy the vertical whitespace characters that appear between two correctly rendered paragraphs between two incorrectly rendered ones results in a "no change to text" message. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Deleting and retyping the whitespace doesn't seem to help either, meaning that I can't consistently break the rendered text. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This problem arises using IE5.1 on Mac OS X 10.1.2  Any ideas?

        I think you're misunderstanding how wiki renders text - inserting a new line in the middle of a non-indented paragraph in the editing box is not supposed to divide that paragraph into two paragraphs. If you want such division to occur, enter two or more successive new lines. You will then get a blank line in the rendered page. Wiki generates <p></p>, which has been alleged not to work in Opera, but you should get separate paragraphs consistently using most browsers.

        No, I understand all right. Maybe I didn't express the question clearly enough. When I look at this page in the edit box I see: ...message.<blank line>...text.<blank line>...ideas?<blank line>...browsers<blank line>No, I... Each blank line being two successive new-line/carraige return pairs. In the edit box there are 5 paragraphs, each separated by a blank line. However, this gets rendered as two vertical whitespace separated paragraphs (one with embedded newlines). The source of the page has <P></P> pairs where we'd both expect. Only one of them seems to work, for me, the one after ..message. How many vertical whitespace separated paragrphs do you see on this page?

        I have the identical problem with <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> 8.6 running IE 5.0.  Irritatingly enough it also can't do tabs to save its life. --<a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>
