        I am not really a software engineer but a statistician with
        a deep interest in computer programming.  When I first
        discovered object-oriented and pattern technologies my
        reaction was that they were a lot of fancy, computer sciency
        ideas that were relevant only for IT professionals, but the
        more I learn about programming the more I have come to
        appreciate them.  In many ways the pattern community bears
        the same relation to the software hacking culture that the
        statistics profession bears to the more undisciplined and
        ad-hoc fringes of the machine learning world, namely, it
        provides a sensible way of arriving at interpretable
        results.
