        An idea that's been floating around some of the longtime participants for a while. Perhaps it's time. What's the best way to go about this without losing what's valuable here?

        <li>
           Make www.c2.com/cgi/wiki read-only. That part's easy, just disable wiki?edit.
        </li>
        <li>
           Create a new blank wiki on c2.com with a charter requiring, say, <a href="OpenContent.html">OpenContent</a>, <a href="OpenAuthor.html">OpenAuthor</a>, <a href="RefactoringDeadline.html">RefactoringDeadline</a>s on <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, a strict observance of the duties of a <a href="GoodWikiCitizen.html">GoodWikiCitizen</a>, and dedication to the ideals of <a href="MakeSignalNotNoise.html">MakeSignalNotNoise</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't permit wiki?edit on the new wiki from any participant who won't publicly commit themselves to the charter. Use cookies to enforce that.
        </li>
        <li>
           When someone editing a page on the new wiki references a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> that's only present on the old, give them the option of importing the old page on the condition that they will immediately <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> it.
        </li>
        <li>
           (Optional) add <a href="WikiPortal.html">WikiPortal</a> capabilities to the new wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           (Optional) let the old wiki stay open for participants who won't agree to the new charter.
        </li>

           Wait a year (say) and then <a href="DeleteWiki.html">DeleteWiki</a>.

        It's one thing to be intimate with one's life, another to be reactionary.

        How long has this thing been running? It seems like the most vulnerable thing on the web is also the most stable.
