        Its The Same Data

      <p>
        This happens during the <a href="SimultaneousDevelopment.html">SimultaneousDevelopment</a> process, about a third of the way through, when somebody realizes
        that the GUI is doing one thing in two different ways
        (which is reasonable. For example "showing a particular 
        database table." Depending on context, you might want to 
        show the table [well, the elements in the table] in many 
        different ways). 
      </p>
      <p>
        But, usually, it's a person working on something else who realizes that <a href="SomethingMustBeDone.html">SomethingMustBeDone</a> and she will do the 
        natural thing (a quick hack to the widgets and <em>presto --</em>
        problem solved). After all, she's got her own deadline to
        meet. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Which leads to multiple GUI widgets doing almost the 
        same thing (what they do isn't really documented, since
        it was a quick fix). Lots of replicated code, lots of
        replicated functionality, lots of brittleness.

        Why did I name this page <a href="ItsTheSameData.html">ItsTheSameData</a> ? Because the 
        number one justification for making these quick hacks 
        is a variant of "It's the same data. I'm just changing 
        the way the user interacts with it."
