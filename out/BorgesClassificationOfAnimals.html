        This passage quotes "a certain chinese encyclopedia", the (completely fictional) "Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge", in which it is written that animals are divided into:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           those that belong to the Emperor,
        </li>
        <li>
           embalmed ones,
        </li>
        <li>
           those that are trained,
        </li>
        <li>
           suckling pigs,
        </li>
        <li>
           mermaids,
        </li>
        <li>
           fabulous ones,
        </li>
        <li>
           stray dogs,
        </li>
        <li>
           those included in the present classification,
        </li>
        <li>
           those that tremble as if they were mad,
          <ol>
            <li>
               innumerable ones,
            </li>
            <li>
               those drawn with a very fine camelhair brush,
            </li>
            <li>
               others,
            </li>
            <li>
               those that have just broken a flower vase,
            </li>
            <li>
               those that from a long way off look like flies.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
