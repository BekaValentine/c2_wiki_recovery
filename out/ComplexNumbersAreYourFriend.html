        See also <a href="ComplexNumbersAreYourFriends.html">ComplexNumbersAreYourFriends</a>, but let's not merge them. Both titles are potentially grammatically correct; the one refers to "complex numbers" as a single collective, the other refers to each and every member of that collective.

        <em>Just to be anal retentinve - not quite.  Perhaps, </em>ComplexNumberingIsYourFriend?  "Complex numbers are your friend" is exactly as grammatically correct as "Complex numbers is your friend".<em></em>

        A lot of integrals are actually easier to perform using ComplexVariables.  I recommend that everyone study ComplexVariables sometime--especially those who have to write StatisticalSoftware or are involved in MathematicalComputing.  Besides, there needs to be a way to define the SquareRootOfNegativeOne.

        <a href="ComplexNumbers.html">ComplexNumbers</a> simply simplify so many things, since they allow you to see the whole picture. From a SignalProcessing perspective, it all has to do with HarmonicOscillation not having a solution of order 1 over the RealNumberField.
