        Database Deadlock Avoidance

        In theory, applications should respond to <a href="DeadLock.html">DeadLock</a> errors on database operations by retrying the transaction/unit-of-work.
        In practice, most applications have problems with error processing, and just outright fail.

        Context: A database scheme that is used for both high-load querying/retrieval of information as well as low/medium load transaction processing.

        Commonly, one of the transactions participating in a <a href="DatabaseDeadlock.html">DatabaseDeadlock</a> will be selected as a "victim," and forcefully rolled back.  That client is given an error indication/code/message telling them that they were selected as a victim of a deadlock and that their transaction was aborted.
      </p>
      <p>
        One would hope that applications, upon receiving the "deadlock victim / your transaction was rolled back" message, that the application would automatically retry the transaction from the top.  However, few applications do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        DB2 2.x has a unique behavior of killing off all 'deadlocked' processes, rolling back all processes that were deadlocked.  The application will need to re-establish a connection with the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="MnesiaDatabase.html">MnesiaDatabase</a>, you make queries by passing the database a closure to run in a transaction. If the transaction is chosen as a "victim", then it is automatically restarted after a short delay without the application even being aware. This has the advantage of simplicity, but also means you have to avoid side-effects which can't be undone in your transactions.
