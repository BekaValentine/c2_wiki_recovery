        Mind Altering Languages
      </h1>
      <p>
        Languages that challenge you to think differently. According to <a href="AlanPerlis.html">AlanPerlis</a> (<a href="EpigramsInProgramming.html">EpigramsInProgramming</a>) these are languages worth knowing.  This is <em>not</em> the place to debate the merits of the languages from a practical standpoint, but to merely point out those that may challenge your world view and expand your thinking (software-wise, or perhaps deeper?). Perhaps it helps you solve problems better in "regular" languages, or is just for the joy of <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>.

        Some 'toy' languages that qualify.

        Of course this is relative. Most are trained on <a href="AlgolLanguage.html">AlgolLanguage</a> descendents, such as the C family, Pascal, VB, etc. If one was originally trained on say Prolog, then the Algol-style may seem mind-altering when first encountered.

        So, a MindAlteringLanguage has to be slightly esoteric, cause he won't follow the Algol pattern. Maybe there is space for a LittleMindAlteringLanguages that are still Algol like, but give you some new idea. 
        I wouldn't have thought of using metaclasses before I knew python (even if they already existed in CLOS)and I wouldn't have thought of building my own control structures before I knew ruby's blocks (even if they already existed in ST)

      <p>
        Also, I think in the mind altering space you can't omit to name <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a>.
        The fact that it is homoiconic, that every control structure is a command, that there are no keywords at all, and that it uses "set" instead of "=" or ":=" is surely something that changes the way you think :)

        I think that the most mind altering of the languages mentioned, is Forth. You have to manage your own stack, for God's sake!!! It makes assembler look a little better.

        <em>It's all relative.  I think the most mind altering of those listed above is Prolog.</em>

        I wish I could ask Timothy Leary ;-)
