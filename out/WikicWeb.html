        The <a href="WikicWeb.html">WikicWeb</a> is a <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> version of <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>.  I recoded the entire program in C because that is the language I am most familiar with.  The <a href="WikicWeb.html">WikicWeb</a> was designed for the Patterns Home Page at <a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/patterns/">http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/patterns/</a> (<a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> 20070524) to create a place where people can tell stories about patterns (The official name is currently the Pattern Stories Web).

        I love the idea of having a public Web site where everyone can get involved in editing.  However, the first time I was introduced to the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> here, there were a few features that seemed confusing or restricting.  It was my goal to eliminate as many restrictions as possible.  This may create a problem since some people will want to be a little too creative and make their pages look a lot different from a normal page.  I assume people can exercise self control in this regard.

        Some of the key differences are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          HTML tags may appear anywhere ;)
        </li>
        <li>
          Line wrapping never hurts, such as in lists and tags
        </li>
        <li>
          New link tag so you can have complete freedom in the name of the page.  No more HardToReadThis stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lists are intelligent....
        </li>
        <li>
          External links are encapsulated around a name
        </li>
        <li>
          Tabs are automatically converted to 5 spaces.  No longer have to explain what "<a href="ConvertSpacesToTabs.html">ConvertSpacesToTabs</a>" means, which may be confusing to newcomers.
        </li>
        <li>
          The backup file will contain an infinite number of backups.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Eric graduated, and nobody was maintaining it, so we moved the content to <a href="WikiWorks.html">WikiWorks</a> under as <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/patternStories">http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/patternStories</a> (<a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> 20070524). I'm not even sure where the source is. -- <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>

        I really would like to know where to find <a href="WikicWeb.html">WikicWeb</a>. Can you tell us more? Or at least give a link?
