        Ctrl Alt Delete On Nt
      </h1>
      <p>
        Windows NT requires that the user press <a href="CtrlAltDelete.html">CtrlAltDelete</a> in order to log in. This is apparently a US DoD security requirement,  the technical term for it is SecureAttentionKey. It's to avoid spoof login boxes.  It's relatively easy to spoof up a fake login dialog box, and capture user IDs and passwords, but user mode applications <em>cannot</em> intercept <a href="CtrlAltDelete.html">CtrlAltDelete</a>. During normal operation, <a href="CtrlAltDelete.html">CtrlAltDelete</a> preempts everything else (hopefully), and brings up a dialog with options allowing the user to lock the workstation, change their password or log out. Thus, by making sure that the user has to press <a href="CtrlAltDelete.html">CtrlAltDelete</a> in order to get to the login dialog, spoof dialog boxes are prevented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, not many users know this, and might just type their details in without pressing <a href="CtrlAltDelete.html">CtrlAltDelete</a>.  Furthermore, Win2k relaxes this requirement - the <a href="CtrlAltDelete.html">CtrlAltDelete</a> requirement can be turned off.

        The first time I saw "Press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to Log In" I thought that someone crafty with dark sense of humor had gotten to our brand new test system. I called over a co-worker to share in the joke ... but the joke was on me.

        I always assumed it was part of a fiendish plot.  Here's the scenario:
      </p>
      <p>
        Lowly Windows 3.1 user gets access to a fancy new Windows NT machine at work.
        It says "Press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to Log In".  After the initial suspicion that
        it must be a sick joke, he tries it, and begins to get used to it.  And he
        notices that C-A-D also does other useful things, like bringing up that 
        dialog that lets you shut down, log out, lock the screen, or bring up the 
        task monitor.  Downright handy, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then he goes home, and accidentally reboots his home machine four times
        in one night.  "Honey, I've got to buy Windows NT for our machine here at 
        home.  And it requires more resources ..."
      </p>
      <p>
        The theory held up pretty well until Windows95 started doing sensible things
        with C-A-D, too.  Darn.  -- <a href="GlennVanderburg.html">GlennVanderburg</a>
