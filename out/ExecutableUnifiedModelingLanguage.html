        Executable Unified Modeling Language

        The <a href="BritishComputerSociety.html">BritishComputerSociety</a> ObjectOrientedProgrammingAndSystemsGroup hosted a presentation by IanWilkie of <a href="KennedyCarter.html">KennedyCarter</a> regarding their xUML process/products 5 April 2000. Here's an except from the posted agenda:

        <dd>experience shows that by selecting a semantically tight subset of the UML and augmenting it with a target-independent <a href="ActionSpecificationLanguage.html">ActionSpecificationLanguage</a>, a translation-based development strategy is viable.  Further, it offers significant benefits over traditional, programmer-centric approaches, not least, the opportunity to test and debug UML specifications prior to cutting any code.</dd>

      <p>
        I'd guess that <em>traditional, programmer-centric approaches</em> probably means us.

        Here's what I learned:
      </p>
      <p>
        xUML is a process built around <a href="KennedyCarter.html">KennedyCarter</a>'s <a href="ActionSpecificationLanguage.html">ActionSpecificationLanguage</a>. It involves building two sets of models:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>an analysis model of the problem domain in an executable form</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>a design model containing implementation policies for modeling constructs, patterns, coding standards etc.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The analysis model is built from a well-defined subset of the <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a> with the addition of action specifications behind class methods and on entry/exit to states. These action specifications are written in ASL, which appears to be a procedural OO language that looks, to me, more like <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> than anything else. It is purely procedural, there's no support for pre - and post-conditions or any other form of assertion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool will animate these analysis models for V+V. The idea is that you write tests in ASL based on your use-cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you hit the button, and the code generator uses the rules in the design model to implement the analysis model. There are two generations of code generator available: the original yacc/lex family, and newer ones built by constructing an analysis model of the desired code generation process, then using ASL in a design model for code generators to walk over the new code-gen analysis model and use a pre-existing code generator to build your new code generator. Or something like that... <em>[See also: </em><a href="RecursiveDesign.html">RecursiveDesign</a>]<em></em>

        They seem to be doing reasonably well in the same space that the <a href="ShlaerMellorMethod.html">ShlaerMellorMethod</a> was never able to break out of: SoftRealTime, control, simulation-y sort of things.

        The idea of using the UML as a programming language is advanced in this OMG RFP:  <a href="http://cgi.omg.org/techprocess/meetings/schedule/Action_Semantics_for_UML_RFP.html.">http://cgi.omg.org/techprocess/meetings/schedule/Action_Semantics_for_UML_RFP.html.</a> These's a description under "RFP issued ...
