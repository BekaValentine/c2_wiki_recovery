        Switch Statement
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="SwitchStatement.html">SwitchStatement</a> is a more structured way (than multiple if...else statements) to express conditional logic in C-like languages. Usually looks something like this: 
      </p>
      <code>
        switch(expression) {<br/>
        case a:<br/>
        Do<strong>'Something();</strong><br/>
        break;<br/>
        case b:<br/>
        DoSomethingElse();<br/>
        break;<br/>
        default:<br/>
        HandleGeneralCase();<br/>
        break;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Other non-C-like languages have similar constructs, often with the keywords "case" or "select", often without the need for an explicit "break".
      </p>
      <p>
        A switch can be invaluable in parsing, or as part of an interface between <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> code and <a href="ProceduralCode.html">ProceduralCode</a>. A switch is easier to read than a long if-then-else stack, and almost always faster as well.

        <strong>Discussion on speed and Optimization</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        "...almost always..."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you substantiate this? Does it apply to all languages with switch statements?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [It is optimized by the compiler as a whole into typically one of three different machine code approaches, which is made possible by the fact that the case expressions are constants. If the case expressions form a dense range, then the whole thing is turned into an indirect jump through a table, for instance. Basically it is optimized to be as fast as it possibly could be. A series of if-then-else statements almost always has to be simply implemented as it was coded, therefore e.g. a sequence of 50 if-then-elses will be as much as 50 times slower than a switch. This is all well-known in the compiler world; it is not something controversial.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Some languages do not require the case expressions to be constants, e.g. Lisp (cond), in which case it is just syntactic sugar on top of if-then-elses and not a true <a href="SwitchStatement.html">SwitchStatement</a> as invented in Pascal and C. <em>COND is not a switch! A switch is spelled CASE in Lisp (see below).</em>]
      </p>
      <p>
        With optimizing compilers and so many different languages to consider, it is dangerous to generalize, but the basic speedup that a switch exploits is that <em>expression</em> is evaluated only once, then compared against each case until one matches. Also, since switch statements are so common, they tend not to be just syntactic sugar, but directly supported right down to the hardware.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>The big advantage is that most computers, in assembly language, support computed indirect jumps. In other words, I can make an array of target addresses, and then in order to switch off on a value X, I just use X as an index into this array, fetch the address of a piece of code, and jump to it. This is faster than if... else if... else if... in the same way that an array is faster than a linked list.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Actually, a <strong>single</strong> conditional jump is often faster than a <strong>single</strong> computed jump, mostly
        because of pipelining issues, but of course there is a trade-off point at which
        the computed jump is faster than the corresponding conditional jump cascade.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage of a <a href="SwitchStatement.html">SwitchStatement</a> is that you can have the compiler decide
        the trade-off point; i.e. if the <a href="SwitchStatement.html">SwitchStatement</a> has only a few clauses,
        the compiler will probably produce a conditional jump cascade, but for many
        clauses, it will switch (sic) to a jump table approach. (Or one of several other approaches, depending on the data.)
      </p>
      <p>
        And <a href="SwitchStatement.html">SwitchStatement</a>s almost always have many clauses, in the wild.

        <strong>Fall Through</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A feature (or some would say <em>mis</em>feature) of C's switch construct is that control flow can "fall through" from one case to another.  For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        switch (command) {<br/>
        case CMD_SHOW_HELP_AND_EXIT:<br/>
        do_show_help();<br/>
        /* Fall thru */<br/>
        case CMD_EXIT:<br/>
        do_exit();<br/>
        break;<br/>
        case CMD_OTHER:<br/>
        do_other();<br/>
        break;<br/>
        /* ... etc. ... */<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Because the <em>do_show_help();</em> line is not followed by a <em>break</em>, the <em>do_exit()</em> call will be executed after <em>do_show_help()</em> when CMD_SHOW_HELP_AND_EXIT is the command.  It is traditional to use a comment such as /* Fall thru */ in the example to indicate to readers that a <em>break</em> was not left out unintentionally (a common mistake).
      </p>
      <p>
        Proponents say that this technique leads to more efficient control dispatching when multiple cases share code.  
        Critics say that using this technique leads to unstructured hard-to-maintain code, and is little better than using gotos.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Many optimizing C compilers will emit the same object code for the above code as for the below -- they merge the common trailing portions of case blocks.</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        switch (command) {<br/>
        case CMD_SHOW_HELP_AND_EXIT:<br/>
        do_show_help();<br/>
        do_exit();<br/>
        break;<br/>
        case CMD_EXIT:<br/>
        do_exit();<br/>
        break;<br/>
        case CMD_OTHER:<br/>
        do_other();<br/>
        break;<br/>
        /* ... etc. ... */<br/>

        <em>How does that work when you're switching on 1..5, 6..10, and "other"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Smalltalk program implementing such a dispatch (and they are exceedingly rare, because the object/message paradigm so richly moots most situations that provoke a Switch) typically looks up a method name in an Array or Dictionary which they then perform: -- the equivalent of the C expression (*action[selector])().
      </p>
      <p>
        In the interest of advancing the discussion, I built a test harness and measured the results. I simplified your example to dispatch on a number between 1 and 16 -- this gets at the most important aspects of your question. I defined a new class, SwitchTest, with sixteen methods with selectors #m01, #m02, ... , #m16. For the sake of testing, these methods were no-ops. I then built and measured the performance of three dispatch approaches:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Array Dispatch": I constructed a "dispatchArray" of size 16, where the contents of index N is the integer offset of method m<N> in the methodsArray of SwitchTest. I then constructed a test method that counts an index from 1 to 16, looks up the corresponding offset in dispatchArray, then loads and evaluates the CompiledMethod at that offset.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        (aMethodsArray at: (dispatchArray at: anIndex)) executeWithReceiver: self andArguments: #()<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Perform": I constructed a dispatchArray of size 16, containing 16 symbols, which were #m01, m02, ..., #m16, such that the symbol at index N was #m<N>. I then constructed a test method that counts an index from 1 to 16, looks up the symbol corresponding to the index in dispatchArray, then performs that symbol in the receiver.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        self perform: (dispatchArray at: anIndex)<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Message send": I open coded the sixteen message sends -- this corresponds to the most common idiom in Smalltalk.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        self<br/>
        m01;<br/>
        m02;<br/>
        "..."<br/>
        m16.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The above is a load of bull. This is hardcoding the evaluation of m01, etc. when in reality the values for switch statements are variable. Add the fact that objects must be coaxed into selectors before they can be sent to objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smalltalk needs a switch statement, because nested ifTrue/ifFalse's are ripe with design smell.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then used Time>>millisecondsToRun: to measure the time required to execute 1000000 repetitions of each of the above three cases (on a 3Ghz Pentium with 1G RAM running IBM Smalltalk). Here are the times I measured:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Array Dispatch Test: 637.5
        </li>
        <li>
           Perform Test: 284.4
        </li>
        <li>
           Message Send Test: 189.1
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My interpretation: using the "switch statement" approach (perform) introduced about a factor of two in dispatch overhead, in comparison to a "regular" message send. It might be worth comparing that to the other languages and environments here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> imposes <em>some</em> overhead to setup the switch statement, and it might be interesting measure that overhead in comparison to a  straight procedure call on each of the resulting branches. (But of course a C switch/case statement is faster than a series of if-elses.)
      </p>
      <p>
        My point in putting up the example is to put some quantitative bounds (in this case a factor of two) on the switch statement dispatch overhead imposed by the language. If I was parsing something and cared about the performance, I would probably write and debug the parser in Smalltalk and then recode the lexer into C, calling the lexer through the external function API (<a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The interesting thing is the relative overhead of a switch-like mechanism in Smalltalk, <em>as compared to its natural behavior</em> (<strong>not</strong> to C). My point is that 99% of what one does with switch/case in a procedural language is mooted by a good polymorphic language (like Smalltalk). Switch/case is needed in C because you don't have polymorphic message sends (unless you want to roll your own tables of function pointers).
      </p>
      <p>
        The C-style switch isn't needed in Smalltalk (as a separate language construct) because its function is implicit in the method dispatching behavior. If, in the pathological Smalltalk case where you DO need switch, I showed that it's about twice as slow as a "straight" message send (in Smalltalk). The performance arguments don't make sense until you look at <strong>much</strong> larger grain sizes, where the industry has learned (particularly help from <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>) that C's fine-grained performance advantages do not, in general, translate to corresponding application performance differences.

        It's amazing; you can do anything. (I'm not claiming it can do anything well, just that it has an amazing array of expressive options. ;-)

        <em>Let's standardize on one particular form. A simple substitution process can then generate the correct syntax for your chosen language.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Um... not true, since different languages switching capabilities are different. No one generic form can be translated to each language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long ago, when memory was very limited, there wasn't room for either a jump list or a series of tests in a particular program, so I <em>calculated</em> the required address as a linear function of the switch expression (using a shift instruction for the multiplication), and then made a jump to the calculated address. Those were the days. ;-)

Contrary to some Purists, in some languages it is not possible to replace every switch statement with polymorphism, and in other languages it is not always desirable. Classic example: switch on char value in a lexical analyzer. But switch-on-type should indeed always be replaced.)
