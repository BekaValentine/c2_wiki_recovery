        I first discovered this Wiki about a year ago. Since then, wikis have come to dominate my life. I've even managed to infect my friends with the WikiBug.

        I'm a programmer by vocation and avocation. Mostly I write stuff in the <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a>, but I'm learning the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> in my spare time. And I'm starting to really hate the relative inadequacies of Delphi as compared to Smalltalk. Among other things: manifest typing, file-based source code, almost complete lack of reflection, the general hackish feel of <a href="ObjectPascal.html">ObjectPascal</a>, lack of garbage collection, all the wonderful issues you have to keep track of if you want to use interfaces.

        I now keep several wikis, including a <a href="RolePlayingGame.html">RolePlayingGame</a> wiki describing the world of the Vorician Empire, as played in by my friends & I.
