        Stereotype Classification
      </h1>
      <p>
        Stereotypes are part of the <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a> and provide what is called a language extension mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you wanted to categorize classes by function like in the <a href="IvarJacobson.html">IvarJacobson</a> Interface, Controller, Entity scheme, you would create three stereotypes and specify each class as one of the three types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stereotypes are one of the most unexpected parts of the <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a> and are really interesting in their capability for improving (and obfuscating if used improperly) a software design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stereotypes can (and in my opinion should) be denoted using a custom graphic symbol, if they are not, then they are surrounded by guillemots.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the UML Notation Guide for additional details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, can someone edit this page and express stereotypes as a pattern?

        <a href="DougLea.html">DougLea</a> has a pattern called RolesBeforeObjects. I think that a <a href="StereotypeClassification.html">StereotypeClassification</a> is much the same as a role.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gist of it is that any object may play multiple roles in a software system. At some point in the process it is more convenient to refer to the role rather than the object. (Maybe the object has not even been decided yet.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Roles can come from the requirements, e.g. from things or actions the customer talks about. Roles can also come from design, e.g. the participants in a pattern. Objects may participate (i.e. have a role in) multiple patterns.

        Stereotypes are really a fairly generic extension mechanism.   And as such I was/am intriqued by the possibility of expressing the concept as a pattern.  Sure, a stereotype can denote the role of a class, object, association, etc. but it can also be used for a variety of other ways to extend <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a> constructs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use stereotypes to subtype a UML construct such as a class or association (i.e. you can create a stereotype for <a href="AbstractClass.html">AbstractClass</a> or AliasAssociation or OwnerAssociation).  The <a href="ThreeAmigos.html">ThreeAmigos</a> have put no limits on what you can use a stereotype for, they just suggest that it is semantically clear what you are trying to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PatrickLogan.html">PatrickLogan</a>:  Unfortunately, the Wiki link you give above for RolesBeforeObjects doesn't seem to work but I'd be interesting in seeing it and using it's ideas to start a StereotypePattern Wiki page.  I'll check back if someone will update/create the Wiki page and we'll see what we can do.
