        Network Vs Hierarchy

        The internet is both a network and a hierarchy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When you 'surf' the internet.... follow the links...... follow the connections..... that's when you are using the Internet in its network form.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Can't we follow a link and at the same time have a hierarchy change? In my opinion, this is also possible. You only have to use a "hierarchy changing link".

      </ul>
      <p>
        When you type in a URL directly or use a search engine, you are using the internet in its hierarchical form.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is generally at a more local level, usually a server level. However, the directories/folders may be virtual and point somewhere else. The internet protocols do not dictate that one uses hierarchies, I would note.</em>

        It is possible for a node in a network to be one of its own ancestors. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A network has no top and no bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simplest data structure is a linear one (like an array, or a linked list).
      </p>
      <p>
        A hierarchical data structure is more complex than a linear data structure. In a way, a hierarchy is 'half-linear'. There is always a unique, linear path back to the root, but if you start at the root then there is more than one path you can follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More importantly, in a </em>'hierarchy<strong> there is a single linear path between the root and any node - really, between any two nodes - while in a </strong>network<em>' there may be multiple paths.</em> -- <a href="GeoffSobering.html">GeoffSobering</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A network is the most complex and non-linear data structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The human brain is a network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wiki is a network...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Or, perhaps, the Internet is a pure network and DNS imposes a hierarchy to assist navigating the network? But even then, it's entirely possible to have mail.domain.com and mail.domain.net reference the same IP, breaking the rules of hierarchy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The internet is a hierarchy implementation-wise. DNS <em>exposes</em> the underlying hierarchy in order to fit in with <em>corporate hierarchies</em>. The hierarchical preferences of DNS have nothing to do with assisting users, let alone user navigation, in any way, shape or form.

        Unix files and Unix processes are organized hierarchically.
      </p>
      <p>
        IP addresses and Domain Names are organized hierarchically.
      </p>
      <p>
        All human societies are organized hierarchically. <em>False.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Can anybody imagine a society that is based on a network rather than a hierarchy?

           I sense a John Lennon song about to burst forth....

        <em>Um, yes... a group of friends come to mind. A less trivial example includes any structure where differing members are responsible for differing areas, where those areas affect all members. Such a structure only becomes hierarchial if you cut links, which only demonstrates that</em> any <em>graph can be made hierarchal if one cuts enough links.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Also, would not an anarchy be a network, pretty much by definition? If you reject a hierarchy as a model of society, and you don't reject relationship between people, you're going to have a network.</em>

        Yes.

        <em>In practice, most democracies (or semi-democracies) are not hierarchical. They have hierarchical elements or tendencies, but it's a complex relationship. The president has checks on him from two other branches and voters. And then you have private companies, non-profit organizations, and special-interest groups. It's a complex structure. Generally when things have to get done in a hurry, such as an emergency, hierarchies seem the most effective. However, they don't work so well for innovation and complex tasks.</em>
