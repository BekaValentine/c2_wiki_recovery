        Constraint And Logic Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are several different <a href="DeclarativeProgramming.html">DeclarativeProgramming</a> paradigms which are oft confused:  <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a>, <a href="ConstraintProgramming.html">ConstraintProgramming</a>, and <a href="ConstraintLogicProgramming.html">ConstraintLogicProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In logic programming, one is given a finite set of <em>facts</em> and a finite set of <em>axioms</em>; together these comprise a system.  If the facts and axioms lead to contradiction, the system is <em>inconsistent</em> (and in error), otherwise it is consistent.  A type of <a href="TheoremProvingSystem.html">TheoremProvingSystem</a> called an InferenceEngine is used to deduce whether a given query is true or false.  Most such implemented systems use the <a href="ClosedWorldAssumption.html">ClosedWorldAssumption</a>--meaning that if something cannot be shown to be true, it is assumed false.  <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> is a well-known <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> language.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a constraint programming system (whether or not this is a full-fledged <a href="ProgrammingParadigm.html">ProgrammingParadigm</a>), one is given a set of variables (and domains these variables may range over), and a set of <em>constraints</em> on the variables.  One attempts to find a <em>solution</em> to this system--a set of values for each variable such that all constraints are satisfied.  A system with no solutions is inconsistent.  In some cases, one is only interested in the (non)existence of a solution; in others one wants all solutions, or an optimal solution.  (In some cases, a system with more than one solution is undesirable).  A well-known problem in constraint programming (solved using domain-specific techniques) is solving a system of linear equations.   Unlike <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a>, there is no way to specify axioms (though ConstraintSolvers may use well-known axioms of mathematics, such as transitivity of the < operator, in finding a solution).

      <p>
        <a href="ConstraintLogicProgramming.html">ConstraintLogicProgramming</a> is a hybrid of the two.
