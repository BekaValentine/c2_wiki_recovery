        I've been programming in Java full time since late 1996. 
      </p>

        I became interested in starting a Design Patterns study group following a seminar by <a href="AlanShalloway.html">AlanShalloway</a>, in November of 2001. In this seminar, Shalloway elucidated some of the CommonCharacteristicsOfDesignPatterns, that incidentally are characteristics of good OO design principles. Thus, I was motivated to begin a renewed study of software design patterns with an emphasis on the common OO techniques used in an attempt to gain a deeper and more fundamental understanding of patterns studied. 
      </p>

        I also felt that verbal discussion of these basic principles, and the patterns in general, would lead to a greater ownership of the material as well as a validation of how much I understand these topics.
