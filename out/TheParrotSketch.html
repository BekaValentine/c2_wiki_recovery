        The Parrot Sketch
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Note: despite widespread misconceptions to the contrary, </em><a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a>'s dead parrot sketch was, in fact, not that funny.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The DPS is about <a href="JohnCleese.html">JohnCleese</a>'s fury with <em>himself</em> for being so openly tricked into buying an obviously dead parrot. All the haranguing in the onscreen sketch refers to John's previous visit.

      <p>
        But any humor is lame when you analyze it.

        Regarding <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, the group wrote in pairs. John started the parrot sketch with some other animal, and muddled thru it without humor. Then <a href="GrahamChapman.html">GrahamChapman</a> asked, "but what if it were a parrot?" and the rest is history.
