        Controllability And Observability
      </h1>
      <p>
        A system is completely controllable if there exists an input vector <strong>u</strong>(<em>t</em>) that will transfer the system from an initial state <strong>x</strong>(<em>t0</em>) to a final state <strong>x</strong>(<em>tf</em>) over a time interval <em>tf</em>-<em>t0</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A linear time-invariant continuous system given by
      </p>
      <code>
        d<strong>x</strong>/d<em>t</em> = <strong>Ax</strong>+<strong>Bu</strong>, <strong>y</strong>=<strong>Cx</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        is completely controllable iff the <a href="MatrixRank.html">MatrixRank</a> of the controllability (row) matrix 
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>U</strong> = [<strong>AB AB A</strong>^(2)<strong>B</strong>...<strong>A</strong>^(<em>n</em>-1)<strong>B</strong>]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        equals <em>n</em>, the size of the vector <strong>x</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A system is completely observable if the state can be determined from a knowledge of the output vector <strong>y</strong>(<em>t</em>) over a finite interval of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A linear system is completely observable iff the <a href="MatrixRank.html">MatrixRank</a> of the observability (column) matrix
      </p>
      <code>
        [<strong>C</strong>       ]<br/>
        <strong>V</strong> = [<strong>CA</strong>      ]<br/>
        [...     ]<br/>
        [<strong>CA</strong>^(<em>n</em>-1)]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        equals <em>n</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <strong>u</strong> and <strong>y</strong> need not be the same size vectors as <strong>x</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Shouldn't the above be "rank >= n", not "rank = n"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The rank of a matrix cannot be greater than the size of the matrix, in this case <em>n</em>. If the rank is <em>n</em>, the matrix is of <em>full rank</em>. Anything less and the matrix is singular. 
      </p>

        <em>Well, yes, but I had a vague notion in mind about padding/excess information in the control vs system vector/matrix, similar to the issues in solving a system of N simultaneous equations with M variables and N > M.</em>

        I think the assumption here is that the state vector <strong>x</strong> is all relevant to the state of the process. The number of inputs in <strong>u</strong> and the number of outputs in <strong>y</strong> are generally smaller. The outputs here are assumed measureable. It gets to be more fun if they are not. I didn't write this page, but I think it is all pretty standard control theory. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <em>I had in mind more fun cases. :-) I'm much stronger in the Fourier signal analysis side of things, but I know they are ultimately two sides of the same coin...just haven't gotten around to leaning into the control theory side of things yet. A friend who teaches the subject gave me a text on the subject last year, so one of these days...Meanwhile these control-related pages are tantalizing in giving me deja vu; it's sort of familiar and sort of not.</em>
