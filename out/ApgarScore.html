        Apgar Score
      </h1>
      <p>
        A way of assessing a baby's condition shortly after birth. The score is taken at one and five minutes, to assess improvement. Many babies have low initial scores, which improve rapidly. The five following qualities are used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Appearance (color)
        </li>
        <li>
           Pulse (heartbeat) 
        </li>
        <li>
           Grimace (reflex)
        </li>
        <li>
           Activity (muscle tone)
        </li>
        <li>
           Respiration (breathing)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of the 5 qualities are given a rating of 0 (not present), 1 ('so-so'), or 2 (normal). Thus an Apgar score is a number from 0 to 10, and the higher the better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it might be a strong and useful RatingSystem for new projects, which are our "babies" too. To check how healthy a "newborn" project is, we could measure 5 aspects after a day, a week, a month to check if it is healthy. Candidate properties could be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Appearance (code quality, unreusuable, hacked together or well-factored)
        </li>
        <li>
           Pulse (unit tests present and green) 
        </li>
        <li>
           Grimace (working dummy, that outputs something)
        </li>
        <li>
           Activity (participation by individual or group)
        </li>
        <li>
           Respiration (? website ?)
        </li>
      </ul>
