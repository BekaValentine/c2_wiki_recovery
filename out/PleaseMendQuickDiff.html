        Please Mend Quick Diff
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="PleaseMendQuickDiff.html">PleaseMendQuickDiff</a> it is so useful. May 2010 and now June 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there some reason why <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> has not been mended? It is very useful to a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>.

        <strong>Workaround:</strong>
        Hit <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> then <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>.
        <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> shows a <strong>diff</strong> between the two versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That is helpful, thank you.</em>

        Offer to donate some money to the C2 fund.

        <em>Ward didn't create the C2 Wiki as a profit center. The script is broken probably because Wiki has exceeded some limitation of the interpreter or whatever.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           You mean <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> is full and won't fit any more stuff? That's impossi

      </ul>
      <p>
        See <a href="WikiWikiSystemNotice.html">WikiWikiSystemNotice</a> for a description of the exact symptoms. It looks like one script is missing or misnamed.

        Suggested temporary work-around: Place the marker "[recent]" next to any new material or changes you add. When another person makes a change, they remove the recent's and add their own. I'm also kicking around putting a date stamp in case one forgets to remove them. Example: "[recent 6/9/2010]". Search for "[recent" to find any tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That will work if people are cooperating. One use of </em><a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> is to check what the previous version was of something which has been proposed for deletion, or spammed. The workaround is no use for that. <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> provides a quick route to restore the old version.<em></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Another possibility for you junkies is to consider this diff-less interlude as an opportunity. Contemplate the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>, empty your mind of the illusion of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and the mess of <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, and bring pages into timeless <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That may be a good idea for some things, but </em><a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> makes it easy to check for malicious edits to e.g. <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a> and restore the correct version.<em></em>
