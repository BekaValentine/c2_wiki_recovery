Faber and Mazlish (co-authors of Siblings Without Rivalry) provide a step-by-step approach to improving relationships in your house. The "Reminder" pages, helpful cartoon illustrations, and excellent exercises will improve your ability as a parent to talk and problem-solve with your children. The book can be used alone or in parenting groups, and the solid tools provided are appropriate for kids of all ages." - This text refers to the Paperback edition.

        This book isn't just about how to talk about kids, but about how people should
        talk to people.

        Lets not pretend that programmers have nothing to learn from a good book on communication skills! How often have you come across managers that behave like children?
