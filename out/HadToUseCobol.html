        Actually, you can do that with subprograms in COBOL-85.
        Calls to programs (and subprograms) accept parameter lists.
        But lack of user-defined types cripples the usefulness of this feature, for <a href="ModularProgramming.html">ModularProgramming</a>.
        And the community practice of COBOL programmers will probably prevent most COBOL programmers from using the language in more modern styles, even when it is possible.
        I don't know if COBOL-95 fixes the problems with the lack of user-defined types.
        (<a href="StructuredProgramming.html">StructuredProgramming</a> is well supported in COBOL -- particularly well supported in COBOL-85.)

           The two are the same thing: you stuff a bunch of junk into a boring brown bag, it gets all wet and slimey, products mix together in the bag (no local scope), and then the bottom falls out on a whiney customer, making a big mess just as you are about to leave for home, delaying the end of your shift. One is just analog. -- top

      </p>
      <p>
        I have been programming for four years now, exclusively in COBOL.  From what I read on the internet - I program in a <em>dead</em> language for a <em>dead</em> company that is making <em>dead</em> profits and giving me <em>dead</em> paychecks. Not to mention a nice <em>dead</em> benefit package.
