        Q: Isn't this really the same as <a href="CategoryComplexity.html">CategoryComplexity</a>, which obviously covers avoiding complexity (nobody I know of wants more complexity)? I recommend doing away with this category and change any tags to <a href="CategoryComplexity.html">CategoryComplexity</a>. <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> is growing too big; we thus need to make sure we don't duplicate categories.  (Wiki is becoming a <a href="OnePileFilingSystem.html">OnePileFilingSystem</a> at a size of about 32000. This may be large to some, to small for others, and just right to the remainder)

        A: No. Simplification is not simply to avoid complexity. There is need for this distinction. It include simple things, methods and structures. --  Corrected <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> 20080210
      </p>
      <p>
        Please clarify. I don't see any real distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clarification: Check out the pages in both categories, and you will discover the distinction. 23 out of 28 in <a href="CategoryComplexity.html">CategoryComplexity</a> use the term "Complexity" in their title. 13 out of 25 in <a href="CategorySimplification.html">CategorySimplification</a> use simple or simplicity in the page title. This is distinct in my view. Simplicity and Complexity are different terms and represent widely different approaches to problem solving.<em> -- </em><a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> 20080210
      </p>
      <p>
        It still seems like the essence of the differences is not being labeled properly and needs a rethink. I cannot offer a better one either at this point, but do feel that the existing arrangement smells.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be very clear that different things need different names. This leads to identification, clarity, understanding and progress. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> 20080210

        Oh look!  You <em>finally</em> managed to delete it, briefly.  Good for you!  Good boy!  You're <em>such</em> a good boy!
