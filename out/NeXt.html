        Circa 1985 when <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a> left (or "was ousted from") <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a>, he went off to form his own company, NeXT Computer, Inc., along with a group of very talented engineers. Their goal was to write a <a href="NewAmazingProduct.html">NewAmazingProduct</a> -- a fully integrated operating system, windowing environment, and development environment that they were to call <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a>, and a visionary <a href="MotorolaSixtyEightKay.html">MotorolaSixtyEightKay</a> based platform to run it on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It later became that, initially it was </em><a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a>' way of getting vengeance on <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a>. "We're going to kick their butts."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My boss has a </em>NeXT box. It serves as a visionary platform for the monitor connected to his Toshiba laptop<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, the hardware was dumped and the OS was ported to Intel, SPARC, and PA-RISC.  Then the OS was rewritten to run on top of other OSs instead of on top of the <a href="MachMicrokernel.html">MachMicrokernel</a>.  This project is called <a href="OpenStep.html">OpenStep</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later still, <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a> bought NeXT since Apple desperately needed a new <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>.  Today, the NeXT vision lives on in <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> and the <a href="GnuStep.html">GnuStep</a> project.

        <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a> came back to <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a> when they bought <a href="NeXt.html">NeXt</a>. He turned <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> into <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>, and also make the G4 Cube, eerily reminescent of the original <a href="NeXt.html">NeXt</a> Cube.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="NeXt.html">NeXt</a> came with a Foundation Kit that served as the, well, foundation for programming on that platform in <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>. FoundationKit offered objects for Strings, Arrays, Numbers, Dates, the Object class, file I/O, string scanning, and many others. FoundationKit lives on in FoundationFramework?, a subset of <a href="CocoaFramework.html">CocoaFramework</a> for <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> developers. It paired with AppKit?.

      <p>
        The 68040 was kinda outdated by the time that Next really hit their heyday.  So, they and others talked about the NextRiscWorkstation
      </p>
      <p>
        The rumor was that the HP 712 was going to be licensed for this purpose.  Reportedly, the 712 is the second nicest platform to run <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> on.  The first nicest being the original "black hardware" (the Cube and NeXTStation).

        <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> also runs on HP Apollo 735 (<a href="PaRisc.html">PaRisc</a>) machines. A 735/99 is just over 3 times as fast as a NeXTstation Turbo (33MHz 68040) using a simple integer benchmark (<a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~tromp/c4/fhour.html).">http://www.cwi.nl/~tromp/c4/fhour.html).</a> But the nicest thing about my 735 is its 8-bit <em>colour</em> frame buffer! By comparison, a G4/350 running <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> is about 15 times as fast as the NeXTstation. --<a href="TobyThain.html">TobyThain</a>

        "Black hardware" is used to refer to <a href="NeXt.html">NeXt</a> m68k computers (the Cube and NeXTStation) in the context of <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a>. In contrast, other colours refer to hppa, sun4 and x86 (IIRC). <em>[Note: Someone could fill in the missing bits here.]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "White" hardware was x86. Not sure if hppa/sun had colors. They didn't seem to be widely used.

        <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: Is this a well known term for <a href="NeXt.html">NeXt</a>, or just an anecdote? Maybe this could be moved to a MachineColor page (but I do not know, if these color references are really typical. If not this anecdote should be factored into the <a href="NeXt.html">NeXt</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understand that at this time, a black computer case was extremely rare, so a "black cube" meant only one thing: <a href="NeXt.html">NeXt</a>. This was well known (by some).
