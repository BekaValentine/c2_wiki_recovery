        Sets Of Requirements
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the context of generic programming, the term <em>concept</em> is used to describe the collection of requirements that a template argument must meet for the function or class template to compile and operate properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The requirements for a concept consist of a set of valid expressions, associated types, invariants and complexity guarantees. A type <em>models</em> a concept if it meets the set of requirements. A concept can also extend the requirements of another concept, which is called <em>refinement</em>.

        The problem being addressed is the one described in <a href="GenericVsObjectOrientedProgramming.html">GenericVsObjectOrientedProgramming</a>.  What can happen in practice with programming using C++ templates is that a wrong choice of object type gives rise to extremely long compile time error messages which are difficult to understand. The requirements can be programmed in such a way as to get cleared compile time error messages which locate the origin of the problem.
