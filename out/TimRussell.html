      <p>
        I live in Chicago, Illinois and work from my apartment doing database, web page, and graphic design. I'm fluent in vbScript/ASP, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, HTML, VBA, and SQL. I have been active online since 1993, when as a senior at Illinois State University I got my first email address and began exploring the internet by dialing in to the school's rs6000 supercomputer.

      <p>
        I'm self-taught on a few musical instruments, including drums, guitar, and didjeridoo.
