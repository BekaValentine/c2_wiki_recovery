        Xp Name Cancer
      </h1>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, a lot of people questioned the name "<a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>". The XP guys stuck to their guns - name it and they will come, they said. These days there's no question that the name works, apt or not, and people feel happy with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now Beck & co seem to be having conniptions over the practice names. We don't have <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a>, but <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a>. <a href="CommitmentSchedule.html">CommitmentSchedule</a> is called something weird too. <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s are being renamed <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s. Even the <a href="ListeningTestingCodingRefactoring.html">ListeningTestingCodingRefactoring</a> is all morphed into ambiguity. The whole thing is beginning to smack of the MS OLE/COM/ActiveX/COM+ renaming nightmare.

        XP guys, I don't care what you want to call these things, I'm going to call them what you called them first. You had a reason for picking those first names, and that reason was that they communicated something to you. Now you think you've got something more apt, but you're not weighing the value of its aptness against the cost of the confusion the renaming will cause. Plus, most of your renamings go from a concrete but perhaps overextended term to a vague but more abstract term. This isn't a good thing. To quote Popeye, any way you slice it, it's baloney.

        So beware, neologues, be you high extremos or not, I'm going to keep talking like a hick from the sticks until you explain to me why the heck I oughtn't. Do not adjust your terminology. Adjust its meanings. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>.

        I guess it's hard to refactor XP itself.

        Personally, <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a> has more obvious meaning to me that <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>.. I understand that both names are an attempt at tying the name to a meaning of 'fulfilling <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>' but neither seems better to me.

        <a href="CommitmentSchedule.html">CommitmentSchedule</a> is renamed <a href="ReleasePlan.html">ReleasePlan</a>. The reason is that "commitment" was misleading, as it is a plan but not a commitment to a specific set of features in a specific time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a> is renamed <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>. The reason is that <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a> is closer to standard usage in the testing community. Use of non-standard terminology can't help.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a> isn't a rename of <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a>. There is no division in <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a>; there is in <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a>.

        <em>Um ... if you strike me down I will become more confused than you can possibly imagine. It's the tradeoffs mentioned above you're not caring for. The irksomeness of CS isn't significant once it's explained. The testing community would catch up with FT. And as for </em><a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a>, life creates it, makes it grow. Its delays surround us and bind us. Real beings are we, not these ideal estimates. You must feel the <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> around you.

        Talk straight old man. Crazy old coot never can just spit it out. Always gotta be making a big ol' racket. Think I'm gonna just light out and refactor me them two fancy droids as hunter-killers and ketch a mess o' wamp-rat for supper. Wamp-rat chitlins with wamp-rat gravy and wamp-rat fritters, an a big ol' sweet-wamp-rat pie for afters. Mm-mmm, we livin' high on the hog tonight! -- Luke Bodine

        Oh, here we go again. Listen up, Merel and all you other whiners out there! Ron is right, now and forever. You can do what you like, but if you don't do it like Ron says <a href="YouArentExtreme.html">YouArentExtreme</a>, and that's all there is to it. Jeez, you wanted the name of the whole thing changed, well they never did that, but they are changing some of the other names. Won't you ever be happy?
