        Pattern Uses
      </h1>
      <p>
        One pattern <em>Uses</em> another pattern when (part of) the resulting context of a larger scale pattern  is addressed by the initial context of a smaller scale pattern.

        This is is the only explicit relationship between patterns in Alexander's original architectural patterns, where it is called <em>containment</em>. <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> calls this relationship <em>refinement</em>  (see <a href="PatternLanguageTaxonomy.html">PatternLanguageTaxonomy</a>). <a href="GerardMeszaros.html">GerardMeszaros</a> and Jim Doble (
        <a href="MetaPatterns.html">MetaPatterns</a>: A Pattern Language for Pattern Writing,1996 <a href="http://hillside.net/patterns/writing/patternwritingpaper.htm)">http://hillside.net/patterns/writing/patternwritingpaper.htm)</a> call this <em>leads to</em> and its inverse <em>set up by</em>. This is the key relationship in WalterZimmer's analysis of  relationships between patterns in <a href="PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign.html">PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign</a>-1.

        I call it <em>uses</em> because the word "uses" has only four letters.

        The inverse relationship is an interesting way to look at patterns, PatternCompletes. That is, once you've used the <a href="CompositePattern.html">CompositePattern</a>, <a href="TwoPhaseCompositeOperation.html">TwoPhaseCompositeOperation</a> is one of the possible patterns that completes it. Each pattern solves a problem, and creates other (you hope smaller) problems, which have to be handled by downstream patterns.

        Yes. I find the inverses of all the relationships interesting (although I tend to call this inverse PatternUsedBy because it needs less explanation :-).
