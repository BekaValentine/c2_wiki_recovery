        Cognitive Types
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many people think that there are different kinds of people. People are good at some things and not others. For example, not everyone can be good at sales. Not everyone can be good at programming. Not everyone can be good at fund raising etc. -- <a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a system where cognitive types are used to identify which people would be good at which job functions based on a set of cognitive characteristics which combine to meet the cognitive capabilities of a give task. These are business oriented.

        If you assume that a person's basic 'professional type' is based on the three of these that are the most prominent for them, then that gives you about 1200 combinations, easily enough detail to map on to all the various job functions that exist in business

        <em>"Spiritual intelligence"? And how would you measure that? I feel sorry for the atheists.</em>
        An Athiest can have "Spiritual Intelligence".  I guess it would be a measure of how much one thinks about "The Big Questions", regardless of the answers they come up with.
