        Kevin Lewis
      </h1>
      <p>
        Kevin is a software developer that has to be an architect most of the time, even though he'd rather lay code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kevin is a Microsoft Certified Architect (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/shareideas/share_certified/),">http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/shareideas/share_certified/),</a> though most of his work is in Java-related technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kevin likes software (mostly coding), and ideas from things totally unrelated to software that end up having a lot to do with software.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of them are:
