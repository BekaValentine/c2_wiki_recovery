        To most developers, the relevant part of Team System would be TeamFoundationServer, the new <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a> server (and clients) to replace <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a>. Many of the major technical problems with <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> have disappeared. The irrational design of the Visual Studio solution and project integration remains. It also is <em>not</em> free with <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a>, and has fairly hefty technical requirements.

        Is there anything in VS Team System that cannot already be done better by existing, open-source tools? For example:

      <ul>

           <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>: <a href="CruiseControlNet.html">CruiseControlNet</a> (VSTS cannot do <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> without some work)

           <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing: NUnit, <a href="MbUnit.html">MbUnit</a> (the VSTS test framework is a straight copy of NUnit, including all of its flaws, but is needlessly incompatible)

        <em>When has that stopped Microsoft from reinventing the wheel before? The MS tools will be inferior, but quality is irrelevant - they will be integrated well with the MS toolkit and will not require hunting to get them, and as such will be the defacto standard.</em>

        I'm not expecting Microsoft to stop reinventing the wheel.  I'm asking if there's anything in VS team system that would give me something more than existing tools that are more flexible, more reliable, have a faster upgrade cycle and more responsive development teams.  Surprisingly IDE integration is *not* an advantage of the VSTS tool set.

        <em>A big advantage is that it will be easier for engineers to convince management to use the approach.  If Microsoft endorses it, that goes a long way with managers.  If it's just some thing you can get off the net, you are more likely to get push-back from them.</em>
