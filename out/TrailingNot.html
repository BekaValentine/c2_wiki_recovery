        Trailing Not
      </h1>
      <p>
        As in "Wow, dude, nice haircut... not!!"

        Used on the streets of <a href="SiliconBeach.html">SiliconBeach</a> 10 years ago, before appearing on SaturdayNightLive.

        I thought this was popularized by Bill and Ted...
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought it was Wayne and Garth...

        I think it's probably in the song "Valley Girl" by the Zappa family, from about 1982.

        Sorry. Of the trailing interjections used in that erudite & illustrious poetry, the closest is "no way!"

        <a href="TrailingNot.html">TrailingNot</a> is a lot older than you think. We used it a lot in middle school around 1984. My mother, a high school English teacher, reported an outbreak in her school a few years ago. While idly browsing through one of the textbooks she used, I discovered what I believe to be the primary transmission vector for this meme (and definitely the one that infected both my and my mother's schools):

        Bernice Bobs Her Hair, a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, c. 1920: <a href="http://www.sc.edu/fitzgerald/bernice/">http://www.sc.edu/fitzgerald/bernice/</a> - search for "not!"

        Mom wasn't thrilled to learn that English teachers are largely to blame for the persistence of the phenomenon. -- <a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>

        Much older. Minus the pause, it can be found in Shakespeare - one of the characters says to another, "I like it not." -- <a href="DanHankins.html">DanHankins</a>

        I don't thing that is a true precursor of the usage being discussed. The "..., not!" is usually applied in a sarcastic (and presumably an attempt at humour) manner, as a sort of "logical NOT" of the preceding sentence. The Shakespearian usage was, iirc, at the time not unusual in conversation either.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Shakespearean" usage is still common in Dutch and German.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it is not in English, for the most part. It does live on in certain common prose phrases, like "I think not!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The modern usage is, "Sentence. Not."
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a full stop (a period) between the two sentences, and the second segment is a fragment representing the first with the "not" before the main verb, thus negating the sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the streets, it was typically used after wildly & obviously bogus bragging. "I can program in Modula! Not."
      </p>
      <p>
        For me (www.ckk.com) the classic prototype instance (i.e. not the "first" or "defining" instance, but the "prototype" as the robin might be a "prototypical bird" for many people, in George Lakoff's "Women, Fire and Dangerous Things") was when Madonna was on the bed with Wayne & Garth on SNL, and at the end she said "Call me!.......... NOT!".
      </p>
      <p>
        You had the intense emotional excitement and reaction of Wayne & Garth, (Madonna says to call her!) and then the long pause while it built up, and finally the puncture/deflation with the final NOT.
