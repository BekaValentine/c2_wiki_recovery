        <a href="BicycleRepairMan.html">BicycleRepairMan</a> now has several refactorings.  It integrates with IDLE, the factory-installed Python editor, <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a> and <a href="VimTextEditor.html">VimTextEditor</a>.  The project is going strong and more people are joining in.  Go <a href="BicycleRepairMan.html">BicycleRepairMan</a>!  and kudos to Phil for keeping it going.

        Worth mentioning here if nowhere else that <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a> kicked the project off all those years ago as an exercise in <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>. Didn't write a lick of code. But made the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> so feels entitled to walk around with a big red S on his chest. <em>Hey, works for </em><a href="TedNelson.html">TedNelson</a>.<em></em>

        How is integration with an editor done?
      </p>
      <p>
        The files in the ide-integration folder shows how. Basically <a href="BicycleRepairMan.html">BicycleRepairMan</a> needs the location of the region/point and the filename + it needs to be able to tell the editor to save and reload source files because <a href="BicycleRepairMan.html">BicycleRepairMan</a> works with the file system directly.

        <a href="BicycleRepairMan.html">BicycleRepairMan</a> is from the <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> sketch of the same name (featuring in episode 4 of the TV-series). Bicycle Repair Man lives in a community of superpeople - everyone has super powers, and wears a uniform with a big S on it - but Bicycle Repair Man has a special power - he can repair bicycles! Bicycle Repair Man hears of somebody who has a broken bicycle so he runs to a phonebooth, changes outfits to striped, greasy coveralls with a toolbox, and walks slowly to the rescue. He arrives on the scene to see a Superhero with some trivial bicycle damage. Chain is off the gear thingy or something. He fixes it to the adulation of the superhero ("Thank you, bicycle repair man!") and goes back to his every day life.

        <em>Yes, that's the one. Seem appropriate, don't you think?</em>

      <p>
        <strong>He's mending it with his <em>own</em> hands!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>See how he uses that spanner to tighten that nut!</em>

        Fun, but why does a superhero need a bicycle?

        The lack of any other suggestions implies to me that the <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>/Wiki combination is the best proposed alternative for Distributed <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> Xp.
