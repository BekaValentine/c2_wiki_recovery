        Blender Wiki

      <p>
        A lot has changed since this page was started...
      </p>
      <p>
        This may be considered off topic for the c2.com wiki, but this page has survived for almost 2 years (as of Jan 2003), so I don't think this will be a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now there is a Blender wiki too: <a href="http://wiki.blender.org">http://wiki.blender.org</a>
      </p>

        Blender is a free, recently opensourced, 3d modeling, animation, texturing, etc. application, supported on the following platforms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Linux (intel/PPC/?others?)
        </li>
        <li>
           Windows
        </li>
        <li>
           IRIX
        </li>
        <li>
           Mac
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        and probably others that I'm forgetting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official web site is:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.blender.org">http://www.blender.org</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is mainly for developers.  Users will probably want to look at:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.blender3d.org">http://www.blender3d.org</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        and
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.elysiun.com/">http://www.elysiun.com/</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The main reason why I personally wanted to make a wiki site for blender is to help coders who are new to the blender source find their way around.  This does <strong>NOT</strong> preclude anyone from adding other stuff, such as tutorials or feature requests or the like.

        Here's the page with the source info on it:

        A notion floated at <a href="http://www.blender.nl/discussion/read.php?f=4&i=5771&t=5771">http://www.blender.nl/discussion/read.php?f=4&i=5771&t=5771</a> . Wiki, but with animated 3D content as well as words. Depends on tweaks to <a href="TheBlender.html">TheBlender</a>.
