        Estimation Woes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Is schedule estimation harder than implementation?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Estimation is really hard. Sometimes you just want to get in and do it, partly because the estimate has a much better chance of being accurate when you've done it before.

           Look at the casualty estimate for Boxing Day Tsunami. Started at 15000. Two weeks later it is approaching 200000. Should people who did the initial estimates refrain from publishing the estimates because it was hopelessly wrong? I do not think so. It started to mobilize resources, and they did their estimates in a responsible manner, even though they would have guessed the subsequent revisions would have to have much larger. OTOH the initial death tolls for 9/11 was much higher, a case of CulturalDifferences?

        The team on one old project fell into a pattern of using a stock answer to the ever present "How long will this take" questions. The answer was a quote from a popular TV show in Australia at the time, <em>Comedy Company</em>. One of its characters (Con the fruiterer) was a rotund greengrocer whose produce was always Beauuuuutiful, at least <strong>for a </strong><a href="CuplaDays.html">CuplaDays</a><strong>. He had a way of answering just about any question at all with "</strong><a href="CuplaDays.html">CuplaDays</a>", but most of his questions were to do with how long some piece of produce may take to go bad.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           More details of Con can be found at <a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~imcfadyen/mediaarts/mitchell.htm">http://members.ozemail.com.au/~imcfadyen/mediaarts/mitchell.htm</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anyway, in Australian culture "<a href="CuplaDays.html">CuplaDays</a>" came to mean anything from two hours thru to two weeks. Two days could be a most fair and reasonable estimate to start with, you could get lucky and find a solution within a few hours, or you could run into a nasty obstacle or five, and the feature would take ten working days.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all seemed fair and reasonable, but management would go nuts not knowing if the feature would take two hours or two weeks. and rightly so.

        <em>Management often has trouble dealing with reality. That's fair enough, as most people do. Reality is a very hard thing to deal with.</em>

      <p>
        I worked for a manager (of about 100 people) at a multi-national company whose stock answer was "six man months."
        He said, "if I haven't the foggiest idea how long it will take to do something, I say 'six man months.'"

           Frequently, though, "I don't know" is not considered an acceptable answer. If you are routinely pressured for a number - even if only a "back of the envelope" number - the manager may be trying to <em>negotiate</em> with you rather than gather a good-faith estimate. (See below).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Some people, understandably, want to know when something will be done. When developing a complex system, the answer will have an uncertainty associated with it, but that shouldn't mean that no answer can be given. A good project manager will be able to explain this to a good customer and provide an increasingly accurate answer over the life of the project. Unfortunately, software like <a href="MicrosoftProject.html">MicrosoftProject</a>, clever as it is, doesn't easily allow for uncertainty in project plans, and then unreasonable customers demand Gantt charts with the delivery date down to the day, and give you lots of grief for not meeting it. A product like Pertmaster does allow a probability to be associated with a milestone. Whether a customer will be happy with this depends on their position. -- <a href="AndrewJoyner.html">AndrewJoyner</a>

      <p>
        You get what you pay for:
        It's rare for a project manager to be willing to pay <strong>anything</strong> to improve the estimating process.
        But they keep (often "suddenly" and "unexpectedly") finding themselves in need of estimates.
        So until someone can see the pattern, and develop a willingness to <strong>do</strong> something about estimates <em>(other than complain)</em>, nothing will happen.

        In order to have quite good estimates you need:

        <li>
           a very good requirement documentation
        </li>

           a development process which is stable and visible
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
           <em>an environment that encourage the developers to state their true estimates instead of guessing what the boss already had in mind</em>

        <li>
           the willing to invest more in the estimating process instead of freezing the first estimate at the very beginning of the development.

      <p>
        In front of such a (frequent) complaint, I always try to explain to the complainers that software development is a <em>learning</em> process and a non-linear process i.e. you can't have overall estimates just by adding task estimates. "We'll have to learn". "It's a system". Sometimes they understand. What I'm quite sure of: estimating is not only the developer's task. It involves managers and customers as well.

      <p>
        I have been asked many times for an estimate, and after giving one, get told, "Well, we need it by Friday", when Friday is at most half of the time I estimated. If managers have already established a deadline, why am I being asked for an estimate for completion?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>To see if it's feasible? I'd then expect a conversation along the lines of: "well, you can't have what you asked for by Friday - but we could do X or Y"</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           if that were the case, they should ask that as the first question, instead of behaving like I will have the time to do it right. The conversation should be "They want X by Friday, can it be done? If not, what can be done by Friday?"

           Perhaps its a negotiating tactic. In negotiating for your time, some managers may want <em>you</em> to make the initial offer, in order to put you at a disadvantage (see <a href="NeverStateYourNumber.html">NeverStateYourNumber</a>). After all, if you are a <a href="FullTimeExempt.html">FullTimeExempt</a> employee, the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> may consider the amount of time that you spend in the office to be a negotiable parameter - and is seeking to pressure you to agree to work late to meet some deadline. (In some cases, the deadline itself may be artificial - the customer or higher-level manager is used as an <a href="AbsentProxy.html">AbsentProxy</a>). Many managers - and many companies - view increases in productivity gained by browbeating employees into working additional hours of (unpaid) overtime to be a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>; some managers are frequently evaluated by the amount of blood they can squeeze from stones.

        This sounds very much like the complaint book publishers have about authors. Guess what? Authors can't estimate when the book will be done because it's <em>intrinsically</em> not an estimatable process. I believe software is like that too. When this "industry" stops pretending to itself that we do "engineering", they'll stop asking stupid questions.

           I'm a writer, and I estimate how long projects will take all the time. I miss deadlines every now and then, but if I missed them as often or as badly as software projects do, I'd be looking for other work.

        <em>Like the customer asking how much this is going to cost? That's a legitimate question that needs answering, and answering needs estimates.</em>

      <p>
        <em>I don't believe writing software is not estimatable. A lot of what's done is predictable based on how things have been done before, and isn't particularly innovative.

        This misunderstands the problem. Developers are the better than anyone else at making estimates. (This manager should perhaps be advised to make their own estimates.) The problem is that managers are very uncomfortable with uncertainty. They like things to be known, and they like to have control. They like to be able to rely on a delivery or know who to blame. This is perhaps fine for managing street sweepers or accountants, but it is an unrealistic expectation of something as uncertain as development.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't agree. Developers (in my experience) are often hopelessly optimistic, and estimate for only the time spent coding (not for thinking, investigating the problem, setting up test environments, completing documentation etc...(see the comment about </em><a href="TaskComplete.html">TaskComplete</a> above). They don't look back at their estimates to see how they did, and so they don't improve.<em></em>

      </p>
      <p>
        This is true of all people, not just developers. This is known as Planning Fallacy in psychology. People who are asked to estimate any task produce an overly optimistic response. This does not improve with experience. Managers need to add a chunk of time onto any estimates they get, especially in development where there are a wealth of details waiting to be missed when providing snap estimates.

      </p>
      <p>
        Sure. Maybe they work for an organization that makes money and has customers, so they want to know about the time taken and the cost of everything. Is there something more natural ? By the way, developers too are very uncomfortable with uncertainty. But from the fact some developers have been caught taking estimates not seriously enough, we cannot infer <em>anything</em> about :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           developers ability at estimates : knowing and practicing the job, they should have the best level of estimate, however...
        </li>
        <li>
           is software development so much uncertain that you couldn't produce any good estimate for it : any commercial activity involving tools, people and a fair amount of rationality surely is equipped enough to beat randomness at the end; however...
        </li>
        <li>
           should software development be subject to estimates : if I was to pay for a software development, I'd like very much estimates. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>The point is not "are developers the best positioned to give estimates?". Of course they are. It's just that they often don't give good estimates. I have met a handful, at most, of developers who think about timescales in any structured way, and are aware at all of how good, historically, their estimates have turned out. Complaining "but it's impossible to give estimates" just won't wash</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course it is not impossible to estimate. But it is impossible to estimate exactly. The manager who asks "How long will this take?" will not like the answer "Between 2 hours and 2 weeks, and there a 1% chance it will turn out to be practically impossible." Instead they demand a Wrong Answer, such as 2 to 3 days, which becomes a deadline. If I miss the deadline, I look like a bad developer, rather than someone who gave a second-best estimate under duress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somebody has to manage this uncertainty, and somebody has to make a decision whether it is worth trying the task, and/or what to charge for it. If the manager wants to make these decisions, he or she should demand something better than a point estimate of duration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Exactly. But 2 hours to two weeks isn't an acceptable one of those</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If 2-hours to 2-weeks is truly <em>the most accurate estimate possible</em>, that should be the final word. Whether that estimate is "acceptable" to the manager is irrelevant. Whether that information is useful you, whether you can build a higher level plan from that information, is irrelevant. You can't squeeze blood from a turnip. But if you demand better than the <em>best estimate possible</em>, then you'll get exactly what you ask for: <em>less</em> accuracy in the form of a wild-ass guess that will be wrong as often as right. "It will take two hours." I'll pretend not to know that it might take up to two weeks - <em>yet I do know this</em> - since you won't <em>accept</em> the true range.
      </p>
      <p>
        So many problems in life come from people believing that <em>anything</em> is possible. Some things are not possible. If I <em>believe</em> hard enough, a jelly donut will not appear on my desk right now. If I <em>believe</em> hard enough, certainty will not appear where there is none. I will always make my best estimate, and I can make the estimate better than anyone else, but I cannot <em>create</em> certainty <em>where there is none</em>. Whether I deliver that true estimate to you, or invent some fantasy estimate that you'll accept, depends on <em>your</em> attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course. However, I can think of few reasons that any task would have a real variation of two hours to two weeks, so my first impression would be that the developer is not giving a true estimate (and is probably taking the michael). I can think of tasks for which it is not yet known if it is a two hour task or a two week task (i.e "either", not "between") - with some uncertainty on both possibilities, of course, and a response like that is fine.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's <em>quite</em> reasonable at the earliest stages of estimating for the level of confidence to vary from one-quarter to four times the actual. That corresponds to a range of 5 hours to 80 hours. Throw in the unknown variables - like how often you'll be called to a meeting to give an estimate and report status - a skilled manager will not be afraid of this range. -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

        <em>I don't think so. A 40:1 range? </em>How much will this project cost me? Somewhere between $1000 and $40,000"<em></em>

      <p>
        <em>A skilled manager will want a tighter range. And should ask what it would take for the developer to gain a better idea of the effort. But it's very unlikely that an estimate with a 40:1 range is going to be useful</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If the project is at a stage that asking for estimates is reasonable, a 40:1 range in the answer is not a reasonable estimate. If you're saying that a 40:1 range indicates the project has not progressed enough to permit reasonable estimates, then I'll agree with you.</em>
      </p>
      <p>

I have an idea, and if I'm right, it'll take a couple hours to make and test the fix. If I'm wrong, I'll have to start brainstorming other places and who knows when I'll find it. 2 weeks is a reasonable estimate for me to work top to bottom on a system.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Not if you can also give a confidence level in there somewhere. Something like a 1% chance it will be done in 2 hours, a 90% chance it will be done in 2 weeks. Now, how confident do you need your estimate to be? 75%? OK, there's a 75% chance it will take an effort of 7 full workdays, or 56 hours, or development. You the manager and I the developer agree that on average I can only count on committing 4 hours out of 8 to this tasks. Result: there's a 75% chance it will be done in two calendar weeks. You simply cannot demand and expect better accuracy from a preliminary estimate. If the uncertainty that it will take too long and cost too much is higher than you can risk, then as a manager your responsibility is to forego the development until you can supply enough information or redefine you goal to get within your window of acceptable risk. -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

        The reluctance of managers to give people adequate resources to make good estimates is common. But I have worked at a company where management did make a good-faith effort to address that problem. They devoted a significant amount of money and allowed time to improve the process. The <em>developers</em> were allowed to define this new process, and managers promised to follow it. Developers and managers attended training courses where the new process was presented and discussed. Two separate attempts were made at this change in procedure over the course of a few years, and in both cases, most developers didn't follow the new process, and estimates did not improve. After both failures, developers generally blamed management for not putting stricter controls in place. This reinforced management's views that developers are unable to make estimates, no matter how much help they are given.

        You can say, "I estimate it will take me one hour to tell you how long it will take me to study the problem long enough to give you a solid estimate. That might take two days or two weeks, and the actual job could be two months or two years, I don't know." You gotta Put Your Foot Down� when it comes to giving estimates.

        "It will all be over by Christmas". Schedule estimation isn't always as easy as counting classes, user stories or function points because programming isn't always like Engineering. Sometimes it is more like being a police detective; no-one asks a detective "how long is it going to take to solve this murder?" Sometimes it's like playing a new video game: you may be able to complete Grand Theft Auto IV in 3 days, but it may take you three weeks depending on how tricky some of the levels are (and you won't know how tricky they are until you play them). Sometimes it's like buying a birthday present for your mother-in-law -- you may find the perfect gift in the first shop you come to, or it may take you days or weeks. Sometimes it is even like eating your dinner -- you may be able to wolf it down in a few seconds, or it may be too hot / chewy / difficult to cut, or you may be too full and find it difficult to finish, or it might taste disgusting. Sometimes, you just don't know.

        Isn't estimation <a href="HaltingEquivalent.html">HaltingEquivalent</a>? The 'problem' being solved is "what code implements the set of requirements?". The computer 'running' the 'algorithm' to solve the problem is a team of developers, doing development. The <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> is undecidable in the general case, although some cases are decidable - e.g. the time taken to clean up 20 source code files, with only 1 hour allowed to be spent on each file, is obviously 20 hours, not considering interruptions. However, if the developers have been doing their jobs correctly, all of the easily predictable parts of the problems should already be automated, leaving only the inestimable parts. If estimation is equivalent to the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>, then it is not decidable. Even if we restrict it to the K-bounded version of the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>, i.e. "Can you get this done by Friday?", it is still non-deterministic, which is of no use to estimators. At the end of the day, it's all wild guesses, and our time would be better spent elsewhere. --MikeAmy
