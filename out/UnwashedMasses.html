        Unwashed Masses
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Unwashed masses: (noun):  A common derogatory term for those who do not share the same values, principles, or ideals as the speaker.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how clever you are (or you think you are), or how rich, or how educated, or how religious, or how altruistic, patriotic, sophisticated, or urbane--chances are, someone considers <em>you</em> to be part of the <a href="UnwashedMasses.html">UnwashedMasses</a>.  Most of the unwashed masses like to assume and believe that they are part of an elite group--of any sort--and will readily seek out and/or create (alleged) criteria by which they--and a select group of fellow-travelers--can claim superiority over the rest of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something to think about next time you (meaning everyone) rant about the "unwashed masses"; chances are you're no cleaner than they are, in the grand scheme of things.

        The people who do not understand - and can potentially wreck - Wiki are the <a href="UnwashedMasses.html">UnwashedMasses</a>. Maybe 99% of the Internet population belongs here. Maybe I'm just a pessimist.
        Am I?

        <em>From my perspective, the masses, washed or otherwise, can destroy wiki - and simply because the S/N ratio will fall greatly once enough people hang around here, for any definition of signal:noise</em>

        Tell us more of why you think that what you say is true. It sounds like you are concerned with the potential wrecking of Wiki. That seems a rather difficult thing to do. Why do you think the <a href="UnwashedMasses.html">UnwashedMasses</a> do not understand? <em>I spent a lot of time on Usenet. One quickly loses faith in humanity there.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Besides which, those who don't understand Wiki, for the most part, have never even </em>heard<em> of Wiki.</em> (amen!)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Too bad, then, that if somebody semi-clueless sees or hears the expression </em><a href="UnwashedMasses.html">UnwashedMasses</a>, and does a Google search for it, they'll run into this page. Let's hope that the completely clueless don't want to know, or don't know how to use Google.<em></em>

        The above discourse is a perfect example of opportunistic infection.  In seeking to remain secret, the seeker secretes. <em>What the hell "secret" is supposed to mean as a verb? -- the Unwashed.</em>

        I spent two decades on Usenet, and met most of the best people I know there. <em>Well, I believe most users (the Unwashed?) noticed a dramatical evolution of Usenet in the _recent_ years.</em>

        I've spent more than two decades on this planet and haven't met ANY of the best people I know here.
