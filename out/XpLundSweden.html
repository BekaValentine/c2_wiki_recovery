        Xp Lund Sweden
      </h1>
      <p>
        We have a conference on XP in <a href="LundSweden.html">LundSweden</a> on May 4th 2001.
        (We are the SPIN-SYD network of the LUCAS institute at Lund Institute of Technology and 36 software companies in the south of <a href="SwedenEurope.html">SwedenEurope</a>. ABB and Ericsson are the biggest members, the rest of us are a mix of sizes)
        We do a low-cost conference each year in April/May.
        This year the conference on May 4th 2001 is dedicated to XP.
      </p>
      <p>
        We run the conference with sponsors and volunteers to keep the fee low: 1200SEK (about 120USD).
        Our target audience is developers, project managers and management, in that order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abbreviated Full day Agenda (Coffee breaks in between):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          -10 XP Fundamentals (getting everyone up to sync)
        </li>
        <li>
          :15-11:30 Tool Time ("Tekniskt Magasin") Tell people tech stuff i e "tool time" before you show them Planning Game in Extreme Hour to help them map how it all fits. It works, in our experience, better with developers.
        </li>
        <li>
          :30-13:00 Chinese Lunch in plenty of little boxes (chopsticks) in a large student party hall while you meet other XPers and XP-curious
        </li>
        <li>
          :00-15:00 Extreme Hour/<a href="IronGeek.html">IronGeek</a> in the party Hall. (We saw Iron Geek at XP2000 and will try to improve on the format by using (student) video crews and LCD wall projections. (XP2001-ers: Mail me and I will keep you posted on how it worked out))
        </li>
        <li>
          :30-17:00 How-Tos: How do I get to do XP where I work? 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        (Quality gurus, industry luminaries and experienced developers 
        give practical advice and arguments to get your own company to do XP. 
        If this doesn't work: Do the "Fowlerism": "If you can't change your organization, change your organization!")
      </p>
      <p>
        Special appearance: Project Management and Market people tell their view of XP as Customers
      </p>
      <p>
        During the day we are aiming for a rich environment: Let there be plenty!
        Plenty of refreshments (water, soda, fruit, coffee, sandwiches, cookies).
        Plenty of people.
        Plenty of demos: xUnit, Refactoring, Extreme Hour, Continuous Integration (XP Configuration Management Best Practices)
      </p>
      <p>
        The conference is in itself a XP-project: We are constantly scoping.
        A lot of the content comes from our XP-workgroup of SPIN-SYD/LUCAS: xp-wg-2001
        This wg has had a record-breaking attendance. We have had meetings every 14 days 
        (14-day iterations) from January and onwards. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have XP-pilots of full, all-out XP running at some of our members with more coming up.
      </p>
