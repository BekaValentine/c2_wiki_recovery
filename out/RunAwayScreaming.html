        I wanted to do this as a sort of DoctorSuess thing, but lack the creativity for such a venture. You know how it would sound, though...

        There are many times I have to <a href="RunAwayScreaming.html">RunAwayScreaming</a> from a gig or even a particular task at a gig. The <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> may ask for some feature to be delivered at an unreasonable date (<a href="CountTheHands.html">CountTheHands</a>) or ask for some functionality to be delivered <em>before</em> the functionality it depends on. Oy. There are many reasons to <a href="RunAwayScreaming.html">RunAwayScreaming</a>.

        <em>Actually, it's a black irridite finish. The flash sorta washed out the muzzle end of the barrel so it looks like the satin nickel finish. I wish I had gotten the satin nickel; it's easier to clean.</em>

        You already cast and reload your own bullets, why not take up finishing as a new hobby? Keeping busy with hobbies is a surefire prevention for going postal.

        <em>Noooo. I don't cast bullets. And anyway, lead bullets are for subsonic applications. Anything over 1100 feet per second typically requires a copper jacket for proper performance and to reduce barrel leading. The 350 grain .50 AE leaves a six inch barrel at over 1250 FPS. The 325 and 300 hollow point have somewhat higher muzzle velocities...</em>
