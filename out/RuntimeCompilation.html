        I still fail to understand, though, how a Lisp compiler can interpret data *cough* code which is created at runtime, at the same speed as original compile-time code. I suppose I could look it up somewhere. -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a>, <a href="DeleteWhenCooked.html">DeleteWhenCooked</a>

        <em>Well, if it is </em><a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> the compiler is part of the runtime. So you can dynamically create functions, compile them (or not) and run them just like any other function...<em></em>

        Thanks. I thought it was more of a "translate to <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, pass through GCC" kind of thing.

        <em>While there are projects to implement CL on top of a C compiler (see ECL), that behaviour is the exception, not the rule. There are, however, very good CL compilers (see CMUCL for a free one) which will compile CL to </em><a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>, generally within a factor of 2 of a good optimizing C compiler. This is pretty amazing, considering how much more power you get in CL compared to C. To put it another way: a lot of people like languages such as tcl/perl/python, because it's abstractions let them code much faster than they would in C. However, the "abstraction penalty", if you want to call it that, is sometimes quite high, often a couple or even three of orders of magnitude. So often people optimize by going back and writing critical bits in C or C++, which is a bit of a mess. With CL, you get <strong>more</strong> power and abstraction than these languages, and with appropriately written code you can have very little penalty. Why this hasn't sunk it for more people I am not sure (actually, that's a fib - I have some ideas).<em> [</em><a href="WhyNotLisp.html">WhyNotLisp</a>?]

        Could someone explain how this is done. For most OSs you can't execute anything is the data segment, so how do you execute dynamically created code?
