        Used to just be functional. Now it's got a browser and a CDRipper in it.

        I was pleasently suprised by the latest version. The UI is quite nice and it's great functionality.

        It works and Microsoft is ecstatic to help developers, unlike <a href="RealPlayer.html">RealPlayer</a> (see <a href="RealNetworks.html">RealNetworks</a> for rant). ASF v. 2.0 is going to be the new industry standard (MPEG-4, actually), so <a href="WindowsMediaPlayer.html">WindowsMediaPlayer</a> is the king of the hill. Justifiably so. Smartest people in streaming media.
