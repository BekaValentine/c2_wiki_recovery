        Desktop Metaphor
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="DesktopMetaphor.html">DesktopMetaphor</a> is a <a href="HumanComputerInteraction.html">HumanComputerInteraction</a> realized as a virtual 'desktop' upon which are scattered 'files' that one works upon one at a time - often working on the 'topmost' file, which overlaps other files on the desktop.  When files aren't in use - 'open' and 'on the desk' - they are inactive entities.  Files can be organized into 'folders' and tucked away into strange hierarchies never to be seen again, at least not without a good memory or the computer-equivalent of the card catalog - a good index.

        The <a href="DesktopMetaphor.html">DesktopMetaphor</a> is so pervasive today that most people outside OR inside the computing industry have no clue that there are real alternatives to it.  But see <a href="DontModeMeIn.html">DontModeMeIn</a> and <a href="NoApplication.html">NoApplication</a>.  But the mold is slowly being chipped away... with <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a>, <a href="TheNakedObjectsFramework.html">TheNakedObjectsFramework</a>, AJAX applications, <a href="PublishAndSubscribe.html">PublishAndSubscribe</a> architectures, RSS, and innovative projects like SeaDragon and <a href="QedWiki.html">QedWiki</a> that combine individual 'files' into something much greater, <a href="GnuTella.html">GnuTella</a> and Ocean other forms of 'flat' distributed data storage with indexing & search, and mobile computing in the form of advanced cell-phones with services that users value (like the ability to listen to music and talk to one's friends and conduct business and get directions to the nearest four-star Indian food joint...)

      <p>
        Someday, I hope I'll have the pleasure to say this of the <a href="DesktopMetaphor.html">DesktopMetaphor</a>: 'Good riddance'.  The <a href="DesktopMetaphor.html">DesktopMetaphor</a> tends to tie one to a keyboard and terminal, and tends to isolate people to their own little cubby-holes where they can't talk to anyone without double-clicking on some equivalent of the desktop's 'phone' (IRC or e-mail).  What I want is <a href="PervasiveComputing.html">PervasiveComputing</a> and communication where interaction and interdependence is the default, and isolation comes from building walls.
