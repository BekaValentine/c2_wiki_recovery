        (Note that "<a href="PeterDeutsch.html">PeterDeutsch</a>" usually means L. Peter Deutsch, but another famous <a href="PeterDeutsch.html">PeterDeutsch</a> is Canadian Peter J. Deutsch, creator of Archie; see below.)

        L. Peter Deutsch (sometimes incorrectly referenced as "Peter L. Deutsch")
        wrote or rewrote many of the early virtual 
        machines at Xerox (1971-1986). He also redesigned the bytecode
        instruction set, rewrote the compiler and reverse compiler,
        and was the creator of the ChangeList.  He was an early
        and strong proponent of moving the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> onto standard
        hardware and a standard character set.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Peter didn't actually invent the trick of pre-compiling <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a>s to native code, he was the principal designer and implementor of "PS" (<a href="PortableSmalltalk.html">PortableSmalltalk</a>), the first modern on-the-fly-compiling virtual machine, and of the native-code compiler in "HPS" <a href="HighlyPortableSmalltalk.html">HighlyPortableSmalltalk</a>), its retargetable successor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter also wrote "<a href="GhostScript.html">GhostScript</a>", the GNU <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> 
        implementation,  first public release was v1.0 on 1988-08-11. Originally aladdin.com, handed over to <a href="http://www.artofcode.com">http://www.artofcode.com</a> in 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter is a reliable source of top-flight 
        information about anything Smalltalk or <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age 12 was exposed to the legendary MIT Model Railroad club and thereby the TX-0 console.
      </p>
      <p>
        While in high school, Peter wrote the first interactive Lisp interpreter, which ran on the PDP-1.  It is available at <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/software.html">http://simh.trailing-edge.com/software.html</a> and runs on SIMH (<a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/).">http://simh.trailing-edge.com/).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        With language creator <a href="CalvinMooers.html">CalvinMooers</a>, implemented the landmark <a href="TracLanguage.html">TracLanguage</a> on a PDP-10 in 1964.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spent several years at <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a> in the early 90s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some years ago was working on adapting Ghostscript into a <a href="DisplayPostscript.html">DisplayPostscript</a> for Stallman/FSF; I lost track of what happened to that effort.

        Peter Deutsch is god (grinning). <em>A truly legendary hacker.</em>

        <strong>Peter J. Deutsch</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Created Archie (named after "archiver", not comic strip), the first archiver of the Internet, in 1989, well before the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a>, with two others (names?) while students at McGill University in Montreal. Widely used and very popular in its time, Archie periodically polled all known ftp servers and indexed a list of their files.
      </p>

        Founded Bunyip Information Systems Inc. in 1992 to commercialize Archie.
