        Slow Down
      </h1>
      <p>
        When one of the pair is very familiar with the code and architecture, she can often race ahead leaving the other simply watching a solution emerge. It might be a good idea to ask to drive at this point, or perhaps simply ask her to slow down and explain.

        Asking to drive is usually the best option, otherwise the familiar person will just speed up again, and you'll have to repeat yourself.
