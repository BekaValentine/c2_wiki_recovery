        Hands Free Mouse

        NaturalPoint is selling a alternative handsfree input system for PCs and Notebooks - the TrackIR device. The system works by optical tracking of a reflective dot users can stick onto their forehead. By looking at the desired position on the screen, the system moves the mouse there. <a href="http://www.naturalpoint.com/smartnav/">http://www.naturalpoint.com/smartnav/</a>

        Looks pretty cool. It must be nice to be able to keep both hands on the keyboard, and still control the pointer.

        As an arm amputee, one of the hardest things for me is any kind of key + click combination. I get around it using Microsoft's StickyKeys accessibility feature, but this looks like it could help (not to mention it would be a cool toy). -- <a href="EddieDeyo.html">EddieDeyo</a>

        Very Useful Device not only for amputees, but for those paralyzed.

        They sell something like that too (they call it "Dual USB foot switch"): <a href="http://www.naturalpoint.com/smartnav/store/accessories.html#2">http://www.naturalpoint.com/smartnav/store/accessories.html#2</a>
