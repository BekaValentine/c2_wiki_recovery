        Double Linked List
      </h1>
      <p>
        Type of <a href="LinkedList.html">LinkedList</a> where each node knows both its neighbors (left and right).
      </p>
      <p>
        Its advantage over <a href="SingleLinkedList.html">SingleLinkedList</a> is that removing operations to each node can be done without accessing the entire list, that is, O(1) instead of O(n).
      </p>
      <p>
        The obvious drawback is the need for more memory space than <a href="SingleLinkedList.html">SingleLinkedList</a>, but see <a href="TwoPointersInOneWord.html">TwoPointersInOneWord</a> for a way to save space in certain circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        A perhaps less obvious drawback is that you cannot have two lists share a common tail.

        <em>two lists share a common tail</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm curious. Have any of you ever deliberately done this?.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've done it. In an implementation of a </em><a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a> it makes sense not to copy structures. I had a list to which I prepended items, but the original still had to be accessible. Then I prepended different items to the original and I had two lists with a common tail. Worked well, allowing for its limitations. Saved a lot of unnecessary copying<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It that case you need to implement <a href="CopyOnWrite.html">CopyOnWrite</a> semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
        [This is done in <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> all the time.  If you take the cdr of any other list, as far as Lisp can tell, the result is a separate list that happens to have a common tail with the first one.  Assuming, of course, that you don't try and change the cdr/car of any of the involved cons nodes...]
      </p>
      <p>
        In most <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s (but not Lisp and Scheme), lists are immutable, so <a href="CopyOnWrite.html">CopyOnWrite</a> is never needed (no writes => no copies).
      </p>

      <p>
        Nearly every time I've used a <a href="SingleLinkedList.html">SingleLinkedList</a> it has eventually been replaced with a <a href="DoubleLinkedList.html">DoubleLinkedList</a>. I no longer bother with <a href="SingleLinkedList.html">SingleLinkedList</a>.
