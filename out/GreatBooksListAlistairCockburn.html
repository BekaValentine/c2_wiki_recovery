        <a href="ErikMeade.html">ErikMeade</a> started this neat idea.  He wrote, "I ran into the <a href="GreatBooksList.html">GreatBooksList</a> and thought 'I wish I had a link on peoples pages to see their <a href="GreatBooksList.html">GreatBooksList</a>.', so I made one for me, and linked it to my page."  Good idea, Erik.

        In the genre of fiction, there are more.  <a href="PgWodehouse.html">PgWodehouse</a> had me laughing nonstop.  The Colour of Magic by <a href="TerryPratchett.html">TerryPratchett</a>, very good.  To Kill A Mockingbird I had to read twice through in the same sitting.

        If you like the <em>Ramayana</em>, I recommend you read the <em>Mahabharata</em> if you haven't already. It's the <em>other</em> epic story. I read both back to back before I became a teenager and was too cool to read them. And I'm glad I did. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        Ah, but Aubrey Mennen's Ramayana isn't the usual one, as far as I can tell.  He claims to have stripped out lots of stuff intervening writers stuck in, and tried to get back some of the cynical tone he asserts was originally in it.  So I wonder what someone would think of it who has read the "orthodox" Ramayana.

        Another <a href="PgWodehouse.html">PgWodehouse</a> fan! Have you also read W W Jacobs -- a short story writer from the generation before? There's very little in print these days, mostly his darker side, but his comic stories are little gems. -- <a href="SteveFreeman.html">SteveFreeman</a>
