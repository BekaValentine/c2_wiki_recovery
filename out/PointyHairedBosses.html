        When <a href="ScottAdams.html">ScottAdams</a> started drawing the <a href="DilBert.html">DilBert</a> series of cartoons, one of the characters was Dilbert's balding manager. As time went on, he lost the jowls and his hair started to form points at the sides of his head. His outline started to look like another character: <a href="PhilPrinceOfInsufficientLight.html">PhilPrinceOfInsufficientLight</a> (who lost the jowls about the same time). It turns out they are brothers... Oddly Catbert, the evil HR manager, also has pointed ears... .
