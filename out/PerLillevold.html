      <p>
        Hi, my name is <em>Per Lillevold</em>. I am trying to learn something about Wiki. I only know the name from the net like <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am using <a href="UbuntuLinux.html">UbuntuLinux</a>, on my Netbook, and I have just upgraded from 4.10 to 10.10, the netbook version (remix), and I have problems with the new look. It may be efficient, but it is not intuitiv, so I have trouble finding the best way to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But one thing I have found that is useful, is the <a href="TomBoy.html">TomBoy</a> Notes ( <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/">http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/</a> ), the system which creates notes with links, and the webpage tells me that this is linking in a <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> way, so I had to try out what a <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> way is like. <a href="TomBoy.html">TomBoy</a> is also referred to in <a href="GettingThingsDone.html">GettingThingsDone</a>.

        I know that the man that followed me as an IT administrator in my job (I am retired), did set up a page system for members of the staff to report problems and suggest solutions, he called it som kind of Wiki---. So I guess that one can buy/download the principles of Wiki to one's own server, to make some kind of <a href="WikiPages.html">WikiPages</a> on the internal homesite.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice: The next sentence was written in my first attempt to write a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>, and in the <a href="WikiWay.html">WikiWay</a> it learned me how to create links: I don't know any links to put here, but maybe the <a href="AddingNewPages.html">AddingNewPages</a> could work? I know that my page must be quiet for 10 hours, not to be considered as spam. I really hope that I can learn something of this, this is not spam.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will afterwards try to learn <a href="MoreAboutCodes.html">MoreAboutCodes</a>, and if I am guessing right, the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> <a href="MoreAboutCodes.html">MoreAboutCodes</a> will appear as a link when this page is saved and reloaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please excuse my writing in English, I am a Norwegian computer user, and in an age of 72 I still try to learn new areas in the use of computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will try to put in the name of my son, a Software Specialist in Seattle, to see if he has a home page in Wiki, his <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> should be like KarlOlavLillevold. (Note that if there is a blue questionmark at the end of a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>, the word is not detected as a link in <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>, and a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> is written with at least two regular words without spaces and with each word written with capital letters).
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that this is not a home page like a personal page on the web, but some kind of page that should be useful for the community. I will try to expand it to tell you about my learning prosess in studying <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>. I feel that I have already learned a lot of the Page System, but it is much more to learn here, please read <a href="WelcomeVisitors.html">WelcomeVisitors</a>, and <a href="StartingPoints.html">StartingPoints</a> will be useful too!

        Now I will read <a href="TaoOfLinux.html">TaoOfLinux</a>.
