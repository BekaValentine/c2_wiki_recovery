        Software Systems Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many people view <a href="SoftwareArchitecture.html">SoftwareArchitecture</a> as the design of the infrastructure that ties software together.  It is often used to provide a foundation and structure for software application development.  The user interface is an important component, but not the driving concern. (Analogy: Designing and building the engine and then wrapping the car around it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SoftwareDesign.html">SoftwareDesign</a> is a fairly new discipline (as described by folks like <a href="TerryWinograd.html">TerryWinograd</a>, <a href="AlanCooper.html">AlanCooper</a> and others). It is focused on <em>describing the user's experience with a piece of software</em>.  They tend to view engineering as a separate task.  <a href="SoftwareDesign.html">SoftwareDesign</a> isn't concerned with how the code is built or how it works. The user is first and foremost in the mind of the designer. (Analogy: Designing the car body and dropping an engine in later.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems to me that the two disciplines more than often overlap in the real world.  A single lead engineer often does <a href="SoftwareDesign.html">SoftwareDesign</a> (describing the system in terms of its use) and <a href="SoftwareArchitecture.html">SoftwareArchitecture</a> (describing the system in terms of its structure).  Engineers often look at user interfaces in terms of objects (for example: Model-View-Controller). Designers often look at the software  as a black box (magic happens...).
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't find many books that treat both disciplines equally.	Can anyone recommend books that approach software system design from both perspectives?  (Sure, you can buy 2 books (one on software architecture and the other on interface design), but they more than often don't transition very well...)
