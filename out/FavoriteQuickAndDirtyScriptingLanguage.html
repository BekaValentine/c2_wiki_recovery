        Favorite Quick And Dirty Scripting Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you need to throw a little project or utility up quickly, not worrying about future maintenance, what language do you prefer?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>: Interpreted <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>. Easy to bang out CRUD-ish features, but with an easier connection to imperative diddling not convenient in MS-Access.
          <ul>
            <li>
               For quick webby stuff, <a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a>. It has better HTML integration and map (dictionary) syntax than PHP. And a better type system in my opinion.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>: <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a> and WinForms. Because my <a href="InformationOriented.html">InformationOriented</a> Library is written in C#, but UI selection is unimportant for a quick utility.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>: <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> or <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a> as appropriate.  They're both horrible languages that make me feel unclean, but I can hammer out vast quantities of throw-away code in no time at all, mainly by leveraging all the pre-existing code out there.  If I need to do quick-n-dirty database stuff, I use my <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> if it's database-oriented, <a href="PostgreSql.html">PostgreSql</a> if it's SQL-oriented, or <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a> if it's GUI-oriented.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>So Php's uncleanliness makes you feel less guilty about throwing away throw-away code?</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           (Your handle and preference here)
        </li>
