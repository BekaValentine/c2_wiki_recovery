        Code Golf
      </h1>
      <p>
        Any competition to accomplish a task in the least amount of code. Usually counted in characters, but counted in lines if you're using a sufficiently gross language. Dense languages are favored; or, conversely, language density is sometimes defined by which language wins...
      </p>
      <p>
        This includes <a href="PerlGolf.html">PerlGolf</a>, <a href="ForthGolf.html">ForthGolf</a>, and various multi-language games.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="GolfScript.html">GolfScript</a> was invented for <a href="CodeGolf.html">CodeGolf</a> and approaches the density of HQ9+ (a joke language designed for code golf...) while solving 'real' problems.

        There are various sites that support code golf. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A promising new site is the <a href="StackExchange.html">StackExchange</a> site at <a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-golf.">http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-golf.</a> It's an old-fashioned solution - the only "win" condition is upvotes from peers, and there's no automated testing of any kind. (Or maybe it's a cutting edge solution leveraging Web 2.0 and the social network instead of mere technical prowess...) The shortest entries there tend to be in <a href="JayLanguage.html">JayLanguage</a>, <a href="GolfScript.html">GolfScript</a>, or occasionally <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> or <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SphereOnlineJudge.html">SphereOnlineJudge</a> supports code golf on a very small number of questions.
