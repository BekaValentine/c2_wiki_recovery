        Note Studio is a wiki-based tool for <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> and PC.
      </p>
      <p>
        The developers website is <a href="http://www.dogmelon.com.au/NoteStudio.shtml">http://www.dogmelon.com.au/NoteStudio.shtml</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the original version (1.x) was called WikiStudio.
      </p>
      <p>
        The notes (pages) synchronise from PC to Palm and vice versa.  
      </p>

        Square brackets are used as delimiters, rather than <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>

        The Mac OSX/Palm version needs Missing Sync to synchronize.

        it works perfectly but it is a little expensive for a wiki! I tried almost all the personal wikis till now, if this was a little cheaper I would go right at this one :(
      </p>
      <p>
        There are limitations on both page sizes and number of pages. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Page size itself is limited to 32K. You will get slightly less then this text per page, as the page name and basic page information (overhead) does take up some few bytes of the page space itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program uses an internal wiki page to note the page name and location of all pages in a particular wiki, and this has the knock off effect of limiting the total number of pages in a wiki. This also means that the longer your page names are, the fewer the number of pages you may have in a single wiki. The maximum number of pages allowed in a single wiki is approximately 550 pages, but this is using all page names of single, double, and triple characters only. Using more normal wiki naming gives an user average between 200 to 300 pages per wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Program does allow for multiple wikis (they call them "books"). However, linking to a particular page in another wiki is complex, losing the wiki ease and spirit.

        <a href="NoteStudio.html">NoteStudio</a> by dogMelon software is another <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> (and Windows) <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>. dogMelon is an Australian outfit and their solution appears to be pretty solid. The entry is commercial, running at US$50 on Palmgear. There's also a lite FreeWare version. 
      </p>

        I like it because I'm always on the lookout for a cross platform PIM solution that also functions as a document development tool.  <a href="NoteStudio.html">NoteStudio</a> also has a primitive HTML conversion for the desktop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>cross-platform? Is </em><a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> or Linux support anticipated?<em></em>
        Yes a Mac OSX version is available. But not a Linux version.

        This product provides a version of wiki which runs on the PC (Wiki Studio) and a version which runs on the Palm OS (Wiki World). A Palm OS conduit permits smart updating between Palm device and PC at the next hotsync, when a record entry changes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki Studio is a stand alone application, ie you do not view or edit in a web browser.  Links are created with <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>. Clicking on external http links will open your default browser. Links can be made to files on your local PC. Inline images are not supported. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The current version (1.2.0) only supports bulleted and numeric lists. Version 2.0 is supposed to provide headings 1-4, bold and italic. There is no <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> option. There is a nonconventional way of doing reverse links : Wiki Studio provides a maintenance mode which gives an alphabetical list of all pages and provides a list of reverse (and forward) links for each page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Pages are limited to 16K in size (32,000 characters); exceeding the page size results in a pop up warning that the pages size has been exceeded and text will be truncated. 
        The number of pages is limited only by amount of memory available on the Palm device.  The wiki database is stored in a single file. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The free trial version has the search, encryption and print features disabled. The developer is actively supporting this product, and quickly responds to user comments.  Version 2.0 due out in the fall of 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The free trial version can be downloaded from the site.</em> (4 megs)

        The <a href="NoteStudio.html">NoteStudio</a> app for <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> is fantastic.  The free download gives you a stand-alone Windows app that's very easy to use and is fully synced with the Palm app.  Paying for the software activates the search tool and full encryption for individual wiki pages.  It's not fully integrated into the OS like the <a href="PalmWiki.html">PalmWiki</a> hack.  It's a separate utility like <a href="WikiPad.html">WikiPad</a>.  But the Windows app and the encryption features make this utility my favorite tool for organizing ideas and storing sensitive info on my PC.  Well worth testing!
