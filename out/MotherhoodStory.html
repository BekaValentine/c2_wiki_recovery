        Motherhood Story

      <p>
        A <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> that is really a generator of <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The product will load-balance many servers.
        </li>
        <li>
           All communications between these servers will be crypto-secured.
        </li>
        <li>
           The bridges will all feed the log-server.
        </li>
        <li>
           The product will be easy to use
        </li>
        <li>
           Availability will be 99.98% (one well known company in financial information systems always specifies this number since <a href="TomGilb.html">TomGilb</a> came by but nobody is quite sure exactly what it means, so it's still a <a href="MotherhoodStory.html">MotherhoodStory</a> until that's explained)
        </li>
        <li>
           ...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The strength of this idea is that <a href="MotherhoodStory.html">MotherhoodStory</a>s are invaluable clues to real (hard) requirements - which in XP are <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>.  The name seems to capture this nicely.

        <strong>Q:</strong> I am faced with a few <a href="MotherhoodStory.html">MotherhoodStory</a>s on my current project. Can anyone give more detail on how these might be broken down into 3-week <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>s? In particular, some appear at first glance to be atomic <a href="MotherhoodStory.html">MotherhoodStory</a>'s -- the product won't really be 'deliverable' until the entire story is complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Particulars: We are building a distributed filesystem, with real-time constraints driven by a few key applications. Thus, as per the above example, <em>The product will load-balance many servers</em> is one story. Another is <em>Client application X will be able to play media at aggregate bandwidth Y from the filesystem</em>. Finally the rather large <em>The filesystem will support the full set of filesystem APIs on platforms A, B, and C</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be fair, the filesystem API story is relatively easy to break down -- there are nicely separable features of the filesystem. So this one just has the atomic <a href="MotherhoodStory.html">MotherhoodStory</a> problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the <em>Client X aggregate bandwidth Y</em> story is almost a <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a> specification. How do I get estimable <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>s out of this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Any guidance in the OneTrueWayOfXp is greatly appreciated.
      </p>

        Sure. Just play the <a href="XpFixedPlanningGame.html">XpFixedPlanningGame</a>.

        OK, here is an idea. You can split the bandwidth story at least in two:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Client X can play media.
        </li>
        <li>
           Client X can do so at aggregate bandwidth Y.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first one is a pretty standard <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>. The second one is at least testable. It can be split further like so:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Aggregate bandwidth is at least Y/10
        </li>
        <li>
           Aggregate bandwidth is at least Y/5
        </li>
        <li>
           Aggregate bandwidth is at least Y/2
        </li>
        <li>
           Aggregate bandwidth is at least Y
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think the point is that each increase in bandwidth should be a rather minor optimization. [Disclaimer: I don't know where I'm talking about.]
