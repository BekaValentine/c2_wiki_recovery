        A few months ago, we purchased a new Dell laptop with Vista Home Premium for my daughter who is in medical school, because her old Gateway XP Pro machine was plain worn out.  I spent a bunch of time tweaking it, and I must say that I am very pleased with the outcome.  I really like it, and am looking for a good deal on one to purchase for myself.  Hers is running on 3 gigs of ram and performs very nicely, and of course it works well "it's a Dell"!  I have a 7 year old Dell laptop that runs XP Home (max hacked) like a dream, and it is older then the hills.  Anyway, she has found very few problems with music (she is a music copy queen) and with other applications.  Mainly the problems we have encountered are do to software developers ignoring Vista issues and wanting to keep their heads buried in the sand.  I have helped some authors diagnose and fix their products with good results.  I figured out in a hurry, before we ever purchased that laptop, that you need at least 3 gigs for good performance, and a bit of good tweaking too.  So far, I prefer Vista over, 98, ME, and XP.  I'm hoping that one day, Linux will come out with something that will win me over, they are coming close, but not quite there yet...

        <em>Conversely, I've been using almost exclusively Linux on the desktop (including various notebooks) since 2000.  This includes using it for music composition, editing movies, etc., for the past few years.  There have been issues with hardware compatibilities, software infrastructure changes, etc., but almost all of them were quickly resolved and the power of free software like Ardour is worth the occasional hassle.</em>
