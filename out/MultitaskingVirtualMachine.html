        Multitasking Virtual Machine

      <p>
        All this Application Server development is funny... it is like going back to 16-bit Windows (remember, back then,  if a single application crashed, everything went down with it). It is the same with this modern ( <a href="JavaEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaEnterpriseEdition</a> based ) application servers, if one application goes crazy (infinite loop, very long and slow process, memory leak, etc), it will take down the entire application server, and there is no way around that that I know of (Same thing with Eclipse, if one plug-in goes crazy, everything goes down) it is funny (and sad at the same time) because so much time and resources were wasted trying to give processes proper isolation at the OS level, and now we are using technologies that make that effort irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
        So from a <a href="ProcessIsolation.html">ProcessIsolation</a> perspective all those <a href="JavaEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaEnterpriseEdition</a> <a href="ApplicationServer.html">ApplicationServer</a> are in fact limited to run only one application: Want to run 2 applications in <a href="TomCat.html">TomCat</a> and be 100% sure that one can not make the other crash? Run 2 <a href="TomCat.html">TomCat</a> instances. 
        Same thing goes for the free ApplicationServers such as <a href="JettyAs.html">JettyAs</a>,<a href="JbossApplicationServer.html">JbossApplicationServer</a>, <a href="ApacheGeronimo.html">ApacheGeronimo</a> , <a href="GlassFish.html">GlassFish</a>, <a href="JonAs.html">JonAs</a>, <a href="SpringSourcedmServer.html">SpringSourcedmServer</a> and even the really expensive ones, like <a href="WebLogic.html">WebLogic</a> or <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a>. What some of the expensive ones offer as way to partially overcome this limitation are UIs to easily configure multiple different <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> processes from a single management console, but due to the fact that the <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> can not manage its memory dinamically (you have to statically set the minimum and maximum memory it will use, you can not leave that job to the <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>), you easily end up with an under or over utilized RAM
      </p>
      <p>
        The funniest thing is that the much security and stability criticised <a href="InternetInformationServer.html">InternetInformationServer</a> can actually run <a href="AspDotNet.html">AspDotNet</a> applications with real <a href="ProcessIsolation.html">ProcessIsolation</a> if it is configured in <a href="WorkerProcessIsolationMode.html">WorkerProcessIsolationMode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, with <a href="GoogleChrome.html">GoogleChrome</a> even <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> has <a href="ProcessIsolation.html">ProcessIsolation</a>...
