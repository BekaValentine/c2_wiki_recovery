        Gavin Sinclair is a WikiFan and a RubyFan.  He lives in Sydney, Australia.  He thinks the markup employed on this wiki really sux, and arguably represents a failure of <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>, but that's the price of innovation.  It was certainly the best thing at the time.
