        Golden Egg Laying
      </h1>
      <p>
        From a Warner Bros cartoon where Daffy duck claims to be the goose that laid the golden egg. Unfortunately for the duck, he gets kidnapped by mobsters. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After putting the duck up in a mansion and waiting for the golden egg, the mobsters finally decide to "force the issue". The duck is, of course, kinda getting worried 'cos he ain't the goose!
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, the duck is as surprised as anyone when, with a gun held to his head, he produces a golden egg.....
      </p>

        This kinda reminds me of commercial software development ....
