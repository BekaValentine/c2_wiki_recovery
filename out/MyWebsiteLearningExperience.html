      </p>
      <p>
        Would you care to elaborate on that opinion, Gareth? I can take criticism, but you have to be a little more specific than just saying you don't like it. The fact that you don't like it is irrelevant to me, but the reasons you don't like it highly interest me, being the author of the site. -- <a href="AndreSlabber.html">AndreSlabber</a>

      <p>
        P.S. Having seen your own homepage on the Web [1], I get an idea why you don't like it: you are an 'Information Only' type of person, whereas I think that putting what you have to say into a nice suit also helps...

        I just cannot read the page. I didn't work with <a href="LynxBrowser.html">LynxBrowser</a> (duh), but even <a href="NetscapeNavigator.html">NetscapeNavigator</a> gives me troubles. The page suggests me to upgrade to a frames-compatible browser. I <em>have</em> a frames-compatible browser.

      <p>
        <em>Stephan, this is useful info. I did briefly test the site on Netscape before putting it on the Web, but it was mainly designed with Internet Explorer in mind.

        OK, I read the code and it turns out that if you don't have <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> enabled, it complains that it cannot display the page because your browser is not frames enabled. I always browse with Java, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and pictures disabled, but against my better judgement I turned it on just to view this page. It takes an eternity to load, and then... <em>it makes my browser full-screen.</em> Even the navigational aids are gone! This is extremely rude. Reminded me immediately why I always have <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> turned <em>off.</em>

        <em>I don't know which browser you are running, but I'm doing a simple window.maximize. On Internet Explorer, that NEVER touches the navigational aids. Now that I'm aware of the devastating effect it has on what I assume to be Netscape, I'll remove that feature.</em>

        You should consider being <a href="LynxFriendly.html">LynxFriendly</a>. That does not mean ugly. I just recently updated <a href="http://sunir.org/sunir/writing">http://sunir.org/sunir/writing</a> for instance, which isn't ugly (I hope), but it is <a href="LynxFriendly.html">LynxFriendly</a>. Also, you should realize how seriously bad your FeatureKarma is. Remember, <em>you are not done editing until you are left with a blank page.</em> Delete everything that does not contribute to the unified whole. Your page has no unifying theme which is why it is so difficult to use (is it even usable?). Finally, don't spooge the hypermedia into an old medium (is that an etch-a-sketch?). Scrolling text is evil as well as your "More..." button. Examine how other people have solved interface issues in hypermedia. <a href="http://kuro5hin.org">http://kuro5hin.org</a> has an excellent interface and it is extremely powerful. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sunir, I find a lot of honest comments in the above, so I'll react to that: I've never even heard of the <a href="LynxBrowser.html">LynxBrowser</a> until today. I gather it is one of the browsers that about 3% of the population uses. (79% IE, 18% Netscape, 3% other, as can be found at <a href="http://www.mcfedries.com/books/cightml/)">http://www.mcfedries.com/books/cightml/)</a> I will look into this, but if your site is any indication, there is not much that one can do without being LynxUnfriendly. Other than that, you've done a great job on your site.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the empty page stuff, I have my doubts: if so, wouldn't it be better to just not write anything altogether? At least we'd be finished sooner.

        <em>OK, OK, I may have gone a bit overboard there. But I do not believe that everything should be reduced to its most minimal form. Perhaps I'm too old-fashioned to see things like that.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The unifying theme of the site is there, it just may not be all that obvious to you: It is about the things that keep me busy in daily life, as is clearly said in the introduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the idea of this site was not to build the perfect interface, because if you call kuro5hin the perfect interface, I see no difference with any business site on the Web. The idea here was to create a simulation of a piece of hardware on a website. I think I at least succeeded in that.

        <dd>k5 isn't the perfect interface. It is merely an <em>excellent</em> interface. Indeed, it is excellent because it is so simple and intuitive.

        It automatically maximizes itself. Choosing how much of my screen
        a browser window takes up is <em>my</em> job, not yours. I bought an
        expensive monitor so that I could have lots of things on the screen
        at once, and I consider 1600x1200 pixels more than any web page
        deserves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Wouldn't I just love to have a screen like that. And you're right, 1600x1200 is too much for my site. As for the maximizing code, that is history before I go to bed tonight.</em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>It still seems to be there now (about 10:30am GMT on 2000-10-12). Did something go wrong? ... Oh, I see that you've answered this question below.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        There are two different things that "maximize" can mean (increase
        the size; tell Windows to make the window occupy the entire screen
        and ignore its nominal size). It does the former, which means I
        can't undo it by clicking on the "maximize/don't maximize" button
        on the titlebar; I have to drag the edges. This is fiddly when
        the window occupies the whole screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>True again, I only noticed it after I put it in. Like I said, gone tomorrow.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And, of course, the auto-maximize happens any time I arrive at the
        page. This is pretty much inevitable, I suppose, but annoying: I
        just went to "About Communicator" to check what version I was using,
        then "Back" ... and, bang!, the window maximized itself again.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a civilised size, the actual content occupies less than half
        the area of the window. Maybe you don't value your screen real
        estate, but I value mine. I don't want half of it or more taken
        up with decoration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Aren't you overdoing it a bit? Or is your preferred window size 640x480? And are buttons considered decoration nowadays? OK, there is more on the screen than just a page showing some text. But most of it has a function.</em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>My browser windows on this machine are about 640x640 pixels. It would be narrower, if it weren't for the fact that some things I spend a fair amount of time on (Wiki is one) involve using editable text areas, and those are painful if they're too small. On my box at home my browser windows are about 500 pixels wide. See <a href="TenWordLine.html">TenWordLine</a> for some insight into why I prefer narrower browser windows (apart from the fact that the narrower they are the more I can have visible at once).</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        You have a bunch of big chunky buttons. When I have the window
        at a sensible size, most of them are invisible and one of them
        is cut off halfway. I cannot get at the other buttons without
        making the window absurdly wide. Various other things are also
        truncated when the window is a sensible size. There's no indication
        of this fact on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OK, I did not go out of my way to make everything accessible if the user makes the window considerably smaller than the size it was designed for. If I had, the whole thing would have been cut up by scrollbars popping up left and right to make you reach all edges. There would have been little or nothing left of the effect I was trying to achieve. You may not like the effect in the first place, but that's another story.</em> 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Surely scrollbars only appear when there isn't enough space to display everything? If there's really no way to make it show no scrollbars on a window of the size you wanted, but scrollbars when necessary on narrower windows, then that's a pity.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The cute scrolling text at the bottom right (when the window is
        a sensible size) or at the bottom in the middle (when it's the
        size you apparently want) sometimes gets messed up in various
        ways. Firstly, unless the window is too wide the text doesn't
        fit in the window. (It's truncated at the right-hand side, and
        there are no scroll bars or anything to let me get at the stuff
        that's fallen off the edge.) Secondly, sometimes the scrolling
        doesn't work and I get a rather pretty but unhelpful mess of
        smeared-out characters in that portion of the window. This is
        probably Netscape's fault...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>At least now I have an inkling of what you call 'sensible size'. I guess my first guess of 640x480 wasn't all that bad... As for the text not fitting the window, that is probably the fault of the </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> code I used for it. It does not automatically resize the scroller if its window resizes. The other problem is probably Netscape's fault, because I've never seen that on IE.<em></em>

        I don't <em>want</em> a hardware device simulated in my browser windows.
        Your page says "I thought it might be fun to have a device like this
        in the window of your browser". Perhaps it's fun for you, but it's
        not fun for me.
      </p>

        It says "You may have already noticed that right-clicking on my
        site doesn't do what you want it to do". Actually, for me it often does;
        presumably it doesn't for those lucky lucky people who are using
        InternetExploiter. Be that as it may, this attitude really annoys
        me. It says "What I've done is <em>so clever</em> that I don't mind
        messing up your browsing experience in sundry ways to make it a
        little harder for you to find out how I did it". It's not as if
        this actually makes it impossible, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you had read any further, you would have seen that I do not do it because I do not want you to know, but rather because I like to interact with people about the stuff I do. It is merely trying to get you to E-mail me if you want to know how I've done it.</em>

        (I actually feel rather guilty about mentioning that your
        right-click-interference hack doesn't work right on my Netscape,
        because I expect you intend it to and this may provoke you
        to fix it, thus making the page that little bit worse.)

        <em>No, I actually do listen to people.... the no-right-click stuff will be gone. If not tonight, then probably tomorrow night.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the no-right-click thing doesn't just make it harder
        for people to read your source. My preferred way of doing the
        "back" operation goes via the right-click menu and, guess what?,
        your hack prevents that. By default I have the toolbar containing
        the "back" icon hidden on Netscape, because it takes up a lot of
        space and I don't need it. Congratulations: your hack has made one
        of the commonest operations done while web-browsing take ten times
        longer for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I myself have never used back through the rightclick menu (I don't think IE even supports it). But you are right: this is annoying.</em>

        Following links to other sites makes them appear inside your little
        viewer frame. Please consider that other people may not <em>want</em> to
        be trapped inside your "Internet Viewer". Yes, I know, you can do
        "open in new window". You're still gratuitously putting trouble in
        the user's way. Consider, incidentally, what happens if some other
        site someone gets to in this way also uses frames. Result: the area
        of screen actually containing useful stuff is about the size of a
        postage stamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By now the list of things to do has grown so large, that the best thing to do is probably to abandon the whole thing, and write a 'normal' website again. I'll have to think this over though, because the content in itself should then be all that much more important. This time it was presentation that counted.

        The whole thing really seems to have been designed to make the
        browsing experience as troublesome as possible. I presume that
        wasn't really your intention, but it's what you've managed to
        achieve. This isn't a matter of me being an "information only"
        person, although I do believe that content is the most important
        thing on a web site (this seems to be a heretical view, these
        days); it's a matter of having my browser set up in a way that's
        convenient for me and not liking it when someone else decides
        that they know better than I do how my browser should work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A very nice conclusion to an honest rant.

Secondly, it was an attempt at creating something that you don't find in thousands of other sites.

        <dd>I must congratulate you on your graceful response to some pretty heavy-handed criticism. (This would apply even if you hadn't made <em>any</em> changes...) I should probably be more polite next time I do this. :-)</dd>

        Coming up with impressive <em>looking</em> interfaces is fine if you want a learning experience, but there are far more interesting problems to solve.  The best web designed sites I've been to are the ones that separate the user interface from the content, allowing the user interface to be chosen and customized by the user.  A fair example of this is found in site creation tools like <a href="MicrosoftFrontPage.html">MicrosoftFrontPage</a> (which uses "themes" to encode various formatting features at design time), and <a href="ManilaByDaveWiner.html">ManilaByDaveWiner</a> (which also has "themes" but which are applied at run-time).

        Wiki also allows this sort of experimentation with user interfaces since the content and the presentation are separate.  In my experimental Wiki, I thought it would be interesting to present each page to have this general form:
      </p>
      <code>
        +-------------------------------+<br/>
        | Page title                    |<br/>
        +-------------------------------+<br/>
        | Back  | Rendered page content |<br/>
        | links |                       |<br/>
        |       |                       |<br/>
        +-------------------------------+<br/>
        | Page metainformation (date,   |<br/>
        | time of last edit, revision)  |<br/>
        | Edit link                     |<br/>
        +-------------------------------+<br/>
      </code>

        This was pretty cool and useful (except when the page had <em>many</em> backlinks), and it led to lots more experimentation.  The point here is that if your underlying web site's data is in a format that is separated from presentation, you can freely experiment with user interfaces all you want.  -- <a href="JohnPassaniti.html">JohnPassaniti</a>
