        Preserving Information As Slices

        An I want the slice on a plate, on my own table, ready to consume (that means information stored locally)

        There are several, if not many ways this may be done, some usable and available to everyone, and some you may devise for your own personal use. (<a href="EatYourOwnDogfood.html">EatYourOwnDogfood</a>)

      </p>
