        Power Macintosh
      </h1>
      <p>
        The line of <a href="AppleMacintosh.html">AppleMacintosh</a> computers started by Apple in 1994, superseding the original Macintosh line.  The distinguishing feature was the usage of the IBM/Motorola <a href="PowerPc.html">PowerPc</a> chip.  The current <a href="PowerMac.html">PowerMac</a> is the G5. The processor in these machines is a PowerPC 970 from IBM - a 64bit processor derived from the Power4 family of IBM processors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The neat thing was the relative smoothness of the transition from one CPU line to another; a 68000 emulator was built into the <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a>, with emulated performance on the early Power Macs approaching the speed of the contemporary 68k Macs. A thunking layer allowed programs to mix emulated 68k and PPC code; the OS itself and various third-party apps could thus be migrated to better-performing native PowerPC code over time without gratuitously breaking old third-party apps or rewriting the whole OS for the new hardware.

        The insanely great cube design (silent, small, elegant) has been discontinued due to not really finding a niche, despite everyone thinking it was a brilliant design (although the case wasn't large enough for some PCI cards). Apple have just produced a new dual-processor G4 which, with OSX, is the first time Apple has a machine and OS capable of really using both processors without depending upon specifically written software (to date, Photoshop is an example).

        <em>The cube cost too much, plain and simple. You could get a similarly-powered G4 tower, or a similarly space-saving iMac [computer built into the monitor, vs the cube's small computer still needing a separate monitor], for less money.</em>
