      <p>
        I am a senior research scientist in the Software Engineering department of Simula Research Laboratory.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research is focussed at ProgramAnalysis, <a href="ReverseEngineering.html">ReverseEngineering</a>, ProgramUnderstanding, and DocumentationGeneration. My homepage (<a href="http://www.leonmoonen.com/)">http://www.leonmoonen.com/)</a> contains more information and list of publications. Some of them are related to Agile or XP, but most to <a href="ReverseEngineering.html">ReverseEngineering</a> and ProgramAnalysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm one of the founders of the <a href="SoftwareImprovementGroup.html">SoftwareImprovementGroup</a>, an Amsterdam based company that develops <a href="ReverseEngineering.html">ReverseEngineering</a> and ProgramUnderstanding applications and uses XP for its development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="RefactoringTestCode.html">RefactoringTestCode</a> page was created for (continued) discussion of our work on refactoring of test code which was presented at <a href="XpTwoThousandAndOne.html">XpTwoThousandAndOne</a>.
