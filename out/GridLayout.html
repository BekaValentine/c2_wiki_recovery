        Grid Layout
      </h1>
      <p>
        A simple Java <a href="LayoutManager.html">LayoutManager</a>. All components (widgets) managed by such a <a href="LayoutManager.html">LayoutManager</a> are placed in cells in a grid. Each and every cell in the grid has the same size. Such a layout manager is useful for regular widget layouts, e.g. for laying out buttons to form some kind of numeric keypad when implementing a calculator. A much more powerful <a href="LayoutManager.html">LayoutManager</a> is <a href="GridBagLayout.html">GridBagLayout</a>. The two names are sometimes confused. However, <a href="GridBagLayout.html">GridBagLayout</a> works completely different.
