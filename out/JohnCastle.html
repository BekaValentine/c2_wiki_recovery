        My mind feels like a <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a> is running around in it.  <br/>
        I will only let my inner <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a> out to tinkle on this newspaper until I am convinced of its maturity. <br/>

        It would be good if I could reliably format the text first. <br/>

        I may move this to LeMoyne and use John LeMoyne Castle as an edit tag, but don't want to stick out like a sore thumb ...  Other handles for me are: jlc, jlcastle (guru.com), and Lee which my mother started calling me at birth.

          Is there any Minimum Spanning Tree tool for Wikis, or will the Map idea be resurrected, or something in between? What I am looking for is an exploration tool - something to make sure that my traversal is at least locally complete.

        First programs in 76 and 77 and BS Computer Engineering from UNM in 1995 - elected to Tau Beta Pi for being a homework mensch - I 'took over' TBP tutoring sessions many times before I knew of TBP or that it was their set of newbies that I was assisting with EE and CompE.

        Work experience in various 80's PC Basics, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, Progress4GL, SQL, VBA/VBScript/ASP, a few Windows APIs, Python and Perl. Have done scientific programming, large code base maintenance and development in a startup. Just quit recession-proof call center job (phone work as a collector for Mega Bank) and am already starting to do better for myself in every way as an independent contract programmer. Family and friends have all told me so, though I haven't been paid a dime yet. Hence <a href="ExtremeProgrammingForOne.html">ExtremeProgrammingForOne</a> is my doom/destiny.

        Love learning, the process of design abstraction (reducing cognitive dissonance maybe?), OO, writing programs that write programs, making it go.

        If I were a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> I would be doing my best to <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> yet kindly.  
        Right now, I know a little about the <a href="PerpetualNow.html">PerpetualNow</a>.  
        Perhaps some gnomish behavior when I have mastered Wiki concepts as expressed in this database.
