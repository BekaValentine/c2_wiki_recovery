        Fun With Exclusive Or
      </h1>
      <p>
        Exclusive OR is fun. I used it in a very old assembler project (don't ask when :-). The code in question was essentially a case statement. The code loaded the value to be tested in an accumulator, and XOR'ed it with each of the values to be tested against. If the result was zero, a branch on zero instruction invoked the corresponding code. Otherwise, the code would XOR the target value with the accumulator a 2nd time, restoring its original value, before going on to the next test. Fun, but don't try this at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If it really did that, the programmer wasn't having enough fun. You don't need to do the restoring-XOR between tests; instead, XOR with value1, then with value1^value2, then with value1^value2^value3, and so on. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also from an old assembler program: using the identity 
      </p>
      <code>
        x ^ (2**n - 1) == 2**n - x <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        saved a whole (8 bit) instruction. I was converting from the UK BBC Computer (screen height 256 pixels) to the US model (screen height 200) and this was my first 6502 program, and it took me quite a while to work out what the XOR was doing...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That isn't an identity. (You can tell that instantly: look at the parity.) If you have 2**n-1 on both sides, though, you get an identity. Is that what you meant?</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Don't forget the classic XOR hack for swapping ints without using a temp:
      </p>
      <code>
        int a = 3; // 0011<br/>
        int b = 4; // 0100<br/>
        a ^= b;	// a == 0111, b == 0100<br/>
        b ^= a;	// a == 0111, b == 0011<br/>
        a ^= b;	// a == 0100, b == 0011<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Don't try this at home, kids!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I actually had to use that one once in microcoding a program board which had no capability for swapping two registers.  So I used three cycles as you describe and XOR'd them thrice to effect the swap.  Doubted I'd ever use it, doubt I'll ever use it again :)  -- </em><a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What about this?</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        a ^= b ^= a ^= b;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Modifies a twice between sequence points => undefined behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, one can rotate an array of n values in 3(n-1) XOR operations,
        without using a temp.
      </p>
      <code>
        for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++)<br/>
        array[i+1] ^= array[i];<br/>
        for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++)<br/>
        array[i] ^= array[i+1];<br/>
        for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++)<br/>
        array[n-1] ^= array[i];<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Probably only worth the trouble for n=2, though. More formally inclined people may note that any group operation ^ with the property that for all x, x^x=identity, will work. [Such a group must be commutative.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, observe that since any permutation can be decomposed into a set of independent cycles, it is now obvious that any permutation of n integers can be done in-place with at most (worst case) 3(n-1) XORs. The best case is of course 0, for the identity permutation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that is enough rigour to promote the XOR trick from a hack to an official Technique (TM), methinks ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It should be noted that it might backfire on modern architectures. For instance, gcc on intel x86 will generate faster code if you just use a temporary (only slightly faster with optimizations; 1 xchg @ 3 cycles vs. 3 mov @ 1 cycle each). Same goes for using substraction in a similar way, gcc will detect it and generate xchg instructions which don't seem to save anything.</em>

        Then, there's always the memory-clearing mechanism:
      </p>
      <code>
        n ^= n;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When would you do this instead of just assigning zero?
      </p>
      <p>
        - Some early machines lacked immediate load operators, and their programmers would resort to odd tricks like SUB A,A to get a zero. 
      </p>
      <p>
        - On a Z80, xor a is one byte; ld a,#0 is two.
      </p>
      <p>
        - On an x86, xor ebx, ebx is idiomatic to clear ebx.  It is much shorter than the perhaps more logical:
      </p>
      <code>
        mov ebx, 0<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The latter has to encode a 32-bit integer value in the instruction. The 'xor ebx, ebx' instruction is generated by all compilers I am aware of. It is also the instruction Intel recommends to clear a register. Intel processors after the original Pentium special-case this instruction to make it extra efficient.

        <em>Certainly in the old days (I haven't coded in assembler for years), arithmetic operations affected the condition codes differently from assignment operations, leading to differences in subsequent branching behavior. I always assumed (without any particular evidence) that this was the motivation for the Intel recommendations. Further, in microcoded machines (such as the PERQ), arithmetic operations were a more direct route to microcode magic (such as using one routine to reliably clear LHS's of varying width).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly: xor eax, eax changes various flags. If you need to preserve
        the flags, mov eax, 0 may be your only option.

        Here's how to add two numbers without using addition or subtraction:
      </p>
      <code>
        unsigned int Add(unsigned int n1, unsigned int n2)<br/>
        {<br/>
        while (n2 != 0)<br/>
        {<br/>
        unsigned int sum = n1 ^ n2;<br/>
        n2 = (n1 & n2) << 1;<br/>
        n1 = sum;<br/>
        }<br/>
        return n1;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        <em>If you're programming in INTERCAL that may be useful, but otherwise use + to take advantage of carry-prediction.</em>
