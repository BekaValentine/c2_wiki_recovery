        Distribution String
      </h1>
      <p>
        DIST, (DIstribution STring) is an informal standard for an XML probability distribution container. It holds a randomized uniform partition of arbitrary size in a text string. With the appropriate add-in, it's particularly useful for modeling and simulation with Excel/VBA, allowing an entire distribution to be kept in a single cell. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a text format, it can be treated as a constant--a consistent source to use as a model input, ensuring repeatability not just for different runs but on different systems, without any concern about compatibility of PRNGs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, because DIST uses a uniform partition instead of a formula, a group of DISTs can preserve the connections between interrelated variables. This is vital for getting correct results from Monte Carlo Simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        DIST is described in Sam Savage's <em>Flaw of Averages</em> and supported by a variety of Excel and MS Project add-ins and other analytics products. DIST has a growing corporate user base, particularly financial and resource industry firms.

      <p>
        DIST uses a lossy compression scheme for the distribution vector and uses Base64 to convert the numbers to text for XML. The lossiness is not a concern if the distribution shape is fairly smooth; if it isn't it will be.
