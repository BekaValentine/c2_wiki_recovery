        Apollo Domain
      </h1>
      <p>
        Apollo Computer developed a network-based workstation called the Apollo Domain. They were way cool, but apparently also way ahead of their time. <a href="MentorGraphics.html">MentorGraphics</a> OEM'd the equipment and thereby became their largest customer. Apollo was eventually acquired by <a href="HewlettPackard.html">HewlettPackard</a>, making the latter the world's largest workstation supplier, at least for a while. Mentor ported their stuff off domain and onto generic unix.

        <em>I don't think they were way ahead of their time so much as just better than Sun's </em><a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a> workstations and UNIX.<em></em>
