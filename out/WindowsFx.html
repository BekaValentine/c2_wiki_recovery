        Windows Fx
      </h1>
      <p>
        By reading between the lines of the MSDN link provided below and filtering out the blatant marketese (which leaves almost nothing), it appears that <a href="WindowsFx.html">WindowsFx</a> is the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> platform with extensions specifically for <a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a>.  At least, that's what I think it means.  Clarity and directness aren't Microsoft's strong points, and the sheer desert-like absence of interesting content caused me to doze off and lose my balance whilst reading the article.  As my chair tipped backwards I struck my head on a coffee table.  Therefore, I'm no longer confident that the resultant brain damage isn't causing me to misinterpret some of the fluff as content.

        Apparently, some features will be back-ported to <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> (e.g. <a href="WindowsCommunicationFoundation.html">WindowsCommunicationFoundation</a> , "Indigo"), but others such as <a href="WorkFlow.html">WorkFlow</a> technology will probably not.

        According to the above -- and using the bullet points handily provided as an outline by the original author of this page -- <a href="WindowsFx.html">WindowsFx</a> will be based on the <a href="MicrosoftManagedCode.html">MicrosoftManagedCode</a> programming model, which is supposedly more collaborative and more tool-friendly than (presumably) something that is less collaborative and less tool-friendly.  It is not explained what "tool-friendly" means.  Also, <a href="WindowsFx.html">WindowsFx</a> will eliminate common programming errors such as buffer overruns, and a core customer will become the designer.  Or something.  You can read the article yourself.  I read it, and it seems to suggest that Microsoft is prepared to rearrange the furniture and claim it's a new house.
