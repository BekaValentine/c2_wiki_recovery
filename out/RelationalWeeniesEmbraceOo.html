        Relational Weenies Embrace Oo
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some <a href="RelationalWeenies.html">RelationalWeenies</a> still deprecate <strong>all</strong> things <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>.  This typically appears to derive from some fundamental misunderstandings about <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> approaches:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Myth 1: <em></em><a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> approaches are strictly about creating <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>s, which implicitly or explicitly define <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> (i.e., neo-hierarchical) databases.<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> approaches may be used in a variety of ways, but are most effective when used in the computational domain (i.e., to create computational abstractions) or to define cross-domain types such as DATE, MONEY, COMPLEX_NUMBER, GEOGRAPHICAL_COORDINATE, TEMPERATURE, etc.  They are rarely effective when used to create strict hierarchies of <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>s, except when developing simulations.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Myth 2: <em></em><a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>-ness is defined primarily by domain-independent <a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a>.<em>  </em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               This myth encourages the view that <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> approaches are irreconcilable with the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, typically based on the mistaken notion that "pointers are required when you use objects."  Obviously, <a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a>, in and of itself, is <strong>not</strong> that significant.  Nor are "pointers", as such, required -- <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> systems can be creating using <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>-friendly value-and-variable semantics.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Myth 3: <em></em><a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>-ness is defined primarily by mutable <a href="ObjectState.html">ObjectState</a>.<em>  </em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               This myth encourages the view that <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> approaches are irreconcilable with the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>.  The notion of immutable <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>s et al., and the fact that <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> approaches can be used in a variety of ways without contradicting the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, is either not understood or is ignored on "religious" grounds.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Myth 4: <em>Inheritance and polymorphism are too inflexible.</em>  
          <ul>
            <li>
               Inheritance and polymorphism are typically (and properly) used to represent invariants in the computational domain, not "real world" hierarchies, except in highly-questionable introductory textbook  examples based on geometric shape or animal taxonomies.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Myth 5: <em>"</em><a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>" is an unknown to be feared.<em>  </em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               This isn't aided by a plethora of dire textbook examples (non-<a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programmers are rarely exposed to "real" <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming, which tends to deal more with computational objects than <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>s), and the somewhat amorphous nature of terminology relating to <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> concepts.  E.g., the definitions of object, class, instance, reference, variable, value, etc., are often blurred.  However, "<a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>" can be understood in terms of specific analytical approaches and programming language features, which -- taken as a whole -- are not irreconcilable with the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>.  Specific features may be, but this does not deprecate <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming as a whole. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> and <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming can be highly complementary.  The <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> provides an effective way to manage collections of instances -- i.e., it replaces the usual container classes & instances with a clean, powerful, provable, optimisable, composable model -- whilst <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> techniques can effectively define attribute types (especially those instantiated as immutable <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>s) and manage imperative (e.g., application) code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps those who categorically reject OO would have less of an objection if they better understood the differences between using <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> approaches to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           (a) Define database schemas, i.e., implement <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> databases for general-purpose data management via OO database tools or <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> layers,
        </li>
        <li>
           (b) Structure and modularise imperative code, and
        </li>
        <li>
           (c) Define attribute types.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These days, the typical <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a> who accepts OO:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Deprecates (a), for all the reasons (problems with optimisation, ad-hoc queries, etc.) that <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> databases have largely not succeeded for general-purpose data management,

        One problem is that user-defined types are more difficult to use and share by multiple languages. Existing RDBMS tend to offer a limited set of types, but at least most apps can use them without too much cajoling and complex adapters. Types don't cross language boundaries very easy, and until somebody "solves" this, composing complex types with simpler built-in types has generally been smoother. In fact, I think RDBMS should not support a direct Boolean type, just use 1 and 0 integers, because it's fairly difficult to share with different languages. For example, some languages do not have a "null" Boolean. (Related <a href="CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing.html">CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing</a>). I'd welcome experiments with complex user-defined types in RDBMS, but am skeptical they will succeed at this point. -top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I remember when similar scepticism was expressed about computers, "high level" (i.e., not assembly) languages, structured programming, PCs in business, GUIs, object orientation, C++, the Web, Java, </em><a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>, and so on...<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        From a sharing stand-point? Problems with X and problems with X sharing may be apples and oranges. Regardless, ideas should be adopted because they prove themselves in sufficient pilot projects of a relevant/comparable niche, <em>not</em> merely because "new equals good".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed.  However, a number of us who have implemented complex applications which require complex types and complex code -- and have struggled to shoe-horn these into existing tools including DBMSes, current application languages, and the mechanisms that painfully integrate these -- can easily envision better ways of doing things.  Implementing them is merely (!) a matter of time and effort.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that existing RDBMS are limited, but the solution is not necessarily judicious use of "types". There may be many different kinds of solutions (including extending relational). Without specifics, I cannot make recommendations here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't recall asking you to make recommendations.  It's notable that </em><a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> explicitly do <strong>not</strong> propose extending the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, but they do go into considerable detail on what form a <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>-friendly type system should take.  Codd was clear that attributes must have types (i.e., attribute values belong to domains), but not explicit about what form the type system should take.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As argued in <a href="DoesRelationalRequireTypes.html">DoesRelationalRequireTypes</a>, I suggest that the type system ("domain math") be considered a logically separate system (as far as efficiency allows). Thus, the "types" would not be something the relational engine has to concern itself with as long as the domain math has the necessary hooks (interface requirements). But an unfinished issue is when "cell values" have expandable structures in them, not mere scalars or fixed-quantity sub-components/sub-slots, like phone numbers. Such structures would gum up what relational is about, especially if one has to use domain-specific accessors to manipulate such structures. This is the "encapsulation problem" again. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm curious:  What do you think "relational is about", such that it would "gum up" with complex user-defined types?  Also, I'm not clear what you intend to gain by separating the type system from the "relational engine", other than introducing the apparent, uh, "encapsulation problem" you've noted above.  However, sharing complex types is highly attainable using ideas suggested by mechanisms already in existence, such as JSON, YAML, and the techniques employed by CORBA, </em><a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>, et al.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Relational is mostly about operations on sets of tuples that return sets of tuples. The scalars, or simpler types ("fixed types") are the elements of the tuples. Collections are managed via relational, not custom functions with ADT wrappers (encapsulation). Encapsulation neuters relational. <strong>It is very difficult to have in a given collections both encapsulation and "access" to the relational system.</strong> It forces a hard decision that is difficult to just back out of when requirements for the collection change. In our common example, a "stack" is no longer a "stack" if the nodes within are available to relational operators. In relational the relationship between operators and operands tends to be viewed as complex (potentially many-to-many), not tightly bound (one-to-one or hierarchical). This reflects the set theory philosophy in relational and nested little state-machines in ADT/objects.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I see almost nothing in the quoted paragraph that reflects the </em><a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> as defined by Codd and maintained by <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a>, or indeed any other writer on the subject.  Perhaps it would be more accurate to replace "[R|r]elational" in the text above with "table-oriented programming", so that outright inaccuracies like "[t]he scalars ... are the elements of the tuples" -- as if tuple attributes must be scalar (untrue) -- can be given an appropriate context.  Most of the rest of the paragraph is meaningless ramble, such as "[i]n relational the relationship between operators and operands tends to be viewed as complex."  Huh?<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           I was describing a "should", not a definition. Relational does not, or at least should not, dictate what is "in the cells" beyond a minimum set of requirements needed to interface with relational. I was not clear on the transition in my paragraph, and I apologize.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Hmmm...  I must have misunderstood your use of English, because I interpreted "is" in your "Relational </em>'is<strong> mostly about ..." to mean what the </strong><a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> <strong>is</strong>, as opposed to what it <strong>should</strong> (a word notably missing from the above) be.  As a "should", then, I again suggest that you should incorporate your "shoulds" into Top's <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> model, rather than tilting at the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> windmill.  We can then effectively compare and contrast the two models, without pointless diversions into what the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> is or is not, or what it should or should not be.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           You asked two different questions and I munged the answers together when I probably should have separated them. You basically want to use the type system at the structure level, whereas I'd prefer to use relational to manage the structure-level. It gives better reuse and more flexibility because the boundary between one "type" of structure and another is thin-walled and easily morphed. I seek flexibility in my designs/tools while you seek compile-time-checking. Adaptability with minimal effort is more important than having the machine prevent as much "errors" as possible for the projects I work on. -t
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Nice diversion.  I again suggest that you refer to -- and expand -- your </em><a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> model rather than attempt to "use relational to manage the structure-level."  Note that <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> have already defined an effective <a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a> (i.e., <a href="DateAndDarwensTypeSystem.html">DateAndDarwensTypeSystem</a>) that appears not to require any reference to tables or <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>s in order to provide user-defined types.  However, whether or not these are a sufficient (and effective) way to implement the richness of types encountered and/or desired in the real world is a matter for further analysis and research, as is analysis and research on the equivalent facilities in your <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> model.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           That's <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>, plain and simple, bub. Plus, I see no evidence that they addressed basic issues about the relationship and convertability/sharability between structure-like types and relations.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>How could it be an </em><a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>, when it's not an "argument" at all?  I'm not saying your <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> approach is wrong because <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> say so.  I'm simply pointing out the benefits of distinguishing your <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> approach from the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, such that they can be compared and constrasted in terms of their respective abilities to model complex real-world and computational situations -- including types (or not) -- without the distraction of pointless quibbles over what you feel the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> should or shouldn't be.  Why not refine <strong>your</strong> <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> model, implement it, and <strong>show</strong> us its benefits?<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Are you suggesting that "relational" is defined by <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a>? (I smell another Nygaard-vs-<a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> kind of <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> problem here.)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>No, but I am suggesting that your use of the term "relational" -- which I assume is intended to refer to the </em><a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> -- differs enough from the generally-accepted definition of it (to which <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> and others adhere, in keeping with the principles of <a href="DrCodd.html">DrCodd</a>'s original paper) that it simply seems reasonable to treat your approach as a distinct model.<em> </em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        [The idea that 'domain math' can be separated from relational is well accepted. In an RDBMS, of course, efficiency is an issue (especially for cluster-based queries - likeness, relative distance, etc.) so an RDBMS may need a lot more 'knowledge' of the domains it is expected to index. The idea that variable-sized structures or domain accessors "gum up" relational seems to be Top's belief alone, and seems to be based on little more than his distaste for types.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed, Codd's original paper shows that in terms of the abstract </em><a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, domains (types) exist and need to support (minimally) tests for value equality, but are otherwise irrelevant.  Practical DBMS implementations, however, are a different case.  I note that Top's apparent distaste for types is a peculiar one; his writings suggest that despite his protestations, he actually likes types (or he'd be an assembly language or FORTH programmer) -- he just likes using them the hard way.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that implementation practicalities complicate clean logical separation. But over time more powerful hardware and practice tuning open-source component interfaces often allows us to move incrementally closer to the ideal. As far as the benefits of heavy type usage, until I see it helping for my domain, I'll remain a type-lite fan. (It may indeed help in other domains. I won't argue that. Best tool for the job.) -top

Your SMEQL is doomed to the same fate, I'd put money on it: even if you completed SMEQL and proved it could do anything SQL could do better, it will fail. The problem isn't people waving "bye bye"... it's that most will never even know the language exists, and the rest won't care because it will appear neither maintainable (since nobody else knows it) nor portable (because nobody else supports it).

        <em>How about an illustration of some kind for the million-node report. (Something tells me you will plan to do so only after my join example.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The stack report is a contrived example, of course (fundamentally, a stack isn't a <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a> unless you're relating stacks to things as opposed to relating elements-of-stacks to things). But, supposing your goal is an 'X-ray' of a million-node stack into a million-element relation, I'll offer an example using <a href="TotalFunctionalProgramming.html">TotalFunctionalProgramming</a> to guarantee termination. But you could drop that syntactically guaranteed termination and translate the following easily enough into OO using 'pop' 'peek' 'isEmpty' and a <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> instead of an HOF:
      </p>
      <code>
        define StackFold = <br/>
        {fn Fold: push(X,S) => {fn: HOF => {fn: Seed => {Fold S HOF {HOF X Seed}}}}<br/>
        | empty     => {fn: HOF => {fn: Seed => Seed}}<br/>
        } // implemented to take advantage of <a href="TailCallOptimization.html">TailCallOptimization</a><br/>
        define SequentialUnion = {fn: Elt => {fn: (Counter Rel) => (s(Counter) {union &[(Counter Elt)] Rel})}}<br/>
        define Report = {StackFold MillionNodeStack SequentialUnion (zero &[])}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The above is a left-fold, but switching to a right-fold would allow one to leverage <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> rather than <a href="TailCallOptimization.html">TailCallOptimization</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd need clear goals to run further comparisons. The elements can be shared (useful if they are large strings or whatever). Other problems, like asking for all stacks that contain a particular element, would need the same sort of domain-specific indexing support necessary to ask for all strings containing specific words. That particular issue can be solved by generalizing the indexing mechanisms to support HOFs on what aspects of <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s need to be indexed, and can be written in the same functional language as the above.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not sure I follow your notation here. But it looks like you are inventing an FP query language. And searching for a particular element would not be an uncommon request. One cannot know up front all possible tasks/operations asked of a non-trivial collection. And the user of the data has to learn your different little query language here. And these are just a basic WHERE and ORDER-BY operation at this point. </em>'Why do we need 2 different query languages to do the same thing?<em>' </em>

      <code>
        SELECT * FROM stackNodes WHERE color='red' ORDER BY sales_region<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That is by no means equivalent. If I had stacks as <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s, that means I probably have hundreds, if not millions, of <strong>different stacks</strong>, and the operation you describe would return nodes from every single one of them. Now, perhaps that is your goal; it could be done with functional+relational easily enough if it is, but we really need to compare systems that are functionally equivalent (i.e. produce the same information, even if it is represented differently) before we can reasonably compare non-functional properties. 
      </p>
      <p>
        RE: <em>not know up front all possible tasks/operations</em> - that's fine. There is no issue with that. Functional and OO are both incredibly flexible when it comes to specifying and composing operations (though I'll amend that: traditional OO really needs a companion language for constructing object configurations ideally with support for <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>, whereas functional composes readily without that extra effort).
      </p>
      <p>
        RE: <em>user of the data has to learn your different little query language here</em> - the user needs to learn the representation of the stacks and how to perform domain math operations over them in any case; in your case they need to learn how to join on equal stacks, data entry, and have a tough time performing operations that involve more than one node at a time (e.g. return just the stacks with three red-nodes followed by three blue-nodes). 
      </p>

      <p>
        In any case, I suspect you're imagining the use of stacks as containers for 'data', but in the sense of <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s, stacks (according to the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, as opposed to <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>) shouldn't be treated any differently from short strings or integers. They don't contain data - that is, individual nodes say nothing about the world. Instead, it is the relationship between stacks and other <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s that is data. One needs the ability to operate over selected stacks the same way you'd operate over integers. Your approach fails to do so with even a modicum of convenience.

Why 2? And, "fold" is similar enough to existing relational idioms that we might as well use them. You seem too fond of your FP conventions to consolidate such. (Perhaps the same can be said about me and relational, but at least I am using mainstream conventions as a basis for expansion.)

        Strategies need to be evaluated. Not all of them actually achieve their goals. For example, I don't believe Top's approach offers efficiency or convenience, and I don't believe one can justify a claim that it offers more flexibility than the other strategies. I don't even view it as easier to implement: <a href="InventorsParadox.html">InventorsParadox</a> seems to favor the broader strokes offered by ZF <a href="SetTheory.html">SetTheory</a> or <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>. Thus, (between this and other observations from SMEQL/<a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>) I evaluate it as: looks more promising than SQL, looks less promising on almost every measure than other options on the table.

      <p>
        RE: <em>"You can have your cell view as long as you don't hide the structure"</em> - this is another statement of strategy, not goal. The goal you aim to achieve here is composition (which supports ad-hoc flexibility). Achieving this goal doesn't require that "structured" values be directly exposed to relational operators (though various approaches, including yours and the one derived from ZF <a href="SetTheory.html">SetTheory</a>, allow that); it only <em>requires</em> the ability to view a value as a relation and perform relational operations over <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>'s. All three of the above strategies allow one to compose relational operators with cell <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s; the OO and <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> approaches simply make the composition indirect through an extra primitive.

        RE: <em>"Any given record/node should be able to belong to a million dedicated structure "types" if need be. Think set theory..."</em> - this is a statement of goal, and does not imply your strategy. As noted above, there is no issue with the same node or value existing in many different structures (stacks, lists, trees, etc.). If the goal is even greater efficiency, such that representations are shared, that goal is favored by all approaches <em>except</em> yours, Top, and actually counts as a point <em>against</em> your approach. Sharing of structured values is performed quite easily, with O(1) time on construction by interning of large and otherwise structured values through an intermediate hashtable (though I'll amend: some special efforts are needed for even-more-optimal interning of large strings and lists, usually involving a behind-the-scenes representation strategy called <strong>ropes</strong>). Relevantly, for ZF and <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>/FP approaches, this can happen entirely behind the scenes, applying to all types and values at once, requiring no special efforts, nor any explicit <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>, to achieve. However, Top's approach requires special application-side efforts to share nodes/values/etc. across structures anywhere near so optimally. E.g. if treeZ has treeX as its LHS and treeY as its RHS, one must design the data entry helper to search for treeX and treeY to see if it is already in the database. And then one must be careful to keep treeX and treeY around for as long as treeZ is around. Cascading deletes can help here, but only if explicitly noted, and they'd require some fairly complex specifications; another approach is application-side nightly <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> (which is okay, I suppose, since I didn't list continuous service among the goals, though I probably would for my own work).

               <em>If the logic was objectively wrong, then convert it into formal or semi-formal logic "outline form" along with givens, like a classroom proof.

            <li>
               When you start arguing from logical principles, then I'll be able to point out individual flaws. At the moment, the objective flaw in your logic starts right when you start speaking: you don't even bother with logic. You make or imply vague accusations, claim strengths of your own approach without justification, ignore the counters (or fail to comprehend them), ignore requests to justify your own claims, repeat your accusations and claims - you exhibit the behavior of a man who convinces others by trickery and deceit rather than logic or reason. If you feel otherwise, how about you provide an honest start: please <strong>logically</strong> defend your implied claim that "destructured values are easily able to belong to a million dedicated structure 'types' whereas structured values cannot easily do so". If you make another claim I consider indefensible, I'll point it out to you too. Perhaps, eventually, you can work your way back to logical principles.

            </li>
            <li>
               I asked for a logical defense, not a proof that your pet paradigm is objectively better on some vague 'macro-rigor' scale. A logical defense only requires (a) a justification for your claim, (b) that all elements of that justification can be logically defended as well, and (c) that the justification makes a meaningful distinction regarding the point of contention (e.g. selecting one option/feature/decision over others). As an example regarding a design decision made last year for one of my projects: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                   I choose to use <a href="TotalFunctionalProgramming.html">TotalFunctionalProgramming</a> <em>because</em> it allows greater analysis and is guaranteed to terminate. These points are defended by <a href="RicesTheorem.html">RicesTheorem</a> and the definition of <a href="TotalFunctionalProgramming.html">TotalFunctionalProgramming</a> respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                   I desire termination <em>because</em> it allows for arbitrary <a href="PartialEvaluation.html">PartialEvaluation</a> optimizations, and also because I'll be running untrusted code and I'd finish, and presumably because it would simplify debugging (if only because I don't need to consider whether or not an infinite loop is the problem).
                </li>
                <li>
                   I'll be running untrusted code on my machine <em>because</em> running code on my own machine allows a reduction in network latency, and <em>because</em> the network is faulty and I won't always be connected but I'll sometimes need service from the software anyway.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               And so on. If my defense of a decision or claim is logical, then I should be able to trace and justify reasons for it all the way back to observations over the real world, accepted truths, and system requirements. Now, back to you, if you still think you've been reasonable: please <strong>logically</strong> defend your implied claim that "destructured values are easily able to belong to a million dedicated structure 'types' whereas structured values cannot easily do so"

        It's a bad argument form to raise a goal in defense of a strategy unless one can both justify the goal, and justify that the strategy is <em>the best</em> option to achieve said goal, at least from among the listed alternatives; raising a goal in defense of a strategy indicates without said justification indicates that the speaker isn't considering other strategies that have been presented to him, which indicates he is not listening, which everyone else reasonably finds rude and irritating. It is also bad discussion form to raise a strategy as though it were a goal, especially if the speaker should be aware of the alternative strategies from prior discussion, because it indicates the speaker really is not listening, which everyone else reasonably finds rude and irritating. Can you please, Top, try to be more aware of what you are presenting as goals vs. strategies? Keep it straight. Consider how each goal holds up in other strategies that have been presented. It would lead to more civil discussion. Seriously.
