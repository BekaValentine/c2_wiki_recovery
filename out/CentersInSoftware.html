        Centers In Software
      </h1>
      <p>
        What are the centers in software?  Are there any?
      </p>
      <p>
        What Alexander calls a "center" is something that is defined in
        terms of other centers.  A center is something that holds your
        attention, something that you notice and might name.

      <p>
        A method and a class are probably centers.  A class is made up
        of methods, so that fits.  But classes are pretty small.  A pattern
        like Composite or Strategy is made up of several classes, and they
        are probably centers, too.  A subsystem would be a center, as would
        a complete application.  So, there will be centers at many levels,
        and larger centers are made up of smaller centers.
