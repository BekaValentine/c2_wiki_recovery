        Golden Hammer
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition</strong>: The belief that there is a technology or tool that significantly improves productivity, reduces errors, shortens code, etc. without significant drawbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> Name<strong>: <em>Golden Hammer</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Type</strong>: <em>Development</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>: You need to choose technologies for your development, <em>and you are of the belief that you must choose exactly </em>'one<em>' technology to dominate the architecture.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>: You need to develop some new system or piece of software that doesn't fit very well the technology that the development team are familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The development team are committed to the technology they know
        </li>
        <li>
           The development team are not familiar with other technologies
        </li>
        <li>
           Other, unfamiliar, technologies are seen as risky
        </li>
        <li>
           It is easy to plan and estimate for development in the familiar technology
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Supposed Solution</strong>: Use the familiar technology anyway. The technology (or concept) is applied obsessively to many problems, <em>including where it is clearly inappropriate.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Refactored Solution</strong>: Expanding the knowledge of developers through education, training, and book study groups exposes developers to new solutions.

Although I generally don't believe in person-neutral <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>s, I believe it unfair to criticise it as if it is a consensus fact that there are no such things.

        <em>BrowserConstrainedApplication doesn't seems like an example because it is not a result any one of the above mentioned forces, but due to the need for universal access. -- </em><a href="OliverChung.html">OliverChung</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on a number of applications that had no actual need to be browser-based (internal company applications) and would have been much easier to implement as a thick client application. A BrowserConstrainedApplication is the first thing I think of when someone talks about a <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> -- <a href="BrianDeacon.html">BrianDeacon</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Building for universal access and building for the browser are very different things. Using "web technology" as the <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> very often leads to intractable, single-use, BrowserConstrainedApplications. I have been guilty of this anti-pattern in the past, but am reformed. -- <a href="JimArnold.html">JimArnold</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What other such universal access architectures (preferrably with a interoperable standard and multi-vendor support) are there, where you can connect from cybercafe, PDA, cellphones, laptops, etc almost anywhere in the world today, other than HTTP/HTML? -- </em><a href="OliverChung.html">OliverChung</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think that's the point. In the context of <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a><em></em>'s, a team with whose skills are, primarily, in web development are likely to build an application which <em>precludes</em> the use of other clients. Sure, you can build just about anything with ASP, but try accessing it with anything other than a browser. What about the people who <em>don't</em> need access via the internet? -- <a href="JimArnold.html">JimArnold</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, the page linked above describe BrowserConstrainedApplications's problem as "Sales people need to access FOO on the road, possibly from a </em><a href="CyberCafe.html">CyberCafe</a>, at home, and in the office.... the application needs to be accessible everywhere on the network, with uncertain client-side support". So the system requires universal access with uncertain client-side support. If HTTP/HTML is the only solution, how can it be blamed for the constraint imposed by the browser? What's more, the "Applicable Positive Patterns" section in the above linked page doesn't even address the basic problem, because "creating multiple clients" is not going to allow access from <a href="CyberCafe.html">CyberCafe</a>, unless one of them is HTTP/HTML. There may be cases where using HTTP/HTML is due to <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>'s forces, but the BrowserConstrainedApplications is not one of them. -- <a href="OliverChung.html">OliverChung</a><em></em>

        I can't tell you how many times I have landed in gigs where the client's "engineering" staff was <em>still</em> designing stuff using 80186, Z80, or -- this makes me gag -- MCS-51 family technology. Can't the 8051 be allowed to die a natural death?!? Fortunately, I have priced myself out of most of the work that these loozers represent. However, the kind of thinking that has engineers designing 21st Century products using 1970's steam-engine technology still persists. I run into people designing state of the art electronics hardware and trying to shoehorn UNIX into the box because that's all they know. Duh! Duh! I was thinking about offering a sort of anti-Dilbertism service on my web site. You know the routine; "Have me come in and slap your engineers around a little until they Get It®."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> You can't have it both ways, dude. Sounds like you're trying to shoehorn in 21st century uber-processors into a steam engine. Sometimes a hammer actually is the right tool. So is an 8051. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, I am <em>not</em> trying to use more processing horsepower than is called for by the application. I am trying to avoid the continuous use of 30 year old technology just because the client's engineering staff stop learning anything that long ago. This is not hyperbole; this actually happens, even today. It shocks me into stunned silence to see the kind of crap I wouldn't use to operate my toaster being crammed into medical diagnostics and industrial process automation. Holy moley.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> I wouldn't want any logic circuits in my toaster. It makes toast. That's a zero-bit operation. -- </em><a href="StuartPbBentley.html">StuartPbBentley</a> <em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Note that your rant didn't offer a single reason <strong>not</strong> to use an 8051/80186/z80 or Unix. It may be true that the people you're talking about don't know of an alternative, but that's not the same thing as saying that they chose incorrectly.

           <strong>On the other side of that coin</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have found myself implementing simple already-solved solutions that would work just fine, thank you, if done with an 8-bit micro, but since "this is the 90s" or "it's the 21st century" we "must use the latest stuff" to build a gadget that turns a light on, rings a bell, reports tilt conditions of remote devices to a central location. So we move from a $30 part to a $300 part, hire some guys who are a little fuzzy on what a <a href="TeeState.html">TeeState</a> is, and off we go. OMG. It's a <a href="WheelFactory.html">WheelFactory</a>. But, we <a href="SparedNoExpense.html">SparedNoExpense</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, try this on for size: I recall one client who made industrial temperature controls for various industries. In the case of metal heat treating the response time of the system could be measured in minutes; in the case of certain plastic molding machines the critical temperature cycle could be measured in milliseconds. These guys were developing temperature controls with all sorts of real time features, nifty user interface, and networking -- using a blankety-blank <strong>8051</strong>! The only way they could get their junk to meet latency specs was by going to an <em>even faster</em> 8051 variant made by Dallas or somebody. (Dallas had a version that ran at something like 60MHz, whereas the original Intel device topped out at 2.) Some of their later designs had two or three 8051s in them to spread the work load around enough so that the junkbox microcontrollers could handle it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had these guys switched over to something even as recent as a 68HC16 (1980's technology) they could have met their real time constraints, had all the processing power they could shake a stick at, and eventually created a less expensive, less complex, and more reliable piece of hardware. But, nooooo! They had to stick with the craprod they knew. Oy! What a pile.

        <li>
           Point taken. Yes, if you actually need more clout to get the job done, certainly you want the part that can do it. Those of us working with the "tin box" (a comms interface gadget) have often wished for a bit more clock, a couple more ports, a light or two, maybe a little NovRam to save state, and we've costed it out to get a better part and a little more green real estate -- all within quite reasonable boundaries -- only to have a "<a href="WhereDoYouWantToGoToday.html">WhereDoYouWantToGoToday</a>" honcho elect to employ a gadget that specs out at way more dough and uses <a href="WinCe.html">WinCe</a> as its RTOS, so he can deliver rich content along with everything else we're doing. And the best part? We still don't get the extra ports, nor the extra lights. But we have a hell of a budget entry!

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If I had hard realtime constraints with monitoring fundamentally dangerous hardware, I might adopt the linked processors too (although shared memory if I could get it). One of them gets to be the watchdog for the others.

        Sometimes there are good reasons for <a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a> and sticking to known methods, even if there are "better" ways of working. idSoftware had problems releasing Doom (correct me if I'm wrong) because they used a proprietary sound library without redistribution rights. Sometimes throwing a 100Mhz 6502 at a problem that a 6502 can handle is easiest - software can be fiendishly complex, keeping a working design but clocking it faster might save a lot of money, despite the overall sillyness of 100Mhz 6502s. The trick is to realize when your golden hammer is requiring more work to support than you save by using it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Actually, there are 200MHz to 1GHz 6502 cores embedded in various ASICs, and somewhat slower, 65816s. The choice of what core to use is determined by a wide variety of factors; sure, you can go with a 66MHz ARM, but that has more transistors than a 600MHz 6502, and the 6502 will work plenty "fast enough". That's all that matters to companies; can the project meet its performance requirements, with the right transistor counts (aka, with a given power draw)? When viewed in that light, a 1GHz 6502 makes <em>perfect</em> sense over a 100MHz ARM. Western Design Center (the current vendor for 65C02 and 65C816 cores) notes that sales of their cores is increasing, and the cost of their discrete 6502 and 65816 parts has been steadily increasing, suggesting the increase in demand is accurate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the case of three linked CPUs (wow, the concurrency issues!) you're probably better using one faster CPU. How can you tell? Unfortunately, without experience you aren't aware that not only aren't you using the best tool, but often you're unaware that there are other tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opposite problem is that new tools which solve a fiendish old problem have the tendency to appear magical.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a good reason to keep your design modular. You can swap out a home-written macro parser for an off-the-shelf LISP interpreter, or write a module in perl to take advantage of the <a href="ManagedCode.html">ManagedCode</a> and <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> capability, or call a C program from Perl for something that demands ASM-like control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably the best lesson here though is to expose yourself to new things. <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is a micro form of this - hiring interns and swapping programmers between projects is a macro form of this. If you aren't afraid to <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> and you can write the same code in a few ways, or port your code to a new platform, and experiment. It's a good reason to avoid tying yourself to any technology you don't have access to - <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> is freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Open Source is a wonderful thing and doesn't help you at all when you are trying to create a tightly enclosed, microcontroller-based electronics package.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My toaster has one refinement I enjoy, a little lever which pushes out bread that's either too short to spring out or has failed to spring for some reason. I'm also enjoying the ones made with wider slots for thick bread or bagels. Not sure if those are 21st century refinements or if I've just had low quality toasters before.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The features you describe are 20th century. In addition, many toasters have a slider control which controls the lightness/darkness of the toast. Perhaps the earliest versions with sides that drop down could be adapted so that the drop down would be at the time pop-up toasters usually pop-up. I can visualize them springing open, with the toast ready to buttered or jammed. They could have space that was wide enough and spring adjusted to hold a half-bagel on each side. (Sunbeam, are you listening?)
      </p>
      <p>
        I rather <em>like</em> the fact that my fancy-dancy new toaster is on a timer and not a thermostat, so when my girlfriend's toasting her bagel, i put mine in and the lever doesn't immediately pop back up in a few seconds, like it always did with the old fashioned one. The lever activates the digital timer and is still on a spring (but it's released with a digital "cancel" button on top). I'll be the first to say that motorized toasters that slowly lower and raise the toasted product are just ludicrous. I am however annoyed at my coffeemaker which only has logic buttons for on and off. It has no timer built in, and I can't even put it on an external plug timer because of the full logic controls. Means I can't wake up to hot coffee. I'm starting to think of an automatic button-pusher on a solenoid activated by an X10 sensor, but she's not a fan of my grungy hack tech on our appliances...

        I do look into new stuff, but usually it's more practical issues these days, such as squeezing desired UI behavior out of existing tools. Further, using a different programming language or "odd" technique requires approval from bosses and other developers.

        For one, I'm skeptical that my detractors are as like-minded as you suggest (assuming it's more than one person). Second, you've never demonstrated that academic materials tend to reinforce each other, rather than present potentially contradictory or alternative theories/models. Third, you've never demonstrated how your vast academic knowledge has helped you separate the good from the bad. You rarely turn it into anything demonstratively real or practical. Something is wrong. I still believe that the keys to software engineering are in <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> and not so much pure logic and math. The set-versus-bag "relational" debate is an example where you <strong>overvalue</strong> purity for purity's sake.

I am of the opinion that when I fail to understand something it is my fault and my responsibility to do something about it. You seem to blame the rest of the world. You have that right, but that tends to cause me to think you are a deservedly lost cause. My only goal is to attempt to prevent others from falling into this same trap. I live a life of conflicted misery and dissatisfaction because I am forced to confront the vast number of things I do not know, and do not understand, and somehow this is my fault and my problem and not the world's. Please note that I no longer see any point in suggesting that you think about that.</em> -- Bottom

        {You have a curious view of the outcome of the set-versus-bag "relational" debate. I recall you being repeatedly shown that keeping bags has downsides; eliminating bags has clear benefits and no downsides other than possibly rarely requiring a keyword or two at the system boundaries to either import or export bags; and I recall you being unable or unwilling to provide <em>any</em> justification for retaining bags inside the system other than some weak appeal to "authority" -- something akin to "if Oracle and IBM saw fit to keep bags in SQL, they must have had a good reason" even though several of us explained the historical inertia that leads to such systems being maintained and ignorance being sustained.}

           It made your tool more complex and/or confusing in my opinion. It is perhaps a <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> argument that logic alone cannot settle. Also, you left out space considerations. Omitting a unique key can save space. Maybe not always a big deal, but is one factor. Also, yours was more effort adapting to bags from the outside (suppliers). - t

Indeed, you are sometimes a source of said noise. Why don't you read more and learn something?}

        Well, Oracle, IBM, etc. are also on the corner with me in the bag situation. So, I won't get lonely. I'd rather be surrounded with rich nuts than broke incoherent anal-retentive purity Einsteins. The <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a> crowd is both well-to-do and popular.

        Similarly, if somebody fails to understand your POV, you should consider it your responsibility to rework your approach rather than force them to spend 500 hours reading dry material.

        And, there's also the economic consideration. Given two claimed <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>s, one requiring spending 500 hours reading dry material and the other only 50, I'll go with the 50, and so will a vast majority of fellow practitioners. Plus, I can look into ten times more GH claims in a given time-frame. It's a more logical use of time. There's lots of claimed GH's to explore. - t

        Regarding the economic consideration, top, did you mean to write "one <strong>not</strong> requiring spending 500 hours reading dry material"? Your following comment would make more sense if the word "not" hadn't been used.

        Well now top, I hope you don't think we are trying to change your mind. But we know that <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> differs from ArgumentbyReverence, and that ArgumentByCitation has nothing to do with either. Also you do not know anything about empiricism as you refuse to read Hume or Quine. I consider it privilege and an honor to hear you so enamored of your current view on the grounds that if it requires work is must be wrong. Unlike my colleague, however, I refuse to confuse you with the sophists as they were quite clever by comparison. In any event, insulting you is like feeding chickens to ducks while shooting fish in a barrel which contains only apples. I have no idea how, of course, but given your talents I am sure you can come up with reason yourself and spare me the unnecessary effort -- that's what you do right -- help to ensure that the unexplained stays that way by inventing place holders for rational thought. I should also confess that, while I do think some of your ideas are vacuous enough to induce brain cancer, I can honestly say that if you did not exist I would need to invent you -- you are with out doubt the funniest and most enlightening <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> I have ever meet. I am content to leave you be however, if you agree to sign all of your insights with your full Nom de guerre , <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. This will provide full warning and serve as a form of reflexive refutation. Since you clearly believe your ideas are sound, you should not object. But unsigned idiocy must be considered fair game for the reasons I have already stated. Given a choice of taking seriously your claim that any or all portions of the corpus of human knowledge may, on demand of your humble self, require de novo demonstration , recursively no doubt, or lighting you up in a barrage of sarcasm, I will light you up every time -- after all, its takes much less time and you have now shown me the error of my workaholic ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for providing such excellent fodder. Please Sign your idiocy in future. It will save me time, avoid bring disrepute upon this wiki, and grant me leave to avoid making your fragile ego an unintended causality in the war against nihilism. As I say, to the extent that you think your ideas have merit, you should not object to signing them <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. I concur with your decision not to use your <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a> -- It suggests that you are smart enough to know better which I fear implies much darker motives for your conduct.
