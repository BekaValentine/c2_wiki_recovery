           years a programmer, starting with IBM, now with Nationwide Building Society, alternating several times between suppliers and customers along the way.

        Back at IBM, we were generating a VM version of VTAM from the SNA architecture definition.  Today, there are 50 developers writing business systems using a tool of my own devising, known as Process Author.
