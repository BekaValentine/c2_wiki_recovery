        Sinclair Zx Eighty
      </h1>
      <p>
        The ZX80 was a <a href="MicroComputer.html">MicroComputer</a> from SinclairResearch, released in 1980. It used the Zilog Z80, had 1K of RandomAccessMemory and a membrane keyboard.

        It was the predecessor of the more popular <a href="SinclairZxEightyOne.html">SinclairZxEightyOne</a>. It was also slightly more expensive. Not as rugged or as cool looking (white and blue rather that the ZX81 all black).

        My dad bought one as a kit and put it together, using a soldering iron and lots of patience. It was cheaper that way. You had to solder all of the individual components onto the board. I think we still have it somewhere. --<a href="MatthewFarwell.html">MatthewFarwell</a>.
