        <a href="ObjectWorks.html">ObjectWorks</a> was the predecessor to <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> from <a href="ParcPlaceDigitalk.html">ParcPlaceDigitalk</a>.  At one time there were two <a href="ObjectWorks.html">ObjectWorks</a> products -- the Smalltalk product and a C++ product.  The C++ product was dropped relatively quickly, although I understand you can still get some of the class libraries as part of Linux.
