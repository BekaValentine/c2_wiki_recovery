        Parallel Programming Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        I think there is an issue about boundaries as to what is <a href="ParallelProgramming.html">ParallelProgramming</a>. I had tried to be clear about it when I started <a href="ParallelProgramming.html">ParallelProgramming</a>, but it seems that I have not been clear and that shows up as a problem worth discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are pages which link from <a href="DistributedComputing.html">DistributedComputing</a> which discuss issues of the patterns of programming. They include quite a lot of topics as can be seen from the fact that it has 56 back links.
      </p>
      <p>
        I intended <a href="ParallelProgramming.html">ParallelProgramming</a> to be about taking a serial program solving some numerical problem and turning it into a parallel program which will run on several computers in a closecoupled way. Maybe it is wrongly named, in which case it could be renamed something more specific. I now suggest <a href="ProgrammingForParallelComputing.html">ProgrammingForParallelComputing</a>. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        I think of <a href="DistributedComputing.html">DistributedComputing</a> as distributing a task among separate computers where it is expensive to share resources between nodes.  I think of <a href="ParallelProgramming.html">ParallelProgramming</a> as exploiting fine-grain parallelism in a problem, where sharing resources is easier.  Examples: MultiThreading to take advantage of <a href="SymmetricMultiprocessing.html">SymmetricMultiprocessing</a>, and decomposing algorithms to use SIMD (SingleInstructionMultipleData) to take advantage of vector units such as <a href="AltiVec.html">AltiVec</a> or <a href="CellProcessor.html">CellProcessor</a>s. -- <a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a>

        <strong>Parallel computing</strong> is the simultaneous execution of the <em>same task</em> (split up and specially adapted) on multiple processors in order to obtain results faster. The idea is based on the fact that the process of solving a problem usually can be divided into smaller tasks, which may be carried out simultaneously with some coordination.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <strong>parallel programming model</strong> is a set of software technologies to express parallel algorithms and match applications with the underlying parallel systems. It encloses the areas of applications, languages, compilers, libraries, communication systems, and parallel I/O. People have to choose a proper parallel programming model or a form of mixture of them to develop their parallel applications on a particular platform.

        <strong>Parallel programming</strong> is a <strong>computer programming</strong> technique that provides for the execution of operations in parallel, either within a single computer, or across a number of systems. In the latter case, the term <strong>distributed computing</strong> is used.

        On the basis of the above I think that what I am discussing can be described as <a href="ProgrammingForParallelComputing.html">ProgrammingForParallelComputing</a> which has to use a <a href="ParallelProgrammingModel.html">ParallelProgrammingModel</a>. That has the virtue of being consistent with the <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> usage. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <strong>Category and Concurrency</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two categories <a href="CategoryConcurrency.html">CategoryConcurrency</a> and <a href="CategoryConcurrencyPatterns.html">CategoryConcurrencyPatterns</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also related pages called <a href="SynchronizationStrategies.html">SynchronizationStrategies</a> and <a href="ParalleliZation.html">ParalleliZation</a>. There is some discussion about how these topics are related.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Concurrency is when two tasks or threads are active at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
           Synchronization is when the two tasks need to interact.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There is an EditHint on <a href="CategoryConcurrencyPatterns.html">CategoryConcurrencyPatterns</a> that <a href="SynchronizationStrategies.html">SynchronizationStrategies</a> is the same thing and that they should be merged.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think that </em><a href="ProgrammingForParallelComputing.html">ProgrammingForParallelComputing</a> is a distinct area from the above which could have a category of its own but does not yet. I would welcome suggestions or contrary views.<em> -- </em><a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
