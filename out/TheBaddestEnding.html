           <a href="PulpFiction.html">PulpFiction</a> ("Zed's dead, baby.  Zed's dead.")  <em>This is not actually the ending of the movie; it's the ending of the vignette just before the final one in the diner.  But it's better than the actual ending.</em>  It's not the last scene in the film; however it <em>is</em> the last action to occur temporally in the movie.  All that scenes that come after ZedsDead occur <em>before</em> ZedsDead.  Remember, Bruce Willis's character (the boxer, Butch) shoots and kills John Travolta's character (Vincent Vega) in the "watch" vignette; in the final vignette (which goes back to the beginning of the film) Travolta's character is once again alive.

           Gattacca (Ethan Hawke's character launches into space with his "class" in business suit against the odds, light from the portals	playing on their faces to some forgettable narration. The noir/<a href="TomSwiftJr.html">TomSwiftJr</a> aesthetic of the whole movie was great and this was the perfect ending to it)

           MenInBlack I - scene pans out to the earth, solar system, galaxy only to become embedded in a game of marbles by alien "children" in a higher universe. The sequel tried similar with this reality being a locker in a HigherOrder grand central station; while good did not quite work the same.

        <li>
           BackToTheFuture 1 - "Where we're going we don't need roads..." and the DeLorean wheels fold up (was road bound to this point), takes off into the air, zooms down the road then back. The sequels were a bit of an anticlimax but as an ending for 1 this was "bad".

        TheGangsOfNewYork has a virtuoso fight scene that would surely have been a candidate for <a href="TheBaddestEnding.html">TheBaddestEnding</a>, if it had appeared at the end of the movie. However, it appears at the very beginning. MartinScorcese --- what a nut!

        If there was a "TheBaddestBeginning" I would nominate TimeCop when the old western (Union?) soldiers are plodding through the rain and intercepted by what looks like a real straggler "goldminer" - the furthest looking scene from <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> all of a sudden he brings out his high tech weapons with laser finder and "relieves" them all of their gold to take forward in time.
