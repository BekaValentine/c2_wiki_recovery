        I've been following XP for over a year now - led to it via looking for Patterns information and finding Wiki: got the highest signal/noise ratio on the net, in my experience.

        My background:
        ~20 years in Development: COBOL, Ingres Windows/4GL (a language just too early for the h/w), and VB for the last few years. Lots of RDBMS', though no formal DBA jobs. Mostly working for small software houses.
        Three/four years ago, I set up a company in the UK with 4 others (non-technical) to provide services for the UK Gas Industry. I developed a Gas Balancing system for in-house use, and then we started selling it to Gas Companies, and it's doing quite well thank you very much.

        Just a thought. One of the reasons for <a href="ThingsWeHateAboutVbClassic.html">ThingsWeHateAboutVbClassic</a> is that VB is very definitely a MS environment. The only time I have seen the IDE crash, for example, is when developers put ported *Nix-based tools onto the Windows machines, such as Emacs, VIM etc. Personally, I suspect those tools as destabilising the environment, due their porters ignorance of Windows internals: I don't use them and I've never had the IDE crash inexplicably. (I can however make the whole machine crash with API calls which are malformed sufficiently; another example of <a href="PilotIgnorance.html">PilotIgnorance</a> for which *I* don't blame MS, though I suspect that too many people like playing Iranians to MS's Uncle Sam for me to get agreement with that). Come back Sam G, I understand it all......
