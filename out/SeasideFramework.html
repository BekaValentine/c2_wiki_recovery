        A <a href="ModalWebFramework.html">ModalWebFramework</a> that implements <a href="WebTransactionsWithContinuations.html">WebTransactionsWithContinuations</a>, written in <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>. Originally inspired by <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> and the work of <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> for the YahooStore, it:

           optionally uses <a href="CallWithCurrentContinuation.html">CallWithCurrentContinuation</a> to provide very sophisticated control flow and backtracking support.

      <p>
        Applications built with it include <a href="DabbleDb.html">DabbleDb</a>, a spreadsheet-like database, and PierCms, a wiki and web <a href="ContentManagementSystem.html">ContentManagementSystem</a>.

        Reading others' code is also a learning activity, since all source code in <a href="SeasideFramework.html">SeasideFramework</a> is available.

        Canadian Smalltalkers <a href="AviBryant.html">AviBryant</a> and <a href="JulianFitzell.html">JulianFitzell</a> created Seaside in 2001.  Community leaders include LukasRenggli , PhilippeMarschall, and MichelBany.    Version 2.8 was released in 2007, and as of 2009, development of version 3.0 continues under <a href="PharoSmalltalk.html">PharoSmalltalk</a>, with ports to other Smalltalks.

        Areas I have found useful in my pursuit of WebAppCreationNirvana:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.root.cz/clanky/seaside-1/">http://www.root.cz/clanky/seaside-1/</a> (13 or more sections). As you can see, its written in .cz, but I've learned that when you adapt to the various Smalltalk idioms, the program becomes the documentation.

        How does this compare to <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a>?

      <p>
        <em>Rails is a full web development stack. Seaside doesn't provide data-access mechanisms out of the box, even though Magma (a pure Smalltalk object database for Squeak) seems to be a popular combination. I don't think it would be possible to create sites like </em><a href="DabbleDb.html">DabbleDb</a> in an agile manner using anything but a <a href="ModalWebFramework.html">ModalWebFramework</a>.<em></em>

        There is a port of an early version of Seaside 2 to Ruby, the BorgesFramework (<a href="http://borges.rubyforge.org/)">http://borges.rubyforge.org/)</a>

        There was a colloquium on Seaside at <a href="PortlandStateUniversity.html">PortlandStateUniversity</a> on February 20, 2006.  Presented by <a href="AviBryant.html">AviBryant</a> of Smallthought Systems.
