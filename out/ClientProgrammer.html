        Client Programmer
      </h1>
      <p>
        A programmer who uses, but does not implement or modify, a library, class, or database. A term popularized by <a href="BruceEckel.html">BruceEckel</a>, who attributes it to <a href="ScottMeyers.html">ScottMeyers</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be understood that this does not describe a type of programmer, as it may at first seem, but a relationship between a programmer and a given tool. Unless they are writing a completely new system from the ground up, any programmer is going to be a <a href="ClientProgrammer.html">ClientProgrammer</a> of someone else's work on some level. Examples of this would be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A programmer who uses a STL class to hold a objects of a class he has written: he is a <a href="ClientProgrammer.html">ClientProgrammer</a> for the STL collection, but a <a href="DevelopmentProgrammer.html">DevelopmentProgrammer</a> for the class being stored in the collection.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A programmer who is using an assembler to write a new driver: she is a <a href="ClientProgrammer.html">ClientProgrammer</a> for the assembler, but a <a href="DevelopmentProgrammer.html">DevelopmentProgrammer</a> for the driver.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A programmer who is using a compiler to compile a new version of the same compiler, which he has modified personally: he is both a <a href="ClientProgrammer.html">ClientProgrammer</a> and a <a href="DevelopmentProgrammer.html">DevelopmentProgrammer</a> of the compiler.
        </li>
      </ul>
