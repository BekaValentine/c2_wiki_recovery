        If you need to produce certain OO model-based deliverables, a good drawing tool that understands the syntax of your modelling language can be a valuable aid to productivity. There are lots of tools available, but you client and your manager have only heard of one. It doesn't matter how many evaluation exercises you do, you are going to use that tool. You are going to use <a href="RationalRose.html">RationalRose</a>.

        I feel that way about source code management systems.  "Hmm, yes, it does seem as though <a href="CyclicCvs.html">CyclicCvs</a> does everything that we need. But we're going to use <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> anyway." Sigh. --<a href="BrettNeumeier.html">BrettNeumeier</a>

        You all should be ashamed of yourself! <a href="RationalRose.html">RationalRose</a> was written by <a href="GradyBooch.html">GradyBooch</a>, a pillar of OO thought. How you could disparage his UML case tool is beyond me.  --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        Alternatively, you could ask, how could his company produce a product he wouldn't be proud of?

        Yes, much respect is due for the UML.  Maybe not for Rose.  
      </p>
      <p>
        How could his company produce it?... They probably used Rational Unified Process to develop it, or is it one of those recursive things where they use version 1 of Rose to develop version 2.  Anyway...
        if the tool is not that good, I'm NotGonnaNeedTheHassle!  And, it looks like there are free tools coming on line, such as Argo UML.  So tell me the reasons why I shouldn't use Argo?  It's free.  It's Open Source.  It does all those diagrams.  It may be limited now, and there may be some hassle and shortcomings in support, but the features will keep on coming.  If the only real problem is that my customer needs educating should that really stop me?  --Jon Blackmore

        You're right, it's a feat beyond my powers, I give up, I'll use Rose.

        There is sometimes a misconception that just because the method "gurus" work for Company X, their product represents the "best of breed".  Just how many times do the three Amigos visit product development to provide a some input?! : --<a href="RussFreeman.html">RussFreeman</a>
