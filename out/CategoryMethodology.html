        A Methodology specifies some process for developing software.
        Each one has a specified set of deliverables (code, documents, test
        results, ...) and tasks which develop them.  They differ in what
        conditions they work with and on
        any number of other criteria which others should expand on.

        <strong>Use Methodology or Method - When</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Methodology "can properly refer to the theoretical analysis of the methods appropriate to a field of study or to the body of methods and principles particular to a branch of knowledge," according to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Method is "a means or manner of procedure, especially a regular and systematic way of accomplishing something."
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, most people use methodology to mean nothing more sophisticated than "the way we do things" but sticking the 'ology on the end makes it sound more impressive! -- <a href="PhilStubbington.html">PhilStubbington</a>
