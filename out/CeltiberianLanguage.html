        Celtiberian Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Celtiberian language, as expected, is a member of the Celtic branch of the IndoEuropean language family. It was mainly spoken until about the 1st century BC in Northern Spain.

      <p>
        Although there are a only a few inscriptions of the language, of which only a fraction has been successfully translated, some claim that the language would have been a Q-celtic language. If such were the case, it would mean that the language would have been closer to Irish than <a href="GaulishLanguage.html">GaulishLanguage</a> or Brythonic, for example. Although it appears that some Irish traditions and legends state that the Irish come from the spanish peninsula, it is hard to say whether or not the two languages were closely related, because of the lack of information on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only very few words of Celtiberian origin survive in modern SpanishLanguage, of which one of the most notable would be "cervesa" meaning beer. Compare to Welsh "cwrw" and French "cervoise".
