        Hi all.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you care, there's a fair bit of detail on my background and interests below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, I sail (that's me in the photo above - here in Wisconsin we try and sail year 'round).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently working in the research group of Accuray Incorporated.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current project is investigating Delivery-Verification for the <a href="TomoTherapy.html">TomoTherapy</a> radiation treatment system.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current software/programming interests are in the area of <a href="EmergentDesign.html">EmergentDesign</a> and the correlation/analogies between LeanProduction and software development (ex. <a href="LeanProgramming.html">LeanProgramming</a>). I'm also getting involved in some of the ways <a href="UserCenteredDesign.html">UserCenteredDesign</a> and XP can interact, or be used in conjunction.
      </p>
      <p>
        I almost always feel like <a href="MyBrainIsFull.html">MyBrainIsFull</a>, but I always seem to be able to cram one more interesting tidbit into it...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        For those interested in who I am, here is a brief synopsis:
      </p>
      <p>
        Organized by interest/activity:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Professional Geek.
        </li>
        <li>
           Photographer (mostly airplanes and sailboats).
        </li>
        <li>
           I love to sail (on either soft or hard water).
        </li>
        <li>
           When I'm not doing other things, I enjoy lighting large bonfires.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I now (finally!) own a domain with a *real* web-site:

        <a href="http://moving-target-photos.com/">http://moving-target-photos.com/</a> (two domains, count 'em!)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There's some newer stuff of mine (using PHP, TheDrupalCMS, and <a href="CoppermineGallery.html">CoppermineGallery</a>) at:

      </code>
      <p>
        I'm in the process of setting up a wiki for iceboating topics. Probably based on the Mediawiki package, but I'm a bit hesitant to embrace it's complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also joined the BlogSphere with a number of "official" blogs (i.e. they are hosted by software that calls them "blogs", I believe my first real blog entry was in 1996: <a href="http://geoff-s.net/tc/enc96_planes.html):">http://geoff-s.net/tc/enc96_planes.html):</a>

        Organized historically:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           I'm a chemist by training/schooling (1978-1988). I've been through the academic process through college and graduate school (Ph.D.).
        </li>
        <li>
           My first job (1989) was as a researcher and computer sys-admin at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD.
        </li>
        <li>
           I then (1995) moved back to Madison, WI (nice place to live; please just visit) and worked for GE Medical Systems for a few years.
        </li>
        <li>
           Got sick of the "Corporate Life" (and a long commute) and went to work at Berbee in the summer of 1999. I moved to the Isthmus Group in August of 2004.
        </li>
        <li>
           After six years of "business" programming, I headed back to my instrumentation and bio-medical "roots" and joined the research group at <a href="TomoTherapy.html">TomoTherapy</a> (<a href="http://tomotherapy.com/).">http://tomotherapy.com/).</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Organized by programming philosophy:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           I started writing software sometime around 1975 using FORTRAN and BASIC with no idea what I was doing. Used lots of 'goto' statements.
        </li>
        <li>
           Late in college I was exposed to Pascal (many thanks to BarryBurd and AlanCandiotti) and the idea that programs might want to have a structure to them. What a concept...
        </li>
        <li>
           Sometime in the winter of 1981, I taught my first formal class about the importance of structuring a computer program's source code to reveal the intent of the design (in BASIC! - *not* VB, BTW).
        </li>
        <li>
           Through graduate school I continued to discover more things about program structure - information hiding, "monitors", encapsulation, and the like. Unfortunately, I also stayed firmly rooted in the procedural world, and never made the jump to objects. I did get to write a fairly large Pascal program to run the spectrometer I built in graduate school. For awhile, I also earned my living fixing and supporting a data analysis/display program (pcNMR+) written in C and running under DOS 3.1.
        </li>
        <li>
           During my post-school scientific/engineering career, I mostly wrote code in IDL (<a href="http://www.rsinc.com).">http://www.rsinc.com).</a> Mostly one-off code in-order to analyze some bit of data in order to write a paper; I also wrote a framework for processing NMR spectroscopy data in IDL. In addition, there was some C coding, too.
        </li>
        <li>
           While at GE Medical Systems, I was exposed to the rigors of requirements management mandated by the FDA for medical devices (in my case, Magnetic Resonance scanners). Definitely, "<a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>". I learned some interesting things about ISO9000 and <a href="SixSigma.html">SixSigma</a>. While I was there it all seemed overkill; in hindsight I realize I learned quite a bit about eliciting requirements from users, and managing large projects (the latter to the point where I now *really* value a good project manager).
        </li>
        <li>
           Late in my GE career, I started seriously trying to "become altered" (as <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> would say) into the object world.
        </li>
        <li>
           Once I moved to Berbee, OO in Java was "the way" (except for some nasty bits of Perl...). I was exposed to the various methodologies floating around for managing software development. After the usual flirtation with "why don't we build software like we build a [house|bridge|building]" (i.e. <a href="SoftwareIsDifferent.html">SoftwareIsDifferent</a>) I became a serious proponent of the various LightWeightMethodologies (aka: <a href="MinimalMethodologies.html">MinimalMethodologies</a>) (ex. <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>'s "Crystal" family (<a href="CrystalClearMethodology.html">CrystalClearMethodology</a>), etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
           Heading the admonishments (over *way* too many years) of two very smart colleagues (DavidGurr and AlexGarret), I'm starting to look at <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> techniques and style.
        </li>
