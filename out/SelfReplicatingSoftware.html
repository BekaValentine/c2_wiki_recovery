        <em>There's a lot of useful content on the </em><a href="SelfReplication.html">SelfReplication</a> page. However, I have a question that relates specifically to <a href="SelfReplicatingSoftware.html">SelfReplicatingSoftware</a>. We all know about <em>malicious</em> self-replicating software (viruses, worms, etc.). But are there any extant examples of <em>useful</em> self-replicating software? I have heard it suggested that one could create an "anti-worm", a worm that traverses a network eliminating a malicious worm, but has this actually been done? And are there any other applications of beneficial self-replicating software?<em></em>
