        Life Asa Development Environment
      </h1>
      <p>
        It seems only natural to regard your home, your family, and everything else you do as a development environment. It's all just one big project, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        When you look around your home, what do you plan to do? The <a href="SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>? And then <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> it? When you think about your relationship with your loved ones, don't you <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>? Your child's college fund - <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, are you?
      </p>

        Seriously, if you and your loved ones acted more like a development team and less like a bunch of customers, don't you think you'd have a better time with them?
