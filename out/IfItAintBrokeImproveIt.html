        If It Aint Broke Improve It
      </h1>
      <p>
        The exact opposite of <a href="IfItAintBrokeDontFixIt.html">IfItAintBrokeDontFixIt</a> which involves fixing whatever is broken. For a <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a>, it may be better practice to follow this method, although it can lead to the <a href="SecondSystemEffect.html">SecondSystemEffect</a> and <a href="FeatureCreep.html">FeatureCreep</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this also referred to as IfItAintBrokeFixItUntilItIs?
      </p>

        And if you break it while improving it, you can always go back to what worked before you started your improvement. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>One can go back sometimes... not always.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               That is probably true most of the time for things not broken being fixed by more than one. It is different for those things done by a single individual fixing his own things.

          </ul>
        </li>

           You can <em>always</em> go back. You can often also go <em>sideways</em>. You are using <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a>, right? (I swear, that should be the first thing they teach kids in school.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Even if you don't have version control, is having a simple copy of your code <em>before</em> you do anything risky too obvious a step?
            </li>
            <li>
               {Not if interacting with other systems and tools. It's difficult to "undo" such references and interface dependencies in systems that are part of larger or multiple systems.}
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In my experience, most systems are tossed about every 15 to 20 years or so because some "new-fangled" technology makes them obsolete or the vendor gradually abandons the product. One should consider this before spending time "cleaning" existing systems outside of feature addition/fixing. (Whether they should be tossed or not is another matter; I'm just addressing the fact that they are tossed.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>15 to 20 years?!  In some areas I'm used to seeing things chucked and rebuilt every 2 to 3 years.  5 year old code seems archaic.</em>
      </p>

        For internal systems? Usually nobody wants to spend money to revamp them if they are doing a satisfactory job, especially if they contain legacy data.
