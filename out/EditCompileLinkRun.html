        The steps to produce a working program in many traditional languages; though with sophisticated IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments, modern <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a> and other tools, much of this can be automated.  The four steps are:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Edit</dt>
        <dd>type in your program using an editor of some sort, or modify existing code.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Compile</dt>
        <dd>Cause the file(s) you have been just edited to be translated to some other format, usually object code for the underlying machine.  (A secondary step in many systems is "assemble"; it's not uncommon for a compiler to emit <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> which is then assembled to <a href="ObjectCode.html">ObjectCode</a>; however this step usually is transparent).  Assuming no errors, you then....</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Link</dt>
        <dd>Using a program called a "linker", combine the different object files that make up your program, along with any libraries you want to use (and the language's runtime system) into a final executable.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Run</dt>
        <dd>Invoke the executable.  (Actually this is also two steps--loading it into memory, and executing it when it's there).  When it crashes or otherwise doesn't work, go back to step 1.  (Better yet, run a debugger--another step I didn't mention).</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Obviously, the above is a gross oversimplification.  Modern <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>s can defer much of the linking to the load phase; and almost every environment known to man can combine the compile and link phases, whether it's an <a href="IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.html">IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment</a> or a Makefile.  However, the steps still occur, in this order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some folks rather dislike <a href="EditCompileLinkRun.html">EditCompileLinkRun</a> environments/languages; thinking them outdated.  Indeed, Makefile maintenance is a major chore; and building a large sophisticated product with an IDE can be an equally scary experience.  In most such languages, large programs are broken up into many different files; keeping track of all of them is a pain (and in languages like <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a>, handling the build dependencies is also a pain--maintaining a large project <em>without</em> a sophisticated IDE or a Makefile is almost impossible).  And, even with a good IDE, the "seams" are rather obvious (compared to an <a href="ImageBasedLanguage.html">ImageBasedLanguage</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, <a href="EditCompileLinkRun.html">EditCompileLinkRun</a> has its advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's highly portable.  There is a clear deliniation between what is "source" and what is "derived"; and the entire set of information needed to build a system can be found in a set of text files. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Integrates very well with <a href="ConfigurationManagement.html">ConfigurationManagement</a> systems.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Integrates very well with multiple developers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Supports heterogenous projects (those written in multiple languages) well.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Deployment of object files is trivial (main issue is finding appropriate files in a multiple-file system).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Aren't dependent on one particular environment: if you don't like <a href="VisualAgeForJava.html">VisualAgeForJava</a>, you can pack up your stuff and go use <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> or make or whatever else you like.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Works well across a network; especially across a network consisting of many "<a href="FatClient.html">FatClient</a>s" (each of which can host their own development environment).
        </li>
      </ul>
