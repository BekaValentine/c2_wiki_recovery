        This is an experimental Wiki page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to see if I can make a page to be linked to my web site to allow visitors to make comments about the recent death of a friend: an online obituary of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We're sorry to hear about the death of your friend. It would probably be best if you created your own, dedicated wiki rather than using this one. In that way you can tailor it to your own requirement. You can do this easily by visiting:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://pbwiki.com/">http://pbwiki.com/</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>It's about 3 clicks to make a wiki, and it's yours.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When you've decided what to do, please </em><a href="DeleteThisPageSomeTime.html">DeleteThisPageSomeTime</a>. Thanks.<em></em>
