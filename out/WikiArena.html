        The <a href="WikiArena.html">WikiArena</a> is a place for people who insist on engaging in <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>s on Wiki to do so, without bothering the rest of us.  If <a href="WikiArena.html">WikiArena</a> gets too full or has too much traffic (or too many changes), individual <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>s might get their own <a href="WikiArena.html">WikiArena</a> page (ie WikiArenaRichardVsCostin, WikiArenaTwoSeventeenVsWikiBlackList, WikiArenaRobertVsTheWorld).

        Old rubbish, er, content may be purged from this page at a regular basis.  By default, the contents of this page are <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>; once tempers cool no need to preserve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        No need for the material here to have too much surrounding context, or be in order.  This is the parking lot to keep the brawls out of the bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to move <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>s from other pages here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don't delete this page; it serves a purpose.

        <em>Sadly though, people won't use this. One of the hallmarks of a genuine flame war is that the participants feel that it is genuine, serious conversation. Admitting during the process that it is a flame war would kill it, and no one involved ever seems to want that.</em>

           That's not the point.  I don't expect flame-warriors to wage their battles in here.  I expect <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>s started on other pages to be picked up and deposited here, like litter in the trash bin.  Perhaps the participants will get the clue; perhaps not.  (I wouldn't be surprised if a <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>, once moved here, <em>continued</em> in here; such is the nature of the beast).

        If RK wants to have a "thoughtful" discussion about my alleged "abuse" towards him, he's welcome to do so. My rules are: honesty (no cheap editing tricks) and no insults. Anything else will be swiftly deleted, no explanation necessary. Repeated tries to engage him in a conversation (even ignoring insults) were unsuccessful. I have never deleted and will never delete anything even remotely reasonable written by him.  He can whine all day long or he can learn to deal with me. I can sympathize that his hatred towards me makes this an exhausting effort he's not yet ready to undertake, but what can you say, life is tough, buddy. --<a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        In more details, to his claim:

      <p>
        <em>It should be possible for his victims to simply ban him from pages which they have created for their own uses. It should also be possible for his victims to talk about that abusive son of a bitch without either him or one of his admirers coming along to nuke the entire discussion.</em>

        No, it's not possible. Not on <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> anyways. You can't insult people, put up false statements about people, or on any other subject, without expecting to be challenged in at least an intellectually engaging discussion. That's the nature of wiki. There are plenty of free blogging websites, wiki space generously donated to you by <a href="BenKovitz.html">BenKovitz</a>, where you can unleash your pure thoughts without worrying about being challenged. However, inspite repeated bragging you never took that opportunity, because such a solution won't work for you for obvious reasons: it'll succomb in anonymity and non-value. Left to your own devise, you don't value that much. That's why you desperately act to try to both take advantage of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> both notoriety and content <strong>and</strong> be editorially in charge so that you can promote your own ideas about whatever unchallenged. Here's your own words.

        <dd>So the obvious next step is to create a large principled wiki. How to do that? Out of the resources of this one, by stealing its pages, its users and usurping its rulers. [quote from RK]</dd>

        Apparently "stealing its pages" is not enough, cause practically nobody  is going to read RK's personal soapbox, even if you copied the whole content of this wiki. You still want to take advantage of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> notoriety, but use it in your own "principled" way. My answer to you is simple: <strong>get over it, it can't be done</strong>. If you insult me or anyone else your insults will be swiftly deleted. If you want to promote whatever idea either crazy or seemingly reasonable or perfectly reasonable, expect that challenges are normal. If you delete the challenge or unethically edit it, your discourse will be deleted in return, because by making impossible to challenge your discourse you turn <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> into your private tool for soapbox, promotion, bragging or whatever, and this goes against WikiSpirit.
