        I heard the late MaoTseTung (ChairmanMao) once said something of this nature:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Rumours told a thousand times becomes the Truth</em>
      </p>

        <em>Mao's aphorism is different (and closer to Rovian politics). Tom refers to the same guy repeatedly saying the same things in different ways. Mao refers to viral memes that you hear from many sources, because the peasants have been taught to feel empowered by repeating it. Example: John </em>McCain is gay, and has a black love-child.<em></em>
