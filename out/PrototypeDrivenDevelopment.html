        Prototype Driven Development
      </h1>
      <p>
        During the process of developing and refining <a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a>, you can follow the Prototype-Driven Development pattern for building artifacts that are used to build confidence in the <a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a>. It is highly suggested that any code that is built during this process should never be copy & pasted into the application.
