        I'm interested in everything, so what can I say that's relevant here?
        Software design; the process of design; design vs evolution and their hybrids; evolution and learning; collaborative and ant-hill-like creation.  Security and modularity effects of language and system
        designs.

        I was a <a href="TedNelson.html">TedNelson</a> apprentice and a Xanadu project hanger-on.  From Ted I got the "outsider-insider"
        view on computers: user advocacy and distance from the status quo / party line / main paradigms, 
        combined with enthusiasm and insistence on delving into technical details; an appreciation for
        how the low level details percolate and ramify into outward qualities of systems; an awareness of
        the industry politics of the evolution of technologies.

        Xanadu's original code is open-sourced at <a href="http://udanax.com,">http://udanax.com,</a> and <a href="http://sunless-sea.net">http://sunless-sea.net</a> is a wiki
        about understanding and reimplementing the ideas.  Xu involves fine-grained bidirectional links,
        compositing, and versions, so that the whole "docuverse" would be somewhere between a Wiki (anyone can add comments to any part of anything) and the Web as a whole (each doc is still owned and controlled by an individual).  Wikis per se are interesting to me
        because they are set up so the readers and creators are the same sorts of people, seeing
        the same views.

        I'm more of an Alexander patterns guy (ethical / ideological / aesthetic / user-soul-liveability) than a GOF patterns guy. You might think Gabriel's "habitability" was a link between the two, but he's talking about habitability for programmers rather than users - exactly the reason most software is not Alexandrian.  (See <a href="SoftwarePatternsArentAlexanderPatterns.html">SoftwarePatternsArentAlexanderPatterns</a>.)
