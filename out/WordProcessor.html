        Word Processor
      </h1>
      <p>
        A program or machine that facilitates writing prose. -- <a href="WhiteHat.html">WhiteHat</a>

        Typically its goal is to help the user create good-looking printed pages, as opposed to files.

        Machine word processors are almost extinct.  Brother makes them, and they are all that's left. -- <a href="BlackHat.html">BlackHat</a>

        As far as programs go, the four best word processors of all time were <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a>, <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a>, XyWrite, and Emacs (<a href="CategoryEmacs.html">CategoryEmacs</a>). -- <a href="RedHat.html">RedHat</a>

        <em></em><a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a> was always one of my favorite word processors. Not because it was a good word processor - I never liked it for that. Rather, because of the white text on a blue background. Often when aligning video monitors, you need to see a solid patch of a single color. I wouldn't type a grocery list with <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a>, but as a program to generate a blue video field, it works great. -- <a href="JohnPassaniti.html">JohnPassaniti</a><em></em>

        <dd>Windows NT is good for producing a field of blue too. You might have to wait for 5 or ten minutes after booting to see it.  :-)</dd>

        I think the list of four above is open to rampant disagreement.

        Why on earth would I want to process words? I want to process <em>documents</em>. I want a tool that helps me organize and refactor documents, not make some bits of text different colours to others.

        I cut my teeth on <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> in the 80's when nothing else was available to do the job. You could save a straight ASCII text file with just two keystrokes. And using a keyboard to drive all functions kept my hands ready to do business. I discredited the mouse and lauded <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> for a long time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a> because I took a job in the late 80s teaching it at local vocational school. I would literally learn the night before what I needed to know the next day to teach it to the class. In the course of doing this, I learned to love <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a>. A few years later, I used version 5 in my job to write a minor book for governmental consumption. Actually, I used <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a> to crunch the text and show me where the changes were from other contributors. Then I'd ship it to the graphic artist using Pagemaker (I think) which could read native <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, I remember when my son was in High School in the late 90's learning programming. I went in to check up on him. He was typing nearly the same text over & over. Just on a whim, I had him put the cursor up at the beginning of the block and hit Control-KB. It took it. I had him mark the end of the block with the similar <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> command. Then I showed him how to cut & paste the block where he wanted it. He felt I was a genius and to this day wonders how I could have known that about a programming tool he knew better than I did. :^)

        I STILL have multiple copies of <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> on 5 & 1/4" floppies in cabinets at home. What do I miss most? Column mode. I wish the inventors of vi & other tools could be made to understand the essential nature of column mode.

        I'll refactor this later. I had to get it out for now though. -- <a href="TerryLeeMoore.html">TerryLeeMoore</a>
