        Xp Game
      </h1>
      <p>
        A simulation of XP iterations, developed by VeraPeeters and PascalVanCauwenberghe
      </p>
      <p>
        In three fun iterations, you learn about and use: <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s, estimating, the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>, Velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stories to implement are simple games - inflating balloons, building a house of cards, rolling dice for particular numbers - so that both developers and business people can join in the fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole game (including discussions and debriefings) lasts between 90 and 120 minutes.

        <a href="BobPayne.html">BobPayne</a> ran this game for the <a href="WashingtonDcAreaXpUsersGroup.html">WashingtonDcAreaXpUsersGroup</a> at our February 2002 meeting - it went over really well. If you think you really know XP well, you might be surprised by what you learn playing the customer role, or trying to estimate tasks with a large random component, or facing a task where you really just do need the specialist to work on it alone (we had a house-of-cards ringer).

        By the way, to distinguish it from the other XP games out there, Bob called it "the <a href="BalloonGame.html">BalloonGame</a>". -- <a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>
