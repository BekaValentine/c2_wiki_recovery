        I like this analogy a lot.  This also points to the dark side of Nomadic tribes -- for instance there are tribes who are like the Plains Indians (Native Americans?) who simply follow the buffalo (aka projects) wherever they go, add their own value, and leave quietly without a trace.  Unfortunately, there are also marauding tribes like Huns or Vikings, who come in, murder and pillage, and leave after taking everything of value.  I would tend to lump many Big Four accounting firms in this second group...

        I met a bunch of 5 VB programmers who had formed a <a href="NomadicTribe.html">NomadicTribe</a> and they seemed to be having a great time. If they were using a different language I might have asked to join them.

        Are there many <a href="NomadicTribe.html">NomadicTribe</a> s out there? Can anyone share their experiences of working in one? Is this a way to sidestep some of the more Dilbert-like issues you encounter as a programmer?
