        Reasons For Disagreements
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is an attempt to classify disagreement reasons, along with tips on working past impasses.

        <li>
           Disagree with Authority (<a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Too many variables - There are lots of metrics or evidence specimens, but the weights given to each is in dispute. (<a href="TooManyVariablesForScience.html">TooManyVariablesForScience</a>)

      <ul>
        <li>
           Miscommunication (dreadfully frequent; sometimes results in <a href="ViolentAgreement.html">ViolentAgreement</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Differing set of accepted axioms
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Differing priorities, especially if these are not recognised
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Personality clash (biggest and most frequent cause of all)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        When you find yourself arguing with someone, even though they are basically right, it is time to quit, because you really don't have a legit reason for the argument.  The real reason being, "you just don't like the guy".
