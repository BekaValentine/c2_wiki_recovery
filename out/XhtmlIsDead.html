        Xhtml Is Dead
      </h1>
      <p>
        XHTML is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not due to a failure to implement the standard but due to the fact the standard was misdesigned.
      </p>
      <p>
        See that XHTML's 1.0's claimed HTML 4.01 compatability was based on pure fiction as <br/> would actually place an angle bracket on the output page if parsed by a strict HTML 4.01 parser.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that is not what killed XHTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        XHTML is dead because HTML 5 is inherited directly from HTML 4.01 and does not use an XML parser.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Another issue: <script> print a & b </script>.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Due to the generation of kiddie programmers raised belting out thousands of lines of HTML in Notepad, a web browser does not have the luxury of expecting all scripted ampersands </em>'&<strong> to be escaped </strong>&amp;<em>'. Hence, ampersands must NOT be escaped, because the browser must not misinterpret them and double-escape them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hence, HTML and XML remain sibling languages, never to merge.</em>
