        Chiq Chaq
      </h1>
      <p>
        chiq_chaq is a <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> designed for easy localization and friendliness towards non-technical users. I wrote the server side in Perl, and my husband RoySharon did the client side (graphic design and DHTML/<a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>/CSS/XML/XSL stuff).

        <li>
           <em>There is rather a lot of </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and some IE-only stuff, which is unfortunate, but the basics are usable in most browsers and all the client-side stuff is templated so you can throw it away and sub your own.<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Actually the new version 1.5 works on Mozila 1.2 just fine.

        There's an active site in Hebrew at <a href="http://www.beofen-tv.co.il/cgi-bin/chiq.pl">http://www.beofen-tv.co.il/cgi-bin/chiq.pl</a> and a sample site in English at <a href="http://www.beofen-tv.co.il/cgi-bin/chiq.pl?group=eng.">http://www.beofen-tv.co.il/cgi-bin/chiq.pl?group=eng.</a> The source is available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/chiqchaq/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/chiqchaq/</a> .

        BTW, in Hebrew <em>chiq-chaq</em> means "quickly"...

               This might be an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, creating more <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> and less careful contribution. Please let us know what happens.

               <em>I don't think chiq_chaq is any more or any less messy than other wikis. It seems some people only edit what they themselves wrote, and others take more responsibility and refactor and summarize threaded pages. I think this is not so much a technological issue as a sociological one.</em>

               With a bit more development/hacking, this feature could make it a nice wiki/forum hybrid. I'm thinking of rolling it out for a particular site such that anyone can Add but only the site owner can Edit. This is probably anathema to "proper" Wikizens but I bet a lot of sites would go for it. However the features aren't adequate yet for this purpose.

               I don't agree that it is an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>.  I think <a href="WikiUserInterface.html">WikiUserInterface</a> could use some more patterns.  After all isn't the "add comment" feature, just an affordance to the general wiki custom of adding a horizontal line and a comment. -- <a href="SarahAllen.html">SarahAllen</a>
