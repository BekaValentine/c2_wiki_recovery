        I met <a href="BobStout.html">BobStout</a> on <a href="FidoNet.html">FidoNet</a>'s C_ECHO when I was cutting my teeth. He was one of the many JediMasters who trained me in the art of JediProgramming. Or, in other words, they taught me most of what I know about programming.

        His most important contribution to everyone else is The SNIPPETS Archive, which is a repository of extremely useful code snippets of almost anything you could think of.
      </p>
      <p>
        The archive as well as Bob live at <a href="http://www.snippets.org.">http://www.snippets.org.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly, in recent days, he has passed the archive onto a group of volunteers. Hopefully it can be resurrected.

        Bob Stout did not write the code, others wrote it.  Bob is an arrogant blowhard.
