        Impatience Problem

      <p>
        The <a href="ImpatienceProblem.html">ImpatienceProblem</a> on this wiki is where someone has an idea and starts to implement it. They do some and then take a break for any or all of sleep, food, work etc. In the meantime it becomes a deletion candidate in the mind of someone else.

        This is compounded by the 24 hour interval between indexing runs.

        <em>It's been avoided "sometimes" when individual leaves notes explaining what they have planned and what they are doing.  But, even then, I have to admit, someone may not agree and then takes a </em>'psycho-commando-rule-all-in-mad-mood<em>' approach and undo all of said work.  I guess if have long project in mind, don't sleep until it's done, then maybe it will be too much work for others to bother to undo?</em>

        There is also the TimeZoneAnomaly where we sleep at different times of the day to each other.
