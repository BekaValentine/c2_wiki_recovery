        Long Lists Smell
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am bothered by software that displays long lists of titles and expects one to read each one to find what they are looking for. Some people have a speed-reading gift. I don't. If the list is more than about 15 items, then there should be an way to search for substrings.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, back in the old days, a clever character based text interface to a file/directory listing went something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        Welcome to the XYZ file system.<br/>
        Enter substring: foo<br/>
        Results:<br/>
        A - Foofoo and the fooman<br/>
        B - After the afro craze, the afoo<br/>
        C - The new silverware hybrid, the "foon"<br/>
        Type a letter: C   [Enter-key is not required. Esc. to start over]<br/>
        ...editor starts up...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If the search term is not specific enough to narrow it down to 15 or so results, then you are given the chance to offer more criteria such as a longer phrase or Boolean operators.
      </p>
      <p>
        A GUI-based listing could have a drop-down-list at the top with options such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Starts with
        </li>
        <li>
           Ends with
        </li>
        <li>
           Contains
        </li>
        <li>
           Contains word
        </li>
        <li>
           (etc...)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The same search term box stays in place such that if you get too many or too few terms, you can re-edit the existing string and try again. Unlike <a href="IncrementalSearch.html">IncrementalSearch</a>, this is easy to implement in most GUI engines.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least with browser-based interfaces, one can do an "Edit, Find". But dedicated GUI's often don't have such an option.
      </p>
      <p>
        --top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Every application needs </em><a href="IncrementalSearch.html">IncrementalSearch</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't see how this is useful for multiple matches or if you don't know where in the result the sub-string is. It is just a "starts with" above and not equivalent to the other comparitors. Plus it may jump around the list making it hard to see the context.
