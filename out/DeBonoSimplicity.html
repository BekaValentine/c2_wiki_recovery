        De Bono Simplicity
      </h1>
      <p>
        His ten rules of simplicity are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You need to put a very high value on simplicity
        </li>
        <li>
           You must be determined to seek simplicity
        </li>
        <li>
           You need to understand the matter very well
        </li>
        <li>
           You need to design alternatives and possibilities
        </li>
        <li>
           You need to challenge and discard existing elements
        </li>
        <li>
           You need to be prepared to start over again
        </li>
        <li>
           You need to use concepts
        </li>
        <li>
           You need to break things down into smaller units
        </li>
        <li>
           You need to be prepared to trade off other values for simplicity
        </li>
        <li>
           You need to know for whose sake the simplicity is being designed
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        On page one he says something like, "Simplicity is one of the four key values." Then he never lists the values. I couldn't find them with <a href="AltaVista.html">AltaVista</a> either. Does anyone know his four values?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Perhaps that's why its so simple...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        And I thought it was just one thing...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        From <a href="ExtremeValues.html">ExtremeValues</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Communication
        </li>
        <li>
           Simplicity
        </li>
        <li>
           Feedback
        </li>
        <li>
           Aggressiveness
        </li>
      </ul>

        You mean the identity of the mysterious FourthMan behind <a href="TheThreeExtremos.html">TheThreeExtremos</a> is about to be revealed?  I think we should be told ...
