        Super Mario Three
      </h1>
      <p>
        A sequel to SuperMarioBros.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first of the Mario games to allow the player to select the order in which they play levels through the use of a map.  Also seems to contain the widest variety of "permanent" power-ups.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mushroom: Doubles Mario's height, as do all powerups.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fire Flower: Turns Mario yellow, at which point he can spit bouncing fireballs, as in the original SuperMarioBros.
        </li>
        <li>
          Racoon Leaf: Gives Mario a cute little racoon tail and ears, and allows him limited flight with a long running start.
        </li>
        <li>
          P-Wing: Same as Racoon Leaf, but rarer, and through the course of one level, he doesn't need a running start to fly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Frog Suit: Mario can swim much better, and can jump higher, but his land movement is a little more awkward.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tanooki Suit: Full-body racoon suit.  Mario gets the same limited flight, and the ability to temporarily turn into an invulnerable statue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hammer Suit: Helmet, tan skin back plate and hammers to throw. This Suit can only be found in the 7th world, or with Game Genie!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course, the last three such power-ups are super-rare and non-renewable, and if an enemy touches you just once, you lose that nifty power-up ability until, or unless, you find another one.

        Apparently, the most sold game in history, achieving more than 40 millions of cartridges sold.
