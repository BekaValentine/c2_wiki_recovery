        Composition Fallacy
      </h1>
      <p>
        The fallacy of composition is the following: X is good for me, therefore it would be good if X happened for everyone. Or X is good for everyone, therefore X will be good for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The second example is not actually a fallacy, of course. The premise may be false, but the logic is sound.</em>

        Would that depend upon whether 'everyone' is used in the collective sense (the group) or meaning 'every individual'?<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        An example of this is the invention of computers. It was not good for individuals, specifically individuals who made type writers.

        I win the lottery, that is good, everyone should win the lottery. Incorrect, if everyone won the lottery, the pay-out would be pennies.

        <em>Why is it called </em><a href="CompositionFallacy.html">CompositionFallacy</a>? I call it TotalizationFallacy. And isn't this a specialization of <a href="OverSimplification.html">OverSimplification</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most fallacies are specializations of oversimplification. And it's called the composition fallacy because its formulation is actually "a property of a substance is also a property of the composite that includes that substance". As in, hydrogen and oxygen are both gases, therefore H2O must be a gas. Or this one that I've actually seen defended; a relationship governed solely and principally by pure power is evil, hence a relationship governed principally by justice and backed by power is also evil. What you call totalization is just a special case of composition.
