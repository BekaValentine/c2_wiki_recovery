        Oop Is Fluff
      </h1>
      <p>
        Let's use the "shapes" example, to see what OOP's big mistakes are:
      </p>
      <p>
        In Erlang:
      </p>
      <code>
        -module(shapes).<br/>
        -export([area/1]).<br/>
        area({rectangle,X,Y}) -> X*Y;<br/>
        area({circle,R})  -> R*R*3.14.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In Ruby:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Rectangle<br/>
        def initialize(x,y)<br/>
        @x = x<br/>
        @y = y<br/>
        end<br/>
        def area<br/>
        @x*@y<br/>
        end<br/>
        end<br/>
        class Circle<br/>
        def initialize(r)<br/>
        @r = r<br/>
        end<br/>
        def area<br/>
        3.14*(@r**2)<br/>
        end<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Let's say I want to add perimiter/circumference to the shapes.  In the Ruby example, I have to do this: 
      </p>
      <code>
        class Circle<br/>
        def perim<br/>
        2*3.14*@r<br/>
        end<br/>
        end<br/>
        class Rectangle<br/>
        def perim<br/>
        2*(@x+@y)<br/>
        end<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It would be worse in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> because you would have to open up the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Erlang:
      </p>
      <code>
        -module(shapes2). <br/>
        -export([perim/1]).<br/>
        perim({circle,R}) -> 2*3.14*R;<br/>
        perim({rectangle,X,Y}) -> X+Y+X+Y.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If Erlang did not require modules, it would be even better.
        Which changes more, Features or Shapes?  In most domains the answer would be Features.
      </p>
      <p>
        STATE IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL.
      </p>
      <p>
        State is a bad thing for 3 reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           state makes concurrency difficult
        </li>
        <li>
           it makes reasoning about code difficult
        </li>
        <li>
           it increases coupling.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Hidden State is doubly bad.  It makes code that looks fine act strangely when you are mutating state, and you can't figure it out because you can't access the variable(s).
      </p>

        <em>I think the author of this document has some sort of frustrations but hasn't a clue how to communicate them.  Does he wish to </em><a href="KillMutableState.html">KillMutableState</a>?  Or does he just object to the concept that 'circles' and 'squares' should be considered objects instead of geometric values.  Personally, I agree on the latter, but I recognize that these circles and squares are useful for education.<em> --db</em>
