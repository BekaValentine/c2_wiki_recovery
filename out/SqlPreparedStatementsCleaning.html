        Sql Prepared Statements Cleaning
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a topic to clean up the <a href="SqlPreparedStatements.html">SqlPreparedStatements</a> topic by describing both sides of the argument without the personal insults. It may be renamed when cleaning is completed and consensus reached.

        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> mission is to be much more a good resource for the reader, than to be a intellectual sex toy in support for Top's <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>. In other words, if some novice software engineer wants to read about a topic like <a href="SqlPreparedStatements.html">SqlPreparedStatements</a>, he should be entitled to view the current best practices, rather than a horrendous <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> whose only purpose it to make Top feel good about his own level of ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
        You've been accommodated with <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>, ignorance and trolling, and what have you, but now you are asking more than what you're entitled to. be happy that you have a <a href="TopOnPreparedStatements.html">TopOnPreparedStatements</a> and all kinds of TopOnXxx kind of pages, and those pages are referred. If whatever fans you have left out there find your <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> and trolling convincing, they'll still have easy access. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        <em></em>CleanDontDelete - I agree that threadmess is not pleasant. But let's rework the arguments instead of KILLING IDEAS. That is why this topic is here.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonsense. Work your <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> all you want on <a href="TopOnPreparedStatements.html">TopOnPreparedStatements</a>, nobody killed any of your ideas.

        <em>I don't like that title. If you can show a majority vote, I will live with it though. Otherwise, what is wrong with say "</em>PreparedStatementDiscussion"?<em></em>

      <p>
        Why, are you afraid of your own brand, TOP? The thing is you're arguing alone against everybody (and against best practices) and arguing from ignorance, cause you just don't know stuff. Anything you need to know and you're <a href="ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof.html">ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof</a> about it, is easily reachable should you bother to find out.
      </p>
      <p>
        A "majority vote"? Wasn't enough for you that nobody gave any weight to your argumentation?
      </p>
      <p>
        How about if nobody contributes to this page from here onward and you'd be left talking to yourself? After all, it's nobody's responsibility to help you out from the corner you out yourself into by arguing from ignorance. And you can exit easily: just go and read about it.

        <strong>Scenario</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A complex query may have several clauses. Under solution 1 each clause can be appended using self-rolled API's such as:
      </p>
      <code>
        clauseB = clauseB . ' title= ' . sqlString(workingTitle);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (dot means string append. Some langs can use ".=" to simplify syntax.)
