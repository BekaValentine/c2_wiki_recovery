I seldom do any object-oriented programming, although in July of 1998 I was writing a Java program to emulate a robot while trying to apply all those <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> techniques I had just learned by happening onto patterns and this Wiki. This software consists of a whole whopping 1900 lines of code with 83 tests in 21 files (30 classes total).

I am an INXP on the <a href="MyersBriggs.html">MyersBriggs</a> scale.
