        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In design or code reviews, no one really understands the design but reviewers are unwilling to admit it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any criticism is quashed by other reviewers who claim understanding and consequently gain a feeling of superiority.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Context and Forces</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Peer Review is seen as a milestone to pass before development can continue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Too much negative feedback can delay development and effect project timescales.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Proposed Solution (the bad one)</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make design process and procedure idiot-proof to prevent developers making mistakes next time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Down-play complaints about over complexity or lack of abstraction because changes can be postponed until the next stage of development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Effort required to make major changes at this stage has a huge effect on project timescales. Consequently leave it as it is - it won't be as bad next time!
        </li>
        <li>
          Define design or coding standards with a set of clear rules that can be tested against to simplify the peer review process and minimise non-constructive feedback.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You cannot develop an idiot-proof process - a good process depends on good developers to execute it  (see <a href="IdiotProofProcess.html">IdiotProofProcess</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Delaying serious problems will lead to more serious ones (see ImplementationIssue).
        </li>
        <li>
          Checking only against standards will mean any updates to design or code is simply cosmetic.
        </li>
        <li>
          All of these leaves us with a poor design which means:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Requirements may be left unmet
            </li>
            <li>
              Major problems are missed
            </li>
            <li>
              Difficult decisions are left to the implementers
            </li>
            <li>
              Coders ignore or abandon design
            </li>
            <li>
              Design will have served no purpose
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Design Rationale</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identify different people who:
          <ul>
            <li>
              have good analysis and design skills
            </li>
            <li>
              can define good abstractions
            </li>
            <li>
              have good implementation skills
            </li>
            <li>
              or are subject matter or user experts
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Hold regular brainstorming sessions with these people to refine requirements and/or develop the design.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change organisation to promote day to day coaching of those less experienced.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adopt and/or develop simple, clear notations that are more understandable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change focus so that formal reviews are a just a small part of the quality process.
        </li>
      </ul>
