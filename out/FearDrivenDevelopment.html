        I see a couple of possibilities here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Characterizes a software development process that attempts to forestall mistakes during coding by moving at a snail's pace, producing, double-checking, and re-triple-checking lots of paper artifacts, before producing any actual working software.  In essence, being so afraid of making mistakes that you end up not producing anything at all.
        </li>
        <li>
           Characterizes a software development process that attempts to wring productivity out of its participants by instilling in them fear of losing their jobs.  Often part of <a href="HeroCulture.html">HeroCulture</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I have seen the second of these at work.  Often accompanied by exhortations to "keep on crankin'", we came to call this style <a href="CrankDrivenDevelopment.html">CrankDrivenDevelopment</a>.

        Some of what you are thinking about may also be found at <a href="WorryDrivenDevelopment.html">WorryDrivenDevelopment</a> (<a href="HaHaOnlySerious.html">HaHaOnlySerious</a>). Cheers, --<a href="JasonNocks.html">JasonNocks</a>

        <a href="FearDrivenDevelopment.html">FearDrivenDevelopment</a> (FDD) could also be when you have an amount of <a href="LegacyCode.html">LegacyCode</a> and maintaining the code is hard because you don't know what unintended effects your changes have. When there is high coupling, changing method A suddenly made method B stop working and maybe that wasn't discovered until the code was deployed. A few live defects/bugs like that and you're suddenly practising FDD.
