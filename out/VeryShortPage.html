        Very Short Page
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="VeryShortPage.html">VeryShortPage</a> is a page which contains very little information--just a one or two sentence description/definition(s) of the topic (if the content is relevant to the topic at all!).  Most such pages are probably good <a href="DeletionCandidate.html">DeletionCandidate</a>s, as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiIsNotaDictionary.html">WikiIsNotaDictionary</a>.  Pages which define terms and add little other value probably aren't beneficial.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiIsNotYourBlog.html">WikiIsNotYourBlog</a>.  If you think <politician> is an idiot or <artist> is a hack, stating so on a page all its own isn't beneficial either.
        </li>
        <li>
           Any page whose content isn't relevant to its title should be deleted or <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a>ed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the other hand:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Organic growth implies that large pages grow from small ones; it would be a shame if a possibly-interesting page were snuffed in its infancy on the grounds of being a <a href="VeryShortPage.html">VeryShortPage</a>.  Deletion on this grounds should only occur after a significant period of no activity.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some pages are necessarily short--pages which refer to resources outside the Wiki; pages which redirect to other pages (to deal with the <a href="WikiNamePluralProblem.html">WikiNamePluralProblem</a>), etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
