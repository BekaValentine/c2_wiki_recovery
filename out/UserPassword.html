      <p>
        The <a href="UserPassword.html">UserPassword</a> does not use administrative level privilege. Defects in an application configuration will not prey upon the administrative level privilege by misconduct events.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="UserPassword.html">UserPassword</a> is not stored in an easily copied way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="UserPassword.html">UserPassword</a> encryption method is not reversible; ABC ROT1 = BCD; BCD un-ROT1 = ABC
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="UserPassword.html">UserPassword</a> choice cannot be successively guessed in less than 2 hours work. Note: a Pentium 4 can easily achieve 1,000,000 guesses per second; 2 hours work is 7,200,000,000 guesses. Most language dictionaries are less than 100,000 words.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="UserPassword.html">UserPassword</a> can be changed by an authorized authority without crashing the application. Thus, the password updates will not be avoided by systems administrators for years because of service crashing fears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mis-entry of the <a href="UserPassword.html">UserPassword</a> will not create a permanent lockout condition. Short duration lockouts are often sufficient to prevent brute force attacks. Long duration lockouts enable denial control attacks that lock up all accounts.
