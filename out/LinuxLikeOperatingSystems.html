        Linux Like Operating Systems
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="EricRaymond.html">EricRaymond</a> used to say that linux was a unix like operating system.  Then the owners of Unix tried to bully him, so he switched to saying that unix was a linux-like operating system.  In this day and age, this seems to make more sense to average people anyway.  I mention unix, they have no clue what I'm talking about.  I mention linux and they have a vague idea.
