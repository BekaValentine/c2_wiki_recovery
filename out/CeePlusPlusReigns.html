        Cee Plus Plus Reigns
      </h1>
      <p>
        For modern non-web applications, C/C++ (<a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a>) remains the standard.  See <a href="ProgrammingLanguagePopularity.html">ProgrammingLanguagePopularity</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ah, </em><a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>. Many people consider it a pathology of the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> community that they write so much C/C++, often on the spurious grounds of "portability".<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Actually, much <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> code is in other languages, such as <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, or <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a>.  The <a href="FreeSoftwareFoundation.html">FreeSoftwareFoundation</a> still recommends using <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> (with extensibility provided by <a href="GuileScheme.html">GuileScheme</a>, <a href="RichardStallman.html">RichardStallman</a> being a <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> old-timer before becoming a <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> advocate).  <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> is becoming quite popular as an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> language.  The languages which <em>don't</em> have much open-source mindshare (Smalltalk being a key example) are the ones which are expensive to acquire (or were so until recently), or which are widely considered <a href="BondageAndDisciplineLanguage.html">BondageAndDisciplineLanguage</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>
           Yes. Much software is written in other languages, but the dominant language for <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> is still C/C++. I don't know what point you are trying to make. (See <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a>)

        Possible causes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Usual bias against whatever language/company/product is the current standard.

           Confusion about the roles of compiled vs <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>s
        </li>
        <li>
           No language support (except for third-party libraries) for many domain-independent problems: graphics, networking, concurrency, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Low-level programming model introduces many classes of defects (<a href="WildPointer.html">WildPointer</a>s, for instance) simply not found in other languages
        </li>
        <li>
           Performance optimizations inherent in the language (or most implementations) make incremental or separate deployment of code problematic (see <a href="FragileBinaryInterfaceProblem.html">FragileBinaryInterfaceProblem</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           No reflection or introspection in the language.
        </li>
        <li>
           Strong preference for <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a> found on this Wiki
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At this point it is impossible to discount <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> or even claim it is dying.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe this is due to <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>'s strongest point: It is the best fit (and most common) in the role of balancing high-level abstractions with low-level bit twiddling.

        Argg. Please don't let it become that. The point here is that <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> reigns, not because it's great, but because it's optimally ungreat.

        <em>I agree, </em><a href="CeePlusPlusReigns.html">CeePlusPlusReigns</a>... in the domain of static monoliths coded in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>. Oh my, that's circular. Yup.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Could you elaborate on static monolith? Do you mean <a href="LegacyCode.html">LegacyCode</a>, independent applications, or code that is difficult to refactor?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Most common "foundational" applications are written in <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a>: <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a>, bsd, <a href="WindowsOs.html">WindowsOs</a>, <a href="MicrosoftOffice.html">MicrosoftOffice</a>, iis, apache, samba, gnome, <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a>, <a href="OracleDatabase.html">OracleDatabase</a>, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though many business applications are coded in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a>, etc., it is difficult to imagine C/C++ not reigning till these foundations start being written in other languages. Nothing else seems to be efficient enough.

        My understanding is that most OSes were written in <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>. (VaxOs, CP/M, <a href="MsDos.html">MsDos</a>, ProDOS, <a href="MicrowareOsNine.html">MicrowareOsNine</a>, etc.) My understanding that the most *popular* OSes today (2004) are currently written in mostly C (not even C++ !).
      </p>
      <p>
        (For example, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (right?) wrote the original <a href="UnixOperatingSystem.html">UnixOperatingSystem</a> in PDP-11/20 <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>, then rewrote it in C in 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the conversion from assembly language to C was such an amazing success (and has a huge influence on computer architecture: most modern CPUs have been optimized for running C programs), some people wonder about writing an OS in some other language. How would the size (There is <a href="NoSuchThingAsSize.html">NoSuchThingAsSize</a>) of the <a href="SourceCode.html">SourceCode</a> depend on which language it was written in? How would computer architecture be different today if a different language had become dominant?
      </p>
      <p>
        An OS built on <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, Inferno, or some other dynamic programming language [<a href="DynamicProgramming.html">DynamicProgramming</a>??] wouldn't need a MMU. If any of those languages had become the dominant language (rather than C), computers would not have MMUs.

        Some are fascinated with the idea of an operating system built atop a dynamic <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>. Does such a thing already exist? It depends what you consider an operating system. Emacs qualifies for some, though it relies on a host operating system to do the low-level bit pushing. Squeak is usually the same, though there are versions of Squeak that run on bare metal. In that case, though, most of the low-level work is done in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>. Some implementations of <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> probably qualify, having <a href="DeviceDriver.html">DeviceDriver</a>s and all operating system functions (such as they are) implemented in Forth itself. ---- <em>It does depend partly on how much of the OS core has to be </em><a href="HighLevelLanguage.html">HighLevelLanguage</a> to qualify. On one extreme would be systems where the user-space interface is the runtime of a HLL but all the kernel code is in C/assembler/whatever; on the other extreme are systems where every iota of kernel code is HLL. I suspect that SqueakNOS is actually a lot closer to the latter end of that range (modulo VMWare).<em></em>

        Wait a minute... what the heck is C/C++? (See <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a>) There is no language of that name.  Taking another look at <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>, oh, it seems <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> actually reigns.  Possibly because it is the '<a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>' of <a href="UnixOs.html">UnixOs</a>. ---- <em>C was more the </em><a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> of Unix, oriented to systems programming and "serious" applications work. The original <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a> of Unix was, well, shellscript. <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> became the first modern scripting language when it gained the ability to replace shell in that role.<em></em>

        <em>Looking at the 2005 figures at </em><a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/matsh?entry=java_history_was_made_today">http://www.jroller.com/page/matsh?entry=java_history_was_made_today</a> , <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> together dominate Sourceforge, with roughly equal project numbers.

        Any real language is going to be <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a>, and <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>s definitely fill a different role than "applications". <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> doesn't do high level easily and <a href="PowerBuilder.html">PowerBuilder</a> doesn't do low level easily, and I often wonder what the proper balance for a language is. I don't know anyone that claims <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is some kind of ultimate grand language, and everyone can name a worse language... for any category. The nice thing about languages & standards is there are so many to pick from (see: <a href="AndrewTanenbaum.html">AndrewTanenbaum</a>).
