        I am very pleased to have one of these, from the old days. The thing people don't understand about us UnixWeenies is summed up, from our point of view, in this borrowed phrase. Unix isn't perfect, but it is freedom. All other operating systems before and since are fascist bondage and discipline "you can't get there from here" systems, no matter what individual nice features they have, or (these days) how flashy their GUI.
      </p>
      <p>
        We value freedom, thus "Live free or die!"
