        <dd>OOPSLA is the premier forum for bringing together practitioners, researchers, and students to share their ideas and experiences in a broad range of disciplines woven with the common thread of object technology. It is a well integrated collage of events, including outstanding invited speakers, carefully refereed technical papers that will be archived in the ACM Digital Library, real world experiences in the form of practitioner reports, exciting panels, topic focused workshops, late-breaking demonstrations, and an interactive posters session. In addition to offering the most comprehensive tutorial program, OOPSLA also offers symposia specifically designed for educators and for doctoral students in the field of object technology. For those who enjoy informal discussions on specific but related topics, OOPSLA provides facilities to hold birds-of-a-feather sessions, and organizes plenty of social opportunities for mingling and professional networking throughout the conference. Such a variety of activities make OOPSLA the conference of choice for a broad range of professionals: from recognized academics to undergraduate students, from industrial researchers to technical developers and managers, and from technology gurus to users.</dd>
