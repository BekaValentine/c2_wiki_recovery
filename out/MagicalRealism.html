        Magic realism is realist, mimetic writing which contains fantastic elements. <em>Shame</em> is a particularly good example: it concerns the history surrounding a military coup in Pakistan, but as well as power-hungry generals, corrupt bureaucrats and the odd noble hero, it has one character, a general's daughter, who runs off into the countryside and devolves into a beast, hypnotizing crowds of men and tearing their heads off. The juxtaposition of the completely real and the completely unreal is seamless and shocking, and cannot be dismissed as a detail, as it is crucial to the resolution of the story.

        <em>My mom handed me down the book </em>Towards the End of Time<em> by John Updike. It was readable but not earthshaking. But now I understand his special effects gimmicks were following a named genre. If I could be disillusioned about JU's prowess, I would be now. >sigh< -- </em><a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a><em></em>

        You know this kind of stuff would probably be better off on <a href="BookShelved.html">BookShelved</a>. <em>as would all book and author references</em>

        I think that would require at least a pact between Ward and Laurent regarding page transplants.
