        Would it be awful to make an all-cap-word a valid <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>? If I want a page about PDAs, I don't want to have to do something silly like write it as PdA. -- <a href="BillSeitz.html">BillSeitz</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Except that doesn't work, since you need a lowercase letter after each capital letter. The real page for PDAs would have to be something more like PeeDeeAy.  But then you start running into pronunciation aliasing. The better name would probably be <a href="PersonalDigitalAssistant.html">PersonalDigitalAssistant</a> or <a href="PersonalDigitalAssistants.html">PersonalDigitalAssistants</a>. Wiki isn't very conducive to acronyms. -- <a href="GavinLambert.html">GavinLambert</a>

        It depends on your implementation. VQWiki uses backticks around a string to recognize <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> that are ALL CAPS or lowercase. I see nothing wrong with that - just about every keyboard has 'em, but people rarely use 'em. Acronyms are core to English, and the people who write wikis are likely to offer them to get people to use their wikis whether you think they should or not. If a wiki writer's regexp library is sophisticated enough to handle it, why not offer the ability to use a different method of creating <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>? 
      </p>

        Yes, it's possible. But is it desirable? One of the key points about <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> is that they actually make sense in isolation. So I can be reading a page, and see a reference to a <a href="PersonalDigitalAssistant.html">PersonalDigitalAssistant</a> and immediately understand what it is. If that was just "PDA" I might have to click on it to find out just what the heck that acronym stood for before it made sense in the context of the linking page. The same goes for other acronyms - which is easier to understand: OAOO or <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>? DTSTTCPW or <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>? -- <a href="GavinLambert.html">GavinLambert</a>

        I understand that the current way is very easy for writing comments, but it is still unreadable. Wiki's appear to be geared towards writers, and not so much towards readers. Wouldn't it be easy to display the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s with spaces before capitals? They are always links, so it shouldn't be too hard. Convert Spaces To Tabs would be easier on the eyes. -- Rhesa Rozendaal

        <a href="TwiciWiki.html">TwiciWiki</a> makes all-caps words into <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>; this started off as a side-effect of allowing single capitals in <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> (WikiNamesWithASingleCapital), but it was decided that it was a feature. Mostly, this is useful for acronyms. The idea that  forced expansion of acronyms is a good thing is a bit fishy; making acronyms into links doesn't stop people spelling things out when it's appropriate.

        Other wikis (Open Wiki) use doubled-up square brackets around the wiki name / identifier... so you can create a wiki link to anything you want.  Advanced wikis allow you to include edit text inside of the doubled-brackets, e.g. [[WikiKey|Link text that I want to see]]. -- TGH

        My questions is: how to make words in double-byte characters(such as Chinese) <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> ?
