        <dd>... Over the series, we shall seek to find answers to questions such as: What is the difference between a type and a class? What do we mean by the the notion of plug-in compatibility? What is the difference between subtyping and subclassing? Can we explain inheritance, method combination and template instantiation? Along the way, we shall survey a number of different historical approaches, such as subtyping, F-bounds, matching and state machines and seek to show how these models explain the differences in the behaviour of popular object-oriented languages such as Java, C++, Smalltalk and Eiffel. The series is titled "The Theory of Classification", because we believe that all of these concepts can be united in a single theoretical model, demonstrating that the object-oriented notion of class is a first-class mathematical concept!</dd>

        It hardly fits its billing of being "aimed specifically at non-theoreticians". Then again, it took a few decades to put <a href="DrCodd.html">DrCodd</a>'s ideas into plain English.

        <em>I agree that those articles rely on a basic understanding of a few concepts, however, this is the very foundation of what we do in OO. Its impossible to talk about types (or anything) without these kinds of definitions.</em>

        The article seems to solidify the set-based definitions already offered by some. If it is just a many-to-many table of potential operands and operators, then one should focus on sets, not "types". OO is not inherently a set-based paradigm. Besides, what exactly would such a definition lead to? The "weakness" of the implications of such assertion is described near the bottom of <a href="ThereAreNoTypes.html">ThereAreNoTypes</a>.

        The article states: <em>A mathematician considers a type as a set of signatures and constraining axioms. </em> I believe this is the notion that BetrandMeyer built on and extended.
