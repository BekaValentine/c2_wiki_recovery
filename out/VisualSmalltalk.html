        <a href="VisualSmalltalk.html">VisualSmalltalk</a> is a Smalltalk product now sold and maintained by Cincom.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was created by a company called Digitalk which then merged with <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a> in 1995. After an unsuccessful project to merge <a href="VisualSmalltalk.html">VisualSmalltalk</a> with <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a>, called Jigsaw, this product was end of life'd in a notorious 'suicide note' by <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a>-Digitalk management. However on the sale of the Smalltalk business to Cincom in 1999 a new point release version called <a href="VisualSmalltalk.html">VisualSmalltalk</a> 2000 was released by Cincom. Apart from patches no significant development has been done with this product since then.
