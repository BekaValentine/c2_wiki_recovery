        The Coach
      </h1>
      <p>
        As a naive summary, we have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> watches everything, sends obscure signals, makes sure the project stays Extreme. Sometimes the signals aren't obscure, but take the form of a <a href="BigVisibleChart.html">BigVisibleChart</a>. Helps with anything. Applies <a href="RolledUpNewspaper.html">RolledUpNewspaper</a> as required. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a>, to the extent that (s)he is carrying out <a href="ChiefArchitect.html">ChiefArchitect</a> roles, may need to assume all of the following roles: 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt>	<strong>Visionary</strong></dt>
        <dd>to formulate and communicate a vision of the goal that other developers can buy into and work towards.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	<strong>Glue Maker</strong></dt>
        <dd>supply a paradigm within which developers will work. Perhaps in the Smalltalk world this is just Smalltalk. However, even so there are many tools and approaches which a project should consider.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	<strong>Methodologist</strong></dt>
        <dd>choose which methodologies are suitable and communicate and adapt it to the business. Again, Smalltalk IS the core methodology, but there are many choices (and pitfalls) surrounding it.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	<strong>Mentor</strong></dt>
        <dd>normal projects involve people of varying skill levels and abilities. <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> helps the individuals with  less experience find directions to grow in that are relevant to the business and the project unfolding.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	<strong>Language Lawyer</strong></dt>
        <dd>Smalltalk is a nice simple language; today, its environment is a bear. And odd paradigms and extensions require judicious use <a href="OccamsRazor.html">OccamsRazor</a> (and <a href="OccamsEraser.html">OccamsEraser</a>) to keep a project in balance.</dd>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> needs to keep individuals on track with respect to the development paradigm: eXtreme Programming. This is a work of love. If you don't respect others, you're not doing it right. <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> get his respect to show through for people who try hard to do the right thing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> may need to use coercive means to corral the determined individualist back into the group. Ultimately, <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> must ask such an individual to leave, where no supportive contribution to group goals can be made by the individual.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Finally, <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> must regulate the healthy flow of ego as distinct from a group destructive one. Basically a designer, analyst, programmer should try to exclude destructive (self-centered) aspects of the ego and focus in a "pure" manner on the problems, requirements, and ideas of others. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The eXtreme Programming group has not done a thorough job of discussing the various roles necessary to do eXtreme Programming; what exists is in <a href="ExtremeRoles.html">ExtremeRoles</a>. It would seem important to understand these roles to properly steer (or survive) an <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> project, and (of substantial importance) to relate it to the roles and practices of other individuals (particularly management) in the customer's environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        One role, seemingly essential to eXtreme Programming (I had not previously understood prior to BOF in Vancouver) is that of <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a>. As a starting point, I did a search on the pages which refer to word "coach." They are here as a starting point, and I will attempt to annotate them as I understand the contents of each page.

        This covers it, as well as I can condense from the words of others. I would like to know what experiences projects espousing XP have had with <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a>. It should be noted that the above descriptions are written by (currently) an outsider, but one who is attempting (and whose project is attempting) to bring these approaches to bear in a large Smalltalk development project. For some alternative views, see particularly <a href="ArchitectAsKeeperOfTheFlame.html">ArchitectAsKeeperOfTheFlame</a>.

        <em>Merged from MissionOfXpCoach</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I discovered an unusual but accurate expression of the mission of an XP coach in (of all places) a compilation of greatest hits of the funk uber-group Parliament Funkadelic... :)
      </p>
      <code>
        Most of all get funky,<br/>
        Then help them find the funk.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I don't suppose FP (Funky Programming) would be any more accurate or less contentious a name than XP. But the funk, that relentless, organic, irresistible, rolling feeling when the entire band is really grooving, does feel a lot like XP when it works. 
      </p>
      <p>
        YMMV, of course.

        I just finished the second of my stints in this role.  I would like to add one more activity
        to the role.  I feel that <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> acts as an intermediary between the <a href="ExtremeProgrammer.html">ExtremeProgrammer</a> and management.
        One of the reasons that <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> can use the <a href="RolledUpNewspaper.html">RolledUpNewspaper</a> is that there is no danger of
        PermanentHarm to the programmer.  Having said that, the <a href="RolledUpNewspaper.html">RolledUpNewspaper</a> won't have any effect
        unless the programmers respect the coach.  <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> has no real power, only influence.  This leads
        me to believe that <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> must be the AlphaProgrammer of the group.  While I don't think it's
        possible to carry on the role of <a href="ExtremeProgrammer.html">ExtremeProgrammer</a> while being <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a>, all of the activities of the
        <a href="ExtremeProgrammer.html">ExtremeProgrammer</a> should be demonstrated by <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> at one time or another.  It is important that
        the programmers regard <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> as one of them (and not just another piece of ManagementBaggage).
