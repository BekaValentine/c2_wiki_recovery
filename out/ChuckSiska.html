        I've been programming for about 20 years doing too many
        kinds of things: operating systems, tools (assemblers &
        compilers & translators & debuggers & editors & version
        control), performance analysis, various AI subfields
        (mostly for aerospace), and games.  (But, I haven't done
        all of them well.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in too many things, and I don't
        devote enough time to any of them, I'm certain.

        I was led to patterns by Gabriel's Critic-at-Large
        articles, and while I may not buy into the realizability
        of a "<a href="TimelessWayOfBuilding.html">TimelessWayOfBuilding</a>" here on Earth, I 
        find that alexandrian patterns as discussed in GoF and elsewhere can
        reduce the complexity involved in understanding program
        designs.
