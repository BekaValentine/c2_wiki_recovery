        <strong>An Old Joke</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bill Gates, Andy Grove, and Jerry Sanders (Heads of <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>, Intel, and AMD, Advanced Micro Devices) were in a high-powered business meeting. During the serious, tense discussion, a beeping noise suddenly is emitted from where Jerry is sitting. Jerry says, "Oh, that's my beeper. Gentlemen, excuse me, I need to take this call." Jerry lifts his wristwatch to his ear and begins talking into the end of his tie. After completing this call, he notices the others are staring at him. Jerry explains, "Oh, this is my new personal communication system. I have an earpiece built into my watch and a microphone sewn into the end of my tie. That way I can take a call anywhere."
      </p>
      <p>
        The others nod, and the meeting continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five minutes later, the discussion is again interrupted when Andy starts beeping. He states, "Excuse me gentlemen, this must be an important call." Andy taps his earlobe and begins talking into thin air. When he completes his call, he notices the others staring at him and explains, "I also have a personal communication system. My earpiece is actually implanted in my earlobe, and the microphone is actually embedded in this fake tooth."
      </p>
      <p>
        The others nod, and the meeting continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five minutes later, the discussion is again interrupted when Bill emits a thunderous fart. He looks up at the others staring at him and says, "Somebody quickly get me a piece of paper... I'm receiving a fax!"

        Random fact I just learned: The "unknown contact" sillhouete from Outlook 2010 is taken from Bill's famous mug shot

      <p>
        I wonder if Bill directly approved this, or it was an inside joke that got "approved" by inaction to end it.
