        <strong>Keyword Blocking </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Used in software for blocking access
      </p>
      <p>
        Filtering packages which use keyword blocking have a list of 'forbidden words' which they search for in web pages, e-mail messages or even Internet Relay Chat and other 'chat' functions. If the software finds those words it will either prevent the user from accessing those e-mail messages or pages or block out the relevant sections of it. The list of 'forbidden words' may initially be set by the software provider although some filtering packages will allow additional words to be added by the software purchaser.

        Libraries are particularly interested in software having this feature. It is used in this context to shield minors from language and other content inappropriate for that age group.
