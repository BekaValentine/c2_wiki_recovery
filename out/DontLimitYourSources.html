           I recently read a Computer related article from the Wikipedia which had a disclaimer which indicated that no "reliable" sources were cited within the page. Even though such sources as the UN, ANSI, several governmental agencies and generally accepted practices since before the age of the microcomputer were mentioned and linked. This puzzled me. What "reliable" sources are referred to in the disclaimer? Since it seemed to me to be related to housekeeping and control of content, by whatever preservers of accuracy that presently exist, and which matched the content templates which seem to have evolved, rather than as an expression of the articles value, I did not thereby introduce the notion that the content might not be accurate or useful, or because it might not have been authored by "experts", so as to make it "reliable". I read the article, thought about what it said, and from that became aware of new concepts and ideas about the subject.

           I have always been inquisitive, considering ideas which are explained and presented in a form which makes them both understandable an reasonable, regardless of source. Thus, even though I might consider a topic as expressed by one of a religion not my own as having value such as to be practiced, I can also consider the expressions of those who have values which are not based on any religion foundation as also worthy of emulation. Before I was old enough to know much about such things, I had formed a notion of what seemed sensible, reasonable and fair. I had formed these notions as a result of seeing what people did and said, and observing the results. Even now that I have a religious persuasion which closely matches those early notions, I discover ideas and things which come from a wide variety of sources. I consider listening as a valuable and essential prerequisite to learning. As a result I have formed the conclusion that one can learn and accept things as valuable regardless of the "authority", "prestige", or "presentation position" its presenter occupies. I have chosen to be open to ideas, and to test their value in practical and reasonable fashion.

           <em>[I heartily agree with the notion of being open to ideas, regardless of source, and testing their value in practical and reasonable fashion. That is common sense. However, it's worth noting that any and all sources -- especially those in a scientific or engineering domain -- should be critically evaluated, and must be carefully examined to verify their claims. In particular, note whether or not they have been subject to formal peer review and independent, objective validation. Any claims -- no matter how reasonable-seeming -- that have not been validated through peer review and multiple, independent validations should be considered inherently more suspect than sources that have been peer-reviewed and independently validated. Otherwise, we are forced to consider sources purely on the basis of their reputation or the quality of their rhetoric, i.e., how convincing they </em>seem<em>. That is why many academic journals as regarded as inherently better sources than magazines and 'blogs, and why multiple, independent double-blind medical studies should generally be given more weight than a handful of anecdotal reports.]</em>

           The kind of ideas which I am referring to are those which are usually on the "bleeding edge", where there may be few who can be considered qualified as peers. I am sure that things such as Innovations, Inventions, new paradigms, departures from the cut and tried into new approaches and schemes which hold a very narrow to little chance of success, do not garner the attention, let alone the review of a significant number of those who could be considered experts or "peers". 
        </li>
        <li>
           Examples might include the personal computer, which began, not in the research laboratories of the experts, but in the dream spaces (garages) of visionaries with little support or resources. I wonder where computing would be today without such developments and developers who had a vision which was not the result of the peer-reviewed, academic, governmental, or corporately supported scholarly treatises and papers which are found in the majority of journals. Was Wiki and Wikipedia the result of ideas which received appropriate peer-review? Wiki has been successful even though the premise of free collaboration and cooperation with little limitation on who might participate would not have been advocated in an environment of "peers". 
        </li>
        <li>
           I am not minimizing the value of journals and peer-review, I am simply suggesting that there are other sources which are numerous as well as "free" and "open", which can result in developments which will be immediately useful and eventually valued by those who become new "peers".

There are those who are often much more concerned with their investment in considerable "surrounding education" which prohibits introduction of ideas which can not be made to mesh comfortably with ideas considered acceptable among "peers". Thus they either criticize or ignore them.

If you do that too much, you end up with, well, a bleeding Encyclopaedia.

           I appreciate all that has been said about conformity, vision, mission, establishment, verification, that articles be fitting and appropriate, and where enforcement of these limitations and other controls imposed by those who have accepted the challenge of monitoring content. In a publishing atmosphere these are the essential requirements that an "editor" imposes on authors. It would seem to me, if all of the above is applied with rigor, that the contribution base will be restricted to those who are "supported or sponsored" to be the maintainers and experts, and who will along with and in cooperation with their "peers", present topics of interest or related to what their environment may promote or make public, released in a manner required by those who sponsor them.

Unfortunately, those least able to critically distinguish sense from nonsense are often the ones most inclined to generate more rubbish, thus perpetuating a cycle of ever-growing rubbish-generation. The need to conform to restrictions and submit to peer review helps filter out the casual pundits and outright zagnuts, leaving (hopefully) those with a genuine commitment to professional knowledge generation.

Now, as it happens I am a pretty good mechanic and can apply both critical thinking and knowledge in that area, but I haven't a clue about (e.g.) quantum mechanics and couldn't tell a page of legitimate formulae from random gibberish.

        <li>
           first tried to apply the collaborative model to Nupedia, which was an encyclopedia where experts would write the articles for free and volunteer editors would be approved based on their credentials. But the hurdles to participation were so high, said Wales, that Nupedia failed. (Wales did not explain what he meant by hurdles to participation; presumably, he meant that professionals would not work for free.) Wales then came up with the idea of Wikipedia, an encyclopedia where anyone could write an article and anyone could be an editor, regardless of credentials. Wales’ great fear was that someone else would come up with the same concept and beat him to the punch. That did not happen.
        </li>
        <li>
           A critical question for a printed encyclopedia is what to include and what to exclude. Not so for Wikipedia, since it is online. Wales said that Wikipedia aims to be as comprehensive as possible, emphasizing that the space limitations imposed on hard-bound volumes do not constrict it. Wikipedia does have limitations, however. The main limitation is verifiability. Wikipedia is not a forum for original research and writing. It will only include articles that can be verified by references to other sources.
        </li>
        <li>
           Wales spent a great deal of time discussing how Wikipedia insures the accuracy of articles given that practically anyone at all can visit Wikipedia and change the content. He noted that, contrary to popular belief, the articles are not generated by millions of people adding one sentence at a time. What actually happens is that a small group of people, knowledgeable about a particular topic, generate an article, each person adding a substantial amount of text. This small group of people monitors the accuracy of what is written, each member of the group checking what other members write. The group also monitors, and corrects when necessary, the phrases or sentences added by a stray individual.
        </li>
        <li>
           Interestingly, Wales claimed that it was not difficult to insure and maintain the accuracy of articles on significant topics. That is because, for such topics, there is generally a dedicated group of volunteer editors continually monitoring what is being written. For less important matters, Wales conceded that it was a challenge to insure and maintain accuracy, since few people ever check what is written about them.

Consider searching via Google or other search engine. This is not an easy task, for it requires discrimination and time to filter what you find there. Consider many, not just a few of the references.

This will allow you to add to what you know the newly discovered pearls of wisdom, information and inspiration which often encourages more exploration.
