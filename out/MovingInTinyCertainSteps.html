        Some have used this phrase to describe how Science is done. Rarely are these steps in a straight line without retracement. This is part of the reason one does this. When making a step forward and finding unsure footing, one has not committed the center of gravity over the new step, but instead have kept that center over the departure location. It is only when the new footing has been verified as secure, that one shifts the weight forward.
