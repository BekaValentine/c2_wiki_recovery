        Design Patterns Are Hard
      </h1>
      <p>
        It is frustrating to get involved with learning <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty years ago IT applications worked fine without the use of these things.

      <p>
        Now it is like "fashion of the week", and they are hard to comprehend without the relevant <a href="CulturalAssumptions.html">CulturalAssumptions</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I was reading <a href="HollywoodPrinciple.html">HollywoodPrinciple</a>, it looked like some kind of pattern, track it down to <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> page, and it confirmed that this is a pattern. Then went to MF site as suggested. And then get hit by the word "Java" staring at me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I get intimidated. I do not want to know <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>. So is the page relevant to me still? Don't know. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I still have this book "Design patterns for <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>" or something similar. The software got obsoleted before I have gone thru much of the pages in that book. Very concerned that history repeats itself.

           years ago, building went up just fine without blueprints, standard-sized lumber, etc.  Fifty years ago, seatbelts were not even an option in vehicles.  We learn better ways of doing things, and <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> allow us to handle more complexity in software. --<a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>
