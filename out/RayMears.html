        Describe <a href="RayMears.html">RayMears</a> here.

        Ok, i'll start.  Survival Expert - that doesn't sounds right.  Known in the UK for survival programmes on BBC2 (hey, if Buffy has a page here, why not Ray :).

        There's something about these programmes, nothing to do with computer programming on an immediate level, but then neither does <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>.  Tonight he carved a spoon out of a log, one with a natural bend, so the grain of the wood reinforces the spoon: "very satisfying" as he said.  Watching him make fire, find food, cook and live in the woods, deserts, snow is so cool (at least for this city boy).  Maybe it's the respect he has for his environment, work with it or against it.  Or his ability to "read" the patterns, that we no longer recognise.  <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>?  The analogies are there.

        <em>Hmm. This reader finds him pretentious beyond belief</em>
        "you arse hole real big hole the guy is only seeming pretentious to you because you believe what you see to be basic knowledge, i question your abilities and your understanding of other peoples abilities- you my learned friend are a prick!"- says this reader
