        <em>Interesting. I am just looking at some of the </em><a href="NepomukKde.html">NepomukKde</a> tools available with the <a href="KayDesktopEnvironment.html">KayDesktopEnvironment</a>. My interest is in ways of developing and sharing metadata in my environment. Does this have any links with that?<em> -- </em><a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        Not intentionally.  Whether it's relevant, I think, depends on what you have in mind for developing and sharing metadata.  If you need the ability to draw and manipulate box-and-line drawings in Java, <a href="TomatoIde.html">TomatoIde</a> contains reusable tools for that, some of which I've easily re-used for a forthcoming edition of the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>.  However, as a tool in itself it's quite limited.  You can create Java programs (sort of) and edit them whilst they're running, which is oddly exhilarating but not particularly useful, though I do sometimes wonder if I've created something significant but lack the imagination to appreciate it.  (In 1992, I was shown the early Web and remarked that I didn't think it would catch on.)  Tomato is very tied to the Java environment, and is similar to <a href="BlueJay.html">BlueJay</a> in some respects.
