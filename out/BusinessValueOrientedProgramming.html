        Business Value Oriented Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="BusinessValueOrientedProgramming.html">BusinessValueOrientedProgramming</a> is another name for <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. <a href="BusinessValueOrientedProgramming.html">BusinessValueOrientedProgramming</a> focuses on three critical <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a>'s:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           SpeedToMarket -- Getting a product to market fast is a business value.
        </li>
        <li>
           ServiceToCustomers -- Getting what a customer wants to market has business value. 
        </li>
        <li>
           FastReactionToMarketChanges later on -- Being able to modify software quickly to meet changes in the market is a business value.  To do this, the code must be well designed. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When companies try to mix these business values in a project, they tend to gravitate toward one at the expense of the other two because these businesses values tend to require mutually exclusive actions. For example, if a company wants to have FastReactionToMarketChanges, they tend to do substantial up front design and analysis.  This cuts SpeedToMarket substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> solves these problems by having the programmers bend over backwards to set up their programming approach so that all these three business values can be met.  They do this by building the tests before the code, which is backward to the standard way of writing software. -- <a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>
