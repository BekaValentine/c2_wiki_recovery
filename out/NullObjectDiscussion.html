        Can some of the contributers help me refactor this page? The new comment on <a href="TheNilObject.html">TheNilObject</a> leads me to think some of this material should move to a new <a href="TheNilObjectDiscussion.html">TheNilObjectDiscussion</a> page. That, together with renaming this pattern "<a href="DummyObject.html">DummyObject</a>" or NotAnObject or <a href="DullObject.html">DullObject</a> -- almost anything other than <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a>. I see, on rereading this, that my own comments mostly resulted (I think) from my confusing NullObjectPattern with NilObjectPattern - and I've been convinced that they're different.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, <a href="TheNilObject.html">TheNilObject</a> page alludes to the role that NilObject (or anything like it) might play in a strongly typed language. I wonder if there might be hackery to make it work -- but if so, that belongs on a different page than this.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder if, with the NilObject stuff removed, the PatternFormerlyKnownAsNullObjectPattern might become much more interesting again.

        As I see it, "NULL" in C++ is not a type or subtype, it's a value. (<a href="NullValue.html">NullValue</a>)
        C++ lets you convert the NULL value to the value of a pointer to any type you wish, including pointers to objects.
        But when a C++ pointer contains the value NULL, it <strong><em>does not point to any object.</em></strong>
        Thus, you can't invoke messages on it.
        <em>(Doing so is </em>'undefined<em>' in the language -- and typically causes your program to crash.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In C++ you must check for NULL <strong>before</strong> sending a message, or risk program crash.
        Use of the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern relieves you of this inconvenience, by providing a valid pointer to an actual object to use, instead of a "NULL pointer."
        -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously NULL is a value that can be assigned to a pointer, and in that sense <a href="NullValue.html">NullValue</a> is right, but we can also think of it as a reference to an object and talk about that object's type. Its type conforms to every other type (including non-class types like int and float), and it implements every operation to have undefined behaviour. 
        (In relaxed English we sometimes use NULL to refer to the object, and sometimes to the pointer to the object; I hope this does not cause real confusion.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This notion is explicit in languages like Eiffel, and it fits in C++ as well as it can given C++'s broken type system. Obviously it may not be implemented that way - eg there may not be a real vtbl that contains an entry for every known function. That said, it <em>might</em> be implemented that way by a system which wanted to provide Java's <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> and didn't have hardware support. Do you see that this (a) would work and (b) would be permitted under the ISO standard? -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        The problems you outline seem to be caused by the use of untyped languages rather than strongly typed languages. The intent of the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern as I understand it, is to define different <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> classes for each base type, rather than use a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> class for more than one type. In the Shape example above, the Null_Shape class can only be used where a Shape type is expected. Each type hierarchy that uses the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern defines a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> class that knows how to act as "null" in the protocol defined by that type. For example, <a href="ImmutableList.html">ImmutableList</a> defines a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> class that acts as the tail of the list and responds to the "remove" and "forAll" methods appropriately.
      </p>

        In a strongly typed language it would not make sense to ask a NullZeetix if it is not a Foobar because the type system would check this at compile time. I'm assuming the Foobar and Zeetix are not related by inheritance or share a common base type. If they do, then they would both share a common <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> and there would be no need for the NullFoobar and NullZeetix classes.

      <p>
        The problems I describe are present whether or not the system is strongly-typed; the use of strong typing only moves the problem somewhere else (for example, parameterized collections). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your final paragraph has, in fact, circled back to the root of the problem (no pun intended). In a strongly-typed system in which both Zeetix and Foobar inherit from a common parent (let's call it ZeetixFoobar), and NullZeetixFoobar descends from ZeetixFoobar, what should NullZeetixFoobar>>isFoobar and NullZeetixFoobar>>isZeetix respond?
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, how shall Null<Anything> respond to "== Nil"?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Nil" (sometimes spelled NULL) is a very funny object; in LISP, it is the only entity that is both an Atom and a List.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is in the semantics, not the language.

      <p>
        The semantics of a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> are determined as much by the clients of the class as by the semantics of the class itself. A <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> is a subtype of a class. It is responsible for implementing the semantics of the class in a specialized circumstance, in this case the absence of an instance of that class. Different clients might require different behaviors from the non object. So you may define more than one <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> per class. As an overly simplified example you might have <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a>-s for some numerical types that act like zeros for purposes of addition and subtraction and like ones for purposes of multiplication and division. If you need to test for null you can inherit from a "Nullable" interface that has an isNull method in the base class, <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a>s would then respond "true" while other types would respond "false". This is the approach Doug Lea uses in his book on multithreaded programming in Java. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>

        You say: "<em>In a strongly-typed system in which both Zeetix and Foobar inherit from a common parent (let's call it </em>ZeetixFoobar), and NullZeetixFoobar descends from ZeetixFoobar, what should NullZeetixFoobar>>isFoobar and NullZeetixFoobar>>isZeetix respond?<em>"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the question should be why is the program querying the type of an object instead of using polymorphism? If one replaces conditionals on type with polymporphic messages declared as abstract in the base class, the NullZeetixFoobar object can implement those methods to perform appropriate "no-op" actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        To continue my shape example...
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of code doing something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        interface Shape {<br/>
        boolean isRectangle();<br/>
        boolean isCircle();<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void drawShape( Shape shape ) {<br/>
        if( shape == null ) return; // Check for null shapes<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        if( shape.isRectangle() ) {<br/>
        drawRectangle();<br/>
        } else if( shape.isCircle() ) {<br/>
        drawCircle();<br/>
        } ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        One defines the operations one wants to do to a shape in the Shape interface:
      </p>
      <code>
        interface Shape {<br/>
        draw( Graphics2D graphics_context ); // Draws the shape onto a device<br/>
        int getArea(); // Returns the area of the shape<br/>
        boolean containsPoint( Point2D p ); // Does the shape contain a point?<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now one draws the shape like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        void drawShape( Shape shape ) {<br/>
        if( shape == null ) return; // this will be replaced by the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern<br/>
        shape.draw( getGraphicsContext() );<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        All this is straightforward OO design, but then allows one to use the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern to avoid the check for null:
      </p>
      <code>
        class NullShape implements Shape {<br/>
        public void draw( Graphics2D g ) { /* Don't draw */ }<br/>
        public int getArea() { return 0; }<br/>
        public boolean containsPoint( Point2D p ) { return false; }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void drawShape( Shape s ) {<br/>
        s.draw( getGraphicsContext() );<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Thus, in a similar way that polymorphism removes the need for "isFoobar" tests, the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern removes the need for "== null" tests. Indeed, you should never have a null reference within a data structure that uses <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern works well as long as the base type (Shape in this example) defines all the operations one would wish to apply to a Shape. However, if this is not the case, one needs to use the Visitor pattern to double-dispatch on the type of the Shape. In this case, should NullShapes be included in the Visitor interface? I am suggesting that they should not, and that <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a>s should not double-dispatch to a Visitor. I guess this answers your question as to whether a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> should be included in an enumeration of its base type: no it should not.

        Guys, I understand how polymorphism works, you simply polymorphed away my example. The question remains -- when the value is null, should the "type" of the value be Nil, NullFoobar, or NullFoobarZeetix? I argue that for it to truly act like "Nil", which it should, it should inherit from <a href="UndefinedObject.html">UndefinedObject</a>. Even if you don't *need* to send it an "isNil" message, it should still do the right thing in response to it. There are likely to be many occasions in a real system when you want NullZeetix to act like nil. For example, there are likely to be methods like the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        Object>>doSomethingWith: anObject<br/>
        "..."<br/>
        self == anObject ifTrue: [^self doSomethingInteresting].<br/>
        "..."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This code is intended to be general, it obeys the Liskov rules, and I argue that "aNullObject doSomethingWith: nil" should answer the result of #doSomethingInteresting.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this to work, NullFoobar would need to be a descendent of <a href="UndefinedObject.html">UndefinedObject</a>. Yet, by construction, NullFoobar is supposed to be a descendent of AbstractFoobar. In a single-inheritance system, it cannot be both.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a>'s argument, in my view, is tantamount to saying "The <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern works well as long as you don't do things that don't work". Again, by construction, the only time you need <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> in the first place is when defining a type that, by construction, includes NULL in its list of acceptable values. A "strong" type system that allows a variable to accept an assignment of a value that is excluded from an enumeration of all possible values is, in my view, broken by definition. Let me try it in different words: given a strong type system that has accepted an assignment of a given value to a variable declared to be of an extensional type "Foobar", I argue that I should surely be able to then apply an assertion like: "Foobar allValues includes: aVar" and get a "true" result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me ask a related question:
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose I have a variable declared
      </p>
      <code>
        zeetix aVariable;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        What should should the compiler do in response to the following assignments?
      </p>
      <code>
        aVariable = nilZeetix;<br/>
        aVariable = nilFoobar;<br/>
        aVariable = nil;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        How shall the following conditionals respond, given these assignments?
      </p>
      <code>
        if (aVariable == nilZeetix) {/* ... */};<br/>
        if (aVariable == nilFoobar) {/* ... */};<br/>
        if (aVariable == nil) {/* ... */};<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And, perhaps the most interesting:
      </p>
      <code>
        Object aVariable;<br/>
        Object anotherVariable;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        #ifdef CASE 1<br/>
        anotherVariable = nilZeetix;<br/>
        aVariable = nilZeetix;<br/>
        #endif  <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        #ifdef CASE 2<br/>
        anotherVariable = nilZeetix;<br/>
        aVariable = nilFoobar;<br/>
        #endif  <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        /* ... */<br/>
        /* You get the picture */<br/>

        This page has got way to big for me to figure out what is going on. It sometimes sounds like the problem is multiple inheritance and not nil at all. In a type system like Cecil's,
      </p>
      <code>
        aVariable = nil;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        would be a type error because nil is not a zeetix.

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Nor is nilFoobar unless you made it one. If Foobar and Zeetix are disjoint types, you obviously can't define a class nilFoobarZeetix which inherits from both of them. You need separate, more specific classes instead. Nil is not equal to nilFoobar unless you want it to be; we don't have to make all flavours of nil equal to each other. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Excuse me? If you want to be able to correctly perform generic comparisons of objects, and "nil" is one of the objects, you'd better make them all at least appear to be equal to each other. -- </em><a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm afraid I don't follow what you mean by "generic comparisons" which implies nil must be equal to nilFoobar. It seems obvious to me they are different.

How can they be equal if they are not even substitutable for each other? -- </em><a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a><em></em>

        Being more specific is sometimes necessary and desirable.

        Perhaps the difficulty here is that, as is often the case with singularities, the effort to examine the singularity expands in unexpected ways to a variety of areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a> is correct in observing that the issue is intimately related to type -- including <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I understand typed systems, especially "strongly typed" systems, they attempt to impose a constraint that any given datum is an instance of one and only one type. Typically, "sub-types" are value restrictions on their supertypes: if "Integer" is a subtype of "Number", Number contains instances that are not included in "Integer", but every Integer is also a Number.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>A datum can belong to many types at once; "Integer" and "Number" are both types and a single value can belong to both of them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We can define sub-typing in terms of Liskov Substitutability, and we can approximate LSP by whether an object will give #messageNotUnderstood. Thus "Integer" is a sub-type of "Number" if "Integer" never gives #messageNotUnderstood when "Number" wouldn't. We can leave inheritance out of it. -- </em><a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Thus, what we have here is a situation where NullFoobar wants to be both a kind of <a href="UndefinedObject.html">UndefinedObject</a> and a kind of Foobar. In a system with multiple inheritance, this is easier, but not complete -- even with multiple inheritance, sometimes NullFoobar should be identical to NullZeetix (in generic comparisons, for example) and sometimes it should not (anytime you want NullZeetix to behave differently from NullFoobar -- presumably it is an error for a variable declared to be of type NullFoobar to contain and instance of NullZeetix instead).
      </p>
      <p>
        One approach, in a multiple inheritance system, is to declare NullFoobar to be a Singleton that has both <a href="UndefinedObject.html">UndefinedObject</a> and Foobar as parents. In a single-inheritance system, this can be simulated by choosing one parent and delegating to the other. However, even this approach will lead to unexpected behavior in generic comparisons (consider, for example, UI widgets that return a list selection. What object should a Foobar chooser answer when there is no selection, nil or theNilFoobar?).
      </p>
      <p>
        I offer that the issue is created by explicitly representing nil in the first place (in a strongly typed system). I'm reminded of the difference between a scavenging garbage collecter and a mark/sweeper: the former never explicitly dereferences the garbage, it instead leaves it behind. This is a fundamental difference that leads to profound differences in garbage collector behavior and performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone wants to refactor this into another set of pages, its fine with me -- but I think that this is all <em>very</em> relevant to the use of the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern. The rub, for me, is that each time I've used it, it has come back to haunt me, through these kinds of issues. I'm therefore loath to simply dismiss these questions as irrelevant.

        Sounds to me like a purely semantic argument taking issue with a (possibly) <em>misleadingly</em> named pattern -- this could probably be resolved by replacing the word <em>Null</em> in the <em></em><a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><em> pattern name. People seem to be more hung up on the idea that the term </em>Null<em> shows up in its name than with the actual </em>behavior<em> of the pattern. Seeing the term 'null' moves one to desire implementations of </em><a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><em> that act like </em>null<em>. However, this misses the point. The </em>null<em> value that </em><a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><em> replaces is a </em>'misuse of the null/nil value<em>'. Since there is no concept for </em>absent behavior<em>, we have little choice but to use the </em>absence of value<em> to denote the absence of behavior in our code. In this context, </em><a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><em> does not represent a null value but is instead representing </em>empty<em> or </em>non-behavior<em>. </em>
        Seems this argument could be cleared up by renaming the pattern something along the lines of <em></em>DoNothingObject<em>, </em>NoBehaviorObject<em>, or </em>TransparentObject<em>. From my limitted understanding, the pattern's intent seems simple -- to provide an empty </em>implementation<em> in order to reduce value-</em>checking<em> logic. In many cases, the use of this pattern can be replaced by </em>ObjectForStates while in other cases it works great <em>with</em> ObjectForStates.

        Back to an earlier quote implying that <em>null acts like a subclass in C++ or Eiffel</em>... it is just because <em>null</em> does <strong>not</strong> act like a subclass that something like <em></em><a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><em> is so useful. </em>

        I've been playing with a pattern to replace <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> that is a variation on <a href="AbstractClass.html">AbstractClass</a>.

        Concrete iterators would subclass Default<strong>'Iterator much like an </strong><a href="AbstractClass.html">AbstractClass</a>. While not shown in this example, a concrete class would only need specialize those methods for which they were adding non-default behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, subclasses would gradually specialize the <em>default</em> (or null) behavior out of existence. So rather than <em></em><a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><em> being a specialization of some abstract class, the null object would be the classes default implementation. Any thoughts on this? Clearly there are some problems with this idea too, but is it worth working into its own pattern?</em>

        You said... "<em>I argue that for it to truly act like "Nil", which it should, it should inherit from </em><a href="UndefinedObject.html">UndefinedObject</a>.<em>"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The point of a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> is <em>not</em> to act like a null object reference, but to do something sensible at the edges of a data structure so you <em>never have a null reference</em> in the data structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        You complain that I "<em>simply polymorphed away [your] example</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the whole point! The <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern replaces conditionals testing for null object references in data structures with polymorphism. It's still perfectly valid to have null object references elsewhere (in local variables for example), but they are a programming error if encountered within a data structure. For example, you may have a function performing a depth-first search over a tree that can contain <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a>s. The search function would return a null object reference to indicate that it had not found the required node. It would <em>not</em> return a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> to indicate that because a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> is used to mark the edges of a graph, not the absence of an object.
      </p>
      <p>
        To touch on the issue of types and semantics that you have mentioned, a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> is not a null reference. A null reference is a value of the reference type, and a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> is a value of the polymorphic type referred to by a reference.

        And so when I assign the result of this search into a variable, I'll be assigning the value "nil" to a variable declared to be of type Foobar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now please tell me how I subsequently use that variable without testing its value for nil at each reference -- precisely the problem I set out to avoid with the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern.

        The fact that you are testing the returned reference against null is because that is not an example of the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern, but the pattern is used within the structure itself. Look at the applicability of the pattern as described at the top of the <em>[</em><a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a>]<em> page: "a recursive structure, like a list or a tree, requires some special marker to define those nodes at the structure's boundary".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern is not used to replace <em>all</em> uses of null references, or all tests for null references. Only null references marking the boundaries of a data structure made up of polymorphic objects, and checks for null in code that traverses that data structure. Like any pattern, it is applicable in some parts of a system and makes no sense in (and, indeed, complicates) other parts.

        Yes, so it sounds like we agree -- although we express our interpretation differently. You said "<em>... it is applicable in some parts of a system and makes no sense in (and, indeed, complicates) other parts.</em>". I said "<em>Unfortunately, I fear that this pattern moves, rather than solves, the problems it attempts to address.</em>". I believe these are two essentially equivalent statements, albeit with different connotations (I don't share your sense that this is true for any pattern).
      </p>
      <p>
        I "had" this pattern at one time, and have since stopped using it because my experience has been that the "other parts" that it "complicates" or "makes no sense in" in were a) unpredictable (by me) and b) just as painful to solve as the original tests I was trying to avoid through the use of <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a>.

        While this exchange has helped me more clearly understand the ramifications of <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> (it has helped me understand more completely the extent of the "weirdness" of nil in a strongly-typed environment), perhaps we agree that application of <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> <em>does</em> have side effects that tend to offset (to a greater or lesser extent) its utility.

        A generic collection should <strong>not</strong> return the object that isn't there. If you want the collection returning some particular object in some particular cases, just write an adapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are assigning an object of type FoobarOrNil to a Foobar variable, that's your fault. As well as when you are assigning the FoobarZeetix object to the same variable. A system with relatively good type checking will find these faults (even <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> can sometimes find them). A good strong typed system will force you to perform the type conversion safely. -- <a href="NikitaBelenki.html">NikitaBelenki</a>

        I guess the reason we have had this exchange is that our experiences of the pattern are quite different. In the systems in which I found the pattern useful (the animation scene-graph, for example), the parts of the system in which it was and was not applicable were very easy to determine, and the pattern cleaned up the code enormously. On the other hand, my experience is also that I never designed the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern into the system from the start, but added it later when checks for null started becoming unwieldy. Perhaps it is better thought of as a refactoring pattern?

        Sometimes you need several different "flavors" of NULL.
        The "OWL" object oriented language in EDS (...similar to Smalltalk; used for expert systems development), had several different kinds of NULL:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           NotSet = variable had never been given a value.
        </li>
        <li>
           Unknown = we tried to find a value, but failed. <em>(Meaning that we won't try again.)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Database NULL = the NULL value, as fetched from a database.

        Most of what I'd wanted to say has been said; for the sake of summarizing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           NullFoo is a subtype of Foo; it's different from null or nil
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> is something that exists to get rid of lots of checks for null, and use polymorphism instead
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> is an obvious name, since you're replacing "null" all these places in the code with "NullFoo", but it's misleading; so let's go with <a href="DummyObject.html">DummyObject</a> instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To put things in a slightly new way: <a href="DummyObject.html">DummyObject</a> is just a way of organizing your code. You take all the little clauses inside the "if null" conditionals that guard calls to baz(), and sweep them into <a href="DummyObject.html">DummyObject</a>.baz(); ditto for qux() and all the rest. It should look awfully familiar to do this, once you get over the fact that you're checking for null, rather than for some ugly int type field. But there's nothing in a <a href="DummyObject.html">DummyObject</a> that you wouldn't have needed to write anyway - you've just put it all together in one easy-to-maintain place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also think <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming is mostly just a matter of organizing your code: you put together things that will tend to change together. You don't actually write very much code you wouldn't have written in a procedural incarnation: the main benefits are in being able to reduce duplication (though you get out of writing some bookkeeping code when the language supports OO), and to make most changes much, much more cheaply.
      </p>
      <p>
        To elaborate on <a href="DummyObject.html">DummyObject</a> as something that's called into existence to eliminate null checks: Tom asked whether a DummyFoobarZeetix should act like a Foobar or like a Zeetix. Assuming our motivation to introduce DummyFoobarZeetix is the usual one, we want it to behave the way null would have behaved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we had no way of distinguishing between various values of null before, Foobar and Zeetix should behave <em>exactly the same as each other</em> when null. We move that behavior into DummyFoobarZeetix. If Foobar and Zeetix had had different null behavior, we might not have been tempted to create DummyFoobarZeetix in the first place - or even FoobarZeetix.
      </p>
      <p>
        And since all occurrences of null are the same (there being no instances to differ), it should be clear that we only ever need one instance of DummyFoo, and that it's a value object: it can't change its state (the question "can it examine its state?" is meaningless for a value object).
      </p>
      <p>
        As for what a <a href="DummyObject.html">DummyObject</a> should say when you ask it about its type: I honestly think asking an object about its type is cheating. It's roughly like conducting a Turing test and saying, "Yeah, but are you a computer?"  This came up with regard to reflection on the <a href="LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple.html">LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple</a> page, too. There should be some way to shave this kind of pointless hair (the "type name") off of types: if the types' behavior differs in no other way than what name they give back when asked, why would you have them return different names in the first place?

        I think the term "dummy" is just too vague.

        I think this trivial object idea seems a bit more intuitive than the standard inheritance. If you think of the trivial object - as not necessarily a direct analogue of the null object - but as a more generalized version of the object, it gives you a base class that cannot contain data(that is null), and you define a subclass that has the the ability to contain data other than null.
