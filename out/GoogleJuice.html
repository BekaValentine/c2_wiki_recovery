        <a href="GoogleJuice.html">GoogleJuice</a> is the ethereal substance which flows between web pages via their hyperlinks (in both directions!). Pages with lots of links to them acquire much <a href="GoogleJuice.html">GoogleJuice</a>; pages which link to highly juicy pages acquire some reflected <a href="GoogleJuice.html">GoogleJuice</a>. (do they? who says?) The level of <a href="GoogleJuice.html">GoogleJuice</a> in a page thus reflects how well connected it is, and thus, in our world where <a href="LinksAreContent.html">LinksAreContent</a>, how good it is (well, sort of).

      <p>
        Google uses the term <a href="PageRank.html">PageRank</a> in-house to mean the score that they give to each web page.  When it was google.stanford.edu, Google search results included a small graphic indicating how much <a href="PageRank.html">PageRank</a> each page has.  Now that search results no longer include <a href="PageRank.html">PageRank</a> (<em>unless you have the google toolbar</em>), people use the term <a href="GoogleJuice.html">GoogleJuice</a> to mean "the mysterious quality that causes pages to come up high in a Google search."
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> engine was the first <a href="SearchEngine.html">SearchEngine</a> to measure the levels of <a href="GoogleJuice.html">GoogleJuice</a> in each page; it sorts its results accordingly, presenting the ones with the most juice first.

        The term <a href="GoogleJuice.html">GoogleJuice</a> may have been first used by Don Marti in 1998 or 1999, and has become popular on the CrackMonkey mailing list and lists with CrackMonkey members on them.
