        Okay, first definitions. Class B is dependent on class A <a href="IfAndOnlyIf.html">IfAndOnlyIf</a> compile-time knowledge of the interface to class B requires compile-time knowledge of the interface to class A. What's significant about this is that a requirement to change the interface of class A has the potential to require a change to the interface of class B.
      </p>
      <p>
        A cyclic dependence occurs when class A and class B depend on each other. 1-to-1 cycles are unavoidable - nodes and links in a graph, or one of many varieties of parameterizing on types  ... there are lots of cases where you can't do without this. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But there's potential for real maintenance trouble when the cycle involves > 2 classes. The trouble comes when changing the interface to A requires changing the interface to B which requires changing the interface to C ... which requires changing the interface to A again. Involve several other classes in this unholy cycle and you've got a small change request exploding into an unpredictable amount of work. Involve several other cycles and ... game over, man.
      </p>
      <p>
        So you can use <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a> to break such a cycle this way: if we have (pardon my poor ascii-art):
      </p>
      <code>
        A<- B<br/>
        |   ^<br/>
        \   /<br/>
        ->C<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        we can break that by abstracting D from any class:
      </p>
      <code>
        >D<br/>
        /  ^<br/>
        A  |<br/>
        ^  |<br/>
        |  |<br/>
        B  |<br/>
        ^  |<br/>
        |  |<br/>
        C-/<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which, if C's dependence on B was inheritance, is MI for C. Of course there are other ways to do this refactoring, but <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a> is the most economical one.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's an interesting thing about this technique: the choice of which class to factor from is always natural. I mean, in my experience, it's just bleeding obvious. This backs an idea first suggested to me by <a href="MikeMowbray.html">MikeMowbray</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a long-chain cyclic dependence inherent in a class diagram, then that always means there's a class hiding in there some place that you need to factor out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technique I use to do this is pretty simple: in a class diagram, make all the arcs point up. That's to say, if one class is higher on the page than another, then the lower class can use/inherit/composite/aggregate/whatever the higher class, but not vice versa. This puts <strong>a lot</strong> of extra information on a class diagram, because it's not just the arcs that convey information - position of classes becomes extremely useful information about what those classes can and cannot be responsible for. 
      </p>

        Hmm ... I wonder what the CRC equivalent would be? --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        (<a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>) "changing the interface to A requires changing the interface to B which requires changing the interface to C ... which requires changing the interface to A again" - huh? I simply cannot imagine that happening at all. Please give an example. --<a href="AndersMunch.html">AndersMunch</a>
