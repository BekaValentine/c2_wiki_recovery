        Modern Dinosaur Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Old chaff, and a little bit of valuable discussion triggered by <a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a> attacking me on <a href="ModernDinosaur.html">ModernDinosaur</a>. Because lack of time to refactoring, as well as because of the impossibility to conclude it in any significant way when <a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a> has been sleeping for ages, I moved the raw material here.

        <em>Ralph, </em><a href="ConsiderTheSource.html">ConsiderTheSource</a>: <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>, who admits he's never used an object database.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Imagine, condescendingly recommending an introductory database text to </em><a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>.  That's one of the most disrespectful things I've ever seen in a professional community, let alone on this wiki.  Costin, your arrogance discredits you even more than your incoherent arguments.  --<a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine, Randy, I would definitely recommend you to read carefully AnIntroductionToDatabases, and if you can finnish that maybe you can try <a href="FoundationsOfDatabases.html">FoundationsOfDatabases</a>.  And it would do me great pleasure to do that <strong>condescendingly</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've already read Date - 12 years ago in grad school, where I wrote a term paper comparing and contrasting OODBMSes and RDBMSes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [[ Well, I certainly recommend you to read it again, and this time more carefully. 12 years is a very long time in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>. ]]

      <p>
        So much for your <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> that you're so fond of lately. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So shame on both of us.  From </em><a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a>: "this is a good reason to avoid condescension and sarcasm in conversation. It spoils the conversation.  The reason to avoid insulting a person you are conversing with is because he is a person".  You are insulting, Costin.  Until you change that, I couldn't care less about your ideas.  You seem to think only your ideas are relevant, and not your behavior.  As far as I'm concerned, <strong>that's</strong> fallacious thinking on your part within the context of this community.  I've been around here for six years or so, to the best of my memory, and politeness and respectfulness have always been the norm and, indeed, expected.  It's pretty cowardly of you to be rude and insulting, and then conveniently hide behind an <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> defense.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [[ It is only ideas that should be relevant, and by the way I believe and my attitude are not insulting. In contrast yours are beyond any comprehensible limit. I wouldn't have mentioned <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a>, but I ignored your insults twice before this, and you don't learn anything. It is time for you to take responsibility for what you do. ]]

        <em>[[It's clear from Ward's comment about </em><a href="GoodStyle.html">GoodStyle</a> on <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a> that civility has always been part of the <a href="WikiSocialNorms.html">WikiSocialNorms</a> here, so the ideal that only ideas should be relevant is not the reality of this community.  So why should you get to elevate your own beliefs above this community's reaction to you?  Why should you be immune to feedback?  <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> described your contribution as "insulting" before I ever even got on this page, and this isn't the first time you've been in this kind of conversation around here - with other people besides me.  Multiple people around here have repeatedly had this kind of reaction to you, but not to others, and you maintain it's <strong>their</strong> problem not yours?  FYI in the course of editing some 200 pages over the last five years or so, I've never had this kind of interaction with anyone else here besides you.  I'll gladly take responsibility for my actions.  Will you?  It's true I attributed to you your anonymous contributions on <a href="VariousIdeasOnWhyObjectsHaveNotFailed.html">VariousIdeasOnWhyObjectsHaveNotFailed</a>, and I escalated hostilities there with my choice of words.  That was in response to your addition of the "widespread dogmatic..." section, whose title and tone I felt to be obviously sarcastic and in violation of the last paragraph on <a href="GoodStyle.html">GoodStyle</a>.  I could have, perhaps should have, responded differently.  But I hate to see pages get poisoned like that.  Your addition of that section was the <a href="DeathOfThePage.html">DeathOfThePage</a>.  What could you have done differently?  What should you have done differently?]]<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        { You had very bad reactions, indeed. Maybe you should consider why your reactions or other's reactions to me are escalating. They're much worse than the "rudeness" they're supposed to react to. I never considered the expression of ideas to be rude, nor the expression of ideas should be hindered by political considerations. So if I point out flaws in object database, or I contradict your well entrenched prejudices against relational databases, you tend to react angrily, even in a personal manner. Some ideas are good, other ideas are not so good, others are simply bad, there's nothing new under the sun. When ideas conflict, it is people who take it personally, and that's bad. The traditional solution in wiki was a strange kind of political correctness, where you're supposed to let others SaveFace, which is hypocritical. Everybody and their friends should just drop their personal egos from the discussio, that's the right solution. }
      </p>
      <p>
        { <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> qualified this page bogus, and dismiss it out of hands with little justification, even if it was a respected scholar who came up with this term <a href="ModernDinosaur.html">ModernDinosaur</a>. They're many, many others (including both scholars and engineers) who think the same. It's not like you can blaim this whole page on me, and say that it is just <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a> that wants to show off his "rudeness".}
      </p>
      <p>
        { The same thing goes about "widespread dogmatic attitude". To be truthful and conforming to <a href="CriticizeBluntly.html">CriticizeBluntly</a>, I <strong>should</strong> have added <strong>ignorant</strong> which is much more than dogmatic, because a dogmatic but informed and justified attitude is not to be condemned. And again, there are other very important people who have said it before me. That's an objective qualification of what happens in OO communities, as viewed from the outside. They learn a little bit about OO, and they know nothing more, nor will it ever cross their mind that . It goes from the bottom all the way to the top. If you feel insulted by this, be my guest. If you feel you're affiliated somehow to the idea of OO community, throwing your anger at me is not going to help at all. }
      </p>
      <p>
        {And you'll never be able to justify your double standards. You react angrily when your ideas are under attack. When other's ideas are qualified (they are not even attacked as such ) under insulting terms, you couldn't care less. Nor the so called "wiki community" for that matter. }
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the argument from authority you're trying to make, I have more reasons to believe that <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> is the real authority on the subject. However, unlike you, I'm interested more in arguments and logic rather than in the apparent authority of <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a>, <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>, <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>, <a href="ScottAmbler.html">ScottAmbler</a> or whoever you wish to nominate here for a popularity contest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's quite obvious that you're interested in arguments.  However I've yet to see much cogent logic from you.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in the early 70's one noted computer scientist, Charles W. Bachman was far more popular than Dr. Codd as an authority on databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So what?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It didn't mean he was right, however, and unfortunately for him, many people hear of him today in relation to the famous Codd Bachman debate which he lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You conflate "right" with "most popular".  "Right" is context-dependent.  "Right" is in the eye of the beholder.  There's no one "right" that fits all.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But many so called OO "gurus" of today, revamp the same old arguments from debate, under the disguise of <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Prove it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [[ Simple. Bachman talked about "programmer as navigator" in the sense that database accesses is essentially navigation from one record to another along the edges of the Network or Hierarchical data model, it's the same argument that OO gurus come with today. But I strongly encourage you to read <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> for the full account. ]]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[[That doesn't "prove" that OO "gurus" of today "revamp" the arguments.  How do you disprove that the similarities you observe are not mere coincidence?  Show me a specific citation from popular current OOA literature to ancient DBMS literature, and its surrounding context. Besides, even if there are similarities, so what?  Why would that automatically make navigating object pointers inherently "bad" or "wrong"?]]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        { Oh, it doesn't, does it ? If you want me to prove everything you want me to prove you'd be <a href="WastingPeople.html">WastingPeople</a>. Have a look at your dear object databases, to see how they do things, have a look at <a href="EjbFlaws.html">EjbFlaws</a> among other, if you want literature, google it on the web. Everybody and their friends in OO cry that they can't navigate and they have to do <strong>expensive joins</strong> when navigating a pointer is much more efficient. Do you contest that ? }
      </p>
      <p>
        { Navigation is not "bad" or "wrong" per se. You can do it once in a blue while. it si "bad" and "wrong" when it is the primary way of data access, or as it happens often, when it is the only way of accessign data. And if you have remaining doubts, you should consider that relational queries subsumes navigation, so the standard OO argument has no merit besides ignorance. I hope you aren't going to revive Codd bachman debate on wiki, are you ? }

      <p>
        There's absolutely nothing in the basic principles of <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>, that justify the fact that Object DBMSes have the same basic flaws.

      <p>
        { Where do you read that ? I haven't challenged <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> to read. However the current state of knowledge in the database is <em>summarized</em> in <a href="AnIntroductionToDatabaseSystems.html">AnIntroductionToDatabaseSystems</a>. It would be futile for me to bring a quarte book worht of arguments, into one wiki page, so if RalphJonson knows something better he should say it, but not dismiss out of hand. }
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I have a great respect for his work on <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, I have no reason to believe that his expertise spreads over to database related issues.

      </p>
      <p>
        [[ Yes it is related to databases. I wouldn't have brought that into discussion but that particular paper  doesn't lead me to believe <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> is particularly knowledgeable with regards to databases. If he was, he wouldn't have repeated the common OO nonsense "Provide an OID Manager that creates unique keys for all objects that need to be stored in the database. Insure that all newly created objects that need to be persisted get a unique key."  And by the way, it's the same fundamental mistake that is made by <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>, <a href="ScottAmbler.html">ScottAmbler</a>, and became so unbelievably popular in OO circles, with serious consequences with regards to the quality of relational database schemas in production.

        You brought one more "argument" that I never used an OO database. That is true as a fact, but as an argument to this discussion is simply flawed. Do you think that I ought to use an object database ? As a <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a> I have a responsibility towards my patrons to choose the most adequate technical solution for the problem at hand, and not to build up my resume with ObjectDatabases, <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a>, <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> or whatever else you might think I ought to use. It was my <strong>informed</strong> professional judgement that for the the things I've done so far relational DBMSes are a superior technical solution. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I see.  Your professional judgment of OODBMSes is not informed by first-hand experience.  That's unfortunate, because </em>ExperienceIsTheBestTeacher.  I think that makes my point amply relevant.  We can play "my authority can beat up your authority" until we're blue in the face, but those invocations pale in comparison to the lessons of experience.  Yes I think you should use an object database in a real enterprise application development, so like me you can speak to both sides from a position of first-hand knowledge of the consequences (instead of second-hand knowledge of the theories).<em></em>

        [[ Therefore you recommend that I should risk a project just for the sake of me getting first hand experience ? That's a really lame advice. I submit to you that if a theory shows 2+2=4 you can't in good faith try to experiment with a product for which 2+2=5. Before I would ever experiment with an OODB, unless I am paid precisely to do just experimenting, I'll try to see if it's up at least to the standards set forth by <a href="DrCodd.html">DrCodd</a>, and only after that if it measures up with regards to <a href="FundamentalsOfObjectOrientedDatabases.html">FundamentalsOfObjectOrientedDatabases</a>.
