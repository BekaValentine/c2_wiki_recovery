        <a href="OpenDocumentFormat.html">OpenDocumentFormat</a> (ODF) is an <a href="OasisOrganization.html">OasisOrganization</a> standardization effort that uses <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> and aim to provide increased portability of office documents in a heterogeneous environment.

It would at least demonstrate the importance of having a solid <a href="InformationTechnologyGovernance.html">InformationTechnologyGovernance</a> worked out beforehand.
