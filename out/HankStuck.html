        How do you know you won't need it (a particular programming discipline/skill/paradigm) if you don't know about it?    You need to get things you don't know out of the <a href="GingerFactor.html">GingerFactor</a> area.

        Eclectic reader.  For non-fiction with ideas of interest are  by <a href="ShigeoShingo.html">ShigeoShingo</a> and by <a href="EliyahuGoldratt.html">EliyahuGoldratt</a>.   Also Zen Guitar.  Many others.  For fiction, main path is <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> (space opera and military SF).  Lately have gotten back into mysteries, and even some Victorian ones.
