        White Space Invasion
      </h1>
      <p>
        In attempting a simple edit on <a href="RefactorApplicationFramework.html">RefactorApplicationFramework</a> I inadvertently introduced a multitude of whitespace.  It was already there in the text-editing box when I did an <a href="EditPage.html">EditPage</a>, and I incorrectly assumed the wiki text-processing would eliminate it.  Apologies.  Is there a way to fix it short of manually deleting all the unwanted line-feeds?  <a href="ScottJohnston.html">ScottJohnston</a>

        Cut and paste the edit text into word and use its search and replace to replace all ^p^p with ^p ? <a href="AndyMorris.html">AndyMorris</a>

        Yah sure, but I'll use emacs, dontcha know :-)  I guess I was fishing around to see if the white-space compaction algorithm was broken/disabled, and maybe that was why all those extra new-lines showed up in the first place.  There was most definitely a difference in the whitespace contents and/or appearance of <a href="RefactorApplicationFramework.html">RefactorApplicationFramework</a> before and after my edit, a difference created by something other than a manual edit.

        I've noted that this problem can occur when using the Opera 5.0 web browser to edit Wiki pages, maybe with others as well? --<a href="LeonardNorrgard.html">LeonardNorrgard</a>

        Mozilla will "helpfully" get rid of wanted whitespace.  For example, if I copy a TAB and paste it, I just get a single space.  If I copy multiple spaces and paste, I get a single space.  Thanks, Mozilla.
