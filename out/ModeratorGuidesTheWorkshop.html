        Moderator Guides The Workshop
      </h1>
      <p>
        ... a set of well-meaning, qualified people
        (<a href="WorkshopComprisesAuthors.html">WorkshopComprisesAuthors</a>) have
        gathered with an author to review a work such as
        a pattern or pattern language.

        <strong>A group of diverse people make progress only</strong>
        <strong>clumsily unless there is some guidance, and</strong>
        <strong>an authority who (even arbitrarily) decides</strong>
        <strong>on the format, the duration of phases of the</strong>
        <strong>workshop, etc.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Each session should be led by an experienced</strong>
        <strong>moderator, who guides (not directs) the discussion.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The moderator is responsible to see that all runs smoothly.
        Done well, moderation is a background task:  the
        <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a> tradition alone is usually enough
        to guide the main flow of the activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>*  *  *</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The moderator has many tasks and needs many skills.
        There are many different moderation styles, including
        ActiveListeningModeration, where the moderator affirms
        (feeds back) everything that is said.  There are more
        passive styles of moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some moderators will call on reticent participants
        to speak;  most moderators are more hands-off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moderators teach the remaining patterns to the group
        (by example and light turning) and guide their use,
        subject to the moderator's style.
        Depending on the setting, the moderator may be responsible
        for securing copies of the work for the reviewers.
        The moderator
        initially welcomes the author and invites the author
        to read a selection from the work.  The moderator then
        thanks the author and invites him or her to become a
        fly on the wall.  The moderator invites a volunteer
        to summarize the pattern.
        The moderator makes sure that no
        negative criticism leaks into <a href="PositiveFeedbackFirst.html">PositiveFeedbackFirst</a>.
        The moderator decides when the PositiveFeedback has
        reached diminishing returns, and segues into
        <a href="SuggestionsForImprovement.html">SuggestionsForImprovement</a>.  The moderator brings that
        session to a close, and welcomes the author back into
        the inner circle, encouraging them to ask questions
        of clarification.
        The moderator leads the <a href="ThankTheAuthor.html">ThankTheAuthor</a> ceremony,
        and invites a <a href="ClearingThePalate.html">ClearingThePalate</a> speaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moderator may also arrange for a scribe to help
        the author record major discussion points.
      </p>
      <p>
        There should be a separate <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> for
        WorkshopSessionModeration.
