        Incremental Development

        <a href="IncrementalDevelopment.html">IncrementalDevelopment</a> has been with us for a long time. <a href="TomGilb.html">TomGilb</a> described it in his <a href="PrinciplesOfSoftwareEngineeringManagement.html">PrinciplesOfSoftwareEngineeringManagement</a> book, labeling it <a href="EvolutionaryDevelopment.html">EvolutionaryDevelopment</a> or EVO. Increments can be short (<a href="NanoIncrements.html">NanoIncrements</a>) or much longer. XP often uses 3 week increments (but confusingly calls them iterations). Yes, they are iterations from the point of view of the process, but it is really <a href="IncrementalDevelopment.html">IncrementalDevelopment</a>. After each increment new functionality has been added to the application, and often there is some planned rework happening as well in the form of <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a>, but basically it is an incremental process.

        The <a href="UnifiedSoftwareDevelopmentProcess.html">UnifiedSoftwareDevelopmentProcess</a> is also incremental, but in that case it uses <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> increments rather than increments of <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>.  -- <a href="PeteMcBreen.html">PeteMcBreen</a>

        <a href="IncrementalDelivery.html">IncrementalDelivery</a> is a nearly a synonym for <a href="IncrementalDevelopment.html">IncrementalDevelopment</a>

        In <a href="FrequentReleases.html">FrequentReleases</a> (where this was discussed), there is an interesting parallel to what Darwin argued about the incremental development of different organs (such as the eye). I'd be interested to learn more about this, and can write up more if someone is interested. -- <a href="ToniAlatalo.html">ToniAlatalo</a>

        <em>It is true that evolutionary development tends towards local optimals rather than global optimums.  In my experience, </em><a href="IncrementalDevelopment.html">IncrementalDevelopment</a> can make difficult the occasional massive change that is truly necessary for improving the product towards a particular goal (which usually happens via ripping a component out and rewriting it entirely).<em></em>

        The <a href="TgpMethodology.html">TgpMethodology</a> is a new approach in software development taking advantage of incremental development. See also <a href="TgpProcess.html">TgpProcess</a>.
