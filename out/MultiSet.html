        Multi Set
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DataStructure.html">DataStructure</a> in which elements can occur a nonnegative integer number of times. Also called a "bag".
      </p>
      <p>
        A multiset x is characterised by a "count" operation, so that "x count y" is the number of times y occurs in x. There is no other structure; multisets are unordered.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not necessarily true.  The C++ library type multi_set<T> does require that its elements be ordered (by default it invokes operator < on the element type T; you can provide your own comparison </em><a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> if you want.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's because multi_set<T> is an <em>implementation</em> of a multiset. Implementations of a <a href="DataStructure.html">DataStructure</a> can impose structure that is not present in the underlying concept (as an early example, the implementation of sets in <a href="SetlLanguage.html">SetlLanguage</a> was also ordered).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Elements are stored in sorted order (not sure how equal elements are handled); and traversal of the container is guaranteed to visit elements in order.  By comparison, the STL type hash_multiset<T> (not part of the C++ standard library but part of the STL itself) does not sort its elements; traversal of a hash_multiset is not done in any particular (useful) order.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Both, however, are </em><a href="MultiSet.html">MultiSet</a>s<em>.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Both are <a href="MultiSet.html">MultiSet</a> implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like a set, the mathematical concept of a multiset is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           immutable
        </li>
        <li>
           extensional -- two multisets are the same iff they have identical counts for any element
        </li>
        <li>
           well-founded -- no multiset can directly or indirectly contain itself. (More precisely: if a system of multisets is viewed as a <a href="DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a> in which x points to y iff x count y > 0, then it is a <a href="DirectedAcyclicGraph.html">DirectedAcyclicGraph</a> with no infinite chains.)
        </li>
      </ul>
