        Bowling Game Second Story
      </h1>
      <p>
        After examining the <a href="ObjectMentorBowlingGame.html">ObjectMentorBowlingGame</a> score and discussing the lack of a frame object of any sort (and the desirability or not of having one) a couple of programmers turned to the question of how this solution compares to one that could get be implemented in a pure <a href="ProceduralLanguage.html">ProceduralLanguage</a> -- <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a>, to use a devilish example. And thus a second story for the <a href="BowlingGame.html">BowlingGame</a> was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to know, based on my current score and place in the game, what's the fewest number of throws I need to reach a specified score -- if I can at all?
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: I've had 7 throws, my score is 42 (I don't bowl much), what's the fewest throws I need to reach 100, if I can at all?
      </p>
      <p>
        Example 2: I'm on the ninth frame. My opponent just finished with a 286, my score is 210. How many throws do I need to beat her?  Can it even be done?
      </p>

      <p>
        Or, given 7 frames, and a score of 42, what is my maximum possible score for this game?
      </p>

        <em>Good questions all. I like 'em, I like 'em. An experienced bowler can probably answer these in his/her head. But the problem is to get a computer to answer them.</em>
