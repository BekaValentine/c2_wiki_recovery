      <p>
        A <a href="BorgGoldenHammer.html">BorgGoldenHammer</a> is a whimsical Star-Trek influenced nick-name for a <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> that allegedly succeeds because staff is chosen who intentionally <strong>think alike</strong> and/or like the same tool/language. In other words, it succeeds not because the tool is "better" in a general sense, but because it fits the <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> or desires of a controlled group of developers/users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This phenomena caught my attention in the 90's when I read about an author's study that suggested that <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> productivity, per their metric, was initially high in carefully-chosen teams of <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> enthusiasts, but later fell to match the average of other tools when a wider audience was brought in to use <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, after training. One theory raised to explains this was that like-minded teams who choose their own tools may do better than random teams forced to use random tools.

        And whether the results are due to improved morale alone ("Yay, I get to use X!"), or specific tool-to-mind-fit is also speculative.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does suggest there actually are <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>s, but only in a relative sense. -t
