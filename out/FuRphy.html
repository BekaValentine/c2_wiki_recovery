        During the first world war, John Furphy manufactured water and sanitary carts for the diggers in the trenches. The cart-drivers were a rich source of rumors and myths, and so in <a href="CommonwealthRealms.html">CommonwealthRealms</a> a "Furphy" has come to mean anything surrounded by overblown claims and misdirections. One of those words we wish the seppoes knew.
