        Just got here from <a href="http://alsa.opensrc.org">http://alsa.opensrc.org</a> and I was instantly amazed... I saw documentation, precious knowledge, and opinions on a site with a link saying "Edit this page".  I didn't understand how something like this could work, no registration or usernames or anything.  It certainly works, though... and I've gotten hooked on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I saw something similar at <a href="EverythingTwo.html">EverythingTwo</a>, but this is just so much more relaxed.  I've already bookmarked a few edits I want to make (decided to write my own <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> first, though), and I have to say I'm truly impressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and I've found myself tangenting more heavily than I could have expected through <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>, and I often find myself hitting Back ten to twelve times just to get back to what I was originally reading, if not forget about it entirely... anyone else <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>?
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>and about yourself . . .</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Right, right... I put this up with no sleep whatsoever, let's try this again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> major at the University of Maryland, College Park.  I program mostly in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>, and <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a> (<a href="TclTk.html">TclTk</a>), on whatever personal projects look interesting to me, of which there are many.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in other news, I've created my own <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> out of a combination of boredom, <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>, and a need for a good artwork forum.  It's not as fully-featured as this one, but it seems to work at its job, i.e. creating a space for artists to display their work and get comments on it.  It also has a few restrictions on what parts of it can be edited.  I'd love some comments on it; if anyone has the time, visit <a href="FlouriWiki.html">FlouriWiki</a> and let me know (or even better, leave comments) what you think of it.
