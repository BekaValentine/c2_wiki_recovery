        David Aumueller

      <p>
        <em>Young Shepherd</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As to his personal appearance, we only know that he was red-haired, with <strong>beautiful eyes</strong> and a fair face (1 Sam. 16:12; 17:42)
      </p>
      <p>
        He played before the king so skilfully that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain great affection for the <strong>young shepherd</strong>.

      <p>
        On his arrival in the camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years
        of age) was made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the
        Philistines, <strong>Goliath</strong> of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. David took his <strong>sling</strong>,
        and with a well-trained aim threw a stone "out of the brook," which struck the
        giant's forehead, so that he fell senseless to the ground. David then ran and
        slew him, and cut off his head with his own sword (1 Sam. 17). The result was a
        great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines to the gates of
        Gath and Ekron.

      <p>
        David's fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. He ruled
        over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with the spoils of many lands.
        But in the midst of all this success he fell, and his character became stained
        with the <strong>sin of adultery</strong> (2 Sam. 11:2-27).
      </p>
      <p>
        David's last words are a <strong>grand utterance</strong>,
        revealing his unfailing faith in God, and his joyful confidence in his gracious
        covenant promises (2 Sam. 23:1-7). After a reign of forty years and six months
        (2 Sam. 5:5; 1 Chr. 3:4) David died (B.C. 1015 - error : he died in 975 BC ; 1015 BC is just the beginning of his reign) at the age of seventy years,
        "and was buried in the city of David." His tomb is still pointed out on Mount
        Zion.
