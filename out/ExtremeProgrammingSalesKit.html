        Extreme Programming Sales Kit
      </h1>
      <p>
        An unfortunate fact is that some people just don't get it, and other people haven't even heard of it. Extreme Programming needs to be sold to these people, and to anyone else who isn't doing it. The sales kit is a collection of material that can be used to help you to help other people to understand XP.

        The idea was sparked by <a href="CharliePoole.html">CharliePoole</a> on the XP eGroup.

        Donated material needs to be categorized so that people can find things appropriate to their audience. I propose two axis of categorization, by company, and by job.

           Has a process

            </li>
            <li>
               And it succeeds

      </ol>

        Each contributor can add a simple cartesian (or set of cartesians) to their contribution's description of the form j?c? where j indicates the job axis, and c indicates the company axis. So, you may add (j1c1.2) to a donated paper, indicating that this paper is useful for Dilbert ;-) --<a href="BryanDollery.html">BryanDollery</a>
