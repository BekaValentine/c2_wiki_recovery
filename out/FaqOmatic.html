        This is FAQ-O-Matic, a quick-and-dirty Perl hack (aren't they all?) by Jon Howell. <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        It seems like most FAQ maintainers make a valiant initial effort, then get a life and<br/>
        don't have time to keep their FAQs up to date. Also, I often find out a solution to a <br/>
        problem, and feel like I could write a single FAQ answer on it in a few minutes, <br/>
        but where to post it? <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Thus the FAQ-O-Matic was born. FAQ-O-Matic is a couple sleazy Perl scripts that allow<br/>
        people to submit FAQ answers to this database, so it can stay current, with just a tiny <br/>
        bit of work on any one person's part. <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Yes, a bad guy could come along and wipe out all the FAQ entries. Please don't. But to give the<br/>
        good guys some measure of comfort, each submission is stored in an RCS file, so if someone<br/>
        does tamper, we can recover the database. Furthermore, version 2 keeps track of who makes<br/>
        changes. <br/>
