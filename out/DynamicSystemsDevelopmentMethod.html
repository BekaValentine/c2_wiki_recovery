        Upon describing XP to a friend recently, he remarked upon how similar some of the concepts were to DSDM. Not having looked into DSDM, I wasn't in a place to comment. -- <a href="StuartBarker.html">StuartBarker</a>

        Similar things have been said by my colleagues, however, after further discussion we decided that the similarities are not so profound after all. But I, too, don't really know enough about DSDM to have a firm opinion. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>
