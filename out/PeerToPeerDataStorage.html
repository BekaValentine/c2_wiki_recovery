        Peer To Peer Data Storage
      </h1>
      <p>
        A type of DistributedDataStorage where data is scattered among numerous peer nodes, which may  (or may not) be geographically distributed, and the role of a centralized authority/repository (such as a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a> engine) is minimized or eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advantages of peer-to-peer (many of these advantages are theoretical; as production-quality peer-to-peer systems that can compete with a <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> RDBMS like Oracle simply don't exist).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Greater scalability.  The Internet wouldn't work well if everything had to go through a central server somewhere.  Servers invariably become bottlenecks.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Can be implemented on inexpensive hardware.  A RDBMS requires a piece of <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> to run effectively.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           For applications involving multiple autonomous entities, better models the underlying political reality--each node is autonomous.
        </li>
        <li>
           Reliability and fault-tolerance; if one node goes down the rest still function.  (Though many peer-to-peer implementations exist where if one node or link goes down, down goes everybody... [<em>What P2P application on earth goes down if someone turns off their computer?</em>]).  With server-based systems, the server and the surrounding infrastructure is a <a href="SinglePointOfFailure.html">SinglePointOfFailure</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Better models the world; inconsistency is a part of real life.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And, the advantages of the server-based system (including things like replicated databases, where a single logical database is scattered across multiple systems).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Much easier to achieve GlobalConcensus--the canonical state of the system is kept by the server; everything else is just a (possibly out-of-date copy).
          <ul>
            <li>
               Likewise, data consistency is not an issue--the OneTrueCopy lives on the server.  With peer-to-peer, it is easy for the distributed data to become inconsistent.
            </li>
            <li>
               Easier to maintain invariants on the data and provide transactional support (including the ability to roll back transactions which cause an invariant to not be satisfied). 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           For applications involving entities under the control of one organization (such as corporations), better models the underlying political authority--the governance of the authority can implement policies for things like security, backups and data recovery, etc. at the server.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <em>location</em> of data is not an issue (it lives on the server).  With peer-to-peer, before you can find out <em>what</em> the data is you may have to find <em>where</em> it is.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that the issues discussed here are largely orthogonal to the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>--a <a href="NetworkDatabase.html">NetworkDatabase</a> is just as capable as a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a> at addressing the above.  (However, the most mature DBMS products are RDBMS's).
