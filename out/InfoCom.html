        <a href="InfoCom.html">InfoCom</a> was a company that specialized in what is now called <a href="InteractiveFiction.html">InteractiveFiction</a>, but were (in the 70's and 80's) simply called (text) adventures.  Their products are still widely regarded to be among the best in the genre.  Googling should bring up plenty of information. -- <a href="MatteoVaccari.html">MatteoVaccari</a>
