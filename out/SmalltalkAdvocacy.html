        Smalltalk Advocacy
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="JosephBacanskas.html">JosephBacanskas</a> hosted a BOF at OOPSLA '98
        that talked about ways to raise Smalltalk's visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        People mentioned that the Linux community is open to new ideas
        and needs a powerful programming environment, and both <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a>
        and <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> might fit the bill. Join your local Linux users group
        and show them the power of Smalltalk.
        There was much interest in writing/porting a "killer Smalltalk app" for 
        Linux, but nobody had a concrete suggestion. Anybody got any ideas?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes. A fully free and unrestricted implementation that is ported and packaged</em>
        to every system in sight and, where possible, lobbied into vendors' software
        collections. Without it there is little hope as there's a threshold and
        that threshold is not worth climbing just to try something obscure. This 
        applies to all technologies that want to thrive in free software world.
        Iff the technology is interesting enough, someone might do the work for the
        advocates and so it goes unnoticed. But it's there. See gcc, guile, perl...
        Easy to get and available almost everywhere "out of the box".<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That bit is a </em><a href="RefactorMe.html">RefactorMe</a> candidate. The point could be repeated after almost every
        sentence here and elsewhere.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A key part to this is understanding the <a href="LinuxCommunity.html">LinuxCommunity</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>At the very least, it has to be </em><a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> and play well with PosixApi and <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> (The <a href="SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator.html">SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator</a> is a must).

        Some Java users groups are full of people interested in the latest language features and APIs from Sun, but most don't know nearly as much about objects or 
        how to build them as the Smalltalk community does.  This is another community 
        that could benefit from the presence of some helpful Smalltalkers.

        Smalltalk (and especially <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a>) made a lot more sense to me after I started thinking of it as an operating system, rather than just a language. Of <em>course</em> it feels weird to developers for other operating systems - we're not just asking them to try a new language, we're asking them to try a whole new OS too. (<a href="SmalltalkAdvocacy.html">SmalltalkAdvocacy</a> has all the difficulties of language advocacy <em>and</em> OS advocacy. :)
      </p>
      <p>
        If the goal is to make a killer app for Smalltalk, I think we're going to have to, um, embrace our OS-ness. :) We <em>could</em> split apart the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> from the SmalltalkOs and turn it into something that plays nicely with the surrounding OS, but the <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> guys have already done a really good job of that; if the goal is to make a killer Linux app for a Smalltalk-like language, I don't think it would be any shame to use Ruby instead of Smalltalk.

        There is no need to write a "killer app". Smalltalk itself is the "killer"!
        It's a "killer development environment". There is simply NOTHING in the
        Linuxworld like Smalltalk.
      </p>
      <p>
        But. There is a problem. The Linux development-tools that exist today
        are all <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> (or: "<a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> (tm)).    
        And these development-tools are part of all distributions, they are considered
        to be an integral part of Linux itself. While most of the Linux-freaks are
        open (or: not hostile) towards proprietary software, it is some kind of
        unwritten law that the System itself has to be Free. ("free" from "freedom".
        Think at "free speech", not "free beer").
      </p>
      <p>
        (But apparently the free beer aspect is also important, since charging money for the tools is a no-no). -- <a href="AlanKnight.html">AlanKnight</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Paying, ie sending money or other goods to who knows where is insanely difficult in/toward many corners of the world and to many people. The price might not be bad, but add laws and banks and cultures where not everyone has a Visa/MC, it is very difficult.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Commercial software also comes with other significant baggage like restrictions</em>
        that prevent porting, packaging and redistributing the product. It's effectively
        non-integrateable. The software vendor probably only supports some corner case like
        an obsolete <a href="RedHat.html">RedHat</a> and their packagers lack the networking and skills needed to
        do real high-quality packaging and keeping up to date with things fast enough.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Conclusion: <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> non-commercial for Linux is cool, it will help
        <a href="ObjectShare.html">ObjectShare</a> (and the Smalltalk-community) to gain new developers, but:

        Back to the thought about raising Smalltalk's visibility:  I have often thought it was very ironic that the best development language for building large industrial-strength enterprise applications should be named "Smalltalk."  No one encountering it for the first time would ever guess!  It sounds like something you might embed in a PDA or a calculator or something.  It would have been better if it had been called "BigTalk," for heavens' sake!  Has anyone else ever had this same thought? -- Ned Earle
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you're targetting Linux people (and I realize your comment wasn't directed at them specifically) the phrase "Industrial-strength enterprise applications" is like cryptonite to </em>PerlMonks and BashShell hackers.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn't agree with you more Ned.  I do think that part of the Smalltalk's marketing problem is its name.  I made the same argument a couple of months ago on CLS -- George Santamarina

      <hr/>
      <p>
        And I couldn't agree less with you guys :-) 
        I am kind of buffled by the search for a new grand name for Smalltalk; a name which will "clean" our reputation, and will "enlighten" all those uneducated folks out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, in the spirit of <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a>, here is a new name which says it all: <strong></strong>NoTalk<strong>.</strong>
        Or even better: <strong>Silence</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reminds me of ECM, a German music company which carries the logo: "ECM ... the most beautiful sound after silence". (And they fullfill their promise...) -- <a href="BennySadeh.html">BennySadeh</a>

        If I remember correctly, Alan Kay said they chose the name <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> because all the other computer languages at the time were named after Greek gods.

      </p>
      <p>
        In a way the name is not the issue, it is more a symptom of the issue. The <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>/Squeak core of supporters consists of researchers that are far more interested in constructing the next revolutionary step than making the platform widely usable. Their agenda doesn't really coincide with our agenda, that's the issue.

        Smalltalk was very visible in Seattle on Dec. 2.  The Northwest Component Technology Symposium featured 3 experience reports, two of which were Smalltalk success stories.  The third report was from a large company doing an all Microsoft solution.  Travis Griggs from Key Technologies showed how Smalltalk is used to simplify the man machine interface of an extremely complex sorting machine.  I talked about using Smalltalk at Mutual Travel to build a suite of web applications.  The point that was really brought home by both presentations
        was that you can have very high productivity with very limited resources with Smalltalk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, in a panel discussion with the rest of the presenters and the 2 keynote speakers (Jim Rumbaugh and Bob Marcus) we talked about how much lower the cost of change was when you work in Smalltalk.  When we were discussing the kind of exploratory design/coding that is common for Smalltalkers, Bob Marcus warned the audience to remember that I was working in Smalltalk, and that if any his C++ programmers were to try working that way, he would shoot them! (Bob, I hope I got this right, I was VERY nervous).
      </p>
      <p>
        The symposium was attended by about 60 people, most of whom paid at least $200 for the day.  Smalltalk looked really good at the end of the day.

        Perhaps, when evangalizing Smalltalk we need to introduce it to Domain Experts _and_ their programmers at the same time.  That is, when introduced to an audience of programmers they tend to dismiss it because it doesn't let them showcase the skills they've spend years building, namely memory management and typing.  Their Domain Experts aren't there to remind the programmers that _they_ are the ones who need to be satisfied.  When it's just Domain Experts they like it, go back to their programmers and ask them about it, the programmers ask them afew questions which the DE's can't answer because they're not programmers, and the programmers advise against it.  But to test this thesis, how would you get the Domain Experts and their Programmers to the same talk...?

        <strong>Smalltalk's Real Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't get sidetracked by comparing Smalltalk's success with Java's success.  This opens up a lot of issues that I don't think apply here.  (It's also not <i>that</i> popular on Linux.) Compare Smalltalk instead to very successful Linux languages like Perl, Python and C/C++.  What do they have that Smalltalk doesn't?

          <ul>

               Smalltalk is an operating system, if you're complaining about that you're really missing the point.

Now this would be a VERY interesting project: building features into Squeak necessary to let it work in a global, component-based way.</em>

      <p>
        Let's all just get out of the business of building a VM, and just build on top of Squeak!  Then all of the Smalltalk companies would be pooling their resources to make the best possible platform!  
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, speaking of Perl, why not implement Perl on top of the Smalltalk VM?  Why not everything?  We could run Perl, Java, and Lisp comfortably on top of the Squeak VM.  How's that for a plan to take over the world?

        I wonder if Smalltalk has potential as an object modelling tool? Tools like Rational ROSE are
        pretty heavyweight and take quite a bit of getting used to. It is much quicker to create a few
        classes and objects in Smalltalk and play about with them. For testing out an <a href="AnalysisModel.html">AnalysisModel</a>
        it would be unbeatable, especially if you create unit tests so that you can refactor your
