        Ki Swahili
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="KiSwahili.html">KiSwahili</a> is the Swahili word for Swahili. The Ki prefix is used when speaking of languages. The Wa prefix would be used for a group of people, as in Waamerika for Americans and Waingereza for the people of England. The English language is Kiingereza.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swahili has a Bantu grammar but has been greatly influenced in its vocabulary by Arabic, to a moderate extent by Portuguese and English, with scatterings of borrowed words from German, Hindi, Farsi and many other languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The agglutinative nature of Swahili may be illustrated by this perfectly normal sentence:
      </p>
      <p>
        Usiwasumbue wanapolala.
      </p>
      <code>
        U	you<br/>
        si	not<br/>
        wa	them<br/>
        sumbue	bother (subjunctive of sumbua)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        wa	they<br/>
        na	are (doing)<br/>
        po	when	<br/>
        lala	sleep<br/>
        = Don't bother them when they're sleeping.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The possibilities allowed by the rules that govern these constructions mean that borrowed words, especially verbs, fit immediately into a whole scheme that then can generate many other uses.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Somebody once did an experiment by coining a new Swahili word 'vota' meaning 'to vote'. Swahili had no specific word for this, commonly using 'chagua' which means 'choose'. The experimenter used the rules of Swahili to build a list of twenty-some words derived from 'vota'. When he read the list to African Swahili speakers, they immediately knew the meaning of most of them. The remainder they recognized when given a simple hint. So by introducing a single word 'vota', the language could generate words for voter, candidate, election, ballot, ballot box, and so on.
