        Meta Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        Meta-Patterns would be patterns about making patterns.
        Here are some I've heard discussed...

        I bet Rich and Waters are smarter then us, but they got seduced into
        going meta, which is the CS equivalent of "the dark side of the force".
        CS folks are always trying to build tools for something before they
        understand it.  They are always trying to solve abstract problems
        before being able to solve the concrete ones.  Abstractions are great,
        but you have to have experience with the concrete before you can
        understand them, let alone invent them.  That is why we should focus
        on understanding particular patterns before making a theory for
        patterns in general.

        Computer Science is the discipline that believes
        all problems can be solved with one more layer
        of indirection. -- DennisDeBruler

        In programming, everything we do is a special case of something more general - and often we know it too quickly.

        <strong>Metapatterns</strong> is a phrase first used in print by <a href="GregoryBateson.html">GregoryBateson</a>. It is also a <a href="MetaPatternsBook.html">MetaPatternsBook</a> by <a href="TylerVolk.html">TylerVolk</a> about the patterns he finds in Nature. As you expand the scope, you're getting into cybernetics and philosophy.
