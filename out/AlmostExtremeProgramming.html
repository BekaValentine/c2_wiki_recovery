        "Wow! That <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> stuff is neat! We almost do it, too!" I hear this cry remarkably often. I have developed the following little joke description of one of my projects to warn people about what they are saying...
      </p>
      <p>
        "Extreme Programming (a la <a href="ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation.html">ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation</a> project) requires 4 things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You do pair programming.
        </li>
        <li>
           You deliver an increment every three weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
           You have a user on the team full time.
        </li>
        <li>
           You have regression <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s that pass 100% of the time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a reward for doing those, 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You don't put comments in the code.
        </li>
        <li>
           You don't write any requirements or design documentation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now on this project, we're pretty close...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           well, actually a couple of our guys sit in the basement, a couple on the 5th floor, and a couple 2 hours drive from here, so we don't do pair programming,
        </li>
        <li>
           and actually, we deliver our increments every 4-6 months, 
        </li>
        <li>
           we don't have users anywhere in sight,
        </li>
        <li>
           and we don't have any <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>but at least</strong> <em>we don't have any design documentation, and we don't comment our code much!</em> So in a sense, you're right, we're <em>almost</em> doing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>!"

        Heh. Where was I reading this the other day? Maybe <em></em>ConsciousnessExplained<em>, by </em><a href="DanielDennett.html">DanielDennett</a>? Or was it in <a href="KentsBook.html">KentsBook</a>? Anyway, the idea was that <em>almost</em> means the same thing as <em>not</em>. That when a vendor claims his tool is <em>almost</em> anything, you should interpret it as the exact opposite.

        The author goes on to explain that he would rather be <em>almost dead</em> than <em>almost alive</em>, that any businessman in the world would rather be <em>almost bankrupt</em> rather than <em>almost solvent</em>. <g> -- <a href="BillBarnett.html">BillBarnett</a>
