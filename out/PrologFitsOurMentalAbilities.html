        Prolog Fits Our Mental Abilities
      </h1>
      <p>
        Prolog fits our mental abilities because it lets us ask for what we want instead of how to perform it.

        What about Object-Oriented Prolog?

        I'm so tempted to create BrainFuckFitsOurMentalAbilities because our brains are fucked.

        Do we really prefer to ask for what we want instead ordering it done in a particular way? <a href="LeadingRequest.html">LeadingRequest</a>s seem to indicate that it is common for people to phrase their requests only in terms of an exact implementation of what they want, rather than the problem they are trying to solve, which means PrologDoesNotFitOurMentalAbilities (at least, not always)

        <em>That is a fair point. OTOH, Prolog is capable of both.</em>
