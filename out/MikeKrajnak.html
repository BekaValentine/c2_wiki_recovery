        <a href="MikeKrajnak.html">MikeKrajnak</a> has been been a <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> addict for many months now, 
        whenever there is breathing room on his current project.

      <p>
        I have recently been abusing my authority as Lead Architect on my current
        project to introduce <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> practices (by stealth and gentle
        persuasion) and other EnlightenedMethodologies.  The regulatory environment
        that we work in sometimes makes this difficult.  We are having
        a lot of success with <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> and <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> and are just starting to see other
        teams in our company pick it up as a "best practice".

        I'm IntpType which is the only excuse I have for lurking so long before
        I signed in.
