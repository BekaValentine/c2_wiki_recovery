        <strong>Wiki Wiki Story</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>O</strong>n February, 28 2004 a <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> brought a NetiZen to a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> deep within TheWikiForest. The SearchParameter lost the moment he began to read. From the first <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> he knew this was different. He had that feeling you get when you find something that you never knew was lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>T</strong>he words clung to him as if they were his grandfather telling him a story. As he clicked his way through the pages he began to realize that he was in the midst of a completely different world. With <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> on every page, the <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a> had discovered <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>T</strong>he more he read the more he wanted to become a <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a>. He created his <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> and continued to read while <a href="CollectingSeashells.html">CollectingSeashells</a> along the way. He learned about <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a>, <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>, <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, and so much more. He even had the pleasure of meeting a <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a> and caught a glimpse of a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>S</strong>oon, he began to watch <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a> and he realized that a tremendous amount of <a href="WikiMaintenance.html">WikiMaintenance</a> is required to keep <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> presentable to WikiVisitors and helpful to <a href="WikiNewbie.html">WikiNewbie</a>s. He understood that <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a> is due to the dedication of many <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s, <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a>s, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>E</strong>ager to learn more, Tim traveled deeper and deeper into <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>. However, the deeper he traveled the darker it became. Filled with contradiction and <a href="WikiWar.html">WikiWar</a>s, somewhere along the line, the WikiSpirit had broken. <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s throughout <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> have been stopped in their tracks via <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, SignedComments, and <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>s. Smelling of disaster from the <a href="BigWikiFireOfDoubleOught.html">BigWikiFireOfDoubleOught</a> to more recent <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s, <a href="TheWikiWay.html">TheWikiWay</a> somehow carries on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>T</strong>hinking about everything he learned from <a href="GoodStyle.html">GoodStyle</a>, to <a href="PatternMatching.html">PatternMatching</a>, and from the <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a> to <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a>, he was reminded of a saying from a long time ago. <em></em>ItWorksIfYouWorkIt<em> As new as he is to wiki, Tim believes in </em><a href="TheWikiWay.html">TheWikiWay</a> and the LifeForce planted by <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>. With his team of <a href="InvitedAuthors.html">InvitedAuthors</a> and all those that have come and gone, Ward has inspired this <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a>. In honor of <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> and all of the <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a>s of <a href="TheOriginalWiki.html">TheOriginalWiki</a>, I invite you to join in on <strong></strong><a href="CleaningWardsWiki.html">CleaningWardsWiki</a><strong>.</strong>
