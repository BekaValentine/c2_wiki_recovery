        <a href="TimDiggins.html">TimDiggins</a> is a <crossedout><em>relatively new</em></crossedout> <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> convert living at <a href="http://www.red56.co.uk/">http://www.red56.co.uk/</a> some of the time, and at <a href="mailto:tim@red56.co.uk">mailto:tim@red56.co.uk</a> most of the time.

        <crossedout><em>The working day I'm to be found within </em><a href="http://www.teamworks.co.uk">http://www.teamworks.co.uk</a> being a New Media Director, whatever that might prove itself to be (too new to know, really).<em></crossedout> [nb: never really found out]</em>

        Now just started at Xerox Research Labs (XRCE-Cambridge) working on the Multiple Intimate Media Environments Project. Day 2 and I'm working out what kind of wiki we need (of course, it's not a question of whether, it's a question of what).
      </p>
      <p>
        I've set up a few wikis (what does it matter what else I've done, eh?), including one for ex-pats of the company I used to work for (Teamworks, now defunct).  A success was when the Finance Director managed to change her own telephone number (slowly, slowly). Still, no-one really cottoned onto the GeekWord concept, hence few new any pages. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm very interested in the modulation of the use of wikis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           using basic Wiki markup in general for display of text files
        </li>
        <li>
           (optional) alterable ownership rights for (extending) wiki to a mixture of edit and go and 
        </li>
        <li>
           (optional) templates for wiki files - resulting in a kind of freeform database.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But having just found out (via c2Wiki!) of <a href="XeroxSparrow.html">XeroxSparrow</a>, I'll check that out too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think what <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> has done with the Wiki concept in <a href="ThoughtsWeaver.html">ThoughtsWeaver</a> seems very interesting.
