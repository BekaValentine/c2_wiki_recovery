        Network Byte Order
      </h1>
      <p>
        The standard byte order of 16/32/64 bit quantities for <a href="TcpIp.html">TcpIp</a> transport is <a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Berkely socket API defines functions ntohs/htons/ntohl/htonl to convert 16/32 bit quantities between host and network byte order.

        <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>: why was this chosen?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There was a coin flip. The </em><a href="LittleEndian.html">LittleEndian</a> partisans called tails. The coin (I believe it was a J.F.K. fifty cent piece once owned by J. Geils Band drummer Stephen Jo Bladd) landed on heads. The rest, as they say, is history.<em></em>

        You're pulling my leg! Surely it must be because the initial computers on the internet/arpanet were also <a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a>?
