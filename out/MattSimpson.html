        I work for IBM in their knowledge management corporate office. I've been building support for communities of practice since 1990 (having fun doing it, as a hobby, instead of my dissertation). Now, I'm mostly concerned about org. change, org. dev., knowledge management, CoP, business transformation... that stuff. You can find me via email at matthew AT undertheoak DOT net.

        I've installed my own Wiki at <a href="http://undertheoak.net">http://undertheoak.net</a> and am trying to figure out what to do with it. At first it was a Twiki (see <a href="TwikiClone.html">TwikiClone</a>). Then it was a <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a>. Then it was a JSPWiki. Now it is a <a href="PmWiki.html">PmWiki</a>.

        Read your note on <a href="WikiFiction.html">WikiFiction</a>. I might be interested in getting involved. What did you have in mind? -- <a href="JasonYip.html">JasonYip</a>

        I also read your note on <a href="WikiFiction.html">WikiFiction</a>. I hope you'll stop by the site I mentioned. If you can help in any way, or if you have any suggestions, I'd certainly appreciate it. That goes for you too, <a href="JasonYip.html">JasonYip</a>. -- BradleySimmons

        Matthew, are you still of the belief that the <a href="MontyHallProblem.html">MontyHallProblem</a> is 50/50? -- <a href="JeremyCromwell.html">JeremyCromwell</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        No... We discussed this at length via email, right? And I have logged that inside on the <a href="MontyHallProblem.html">MontyHallProblem</a> page. Thanks Jeremy. -- <a href="MattSimpson.html">MattSimpson</a>

        April, 2003 - Wow! I just figured out how to run my own <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a> without worrying about any kind of nonsense with cgi or html server on windows, or any other kind of special software. <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> runs completely on its own without a hitch! Now I can even write some documents for package and deliver by using wiki! -- <a href="MattSimpson.html">MattSimpson</a>

        The invite you put on various pages will be noticed if put on the <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> Page only. -- vk
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course it will by some.  And it will be less missed when put on all Eddie pages.  It's just a harmless one-liner and I wanted to catch everyone's attention using all those pages.  Not everyone reads <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. -- ms

      <p>
        Winter, Spring, Summer 2002 - Used <a href="UseMod.html">UseMod</a> a lot. In total, I setup about 5 wikis with that engine. -- MS

      <p>
        Fall 2002 - My webhost provider reported a crash. All data lost and unrecoverable. -- MS
      </p>
      <p>
        Jan 2003 - Finally invested the time to get the site up and running again... data gone... significant blow. -- MS
      </p>
      <p>
        Spring 2003 - Webhost goes bankrupt - wells assets to another company - new company non-responsive. -- MS

        June 29, 2003 - Recently, I've decided to align my wiki hobby with my employer's future (WebSpherePortalServer) and have found a new web service that can support JSPs. I'm working on JSPWiki now, trying to figure it out. Of course I have to educate myself about Apache, Tomcat, and JavaVM. I've also learned that PHP can be cool too. - <a href="MattSimpson.html">MattSimpson</a>

          _01_01 What the heck was I doing?... Why did I show up so much on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>?... I was just changing my name from Matthew to Matt (sorry for the noise, ye reader of recent changes ;-)
