        Maybe Ward could change the CGI to output a page with HTTP refresh on it? I could put the page on my <a href="ActiveDesktop.html">ActiveDesktop</a>(tm) and the browser would refresh every five minutes. :-)

        That's because I didn't want to tell people how to do it - to minimize the number of people auto-refreshing the <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> page, but still showing the very interested the path there.

        How about an RSS feed for <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>? That would reduce the load if properly set up and still produce up to date results.
