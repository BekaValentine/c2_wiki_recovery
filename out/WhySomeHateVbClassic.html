        Why Some Hate Vb Classic
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> is <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> from <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> which has had its support removed, but which continues to be used with good effect by many regardless. It is a language which can create Executable files through a project system which integrates Visual and non-Visual components in a single Dot Exe file which handles both.

        Strange definition of "average."  If most programmers would not find Python easy, that would seem to say the average programmer would not find Python easy.  There is no reason to imply that if one does not find Python easy, then one is a below average programmer.

        The topic <a href="WhySomeHateVbClassic.html">WhySomeHateVbClassic</a> appears to overlap <a href="ThingsWeHateAboutVbClassic.html">ThingsWeHateAboutVbClassic</a>. What is the difference, and if there is none, perhaps it should be divided up into an intro in outline form and a "discussion" topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The difference apparent perhaps only in the titles is that one involves hating the entire thing, while the other involves a strange mixture of hatred and love, involving the things within it.  The first involves shunning, the second would infer things that might and perhaps should be fixed. The first involves hatred based on loving something else more, the second on perhaps wanting to love </em><a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> more."
      </p>
      <p>
        Another difference arises from those who use it effectively and those who do not, and from the sensible use of alternatives which better fit the task at hand, versus the blind adherence to a <strong>single</strong> language or methodology as the <strong>best</strong> language to use. <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a> a great deal on what one wishes to accomplish and what one has available in the work area and environment in which one is to accomplish it. It may also have a little to do with who is paying you, and what they want you to use, and how imperative it is to accomplish your programming tasks in final and operable form using the least possible amount of time. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

      <p>
        The disdain shown here for <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> as a language is only explicable by crass ignorance, and the superficiality of associating the culture of those using Vb with the language itself. In reality <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> has always been quite a good display of sensible language design.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the great features of Vb is that it has optional and keyword parameters, and that alone puts VB way and above C#, and competing with Java. So, the language is also good for CRAP programmers. This is a quality to be admired. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As for those programmers pretending to be so much better, all we can tell is that if Pascal was good for Wirth and Knuth, then Python is not the only thing you're lacking in order to be able to write software masterpieces. It can be done in VB just like it has been done in Pascal. Actually it probably has been done already in VB.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just to note, that "CRAP" is an acronym for "Create, Replace, Alter, Purge", not necessarily a cussword appearing on kindly wiki.

        <em>Then why not say </em>'CRUD<strong> (Create, Replace, Update, Delete)? See </strong><a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>. There are many variations on the acronym.<em></em>

        Many years ago, I spent a year doing nothing but tutoring university students. It wasn't in VB or <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, but in C++, the poor little lambs. Now I'm not certain that university students qualify as "below average", and I'm not certain that my experience generalizes to your satisfaction, but it's my leg and I'm gonna stand on it. If you'd like to continue to insist that weird, cranky, old VB has some kind of advantage for beginners over elegant, clean, little Python, I'd appreciate it ever so much if you'd explain in concrete terms what that advantage might be. <a href="PrettyPlease.html">PrettyPlease</a>? -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        VB is so similar to python ... it's hard to say which is to be preferred over the other. However, I'd say if I were to develop a command-line tool, python is the way to go. Unit Test is a standard module in python. If I wanted to teach UI development, for instance, the concept of event handlers will come across as foreign to new developers, it is easier to climb VB's learning curve than developing with <a href="WxPython.html">WxPython</a> or Tk, both of which requires understanding of OO or event loops. When teaching debugging, VB again comes up on top for their superior debugger.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           VB and python are extremely similar? Is this a widespread view, or an idiosyncratic one to you? Or do you mean in the same sense that Java and C++ are similar?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This has been spelled out several times already, in my view.

        It comes as one complete, integrated thing, including the GUI builder. I can buy a book on Visual Basic programming from even a poor bookstore. It's easy to build noddy programs in. It requires no real expertise to install. Any number of computer magazines have articles on how to write stuff in it. <em>What does a GUI builder have to do with anything? I've been a professional programmer for five years and I have never used one. -- </em><a href="BrianRobinson.html">BrianRobinson</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(see below for my answer to this...)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not a novice programmer, but I have looked at <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a>. I don't think it's a GUI builder, and even if it was, it's not packaged [a package?] for programming by novices. Have you actually used Zope for that? Are you really claiming a novice can install it?
      </p>
      <p>
        If your response is that Python _can_ have a GUI builder, I haven't got my point over. Asking the novice programmer, possibly quite unsure about computers, and knowing little of programming, to install Python, and select and install a GUI builder is just not reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're a novice programmer, with no real intention of ever becoming an expert one (you just want to print flyers for the membership of your local trainspotting <em>(hmm, I see a </em><a href="BritishCulturalAssumption.html">BritishCulturalAssumption</a>)<em> club, index your CD collection, or whatever), then VB is a reasonable way of getting started.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This strikes me as rather snide. But these applications are well-suited</em>
        to Access. People can and do build more serious projects in VB.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're not a novice, or take up development more seriously, VB will be limiting, and things you have learnt by using VB may hold you back.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's cheap, near ubiquitous, relatively simple, and requires little knowledge of programming or installing and configuring packages. If you insist on calling below average programmers "crap", then yes, it is a good tool for people of limited programming ability and no particular desire to become better.

        In answer, to your post as a whole but to the above-commented paragraph in particular: So do other languages that are not VB. Delphi anyone? Plenty of books in the bookstore for it, completely integrated, an outstanding GUI builder, lots of add-in components for it, a real compiler not an interpreter, a clean, orthogonal object framework, and a nice clean language. Or if you really want to do something simple and don't care about the quality of the language, you could probably use a so-called 'multimedia authoring package' and get the same effect, and it'd hold your hand every step of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why use VB, which only has some, not all, of those things, and doesn't seem to provide anything special of its own that the others do not? "Do you want Product A with X, Y and Z, or product B with only Y?" 
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't want to harp on about this, but no-one provides me with a satisfactory answer and until they do, and as long as people keep saying but-VB-has-a-GUI-builder while ignoring other languages possessing GUI builders that are as good or better, I shall feel perfectly entitled keep harping on. ;} -- <a href="CanisLupus.html">CanisLupus</a>

        It's true that Delphi has a good integrated IDE. But a bookstore in Sydney has about four shelves of VB books, and no Delphi books. And the syntax is terribly complicated. I could probably get the semicolons right. Pity the beginners!
      </p>
      <p>
        I really take issue with this statement. The Delphi syntax (when you're not point'n'clicking) is pure Object Pascal. A language which, in Australia, is taught to High School students as their first language with good success. Beyond this, I have personally taught a class of "CRUD" programmers pascal in 4 days, with success. In fact, the biggest problem was the inability to introduce a GUI into the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real clincher is the Delphi lesson a technophobe was given by a delphi master friend of mine. By the end of 3 hours she was coding, and the next day I couldn't convince her she had actually been programming! She found the syntax to be "almost English", and "not complicated like that programming stuff". I'm afraid that in 15 years I have found absolutely no evidence to support your assertion, and ample evidence to the contrary. -- <a href="AndraeMuys.html">AndraeMuys</a>

I like <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> - I'm not too embarrassed to admit that - AND I LIKE IT BECAUSE I CAN GET AN AWFUL LOT TO SHOW FOR MY EFFORT IN A VERY SHORT TIME. Another thing I like is that it's a great example of a language where a little bit of software engineering goes a long way. If you approach a <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> project with no software engineering discipline, you can get a  lot of functionality put together in a hurry - and then spend the rest of your life wrestling with that functionality. IF YOU APPLY A LITTLE DISCIPLINE, THERE AREN'T ANY SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS TO WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT {What have I been saying for 2 years here - it's incompetence, not the language].

        [JV] How broadly applicable is the knowledge and experience you've gained with VB?
      </p>
      <p>
        [SM}: It certainly was useful for me to have done low-level programming earlier in my career - some assembly language programming, low-level C programming, working directly with the OS calls, or even the hardware in some cases. It's nice to get a sense of exactly what's going on at a lower level than VB gives you. At the same time, though, the direction of PROGRESS in computing seems to be towards higher and higher-level languages. As something of an old-timer in the industry, I would say, yeah, everyone should have some experience working at a low level. But I'm not sure whether that's true or whether I think everybody else should go through the same development process I did!
      </p>
      <p>
        [JV} The specter is that as a VB virtuoso I'd miss a bend in the road that requires a radically different toolset if not mindset, like say, a wireless app.

      <p>
        [SM} Well, I don't know. I think <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> is today's VCobol, and there's a huge amount of development work going into it. I wouldn't bet against it.

        <em>Unix and </em><a href="MsDos.html">MsDos</a> were each written to accomplish many similar tasks on much different machines. As one who has worked with Basic for 30 years, I have found the language to improve with age. It is not like others which are received, worked with, and then discarded in as short a time as 18 months. While others come and go, Basic seems to hang on. Why?, because it has been extended to include the good features of languages programming experts adopt and then discard.

It certainly didn't have any of the modern control structures and such (all there was was "if...goto <linenum>" and "if...gosub <linenum>"), but on the other hand, in a way, it was a very simple and clean language. -- <a href="StefanVorkoetter.html">StefanVorkoetter</a>

        You should try programming in KCML, that's a real head ache! It's a language derived from old BASIC 2C from the Wang 2200 machine. Doing development and maintenance work in that stuff really makes you appreciate the simplicity of VB and VB.NET. Those line numbers were a nightmare!!
