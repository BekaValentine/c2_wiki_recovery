        Online Information Services

      <p>
        Online Information Services were established as the growing interest in ComputerEnthusiasts of conversing, sharing and establishing contact one with another. They were the natural evolution from the successful BulletinBoardSystems which reached its peak as InternetAccess became available to a wider audience. Initially users connected to the service just as they had with the BulletinBoardSystems using Telephone Modems beginning at speeds of 300 baud to higher speeds, eventually reaching 56 Kbaud on regular phone lines. The <a href="OnlineInformationServices.html">OnlineInformationServices</a> have since migrated to the Internet, becoming major factors for certain segments of the market.
