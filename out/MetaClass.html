        There are lots of good OO languages without metaclasses.  While certainly useful, they aren't absolutely necessary--and many programming tasks can get by without them.  Regarding java.lang.Class; it certainly isn't a metaclass in the sense that standard-class (from <a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a>) is; one cannot do <a href="MetaObjectProtocol.html">MetaObjectProtocol</a> stuff in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>.  OTOH, java.lang.Class is a first-class object, and it does provide introspection capabilities on classes in Java.

        <em>As I said, others "might" say a language without metaclasses is broken, and not really object oriented.  I was referring to Smalltalkers of course.  From the </em><a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> point of view, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> isn't fully object oriented, nor is <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> nor <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.  Java.lang.Class is a first class object that you can't change; it's equivalent to C#'s Type class, and while useful, isn't a metaclass.  For example, a real metaclass would allow me to change method lookup to allow <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>.<em></em>
