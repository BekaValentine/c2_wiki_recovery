        Semaphores For Mutual Exclusion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Semaphores are things intended to pass signals between
        independent threads or processes.  A process can 
        <em>wait</em> on a semaphore: this means it                                   is suspended 
        until some other process <em>signals</em> the semaphore.
        If the semaphore has already been signaled, however,
        when the process waits, it doesn't actually suspend,
        but just continues right on through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Semaphores for mutual exclusion are a sub-category
        of all semaphores.  They are used to block access to
        a resource, usually.  If you have a socket that only
        one process can use at a time, and you have multiple
        processes that use the socket, then each process
        can have code like this (pseudocode):
      </p>
      <code>
        socket_semaphore wait().<br/>
        code_to_use_socket().<br/>
        socket_semaphore signal().<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Start all the processes and signal the semaphore once.
        One of the waiting processes will get to go; then it
        will signal the semaphore, and another process waiting
        will go; etc.
      </p>

        In <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> Smalltalk, you can create a semaphore that
        already has the initial signal mentioned above, by
        the code <em>Semaphore forMutualExclusion</em>. --<a href="DanaAnthony.html">DanaAnthony</a>
