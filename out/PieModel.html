        Pie Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="PieModel.html">PieModel</a> is a mental model that allows you to perform tasks. I developed the model because I wanted to make sure that I and others perform tasks in an organized manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has three basic phases: <strong>P</strong>lanning, <strong>I</strong>mplementation, and <strong>E</strong>valuation.  (sort of before you do the task, while you do the task, and after you do the task).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's how I use it:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           I know that there are different mental modes to each phase.  In the <strong>P</strong> mode I have to be creative, think about all the options, generate some new ones, think about pitfalls, pros and cons, etc.  In the <strong>I</strong> mode I need to be aggressive in following the plan, not get distracted, make sure my plan is logical, and be result oriented.  In the <strong>E</strong> mode I have to be reflective, really think about what I was doing, generate lessons for the future.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The <strong>PIE</strong> is recursive because each phase may include internal <strong>PIE</strong>s. I have to plan the <strong>P</strong>, implement the <strong>P</strong>, and evaluate the <strong>P</strong>. Each phase may include several <strong>PIE</strong>s. The <strong>I</strong> part may include 3 subparts each with a whole <strong>PIE</strong> in it.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The <strong>PIE</strong> is especially good when you communicate to yourself or others what you are now doing. If you are in <strong>P</strong>, or <strong>I</strong> or <strong>E</strong> you expect different kinds of inputs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you have more ideas or questions about this let me know.

        <strong>PIE</strong> seems to be an abbreviated version of the <a href="SystemsMethod.html">SystemsMethod</a>.
