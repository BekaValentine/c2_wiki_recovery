        Correlation Does Not Imply Causality
      </h1>
      <p>
        Simply because you see X followed by Y many times, or always see X in the presence of Y it does not mean that X causes Y.

        <em>My favorite class of example runs along the following lines. There is a strong correlation between aspirin use and tendency to headaches. Nobody is tempted to conclude that aspirin causes headaches.</em>

        <dd>A lot of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things. They don't realize that there's this like lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything. I'll give you an example, show you what I mean. Suppose you are thinking about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp. Out of the blue, no explanation. No point in looking for one either. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness. </dd>
