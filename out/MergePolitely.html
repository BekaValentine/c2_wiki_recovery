        Merge Politely
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some call this Wiki a jungle, others call it a community. Both seem to agree they like the mental competition, but not social competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, the Wiki jungle lets good concepts compete for dominance and emerge refined!
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately those good concepts often emerge in several places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately the Wiki is conducive to merging!
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately many are nervous about merging other's pages. Even those who wish to try and help also don't want to do the wrong thing.

        What is the way to <a href="MergePolitely.html">MergePolitely</a>?

      <p>
        <strong>Example of the problution:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's politely merge "jungle" and "community" into "communglty".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>why not junmunity?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, let's politely merge "junmunity" and "communglty" into "juncomungunilty".  I'm sure if we keep politely merging everything then everyone will eventually be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm offended, you completely ignored comjunmunity!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, just one more time and I'm sure we'll all be happy.  Let's politely merge "juncomungunilty" and "comjunmunity" into "juncomunjungunitility".  That's it.  This wiki is now one big happy juncomunjungunitility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As a Freudian, I take issue with your obviously pro-Jungian bias</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can avoid that disgreement by politely merging "Freud" and "Jung" to produce "Freung", and updating "juncomunjungunitility" to "juncomunfreungunitility".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why does jun come before freung?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to politely merge your ass out of here now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Maybe we should just tag this whole section as "example of the problem"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or an example of the solution.
      </p>

        The takeaway thought here is to <a href="JfDi.html">JfDi</a>, because they won't be happy if you don't, and won't be happy if you do.
