        <a href="BlackBerry.html">BlackBerry</a> is a brandname for a <a href="PersonalDigitalAssistant.html">PersonalDigitalAssistant</a> that had a phenomenal growth in popularity, partly due to its good on-the-fly email and <a href="WirelessSecurity.html">WirelessSecurity</a> features. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the features of this unit require subscription to specialized <a href="BlackBerry.html">BlackBerry</a> services.

        The device uses a proprietary operating system but there are <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> based models. Comments were made that this helped <a href="BlackBerry.html">BlackBerry</a> <a href="SecurityManagement.html">SecurityManagement</a> features stand out amongst competitive <a href="WirelessDevices.html">WirelessDevices</a>.

        I looked at a mid05 glossay for a <a href="BlackBerry.html">BlackBerry</a> model 7100g. It claimed email attachments can be downloaded and viewed, including graphics, PDFs, word docs, etc. It also supporting viewing of HTML (and WAP) web pages. I am impressed.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Is it one of those <a href="AlmostTrue.html">AlmostTrue</a> thing with hidden gotchas?
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>No, it actually works.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Any idea whether people use it to view PDF attachments much? Seems to me very difficult to use a "viewport" as a sole means to view a regular sized document. Unless there is a printer that will print these out back to normal size, and that means it is again in an office somewhere.

        Sadly, after pretty much inventing the <a href="SmartPhone.html">SmartPhone</a>, it was swiftly killed by <a href="AppleIphone.html">AppleIphone</a> and <a href="GoogleAndroid.html">GoogleAndroid</a> apparently because it was unable to adapt and successfully compete against the new TouchScreen devices. More on why it failed here: <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/the-inside-story-of-why-blackberry-is-failing/article14563602/?page=all">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/the-inside-story-of-why-blackberry-is-failing/article14563602/?page=all</a>
