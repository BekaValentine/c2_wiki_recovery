        Internet Programming Languages Pros And Cons

        <strong>Presentation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a revolution in programming languages that started when the Web, and consequently the wider Internet, became mainstream around 1994. Perhaps the revolution was so gradual, it happened over such a long period of time that few people noticed it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Gradually, a few programming languages took over and became Internet linguas francas: <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>.  <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> are still used by some sites where efficiency and speed are critical (notably Infoseek and Google), but many Internet developers prefer languages that allow them faster development time.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the advantage of each of these programming languages for Internet applications? . What are its disadvantages?  <em>If this page has any value, it should relate specifically to Internet applications, not to general language issues.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This site aims to compare languages for server-side CGI.</em>

      <p>
        <strong>C/C++ as an Internet language</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pros</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Speed and efficiency when large-scale computing is accomplished in a single HTTP transaction. (e.g., Google, Infoseek)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Cons</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ease of writing code vulnerable to security attacks (particularly buffer overflows)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Although the most common buffer overflows are easily avoided by modern programmers who know better than to use gets/strcpy etc. <em>It's a shame that not too many of these "modern programmers" seem to exist :(</em> Yeah...well...but also there's just a lot of legacy code that seems to only get fixed one security alert at a time. :-(
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           It takes a lot of code & development time to get anything done in languages as low-level as this (in tradeoff for execution speed, sometimes) compared to some other options on this page.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Java as an Internet language</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pros</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Large commercial support base.  Plenty of tools available, and manufacturers to go to for support
        </li>
        <li>
           Large marketing department pushing it as "The" language for enterprise development
        </li>
        <li>
           Application servers (J2EE, <a href="WebLogic.html">WebLogic</a>) for scaleable web-based applications.
        </li>
        <li>
           Has a decent "sandbox" model to reduce leaking control.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Cons</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           High execution overhead for CGI.
        </li>
        <li>
           Dedicated, large-footprint server for AppServer alternative
        </li>
        <li>
           API designed primarily for divided-labor large-org architects rather than smaller-project end-users.
        </li>
        <li>
           Lack of dynamic language features is not popular with many.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Perl as an Internet language</strong>

        <strong>Pros</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Top-notch string processing.  Most websites are simple text manipulation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Related to the above: numerous templating systems. Template Toolkit, Mason, various modules that deal with XML and XSLT and so on
        </li>
        <li>
           Absolutely huge collection of modules (<a href="TheCpan.html">TheCpan</a>) that are easy to install
        </li>
        <li>
           Many scripts available for the download.
        </li>
        <li>
           Can be configured to execute within the server's process space, bypassing the CGI overhead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Cons</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cryptic syntax that's a mix of several language heritages: <a href="BourneShell.html">BourneShell</a>, C and awk.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>PHP as an Internet language</strong>
      </p>

        <strong>Pros</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Can be embedded in HTML; seen as a dedicated web language.
        </li>
        <li>
           Deceptively simple to learn.
        </li>
        <li>
           Touted as a good beginner language.
        </li>
        <li>
           Large array of built-in functions for everything from PDF creation to credit-card transactions to database interaction
        </li>
        <li>
           Available at a majority of hosting services
        </li>
        <li>
           Relatively good integration with apache.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Cons</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           While the runtime services are good, the language itself is quite horrible
        </li>
        <li>
           Encourages writing bad code ^2 <em>{too vague}</em>'
        </li>
        <li>
           PHP implementation is full of bugs and might change semantics without a note, causing constant security upgrades that break your code
          <ul>
            <li>
               What language doesn't have this problem (other than being so old that it doesn't need to change or used so rarely that hackers don't bother with it -- AKA "Mac syndrome".)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           PHP encourages writing web programs in an insecure manner
        </li>
        <li>
           Not too fast (good for building database interfaces, not making calculations)
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>
           Easiness of linking in C code when efficiency is needed
        </li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Cons</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>

           sometimes hard to pick the right server integration technology (standalone server? CGI? Zope? mod_python?)
        </li>
        <li>
           Unusual syntax (white-space usage, etc.) frightens away some people used to C-style syntax.
