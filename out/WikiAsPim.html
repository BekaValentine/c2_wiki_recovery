        <a href="MiniRubyWiki.html">MiniRubyWiki</a> is for a <a href="PersonalInformationManager.html">PersonalInformationManager</a> and for a team - not for the open Internet. For example, it cannot store page versions, and you can do things in-page that eat your server. But I'm not telling what.

        PlannerMode is a <a href="PersonalInformationManager.html">PersonalInformationManager</a> built on top of <a href="EmacsWikiMode.html">EmacsWikiMode</a>. Pages cannot be edited on the net (without an extension); they are all edited locally in Emacs. The nice thing is that the page in Emacs behaves just like a Wiki on the web (it's even much richer) - publishing is optional.

        A nice tool [MRW]! Thanks for providing it. I use it on memory-constrained devices like my Zaurus. So it is easy to have my personal wiki/notebook always with me, and I can sync it with my PC.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, it is an advantage that MRW doesn't have many dependencies and provides its own server.

        Per <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/10/">http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/10/</a> RodWaldhoff similarly does the hand-held <a href="MiniRubyWiki.html">MiniRubyWiki</a> thing - also in a Zaurus. Now why can't Fry's show me one???

        <a href="SdiDesk.html">SdiDesk</a> is a PIM application that works very, very like wiki.

        Most PIMs have tickler (reminders). Does any <a href="WikiAsPim.html">WikiAsPim</a> have similar features implemented nicely??

        If the definition of a wiki is a "collective tool", then it should not matter whether the information was collected globally or locally. I now view a wiki as any informational environment which allows you to easily create, edit, and establish (hyper-linked) relationships between text documents. Indeed, I use many a personal wiki on my computer as "information centers". For example, think of a topic that interests you (baseball), then go out on the internet and collect text information about different aspects of baseball which you want to interlink together (For example, "The BaseballPitcher throws a FastBall whenever he wants to StrikeOut the BaseballBatter".) By creating information in this way, with the wiki effect of simply clicking on a term and describing it in a new document, you can create entire <a href="MindMap.html">MindMap</a>s of text data very effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point is, wikis have tons of uses outside of just internet collaberation. I suggest instead of limiting the term to a particular medium, it should be opened up to describe the process used, rather then the use itself.
