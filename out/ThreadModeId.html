        A convention in on a thread in <a href="RestArchitecturalStyle.html">RestArchitecturalStyle</a>
        is interesting. A series of letters are used as a thread
        identifier. From the letters one can tell where a thread
        breaks into different threads and what section of text
        is replies to what other section of text. All without
        italics/bolds/lines/new pages etc.

        A severly edited example:
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: All these words about REST are wasted. Somewhere operation dispatching is happening. Does it really matter where?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: If scalability to the proportions of "the web" matters, then the short answer is "yes".
      </p>
      <p>
        AA: Can you explain? 
      </p>
      <p>
        AAA: Can you explain how REST equates to the location of "operation dispatching"? Have you read the dissertation?
      </p>
      <p>
        AAAA. Yes i have. 
      </p>
      <p>
        B. Is it possible that there are two different dimensions of scalability in this discussion? 
      </p>
      <p>
        BB. But what's the difference?
      </p>
      <p>
        BBB. The verbs are generic operations, and the genericity matters in this context. What are you looking to clarify?
      </p>
      <p>
        BBB. Clarfication on how it matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        BBBB. It may not matter, depending on what you care about.
      </p>
      <p>
        BBBBB. Filtering requires a common data format and a common filter language. 
      </p>
      <p>
        C. Universal methods + universal IDs = the Web. 
      </p>
      <p>
        CC. But remember this is because the semantics of the application are explicitly assumed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        CCC. The Web *is* a hypertext system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        CCCC. I'd agree if REST wasn't be proposed as the philospohically correct alternative to SOAP/XLM-RPC in general.
