        My God, how many rectilinear boxes within rectilinear boxes must we stare at today? How futile our lives have become. How little we understand beyond these keyboards and mice. The sky and the water have become just meaningless scenery for us, and we no longer know how to relate to anything natural. Our whole existence is squeezed into a metallic grey box embossed with corporate logos, and we have no way out except through these few pitiful words.

        Turn it off. Throw it away. Go live and crawl and struggle and die without it. At least then you will be free.
