        Interface Based Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        Programming where components establish contracts with each other via published interfaces.  Similar to <a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a>.  The latter focuses on the architecture and framework aspects of the entire application, while this page focuses only on the interface and communication aspects.

        [May not last long, as <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> is quickly removing references to information on pre<a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> architecture and technologies. A summary by someone with working knowledge may help those who have to maintain <a href="DistributedInternetArchitecture.html">DistributedInternetArchitecture</a> stuff.]

        Another article found on web: 
        <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kevinha/archive/2003/12/19/44653.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/kevinha/archive/2003/12/19/44653.aspx</a>
        Looks good but too much reading already.

        The article from ZDnet called "Microsoft steers away from object orientation" dated Jan2004 probably reported on the same conference that <a href="DonBox.html">DonBox</a> spoke. It is found at
        <a href="http://www.zdnet.co.uk/print/?TYPE=story&AT=39143730-39020387t-10000006c">http://www.zdnet.co.uk/print/?TYPE=story&AT=39143730-39020387t-10000006c</a> and
        the point that gets me thinking is:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Once <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a> is implemented, would <a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a> fade away, but <a href="InterfaceBasedProgramming.html">InterfaceBasedProgramming</a> continues, in a different format?" 
        What I ask may not make sense due to my limited knowledge. But that is how the community can help me, and though its efforts, help other readers later as well.
