        <em>Dates are often important enough to be remembered " - While in the process of gathering and organizing </em>PersonalInformation, it is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> on occasion to <a href="DateStamp.html">DateStamp</a> or DateTimeStamp in a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>. This can prove to be useful in the future in recapturing things RelatedButNotLinked. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> does not recognize dates or words containing dates or numbers as linkable artifacts. My own <a href="PersonalInformationManager.html">PersonalInformationManager</a> (<a href="NysLte.html">NysLte</a>) has mechanisms to handle such words and proves very useful since dates are important sign posts and remmmbrance hooks upon which information recovery depends. Think about it for a minute or so. We date any important artifact we endorse or sign. Businesses go to further extremes and record on a receipt or document not only date and time, but also the instrument and agent involved in transactions it makes, whether a receipt, a charge, a payment, or other transaction or ogreements. My information manager must make the recovery of records and data which uses as an indentifier such numeric and attendant matters.
