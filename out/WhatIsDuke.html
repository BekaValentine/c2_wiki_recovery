        Did you ever wonder what Duke, the mascot of <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, is supposed to be anyway? An alcoholic penguin or a metronome?

      <p>
        See <a href="http://java.sun.com/features/1999/05/duke.html">http://java.sun.com/features/1999/05/duke.html</a> - "Duke was actually a representation of the "software agent" that performed tasks for the user. The device that contained the user interface was called *7 (pronounced "star seven"), after a feature of the phone system in the Green Team's office."

        <strong>Misinterpretations of what Duke is:</strong>

        <em>(Ah, but how do we </em>'know<em>' that these are misinterpretations?</em>
        <em>Duke might </em>'really be<em>' one of these...	;-)</em>

        Duke looks like a <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> comm badge to me. -- <a href="ChanningWalton.html">ChanningWalton</a>

        I thought so too when I first saw him. So much so in fact, that I made a short animation of him touching his nose(requisite beedly boop noise), and beaming up 2 seconds later....'dillo

        And here I always thought Duke was a "planchette" (the reading puck) from a <a href="OuijaBoard.html">OuijaBoard</a>.

        I once saw a small child running away screaming "<strong>NO EYES!!!</strong>" when he saw a Duke mascot.

        <em>That proves it: Duke is </em><a href="CategoryEvil.html">CategoryEvil</a>. ;-><em></em>

        I tend to associate Duke with playing cards. He sort of resembles the "spade" glyph on a standard playing card deck, but without the tail.
