        Brute Force
      </h1>
      <p>
        Solving a problem by methodically plowing through all the possibilities. For example, solving the <a href="EightQueensProblem.html">EightQueensProblem</a> by generating all possible board positions. Does not scale well.

        <em>"When in doubt, use brute force"</em> -- <a href="KenThompson.html">KenThompson</a> (see the entry for "brute force" in the <a href="JargonFile.html">JargonFile</a> for more comment on this.)

        Ken probably also knew about <a href="BruteForce.html">BruteForce</a> from his experience programming chess computers.  An example of <a href="BruteForce.html">BruteForce</a> is Ken's hardware chess creation, Belle, which became world computer champion not because of any outstanding smarts, but because it could out-search the mainframe competition with special purpose chess-specific circuitry.

        On the flip side, <strong></strong>OptimiseLast<strong>!  Many times the brute force solution has adequate performance for much less complexity in design, development, and maintenance.  </strong>EncapsulateAlgorithms, and reimplement using a better algorithm when performance measurements and profiling indicate that the <a href="BruteForceSolutions.html">BruteForceSolutions</a> are the problem.   This is closely related to <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.

        It is also important to remember that just because an algorithm is O(n) does not mean it is superior to an O(n^3) solution for small values of n (however it does mean it will scale better, as mentioned above).  The additional complexity of many <em>better</em> algorthms can sometimes include large lower order terms.  As n gets bigger these terms become irrelevant, but for small n they can sometimes dominate.

        For <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> problems, <a href="BruteForce.html">BruteForce</a> is the fastest way to guarantee the correct solution. Not <em>fast</em>, but fastest. Fortunately in many of these problems, the correct solution is not needed, just a good-enough solution. -- <a href="RobHarwood.html">RobHarwood</a>

        Particularly with the processing power now available, let the processor do the programming. For instance, use immutable (or nearly so) objects for intermediate data, regenerating as required from the master. - <a href="DavidWright.html">DavidWright</a>
