           I don't claim "canonical" etc. I realize some things are relative and <strong>don't elevate my personal preferences to universal truths</strong>. Thus, it cannot be projection. <strong>I welcome alternative models</strong> of both heads and tools instead of belittle them for not being sanctioned by The Church of Overpaid Protectionist Academic Pseudoscientists. If I claimed canonical-ness, I too would be obligated to prove it's universal and not head-specific.

           [This page is an example of you elevating your personal preference to universal truth. It's also one you intend to only apply to your opponents as evidenced by your repeated use of insults in the various discussions about semantics you are currently involved in. I also find your claim to "welcome alternative models" to be unlikely as you consistently complain about any "models" that aren't of your own devising.]

           What exactly did I elevate? And I usually only insult back as retaliation. I do sometimes slip out of frustration, but I don't try to dress is it up as constructive criticism, like you guys often do. And without specific "complaints" identified, I cannot comment. Criticism of models is fair game (such as grokkability). And so are criticisms of claims that a given model is "canonical" without sufficient evidence. <strong>I don't claim my models are canonical</strong>.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "slip out of frustration" - that is simply untrue. There is no slip. You deliberately hit the save button after painstakingly entering the thought-bubble. That is not a slip, it is a deliberate action.

           [The "need" to earn the right to insult. And no, you did not typically insult in response to your opponents insults. It usually occurred when someone countered one of your points. Of course criticism is fair game, no one has said otherwise. However, consistently complaining about competing models, especially when the criticism is trivial (Whining about "do", "have", and "is" come to mind), does indicate an unwillingness to "welcome alternative models".]

        <li>
           I disagree about the context of my insults. And what do you mean "trivial"? Those words ARE vague; meant for the human world, not the virtual world of machines. That's a problem with English, <em>not</em> me. Your explanations <em>pivoted</em> on such words such that they were not "trivial" in our discussion. I didn't invent irrelevant problems out of the blue, YOUR explanations relied on such fuzz words. (See also <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a>). You guys even <strong>admitted</strong> English (as typically used) was too vague for rigorous or detailed analysis, and proposed a different notation instead if precision was the true goal. (Search "There's an inevitable point where" in <a href="TypesAndAssociations.html">TypesAndAssociations</a>.) If I had made a big deal out of NON pivot-able words, your complaint may have been legitimate. But, that's not the case. Even if you ask regular people whether "do work" means the process (go through the motions) or the "results", you'll probably get a roughly even split, and many saying "both". These words are <strong>ambiguous even in the human world</strong>. Much of the time the difference doesn't matter much. However, for detailed science and analysis, those differences do matter, such as whether programming languages are defined/compared by their processing or results (I/O). Therefore, defining them verbally by "what they <strong>do</strong>" is not clear.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [You can disagree all you want, but the context is still there and you clearly are not insulting others in response to their insulting you. By "trivial" I meant what is usually meant by "trivial", "Of little value or importance." As for the amount of rigor, for the purposes of our discussions here, the amount of rigor supplied by the English language is usually sufficient. There certainly wasn't any problems with the words you complained about. We even offered to use a more rigorous language than English if you preferred. You never took us up on it. (BTW, "do work" couldn't possibly mean either "process" or "results". Both of those are nouns, while "do work" is not.)]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You guys were the ones who made big deals about such words. You said it was "wrong" that I had values "in" variables. First, you didn't say where that no-in rule came from exactly, and second, it looked like your "values" were ALSO "in" variables, per normal interpretation of "in" per XML. And, no, English is NOT sufficient for our needs, especially around anal and nit-picky people. I gave plenty of examples in <a href="TypesAndAssociations.html">TypesAndAssociations</a> of English ambiguities. Frankly, I doubt most programmers care that much about an official or "proper" definition of "value". But you claimed it would kill mental puppies if I used it in the alleged wrong way I did. Thus, the whining over words is from you. I try to avoid dependence on words because they are messy.

           I did not fail. You did not prove that alternative interpretations I provided were objectively or survey-wise "wrong".

           I felt that I didn't clearly explain why "interpretation path produces a different [second] result" was a problem produced by your text in the original, so I fleshed out exactly why it was a problem. In the first version, I successfully identified a duality, but one could come back and say, "So what? What's wrong with duality?" The revision answers that better. We discussed a similar example elsewhere before such that at the time I may have felt a brief version was good enough, but if one encounters such text without that history or memory of, then it could be confusing. -t

        <li>
           {Actually, we said it is wrong that the structure you use to represent variables has an explicit 'type' attribute.  You turned that into a peculiar quibble over "in", "has", etc.  It had nothing to do with "values 'in' variables".}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Fine, "has". But that's equivalent to "in" as I interpret it in that context, and you never provided proof it's not equivalent, nor defined a way to validate if has-ness is taking place or not. A non-falsifiable definition is not useful (meaning there must be a clear way to say something is "not an X" or does not qualify, such as "X does not have a Y".). Saying it was "has" instead of "in" does not change the fundamental problem. <strong>The real problem seems to be that you mistake your personal interpretation of such words for external truths.</strong> You are willfully blind to subjectivity, mistaking your mind for the center of the universe. You have a problem. (I'm in the process of reviewing and clarifying my descriptions of the identified ambiguities in <a href="TypesAndAssociations.html">TypesAndAssociations</a> to ensure they are clear.)

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           And I'd bet money that with the XML: <x><y></x>, most programmers would agree that "x <strong>has</strong> a y". I'd then wave the money in your face to shock your stubborn brain into the reality of popular usage and your minority subjectivity. Maybe social embarrassment would wake up your stubborn mind to the fact you are out of touch with the field. (Neither answer is clearly "wrong", since there is no established or enforced usage pattern for such context. However, it's STUPID to keep assuming and insist to others there is such a language rule without collecting solid evidence of usage first. That's why I believe you to be a stubborn dumbass. You hallucinate canonicality to match your pet subjective models of BOTH language and IT.)

      <ul>

           {Insults, again?  You appear to resort to insults whenever you're caught making an error.  Yes, given the XML "<x><y></x>", I'm sure most programmers would agree that "x <strong>has</strong> a y".  However, that wasn't what the debate was about. You define variables as <variable type="..." value="..." name="..."/>, so your variable has an explicit 'type' attribute.  I've pointed out that as dynamically-typed languages are conventionally understood, variables don't have a type and values do.  In other words, an appropriate definition would be <variable name="..."><value representation="..." type="..."/></variable>.  In response, you claim that a variable still "has a type" because it contains a value, and a value has a type attribute.  I disagree, because a variable does not have (nor does it need) an explicit "type" attribute.  So, the debate was about whether variables "have a type" or not.  However, it's a completely irrelevant debate, because dynamically-typed languages never need make reference to a variable's type, regardless whether "a variable's type" is an explicit attribute in variables (which your model has), or obtainable from any variable via the value it contains.}

           You imply it often.

           Either way, you have not given enough info for the reader or I to verify your association claim of insults versus correctness. Further, if you feel I'm right on an issue, maybe you end the sub-topic and move on, reducing frustration. If you obsess on point that seems either clearly wrong or unverifiable or whacky world-play to me, then I'll get frustrated and insult. Thus, the cause may be something else than correctness. Agreement doesn't generate the long battles. You are making cause-based conclusions even though there are many valid alternative cause possibilities here. It's similar to your interpretation of text: you fail to consider alternative interpretations; instead assuming your pet interpretation path is the One and True. It appears your mind "bets the farm" on your earliest interpretation, and stubbornly defends that version despite any new evidence. Whether this is ego protection or some other personality flaw, I cannot tell yet.

If it appears I've ended a sub-topic without comment, it's either because I've missed it (and so may return to it later) or because it appears the discussion has reached a resolution or conclusion -- which isn't necessarily agreement -- that no longer warrants a response.  I suggest that if you feel compelled to employ insults, please try to resist, as they add nothing to the discourse and reflect poorly on your credibility.  As for considering alternative interpretations et al, I certainly do.  I have considered your alternative model of interpreters, and I feel strongly that it promulgates confusion, and therefore I object to it.}

           You've rarely agreed I was right about anything such that the "testing problem" remains. As far as "promulgates confusion", you appear to be using your own mind as a reference specimen to study "confusion", which is probably a very poor choice of test specimen. You don't think or talk like regular programmers, and you've had too much exposure to hardware-centric issues and specific interpreter implementations, which creates experience that does not match the experience profile the target audience, regardless of your general intelligence or lack of it.

           And the relationship between "variable", "value", and "type" is NOT clearly established in app language manuals (not interpreter/compiler writing books). If there was a clear relationship established, and you gave several examples from actual sources, and they clearly contradicted my model, you may have a point. As it stands, you have failed to do that kind of "word usage mining" to establish a clear-cut and common usage pattern of those 3 things. (This includes the total surveyed. It's poor practice and bad science to only report on or keep the samples that match your preconceived notions.)

Unfortunately, the definitive work in this area is not available on-line:  Each edition of Date and Darwen's <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> has gone to considerable lengths to define and clearly distinguish values, variables, and types, because Date and Darwen believe lack of clarity in defining and distinguishing them has resulted in some confusion.  Your own confusion over the three is characteristic.}

           The "relationship between them" would be typical things like "every X has one or more Y's associated with it and zero or one Z associated with it" and "If an Q has an R associated with it, then it must have at least two S's associated with it". Those quantity rules are easy to describe and expected from good docs. I don't know why so much writing on related topics skips such simple yet powerful info. Baffle. And D&D's model may be a functional model (it produces the right answers) but that by itself does NOT make it canonical. There are probably many "valid" models, per the I/O profile test. (Note that quantity rules per specific model and/or language are not necessary quantity rules per canonical model/definition. But I doubt there is any such canonical associations. Also "has relationship" can be messy if the property is calculated, such as parsing to see if a "value" can be interpreted as a number. But it may not be necessary to "calculate" such. It can be tracked with a tag-like indicator in some situations, such as from parsed literals, and display behavior identical to parse-based determination. Thus, making a distinction between a "calculated" type and an explicit type (tag) imposes an arbitrary implementation assumption into the wording. This is not the same as D1 versus D2, but more like D2 partially implemented with D1-like techniques when certain info is available, perhaps for speed. One cannot tell the difference from the I/O profile. Calling it parse-based (calculated) just may be the simpler <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>. Mentioning "parsing" needs to be done with care. We can only safely say an object "has the property of" something, and not describe whether it's from an attribute or calculation without imposing implementation assumptions. In both D1 and D2 languages, a given variable can be said to "have" or "produce" multiple types at the same time in some situations (such as "0" being used as a Boolean, Integer, and String). However, D1 languages have a <em>single</em> "primary type" (per scalar variable) regardless of the potential for having secondary types. This "primary type" has typically more influence than secondary types, and the existence of this single "special" type is what separates D1 from D2. But the difference between primary and secondary types can often be subtle, and this is the main source of confusion. One can usually ignore the existence of the difference and still get the right results a vast majority of the time; and thus programmers usually don't dwell on the differences, making spot fixes for any problems encountered. They don't dwell on specifics of value packaging. In my model, I chose to model the primary type as a single explicit attribute of a variable, and secondary types are modeled via parsing. That does not mean that parsing actually has to take place, but it's the simplest <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> and I do it to keep the model simple. It's good enough to match the I/O profile of the reference interpreters.)

           {The relationship between values, variables and types is so simple that those who understand it often assume everyone does, or only mention it in passing.  It's this:  A type is a set of values; a variable contains a value.  Furthermore, a literal is a string of symbols that denotes a value, so some values -- those belonging to the type 'string', for example -- can encode literals of other types.  That's why "0" can denote boolean, integer, and string values.}

           In dynamic languages, it's not simple, or at least not clear. It's possible for something to "be" a Boolean for one operator but "not be" for another. "Belonging to" is determined by the operator, not a "set of values" in a general <strong>global</strong> sense. Your description is fuzzy on when a set of values is what to who. You skip scope issues, leaving it vague, assuming people just magically know via the Semantics Ghost or something poorly explained. The devil's in the details. Explicitness in quantities and association application (scope) matters, IF you want to be clear to a wide audience.

      <ul>
        <li>
           {The fact that a value can be treated as boolean in one operator but be (say) numeric in another is fully accounted for by the fact that (as I wrote above) some values -- those belonging to the type 'string', for example -- can encode literals of other types.  That's why "0" can denote boolean, integer, and string values.  I'm not sure what you mean by "scope issues".}

           Your XML structure of a variable "has a type" per common usage of "has", period. Levels of nestedness don't de-has-ify in common usage. You insisted repeatedly that's false, when it's not. And my model of variable is NOT objectively wrong. If you want to provide linguistic usage statistics to show otherwise, please do. But so far it appears to be yet another <a href="AnecdoteImpasse.html">AnecdoteImpasse</a>. <strong>You make up interpreter rules and English rules willy nilly without solid evidence, insisting people just trust you</strong>, claiming it's part of some fake ghosty "common semantics", bullshit pseudoscience. I'm okay with allowing multiple models to live, as long as they fit the proper I/O profile. Whether the internals use variables, values, or foozglips is not something I'm going to get my panties in a knot about, unlike you. Let the models use whatever the hell they want internally.

           That's what summary accusations from existing debates tend to result in. My main point is that you are the one who quibbles about words because my model does not hinge on words and your complaints about it <em>does</em> appear to hinge in words (although I'm not quite sure because you refer to difficult to measure phenomena).

           {For something that doesn't hinge on words, I note that <a href="TopsTagModelTwo.html">TopsTagModelTwo</a> is surprisingly verbose and inclined to employ peculiar phrases (which appear to consist of words) like "type tag" and "anonymous constant" and "hidden variable".  However, my complaints actually hinge on your abstractions, which regardless how they are named, are incorrect.  You treat time-varying slots (variables) and the result of evaluating expressions (values) as the same thing.  That's wrong.}

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your model has model-specific vocabulary or phrases also, such as "D1". That's usually acceptable. (If you don't like the words I use for my internal parts, you are welcome to suggest alternatives, but so far I have not liked your suggestions for reasons already given.) As far as second part being "wrong", you've made a very poor case for that, but this is not the place to reinvent all that.

           <em>"D1", "D2" are just convenient labels.  They aren't part of the descriptions.  Your distaste for my terminology is noted, but I'll ignore it; I'm using familiar terminology and standard definitions.</em>

           Sorry, I don't get the joke. Computer languages and math notion were invented to reduce ambiguity, at least for certain kinds of tasks. And that's largely why the tag model uses familiar imperative pseudo-code and XML to "describe" type processing instead of using English or an odd self-rolled set-theory like notation.  If you can come up with a better notation that regular developers can follow, be my guest.
