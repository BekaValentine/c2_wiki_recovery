        How Other Query Languages Address Sql Flaws
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a comparison of how different query languages, proposed or actual, deal with various <a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a> and shortcomings. Motivated by a discussion of goals in <a href="SqlFlawsDiscussion.html">SqlFlawsDiscussion</a>. It can also be a discussion of different approaches to solving them, regardless of whether an existing language actually has such a feature. It's an exploration of techniques more so than specific languages. Fortunately, the field of SQL alternatives is still new, and thus this is a good time to hash out the options.

           <strong>JPAQL</strong>: Tables are seen like collections of objects, if a query returns duplicates the collection might contain more than one reference to an object (the object is not repeated, but the reference is). "DISTINCT" needs to be used to explicitly forbid duplicates when writing JPAQL queries.

Thus, it considers uniqueness enforcement primarily an "engine" issue and not a query language issue.

If I ask the computer to not show the key, the thing better not show it or I'll go buy another that obeys me[5]. If it lectures me about purity, I'll smash its screen. Further, using bags as results may be more efficient in some cases.</em>

For example, one can change the case of selected column names, add a prefix or suffix to them, union two Column Tables to get a new one, etc. (An empty column list is similar to an asterisk in SQL, by the way.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Pro: Columns can be dynamically determined, which has proven useful in features such as "cross-tab" operations. In cross-tab queries, you don't know the columns ahead of time (at compile time).

            <li>
               <em>Is there a way to create </em>'user defined column selection operators<em>' ? (For example, a "ToLower" that changes all the column names of a relvar to lowercase, of a "AddPrefix" that adds a particular prefix to all the column names... or a "ToCamelCase" that changes all column names from "COLUMN_NAME" to "ColumnName"? or any other operation that someone may want to implement?)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               At present, there are facilities in RENAME to specify a prefix or suffix on all columns, but RENAME is an on-the-fly relational operator. It does not modify any <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a> definitions. In the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>, a future release will support "live" updates of system catalog metadata, which will permit string operations (which may be user-defined) to be used in UPDATEs to the <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a> attribute names found in the catalog. This will permanently alter <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a> definitions.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Nice but... what about non-permanent, only for this query, for any relvar (even if it is a "view-equivalent" relvar) user defined column selection operators? (IMO one of the main principles of TTM is to "give all relvars the same rights, regardless of how they were born"... no?)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               In short, no. The purpose of RENAME is to facilitate or avoid JOINs, facilitate UNIONs, etc. There is no more reason to temporarily camel-case a set of attribute names within a relational expression in <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> than there is to temporarily camel-case a set of class member names within a class method in Java.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>I am pretty sure that the TTM warns against thinking that rules that apply to classes apply to relvar definition (there is chapter only for that IIRC), so no use for member renaming in classes is not a good counter argument for not having UDCSOs in Rel. An operator like "</em>ToCamelCase" could be used, for example, to facilitate joins between relvars in different databases that are using different <a href="NamingConventions.html">NamingConventions</a>.<em></em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   My reference to class member names was an analogy, but it is an apt one.  In <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, at least, attributes are structural, just as class members in Java are structural.  Similar analogies apply to non-OO languages, e.g., variables or struct members in C.  Attributes are <strong>not</strong> dynamic.  Indeed, in implementation the RENAME operator is a purely compile-time mechanism.  However, I can appreciate that there may be value in a more powerful RENAME than that currently provided, and will consider mechanisms to generalise and/or customise the process of mapping existing names to new ones.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               As for user-defined dynamic column selection operators, along the lines of what might be used to generate attribute_name_list_expr for PROJECT(non_scalar_expr, attribute_name_list_expr), that too is forbidden as it precludes static determination of the type of the result. 
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>Are you sure there is no way? Maybe it is just that Date and Darwen have not invested time investigating this possibility... for example Haskell can do all sort of strong typing tricks... maybe some kind of "strongly typed list mini-language" could be used for this?</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   There is no way to determine the contents of a list that is generated at run-time at compile-time, by definition.  Hence, the heading of a relation generated by such a list can only be determined at run-time.
                </li>

            </li>
            <li>
               That said, <em>Rel</em> does provide a means for dynamically constructing projections, using mechanisms too humiliatingly crude and inelegant to share here. (I could tell you, but I'd have to kill you and commit hari kari.) It's intended to facilitate construction of administrative tools. I'll eventually provide a "proper" dynamic projection operator (like the PROJECT example shown above) but that will have to wait for official support for generic (i.e., heading unknown until run-time) relation and tuple types. Obviously, the declared type of a dynamic projection is either a RELATION or a TUPLE (depending on the generic type of non_scalar_expr), but its heading can't be known until run-time.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>I wonder if it is really impossiblo to design a language that allows creation of UDCSOs and at the same times permits to know the structure the resulting list at compile time... I only wish I know more about languages like Haskell...</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   There is no way to determine the contents of a list that is generated at run-time at compile-time, by definition.  Hence, the heading of a relation generated by such a list can only be determined at run-time.  Of course, this does not preclude alternative language designs that admit such dynamicity whilst being strongly-typed.  Many languages permit this.  <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> is explicitly defined as a (mostly) statically-typed language, however, and so precludes this in its strongest form.  It does not preclude providing a dynamic projection operator that returns RELATION {*}.

               It appears to rely heavily on "key words", similar to SQL. Does this create a distinction in style between "native" syntax and user-defined extensions? For example, if somebody wanted to write a custom operation that follows a similar pattern to an existing statement (kin to polymorphism), can they also use the key-word approach, or are they more constrained?

                   There seems to be some confusion here. PL/SQL is the name given to Oracle's server-side extensions to SQL, mainly to support creating stored procedures. Whilst it may be used to <em>support</em> creating applications, a client-side programming language is required in order to create complete, user-friendly applications. Like <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> and unlike PL/SQL, D4 and <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> are intended to be general-purpose programming languages that require no sublanguages or client-side programming languages to create complete applications.

The notion of defining a data model in an "evolving agile way" or that a singular model can be accurately derived from "multiple perspectives" is an exceedingly naive and narrow view that deprecates database development to a level on par with application development. A sad notion, that. By the way, I mention the <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a> table analyser not because it is on par with <a href="NormalizationBySynthesis.html">NormalizationBySynthesis</a> (it isn't) but simply that it is yet another mechanism for automating normalisation.]

        <strong>Leverage Tables Instead of Compete with Them</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is my opinion that things best left to tables should be left to tables rather than invent custom or special language syntax or commands. It not only reduces the complexity of the syntax or language, but also increases meta-ability. It also gives one the option of using a <a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a> to enter "configuration" info. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this doesn't exclude the possibility of a command language performing operations that are built around tables if the command language can create tables (including virtual or temporary tables) and then "act" on them. For example, if there is no cross-table key reference dictionary as shown in <a href="TqlChainedJoin.html">TqlChainedJoin</a>, then one can use existing <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> to create one for a given context or script. If you make it only do-able within a language, then you are stuck using that language instead of other database tools and languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always felt the CREATE TABLE command typicaly found in SQL-RDBMS suffered from this also. The schemas should be defined in tables, not command syntax. If one wants to create a table from a schema, they reference the dictionary table and/or or an existing table in the CREATE TABLE command(s) rather than describe the table using some goofy command syntax. Pseudo-code: "CREATE TABLE x USING SCHEMA TABLE y".
      </p>
      <p>
        If one needs to do it <em>in</em> the command language, then the language should provide a mechanism to describe a table (real or virtual), such as table "y" above, and then reference <em>that</em> table in the command. This reduces the number of command language idioms and commands because table definition only needs to be described once. (Another technique I learned from <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        A distinction should perhaps be made between using an existing table's structure as the schema reference and a <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a>. A CREATE TABLE command could perhaps use both techniques/sources, but if there is a "get schema" command that creates a <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a> from an existing table, then a dedicated command may not be necessary. Whether it's a convenient shortcut or not is another question.
      </p>
      <code>
        // pseudocode for creating a table from existing schema<br/>
        save schema from table A to table B   // B is a data-dictionary<br/>
        create table C from schema table B<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // potential shortcut pseudocode <br/>
        create table C from schema of table A<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, for what I propose, you wouldn't have dedicated syntax for the above, because one changes (system) tables to add/change schemas, not use dedicated schema commands. If other processes need to know about the changes, then internal triggers can perhaps be used. In short, Data Definition Languages (DDL) are a violation of conceptual <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. Designers of existing languages didn't think "meta" enough about this and similar issues, and it's part of the reason for SQL's and similar language's syntactic and linguistic bloat. (Although, <a href="VendorLockIn.html">VendorLockIn</a> may also have been a motivation. It's harder to clone complex languages.)

        <em>There are research DBMSs that do this.  In some, updates to the catalog via the DML are equivalent to the DDL and can be used as an alternative to it.  In others, there is no DDL; the only way to create new constructs is via insertions into the catalog.  The former is a handy facility; the latter is awkward.  For example, defining a table via CREATE TABLE syntax is simple and intuitive.  Defining a table via a series of inserts to the catalog's "Tables" table is not intuitive, and in most cases represents an unnecessary level of indirection.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If a <a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a> is handy, I'd rather use it than CREATE TABLE-like syntax. It can even provide pull-down lists and/or type-ahead for things like type names. And what do you mean by "level of indirection"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If a </em><a href="SyntaxAwareEditor.html">SyntaxAwareEditor</a> is handy, it too can provide pull-down lists and/or type-ahead for things like type names.  <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> and the <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> do that now with various languages.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By "level of indirection", I mean that a syntax that supports "CREATE TABLE" directly requires less indirection than a syntax that does not directly express "CREATE TABLE", but instead requires the user to translate his intent ("CREATE TABLE") into something that expresses it (a series of INSERT statements).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If a <a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a> is a natural tool to a user/DBA, there is no "translation". Further, it is possible to simplify a "series of INSERT statements" to make similar tasks and related syntax more convenient. The advantage is that such shortcuts can be used on other tasks, not just scheme definitions. Inventing custom syntax for every specific DBA-like task is <strong>anti-parsimony</strong>. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Whether a </em><a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a> is familiar or not, constructing a table by editing metadata requires a translation from the user's intent ("CREATE TABLE blah (x INTEGER);") to the user's action ("INSERT INTO sys.Tables VALUES ('blah'); INSERT INTO sys.Columns VALUES ('blah', 'x', 'INTEGER');").  Obviously, you can certainly simplify the series of INSERT statements to make similar tasks and related syntax more convenient.  The way SQL does that is to provide the CREATE TABLE command.  Inventing custom syntax for every specific DBA-like task is not just "anti-parsimony", it would be unreasonable.  However, providing custom syntax for commonly-used commands is convenient, helpful, and reasonable.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My "intent" does <em>not</em> look like Oracle or DB2 DDL SQL; I don't know where you are getting that intent thing. (If anything, my intent looks tabular; after all, I have a TOP mind.) As far as text-centric approaches, textually serializing and importing and exporting tabular data is one of those "commonly-used" features you talk about. It's not isolated to just table definitions. Perhaps we should focus on that as a <strong>general problem</strong> and then only abandon general solutions for use in table definitions IF we cannot get it to work well as a general technique. I am open to better ways to do such (CSV, XML, <a href="UniversalStatement.html">UniversalStatement</a>, hybrids, etc.). If we can universalize it, then switching back and forth between textual and (generic) table-browsers could be made easier. But let's start another topic if we do; perhaps ImprovingTextualTabularDataFormats or something. I find it highly silly that RDBMS have invented huge entity/feature-specific syntax trees to handle what is (or could be) essentially data changes to schema tables. --<a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My SQL (which is standard, and not specific to Oracle or DB2) was merely intended to illustrate the intent of "create a table", using familiar terms.  How does "INSERT INTO sys.Tables VALUES ('blah'); INSERT INTO sys.Columns VALUES ('blah', 'x', 'INTEGER');" clearly demonstrate the intent to create a table?  Does it even create a table?</em>

           Are you suggesting that hard-wiring in commands is the best way to provide self-documenting code? (Actually, "CREATE TABLE" often lies because it may replace an existing table. We need a generic verb for "INSERT IF NEW BUT REPLACE IF EXISTS".)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I'm not suggesting anything, but it seems fairly evident what the intent of "CREATE TABLE" was; not so much for the INSERT statements.  I don't think a generic verb is needed for "INSERT IF NEW BUT REPLACE IF EXISTS".  Just DROP the table before you create it.  (The choice between a "generic verb" and some set of constructs is, of course, a matter of that "balance" thing, mentioned below.)</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           While I agree that better self-documentation may be a positive feature of hard-wired syntax, I do not believe that benefit alone is enough to choose hard-wiring over factoring, unless it's otherwise a close-call. A flip-side may be that once one learns the syntax for a specific case (table specifications), they can reuse that knowledge for other situations, such as other configuration updates. -t

      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>However, I can appreciate your desire for elegant simplicity using a few elemental operators and mechanisms which can be composed in an infinite number of ways to define every possible operation.  That is the essence -- and some would say the beauty -- of languages like Lisp and Forth.  Every language strikes some balance between potentially obscure and laborious elemental simplicity vs overly-verbose pre-specified keywords and constructs.  The choice of balance point is at the discretion of the language designer.  Apparently, SQL didn't strike that balance where you would have liked.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned in <a href="MaspBrainstorming.html">MaspBrainstorming</a>, Lisp perhaps has the right idea, but wrong base data structure. A map or perhaps "ordered map" would make a better base data structure.
