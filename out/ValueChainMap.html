        Value Chain Map
      </h1>
      <p>
        A value chain map is a graphical representation of the process by which something of value is created or modified. Usually, the left side of the map represents the raw materials or other inputs, and the right side represents the finished product. Each intermediate node represents a processing step. Flow through the process steps is represented by arrows.
