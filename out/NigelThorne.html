      <p>
        My name is Nigel Thorne. I was born in Cornwall, England and studied zoology at Oxford University. In 2005, I joined a research project to study rare primates in Indonesia. A plane crash stranded our group on a remote island, and the things I saw there changed my life. Now I am dedicated to capturing the world's rarest creatures on tape.

        Yeti, Chupacabra, the Mothman... To many, they are legends. But unknown species are discovered every day. How many of these so-called "mythical creatures" are simply rare animals, or genetic offshoots of the familiar? Species such as the giant squid were once considered myth, and the prehistoric coelacanth was believed long extinct until its rediscovery in the 20th century. If these species can go undetected for so long, then surely there are others still waiting to be exposed.
