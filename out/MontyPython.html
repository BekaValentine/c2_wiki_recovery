        <a href="MichaelPalin.html">MichaelPalin</a> seemed genuinely interested in his unexpected contribution to making the programming manuals of the future less boring when I finally told him about the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> over a beer before Christmas. (All the Python tutorial code examples use themes from MP sketches of various degrees of absurdity. Somehow it's the first time that I've felt the subject matter ideally matched the mind-numbing nature of the material.)

        I think I lost Michael when I tried to describe the difference between a scripting and a 'serious' programming language but I told him to tell the other guys the good news anyway. Let's hope they don't sue. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        <em>Can you imagine </em><a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> in court? hee hee!<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They've already been in court. In the 1970s, the US broadcasting network, ABC, had bought the right to show some <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> episodes on late night television. They took 3 episodes, smashed them together, cut out large portions (to remove <em>naughty bits</em>), and showed them on a Friday night.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> sued, claiming that the cuts were unauthorized, that the result so distorted their work that it counted as copyright infringement, etc. The Judge was a Python fan! Eventually, <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> lost the court case, but won the war - ABC stopped showing the episodes, and they reached an out-of-court settlement.

        There was an article on this in a 1976 New Yorker magazine (the one with the Saul Steinberg <em>View of the World from Ninth Avenue</em> cover, I think).

        There's an interesting book documenting <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a>'s various run-ins with censorship, first from the BBC, then in the courts, called "Monty Python, The Case Against" (ISBN:0413486605)

        Shouldn't this read 'Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel' rather than 'Schopenhauer and Hegel'? At least my version seems to.

        I believe that the version sung during "Monty Python at the Hollywood Bowl" contained the line "Schopenhauer and Hegel" but on the album version it was "Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel"
