        Is Lispa Functional Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some say it is, some say it isn't.  Lemme see... (this applies mainly to <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>; <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> has a stronger functional tradition).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is a little silly to say it isn't, because lisp was the original functional language.  Otoh, it is pretty easy to see that some lisp variants are not particularly functional today.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           More to the point, much of the <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> community these days isn't terribly interested in the functional aspects of the language.  Many aspects of CL, such as <a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a> and the whole <a href="MetaObjectProtocol.html">MetaObjectProtocol</a>, are rather <strong>non</strong>-functional.  This has causes some <a href="FunctionalWeenie.html">FunctionalWeenie</a>s (sorry) to suggest that Lisp no longer deserves the term....
          <ul>
            <li>
               I dare say that most Lispers these days (and possibly even most Schemers) don't give a damn what the <a href="FunctionalWeenie.html">FunctionalWeenie</a>s think of them. We're just trying to get a job done; we're not interested in religious wars about whose language is more pure. -- <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a>

      <p>
        <strong>Reasons why </strong><a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> is a functional language<strong>:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Supports <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s, one of the first languages to do so.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>However</strong>, some Lisps do it better than others.  <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, by virtue of its separate function namespace, makes things harder than necessary.  Old dynamically-scoped Lisp dialects have difficulty with proper lambdas (not being able to capture variables from the enclosing scope at the point of definition).
              <ul>
                <li>
                   The "funarg device" was present in Lisp 1.5, and that's pretty old.  <em>LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual</em> was published in 1962.  Also see <a href="ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-199.pdf">ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-199.pdf</a>  They didn't close over the lexical environment, but many old dialects could close over the dynamic environment.  There is an example of this on the <a href="DynamicClosure.html">DynamicClosure</a> page.

           It's a <a href="MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage.html">MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage</a>, with <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> as one of the supported paradigms.

      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Reasons why it isn't.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Most Lisp programmers use an imperative style; <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s are common-place.  <a href="ReferentialTransparency.html">ReferentialTransparency</a> is almost non-existent.
        </li>
        <li>
           Lisp programs are not executed on a <a href="GraphReducer.html">GraphReducer</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Excluding <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>, no mandatory <a href="TailCallElimination.html">TailCallElimination</a> (a needed technique for a pure functional language).
        </li>
        <li>
           It's a <a href="MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage.html">MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage</a>... to be "functional" you gotta be pure.  (The same argument, I supposed, used to argue that C++ isn't an OO language).
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a> (many functional languages like to play with advanced static type systems...OK this isn't a very good reason).
