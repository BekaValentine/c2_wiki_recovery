        Software Developer Extraordinaire. Well, that is too grand. I am a programmer. I run my own company 
        <a href="http://www.Webamorphosis.com">http://www.Webamorphosis.com</a>
        My location is Calgary, AB, Canada. I've just been getting into this whole <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> deal recently and hence stumbled upon <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>. I am particularly interested in possible applications of XP to a <a href="ExtremeProgrammingForOne.html">ExtremeProgrammingForOne</a>. I've also been poking about in <a href="SoloXpProjects.html">SoloXpProjects</a>. Also just new to Refactoring, it has been very interesting to discover so many new topics that are so very useful!

        Just picked up Beck's TDD book, I've really been enjoying it. I just don't think I've quite got it yet though. I decided to try it out on a little project that I've been planning on creating but I just couldn't figure out what my first test would be, I always find it hard to get started on a project, and doing so with a new method is even harder. I think I'll look around at <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> here to see if there is anymore helpful info.

        <em>re: the first test. Two things that work for me are:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "What's this reason this object exists, and what's the most simple case for that?" Often this ends up being a brain dead test like <em>ASSERT("meow" == aCat.Speak()</em> with <em>cat.Speak()</em> always returning "meow" The sheer triviality of the test gets me thinking about the next thing that should happen, and soon, it is time to clock out for the day.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If I can't do the above, there's always the dirt simple smoke test of create object, ensure object is not NULL.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           also, Welcome to Wiki.

        Beauty, that is a great help, I'm definitely getting the hang of this TDD action, very useful!
