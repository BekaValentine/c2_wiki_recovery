        "My day job used to be mozilla.org, but on April 1, 1999, I resigned from both mozilla.org and from (what is now known as) the Netscape division of America Online. I mention this so that you will understand that if you send me mail about Mozilla, Netscape, or anything even tangentially related to them, the chance that I will ignore you is high. Sorry, but it's time to move on. Try checking on the mozilla.org site for others who can help you."

        jwz's old "Java sucks" screed at <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/java.html">http://www.jwz.org/doc/java.html</a> illustrates a couple of things worth noticing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           He is (or was) much more preoccupied with MicroOptimization than you might expect for an ex-<a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> programmer who hates <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           He hated <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> before hating Java became popular :)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some notable career events:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In the early '90s, worked for <a href="LucidInc.html">LucidInc</a> on <a href="GnuEmacs.html">GnuEmacs</a>. Lucid soon forked off what is now XEmacs after a famous spat with the <a href="FreeSoftwareFoundation.html">FreeSoftwareFoundation</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Did the Unix version of <a href="NetscapeNavigator.html">NetscapeNavigator</a> v. 1. Invented the word "Mozilla". Got rich.
        </li>
        <li>
           Publicized the <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a> section of <a href="RichardGabriel.html">RichardGabriel</a><em></em>'s <em>Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big</em> talk. This took both the talk and the <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a> slogan from obscurity to fame.
          <ul>
            <li>
               (It also created a misleading impression that the talk is simply anti-Unix, pro-Lisp polemic. In fact, it was received with stony silence and hostility by its original audience of Lispers.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Responsible for much of XScreenSaver.
        </li>
        <li>
           No longer does software for a living, now runs a San Francisco nightclub, DNA Lounge.
        </li>
      </ul>
