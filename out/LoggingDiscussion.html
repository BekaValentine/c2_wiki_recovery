        <strong>Alternatives to Logging</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most things that seem to require log files, don't:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Minor hiccup reporting -- Work around the problem automatically, don't bother telling anybody.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unexpected condition -- Throw an exception.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Resolvable exception -- Resolve it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unresolvable exception -- Propagate it up the call chain.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>(To where? What if this is a service that must continue to run 24/7?)</em> To the top level... see the next two bullets.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Propagating exceptions loses contextual information that an administrator needs to find and solve a problem. You need to log that information before throwing the exception.</em> So put that contextual information in the exception, or throw a different exception that has the information you need.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Propagating an exception up the call chain of a call-back in an event-driven system passes the error information in the wrong direction, away from the application layers towards generic I/O layers. Lower layers do not know how to handle these errors. The interfaces through which they invoke application functionality might not allow exceptions to be thrown. Throwing unchecked exceptions might put the lower layers into an unspecified state.</em> So in these cases, use a mechanism other than an exception.
            </li>
            <li>
               Consider also use of <a href="ResumableException.html">ResumableException</a> or <a href="AbortRetryIgnore.html">AbortRetryIgnore</a> pattern. Admittedly, language support for this doesn't exist outside of Lisp, but the pattern itself allows recovery from exception in accordance with a policy defined in a higher layer.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Top-level environmental exception, like "database is down" -- Send an email to the sysadmin (or whoever is in charge of fixing these things), or page him. He's not going to read the log file unless he has to, so the software should be proactive.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>What sysadmin? Your sysadmin? I don't know her.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>A decent logging framework do this for you when you log certain classes of error.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some other top-level exception -- Must be a bug. Send an email to the programming team, get that sucker squashed. They're not going to read the log file unless they have to, so the software should be proactive.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Ooops, you've lost all the contextual information you need by propagating exceptions rather than logging errors.</em> If you can log the contextual information, you can propagate it with the exception.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Support a more general diagnostics and recovery vocabulary and system-testing framework, possibly something compatible with <a href="RuntimeUpgradeableCore.html">RuntimeUpgradeableCore</a> (i.e. at least a double-redundancy heartbeat, one performing system tests and the other monitoring the heart performing the tests). Push logging to the edges; people are free, if they wish, to log any messages they can obtain through the diagnostics vocabulary without fear of introducing unexpected side-effects. (Compatible with <a href="ObjectCapabilityModel.html">ObjectCapabilityModel</a>. Suitable especially for distributed systems.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Twitter-ify your application. Restrict all logging messages to 140 ASCII characters, create a dedicated twitter channel, and send all the messages that <em>would</em> have been logged to said twitter channel, thus abridging your need for log <em>files</em>. ;-) <strong>MORE SERIOUSLY:</strong> Consider switching to a <a href="PublishSubscribeModel.html">PublishSubscribeModel</a>, and consider use of a distributed, scalable, and <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a> implementation such as <a href="DataDistributionService.html">DataDistributionService</a>, which already supports data-fusion and integration with RDBMS. This approach can be combined orthogonally with a diagnostics and recovery framework, resumable exceptions, etc.

        <strong>Problem diagnosis actually is important</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We put lots of bugs in our code, so we </em>'really do<em>' need log files -- to keep track of all of them! ;-></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Violent and total disagreement. Your world is very simplistic. Yes, we do have bugs in our system. Duh. We try not to but the system is very complicated involving 200+ distributed nodes and multiple hardware and software vendors. Now we can accept that and work with it, or put our head in the sand. A system fails after 4 weeks? Why? With your approach you have no way of diagnosing the problem or fixing it. Customers don't like that. Send an email, so what? You have no clue what happened. The site is a day away by plane. Now what?

        <strong>A Modest Proposal</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Mmmmm... Let's get all idealistic then... the end user runs your code in a runtime system that - in the event of certain kinds of exception - makes a clone of the program state and sends you an email about it. You can then connect to that clone via remote debugging over the Internet to inspect the stack, step forward and test a few things in their live environment without their permission, etc. Oh bliss. -- <a href="DanielEarwicker.html">DanielEarwicker</a>

        <strong>More objections</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I get the feeling someone here has never worked on a distributed system. How can every top level exception be a bug? Certainly, a down sensor or other device is not a bug.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then again, doesn't it fall under the "environmental" category?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>What about the customer?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is too extreme. What about application logging for the customer? What about for a commercial product that generates a log to aid </em>CustomerSupport in doing their job? There are <strong>many</strong> reasons for log files that go beyond the tips of our noses.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, log files can be useful tools to help identify a bug. Just don't add them until there's a tough bug that needs them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Then it's way late. You can't do a build in the field and rerun. The conditions were likely very specific and very hard to reproduce. You need a log that was collected while the problem happened or you are SOL.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Log files give context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I disagree. Log files often are (a) required as a feature by the customer, (b) show the sequence of events between separate processes that triggers an error condition, info that cannot appear on a stack trace, and (c) are often the <strong>only</strong> output mode available to server/daemon processes. -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Log files sometimes reveal patterns which are only visible with a lot of data, more than you can absorb running a program interactively.</em>

        <strong>Log transactions when money is involved</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like databases to log transactions so that when the bank has a power outage in the middle of a transaction, I don't lose $1000. Logging is just another interface to the user. If you don't use logging, you need another interface to report status. If you have one, gravy. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        <strong>Don't forget auditing</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        What about auditing? How do you do that without logs?
      </p>
      <p>
        E.g. Sensitive data is leaked by a user. The leak is detected some time later. Without logs how do you find who was reading the data at that point?
      </p>
      <p>
        My point of view is that in any distributed system or any system that runs without constant user supervision (daemons, etc.), a <em>lack</em> of logging is a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>. More than that, is a design flaw.

        <strong>Ok, maybe we do need <em>some</em> logging</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tentative summary - an identified need for logging is a good indicator that your system is a) complex, b) sensitive to untrusted accesses, or c) subject to applications of data mining after millions of uses. If your system has none of these characteristics, consider excessive reliance on log files to be a serious smell.

        <strong>A second round of objections to logging</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(a) "not completely trivial" would be a better description</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most useful systems are not trivial. A number of useful systems are not complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(b) auditing is required whether users are trusted or not. Most security breaches in business systems are performed by "trusted" users.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's "trusted" in the sense of "all functionality available without particular authentication tokens", as in the Wiki which has no untrusted users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(c) in a distributed system you need to correlate events in different parts of the network to determine the cause of faults. That requires logs, whether you have ten uses or a million uses.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I dunno, HTTP seems to work well enough without needing to correlate what happens in the browser with what happens in the server. If a distributed system is sensitive to small deviations in behaviour on the part of one of its participants, it seems to me that the presence or absence of detailed logs will be less useful than increased robustness in the face of small deviations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>An HTTP server is a centralized system that uses a stateless protocol. It *doesn't need* to correlate what happens in the browser with what happens in the server because (a) the protocol does not synchronize state between the two processes and (b) the protocol considers each request as completely context free - all the necessary context is sent in each request. This is about as simple as you can make a distributed system. In fact, an HTTP server has the same logical structure as a minicomputer running a bank of terminals, which is not what people usually class as a distributed system.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When you have multiple processes running on widely distributed, heterogeneous nodes that must collaborate by communicating with a mixture of protocols and networks (X.25, Inmarsat, GSM, TCP/IP, reliable UDP/IP multicast, CORBA RPC, etc.), then correlating events on different nodes is very important in order to discover what has happened to cause a fault.</em>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You seem think logging is of little use, but it sounds like you have never had to administer a system or write a system that is administered by others. When you have done either of those without a logging system you'll change your mind! I did.</em>

      <p>
        Does having written three chat servers and having been involved with a multimillion-hit Apache cluster count ? I am most emphatically not asserting that there are no known uses for logging. In particular, if there is a user requirement for logging certain events, esp. for data mining (HTTP servers are a good example) then we'd better be ready to do it.

      <p>
        What the <a href="FirstRuleOfLogging.html">FirstRuleOfLogging</a> says - as I read it - is "If you're thinking of adding logging to your system because the blasted thing isn't doing what it should be doing - don't."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That may be good advice, but I don't see any justification for it above. A logfile provides a different perspective on a program's execution than a debugger, which can't capture the past. Why is this bad?</em> -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to extend the above comment. Logging is only a persistent form of on screen debugging. If you program perfectly, you don't need either one, but when I screw up, I rely on whatever tools are at hand to resolve the problem. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

        Marketing departments need HTTP access logs to show advertisers statistics of "hit counts", "eyeballs", "stickyness" and all the other buzzwords they like to see. They need to record the result of normal execution of the server.

        <strong>Reasons to Log</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Logging covers a multitude of different functions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           tracing normal and exceptional behaviour
        </li>
        <li>
           recording informational, warning, and error messages for use by a human or automatic operator
        </li>
        <li>
           recording a security audit trail
        </li>
        <li>
           recording performance statistics for use in tuning
        </li>
        <li>
           transactional logging for recovery and/or rollback in ACID <a href="TransactionProcessing.html">TransactionProcessing</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           forward recovery logging for recovery of the stable state of a database
        </li>
        <li>
           journaling to support undo/redo at a user interface (see <a href="MementoPattern.html">MementoPattern</a>).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An application may need to do tracing or journaling, but the other kinds of logging are often handled by middleware such as <a href="CiCs.html">CiCs</a> or <a href="EjbServer.html">EjbServer</a><strong>'s.</strong>

        <em>What are the reasons not to log?</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Wiki Logging Example</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Logging is useful whenever you simply want information about what happens while your program is running... I mean, there's no real need to log things like "uh oh, there seems to be a bug here" but it would be nice to be able to have some sort of record of the things you didn't expect and plan for.. Like someone trying to circumvent a security measure in your program. You can rely on thinking of everything, or you can put something in place that lets you know what you missed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ironically, while I was saving this page, an error occurred in wiki and it said "this information is being logged."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Possibly the best argument that could be made against the </em><a href="FirstRuleOfLogging.html">FirstRuleOfLogging</a>. Then again, consider - how do you know that message isn't there just to reassure you? ;><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen that Wiki error message dozens of times, for over a year. That bug has never been fixed. Possibly the best argument that could be made <strong>for</strong> the <a href="FirstRuleOfLogging.html">FirstRuleOfLogging</a>.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Huh? You are saying you kept a personal log of a certain event, and by examination of that log you discover that the event (a) isn't once off, and (b) has been occurring for a long time. Sounds like your log (of that "logged" message) turns out to be useful, and that is somehow an argument that logging isn't useful?</dd>

      <p>
        <strong>Logging is a code smell</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I still think that logging can be a code smell. All too often, I see error logging used in place of real exception handling. I've seen this idiom (hmmm... <a href="AntiIdiom.html">AntiIdiom</a>?) countless times:
      </p>
      <code>
        try {<br/>
        foo.bar();<br/>
        }<br/>
        catch (SomeException e) {<br/>
        Log.exception("couldn't bar the foo", e);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Irritation at this idiom is what sparked this page: In the spirit of the first of the <a href="RulesOfOptimization.html">RulesOfOptimization</a>, what I was trying to say (poorly), was, "If you think you need to logging mechanism, <a href="QuestionConventions.html">QuestionConventions</a> and see if there's another way." Sometimes it's a good thing to ButcherSacredCows... judging from the response, I succeeded at that!
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, I think there were a number of good points raised on this page about when logging is necessary. -- <a href="JimLittle.html">JimLittle</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a> also. I've just wasted the last seven months of my life struggling to debug a mess of an application, where the more I dug into it, the more bugs and design flaws I found. The existing logs (which were <em>huge</em>) were almost completely useless in identifying these latent bugs; they obviously hadn't been reviewed for years, by anyone. I had to comment out dozens of mindless logging statements (almost every intermediate calculation and assignment was logged, double spaced) to get the log down to where I could made sense of it, and then add my own key debugging statements to find and fix the <em>real</em> problems. (How can anyone anticipate what they'll need to have logged in order to solve a bug in the future? If you can anticipate that, you can fix the bug preemptively!)
      </p>
      <p>
        In my experience, the core functionality in most software only takes about 10 or 20 percent of the code; the rest is necessary to handle <strong>all</strong> the possible things that can and will go wrong, the exceptional cases. This means you have to spend more than a little mental effort considering what can go wrong, and how to handle it intelligently. This should be handled as a major, integral part of your system design, not an afterthought, and it should be centered on your users' needs. Talk to them about it; ask hard questions, like "What if the system can't get the interest rates from the auxiliary database; what should it do then?" (Users don't particularly like to think about this stuff, but if they don't think about it now, they'll have to think about it down the road when something goes wrong...)
      </p>
      <p>
        So I would say it this way: Logging may or may not be useful, but it is rarely <em>sufficient</em> by itself, and should not be used in lieu of proper error and exception handling. -- <a href="AndyMoore.html">AndyMoore</a>

        <strong>Removing logging ins an </strong><a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           you make the unsupported assertion that logging hides errors for developers or logging is used by developers in lieu of dealing with errors. That's not what logging is for.
        </li>
        <li>
           removing logging is an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, as has been already shown by a number of people here, not a code smell but a straight <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>. You might first log, and after that apply other treatments to the condition. Sometimes logging is also useful for normal functioning of software.
        </li>
        <li>
           questioning conventions and common places is a very healthy thing to do, but sometimes we might find that what we question is quite right. And succeeding is rather a matter of personal opinion.

      </ul>
      <p>
        The code sample that you just gave says nothing about its correctness, it might be the correct thing to do, or it might not. Logging and handling exceptions are not perfectly orthogonal, but let's say they are quite different concerns. Sometimes the correct handling of an exception is to log it. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

I watched the problem grow. I had statistics. But I was never able to establish why. The logs had nothing to say about that. The trouble with logging is that there is no way to ask a follow-up question. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Yes there is. Log more. Log until you have data but no information. Then you can start asking the logs questions by sifting through the data to create information. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        <strong>Use Logging In A Well-Targeted Fashion</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's certainly true that logging is used too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen systems with big files full of junk that no-one ever reads.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen people spend ages designing logging frameworks that never get used.
      </p>
      <p>
        But sometimes <strong>well-targeted</strong> logging can be really useful. I've used it as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Unattended distributed stuff.</strong> There you are, running your distributed calculation overnight across a whole bunch of machines. Something goes wrong overnight. Because you have logging, you can see it happened to several machines at the same time. So that points you to the network backup grabbing files they need. Very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Verifying Configuration Settings.</strong> We have a library framework that can pull in a lot of runtime modules. The setup is very flexible, which means it's a potential source of error and confusion. But we need all the flexibility. So at startup we log what the configurations are collectively asking for and show success/failure in loading the modules. So when over at someone's machine, 9 times out of 10 you can solve any configuration problems by examining the log.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Optional recording/playback.</strong> We allow people to switch recording on/off for calls into the library framework. We can play this back on another machine and trap problems in the debugger. So I can sort out a Java client's problem in a purely C++ debugging session. Also, I can compare inputs and outputs for test runs and report call-by-call differences.

        Seconded. I have saved at least couple on-site debugging visit because my module logs when unexpected values (such as nulls) are obtained from another module (especially the flaky ones). Whenever there is a bug reported to me, the first thing I ask for is the log. In some cases I can reply within minutes that XYZ module is returning nulls for calls to method foo(). -- <a href="OliverChung.html">OliverChung</a>

        Without a specific need for logging identified by the customer, adding a logging framework is taking time away from solving more pressing problems (See <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>). Transaction history and audit trail are legitimate examples of needs for a log. Make the customer identify that need before expending the resources to develop them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Just in case" logging, like error-detection code, is more prone to introducing errors than functional code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Disagree strongly. The only side effect of logging code should be its effect on the log itself, and it should always terminate. In some languages this is enforceable; in any case, bugs caused by logging are IME extremely rare.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The details may not be well-defined, or are based only on progammer hunches. Hunches may be incorrect and misleading in an actual bug hunt. Then you have to debug the debug code. Great. Your time will be better spent testing the code for robustness.

      <p>
        Case-in-point: I took over a project in which the system crashed from filling the log.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Limiting the size of a log is hardly rocket science.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever useful information might have been captured in the log was overshadowed by flooding the log with vague system state information ("powerup", "init complete", and "shutdown"). Because the system was power-cycled somewhat frequently, the log overflowed during normal, error-free operation. A bug in the logging code caused the system to crash.

        Why not let the exception itself do the logging? It's always struck me as a waste the way exceptions are usually used... i.e., if you can resolve the exception at some level, why not let the exception object know about it? The exception seems to be a natural choice... it has the potential to know what happened, why it happened, and what's been done about it.

               What exception? This is language/idiom centric and does nothing for large heterogeneous systems. Presumably, when they exist in good systems, exceptions *do* log things as appropriate. However, there are plenty of conditions where there is no exception even in languages that support them. It is precisely the things the programmers did not expect (enough to throw and catch exceptions) that you need the logs to fix. A rounding error in an accounting program can be *very bad* and still not cause anything to throw an exception. I would not want to go chasing that down. I worked for a very large bank in the United States that had several different methods of rounding depending upon circumstance and it was the most pernicious thing to debug. It never caused an error condition, but it happened. It was a non negotiable requirement from the bank. For reasons to involved to go into here, you can't fix that by stepping through a debugger.

               If a customer has requested a non-trivial system, then they have implicitly requested the use of software libraries, compilers, primitive data types, etc. Logging is part of the package required to deliver a working non-trivial system. Logging is not a customer concern any more than choosing what primitive data types should be used. If an enum takes a little longer, but is the right way to go, do you bring this to the customer to decide whether they would like to spend the money? Logging is not a 'frill'. It is a necessity. Unless you are building toy programs to describe your latest brainstorm for a dogmatic 'one size fits all' <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a> technique, or a canned goods management system for your Uncle, logging is an integral part of development.

               Logging is one of the more important methods of doing that. Proper logging in areas where edge conditions exist allows you to run millions of iterations to ensure that obscure interactions from things you may not control or even be aware of do not impact your system. When they do (and they do), only the logging will give you what you need to solve the problem. The easy bugs are proximal. The hard bugs are distal. Without logging all around, how do you identify something that rarely happens (temporarily could not get a lock and your bug is in that handling routine, tripped up an obscure routine that passed off a presumed impossible condition to something that caused it to randomly leak memory, fill up swap and cause your system to die on an 'out of disk space' error. A good log makes that easy to find. No log makes it, well, not easy.

                   There are times when you would like to know what happened. Sure, resolve it. However, if your resolution impairs system performance or this is a usability issue that is annoying the bejammers out of your users, or try to imagine this: Your resolution does not go as planned, it would be nice to have a log to refer to.

                <li>
                   This was dealt with well above. By all means, you should have a context that can propagate the condition. However, you may be surprised to learn that sometimes, the system fails before the call chain can deal with it. If you had a log, you would know what had happened, even if the condition caused the program to crash on its way back. It sometimes happens that the error is such that it puts the system into an infinite loop and you have to terminate the process. If you have a log that says 'Callee:oops, I ran out of resources' then and infinite number of 'CALLER: I ran out of resources', then you know what happened, where it began and where to look. If you do not have a log, you had better hope that it is easy to repeat (hint: difficult bugs can nigh impossible to repeat) so you can step through a debugger.

               Lack of experience, foresight and imagination is a weak argument. You could say that about every component and tool that goes into making software whose utility you do not understand. Those of us who have already have learned the lesson (often the hard way) might prefer to stick with things we know will work. I do. You are going to need a way to build. You are going to need a way to test. You are going to need a way to measure. You will (most cases these days) need a mouse and a keyboard and a monitor. You will need lots of things and the more experience you have, the more things you will know you need up-front. Whether or not you are going to need 'it' depends upon what 'it' is. A formula that says a-priori that you are or are not going to need 'it', regardless of what 'it' is, is a poor formula for success in the software game.

        You know, I would not have thought there would be a debate about this. I was on here looking for something else and this discussion caught my eye because my logging architecture is one of the most important pieces of code in my systems. I wondered how others were doing it. The fact that there are people who would argue against logging is a real curiosity.

        One has to consider many things when developing software. Small utilities that I write generally don't have logging per se. However, even they have a little message sub-system.
      </p>
      <p>
        When code grows beyond a certain size, it is near impossible to maintain or even bring to production without logging. I have done most of my work in financial and telecommunications environments, so perhaps standards are a little stricter. However, even when doing my own stuff, logging is an integral part of the system.

        </li>
        <li>
           Giving profiling information (shows where, when and often why things are slow, hogging resources, getting blocked waiting on things, etc).
        </li>
        <li>
           Allowing real-time remote recovery from errors without affecting (and alarming!) users.
        </li>
        <li>
           Helping to improve process flow by analyzing real production process flow.
        </li>
        <li>
           Providing action items and priorities for things like missing or inadequate help information.
        </li>
        <li>
           Helping to automate testing.
        </li>
        <li>
           Allowing the collection of metrics to identify which things should take priority in the maintenance work-queue.
        </li>
        <li>
           Identifying opportunities for improvement.
        </li>
        <li>
           Creating a persistent record that allows postmortem analysis as opposed to ephemeral dialogs and final messages in assert statements.
        </li>
        <li>
           Verifying that fixes have indeed been made, installed and work.
        </li>

        I have seen logs grow to enormous sizes in production -- 200MB a day back when the disk space available was not much more than 10GB in total. However, those logs in particular were the only way errors would have been caught, identified and fixed on that particular system (built by nearly 200 people and serving millions).

        They do place some kind of a burden on the system and they do take time to build and to care for. However, they definitely pay for themselves. A non-trivial system *with* extensive logging, is definitely cheaper to build, run and maintain than one without. It really is not a contest. Virtually all systems, trivial or not, leave some kind of record of their activities, however small and short lived. It is not a question of whether or not you should have logging. Arguably, you do already. The question is: is your logging adequate? Chances are, it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier on this page, Ward says that his logging system does not tell him how to fix the problem it logs. He says "The trouble with logging is that there is no way to ask a follow-up question." Well... if you really think about it, logging is all about asking a follow-up question. The fact that his logging is not complete enough to do that is not an argument for *less* logging, it is an argument for more. My logging systems give a complete context within which failure happens and they emit enough records to allow rejection of co-incidences and isolation of actual root causes. In fact, really good logging should not require you to ask a follow-up question. It should tell you what happened, why it happened and how to fix it so it won't happen again.
      </p>
      <p>
        All non-trivial software has defects. If software is *very* buggy, you *must* have some method of dealing with them right away. You really need logging. If software is very clean, then when a defect does arise, you will need a lot of information to find it. It is likely subtle and only manifests under relatively rare conditions. If years have passed, the logging may be the only clue to where and why the system failed. Do those scenarios happen? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be clear what I am talking about, I have taken a sketch from the company's internal wiki to describe the general logging system we use:
      </p>

           <a href="TrantorMessageLoggingArchitecture.html">TrantorMessageLoggingArchitecture</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Given that just about every non-trivial system *has* logging these days, I would say that saying "you don't need logging" is an exceptional claim. Exceptional claims require exceptional proof. People arguing *for* logging have given plenty of examples for why it is a good thing. People arguing *against* logging give reasons that are weak on their face or no reason at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somebody said they hated logging because they had to wade through all kinds of junk that should not have been logged. It is certainly possible to log the wrong things. It is certainly possible to place logging in ill-considered locations that generate a lot of logging. It is certainly possible to have inadequate logging such as a naked message like 'Impossible Condition' with no indication of what that condition is, where it came from and when it happened. The fact that you have shoes that do not fit your feet is not an argument against shoes. Not a good one, anyway. It is an argument for getting shoes that fit.

        This is an fairly literate community with the strangest blind-spots. Although they have done well to articulate a lot about design patterns and what I might term social development philosophies, there is a lot of bread and butter programming stuff that is missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm old-school, so I generally do what I call 'object based' rather than 'object oriented' programming. There are some things that can't be done reasonably without OOP, but there are a lot of things that are done more surely and simply with procedural programming. Before going to fool-blown OOP, it is best, IMO to go 'object based'. Object based just means that data and methods go together with decent cleavage lines between objects. Hierarchies and inheritance, if they exist at all, are simple. Object based stuff can be done easily enough in just about any language. The better the scoping regime (in the language and the code), the easier it is to do. If you have a working 'object based' solution, it ports much more cleanly to other languages. In practice, in even medium size real-world systems you have more than one language and it nice if they can use the same paradigm and models.
      </p>

        I would like to see a little more about bread and butter programming that addresses non-trivial working production systems rather than toy examples.

      <p>
        I am a big fan of 'pair programming' and in my experience it has always been done off and on with successful developers. I like the fact that it has been articulated, defended and allowed to come out of the closet. However, pair programming is only one of the host of techniques used to build large systems. When it takes a hundred people to build a system, basing everything on pair programming or any other single paradigm is a recipe for failure.

Their work may have had its flaws, but I still am impressed with the spare beauty that is the C language.

        Anyway, I have pledged elsewhere to use my <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a> on things and publish more. This was a part of living up to that promise.

        As someone who makes his living administering computers rather than programming them, I read this page with bewilderment.  I need log files to operate my systems successfully, because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hardware fails in unexpected ways that often go unnoticed until it's too late.  Even a perfect program is unreliable on bad hardware.  Logs help me discover and pinpoint failures.
        </li>
        <li>
           People configure software in ways that cannot possibly work.  Config file typos, bad file names, missing DNS entries (my favorite mistake this week) can all make a correctly written program not work.  One option is to simply abort, but most programs I use ignore the errors and do their best to keep going.  I leave it to more experienced folks to debate which approach is better, but either way, messages in a log file go a long way toward helping me identify the error.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I certainly hope that none of the programmers who write the programs I use read this page and decide that logging is a bad thing.  Yes, logs have to be managed, both by the developer and by the admin (whether that be another programmer, an administrator, or the occasional unfortunate nontechnical user), but to me the only real alternative to log files is wild guesses when things go wrong.

        Craig -- Well said. It is good to get another perspective on this.
