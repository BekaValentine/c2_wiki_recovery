        Lambda Nature
      </h1>
      <p>
        Lambda is a greek letter (looks something like an up-side-down back-to-front y) that is often used to represent these things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An <a href="EigenValue.html">EigenValue</a> of a matrix
        </li>
        <li>
          The decay constant of a radioactive material (<em>not</em> the half-life), or other exponential process
        </li>
        <li>
          FunctionalAbstraction in the <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a> and, usually spelled out, some programming languages (typically <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s, but not always) related to that calculus
        </li>
        <li>
           In the context of 'lambda sensor', an exhaust oxygen sensor in a closed-loop fuel management system for an internal combustion engine
        </li>
        <li>
           Wavelength
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are represented by lower case lambda (&#955; or &lambda;).
      </p>
      <p>
        By talking about the lambda nature of a programming language, we usually mean the tendency of treating functions as values (instead of special constructs) and functions having <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a capital Lambda (&#923; or &Lambda;) -- not sure what that is used for, outside of fraternity house names.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The cosmological constant
        </li>
        <li>
           TypeAbstraction in SystemF
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (note: I just tried to type lambdas in Unicode, but somehow they got converted to numeric entity names, which were already there, so I removed them.  I'm using Mozilla 1.5.)

      <p>
        <strong>No no, mu is the <em>next</em> Greek letter!-)</strong>
