        I know the pattern community resists the idea of patterns-of-patterns (is there a <a href="PatternsOfPatterns.html">PatternsOfPatterns</a> pattern?), but it seems to me that this is example is firstly illustrative of why we want <a href="PatternsOfPatterns.html">PatternsOfPatterns</a>, and secondly is demonstrates that the idea of a "pattern" is richer than some of the ideas it supplants.

        I'm reminded of...
        "Each pattern then, depends both on the smaller patterns it contains, and on the larger patterns within which it is contained... Each pattern sits at the center of a network of connections which connect it to certain other patterns that help to complete it... And it is the network of these connections between patterns which creates the language... In this network, the links between the patterns are almost as much a part of the language as the patterns themselves." -- <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> in <a href="TheTimelessWayOfBuilding.html">TheTimelessWayOfBuilding</a> (pp 312-314)

        No they don't. Where did you get that impression? Rest assured its not at all true. Not only has the patterns community <em>not</em> resisted the idea of <a href="PatternsOfPatterns.html">PatternsOfPatterns</a> but most of the ones I know have been trying to encourage it and foster it more and more over time. It's the first step along the journey from individual patterns, to whole <a href="PatternLanguages.html">PatternLanguages</a>.

        One of the important ideas behind a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> is that it is a kind of <a href="PatternOfPatterns.html">PatternOfPatterns</a> where the problem and context are very broad and the solution consists of how the participant patterns collaborate in a piecemeal fashion to grow an overall architecture. <a href="JohnVlissides.html">JohnVlissides</a> has been writing of <a href="CompoundPatterns.html">CompoundPatterns</a> in <a href="PatternHatching.html">PatternHatching</a> and the <a href="CppReport.html">CppReport</a> for over a year now. And <a href="DirkRiehle.html">DirkRiehle</a> was writing about <a href="CompositeDesignPatterns.html">CompositeDesignPatterns</a> before that. -- <a href="BradAppleton.html">BradAppleton</a>
