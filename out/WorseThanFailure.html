        Worse Than Failure

      <p>
        <a href="WorseThanFailure.html">WorseThanFailure</a> (or <strong>WTF?!</strong>) is a website that features bad code, bad experiences, and "curious perversions in information technology"... more to amuse the audience than to provide any sort of education. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find it here:  <a href="http://worsethanfailure.com/">http://worsethanfailure.com/</a>

        Its name used to be "<a href="TheDailyWtf.html">TheDailyWtf</a>" and WTF didn't use to mean <a href="WorseThanFailure.html">WorseThanFailure</a>... It changed recently... I think that the original name was far more funny...
      </p>
      <p>
        It very quickly changed back to <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">http://thedailywtf.com/</a>
