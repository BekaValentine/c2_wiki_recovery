        Abap Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>A fourth generation </em><a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> developed by <a href="SapCorporation.html">SapCorporation</a> (SAP AG).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ABAP/4 stands for Advanced Business Application Programming. It is the programming language that SAP AG has used to develop all of the SAP R/3 business modules, applications, and system management functions.
        The current incarnation is called <a href="AbapObjects.html">AbapObjects</a>.

        ABAP... "German COBOL". ABAP is a very cumbersome language and SAP R3 is a cumbersome development environment.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>To me it came across as COBOL without all the things that make COBOL disgusting, but still maintaining its cumbersome verbosity. It also takes a while to get used to the idea of doing everything with a command instead of a function. On the other hand, being able to directly call an SQL query without having to use API functions is kinda nice</em>.

        <strong>Q</strong> Is <a href="AbapLanguage.html">AbapLanguage</a> going to play any significant role in <a href="NetWeaver.html">NetWeaver</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A</strong> Yes. <a href="NetWeaver.html">NetWeaver</a> will contain two language stacks: Java (actually, J2EE), and ABAP Objects. The vast majority of the SAP business coding is and will remain for quite some time written in ABAP.

        Bet you didn't know this: according the the TIOBE Index 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           ABAP is the 17th most referenced language on the internet! Lots of SAP installations means lots of miserable ABAP programmers, desperately looking for help.
