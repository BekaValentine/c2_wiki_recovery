        I'd really like to heed the advice "Don't <em>ask for</em> employment, go where the employment is".  My city definitely isn't it right now.  I am prepared to move, am available, and would appreciate any suggestions.

        For perspective, <a href="PortlandOregon.html">PortlandOregon</a> has the highest unemployment in the nation.

        <em>Dice can be misleading because the same job can be listed many times by different recruiters.</em>

        The RichmondVirginia number was striking.  Is that an indicator?  Anyone?  <em>I think that includes </em>ArlingtonVirginia - Richmond proper has about 190 jobs<em>  Arlington is right across from Washington DC and about 90 miles north of Richmond.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        These numbers maybe aren't as accurate as a more general <em>sense</em> of things.  What is that <em>sense</em>?  
      </p>

        The USA Today Web site used to have a neat visual aid: just select an industry, and check out how the map of the USA changes.  Flipdog has something similar, but it would be nice to see this on Monster.

        I wish we could tie down the H-1B visa lobbyists who claim there is a "shortage" of tech workers and figure out once and for all exactly where these "shortages" are.
