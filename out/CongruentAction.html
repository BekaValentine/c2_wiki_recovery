        Congruent Action
      </h1>
      <p>
        Congruence as a concept dates back a fair bit: back to Carl Rogers in the 1950's.
      </p>
      <p>
        The central idea is authenticity in interpersonal relationships; to align what we are thinking with our actions in the world.
      </p>

        <a href="GeraldWeinberg.html">GeraldWeinberg</a> is the only person I know to have given this concept the salience it deserves in technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is so easy to fall away from congruence. To get a project the funding you know it deserves, you pretend it is something it is not. This will never end well.
      </p>

        I realised recently that the degree of congruence that exists, or that it might be possible to bring to existence, is the main reason why I pick one project over another - and have done for the last 20 years.

      <p>
        I would like to see congruence given more attention. I wonder why it isn't written about more?

        Employers don't treat candidates as people, they treat them as a bag of skills. Therefore candidates have to present themselves as a bag of skills rather than who they are. As an experiment I once put out a resume that described who I am and what kind of work I do without any of the skills. I got zero hits on that resume, whereas my skill bag resumes get dozens or hundreds of hits. In fact I have found that the more I describe who I am on a resume even with skills the fewer hits I get. I have even been told that 'this resume tells too much about you'. So congruence seems to be punished by hiring managers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may stem partially from the lack of serious <a href="InformationOriented.html">InformationOriented</a> models for describing candidates,so hiring managers have to rely on a bag of skills approach i.e. data. The <a href="BusinessTalentEndemeSet.html">BusinessTalentEndemeSet</a> could be used to partially solve this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we do not have the technology to properly describe something then congruency would naturally suffer. We don't so it suffers.
