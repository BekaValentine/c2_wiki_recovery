        To Fight Evil Work On The Good

      <p>
        Best piece of advice ever from the I Ching. <a href="ToFightEvilWorkOnTheGood.html">ToFightEvilWorkOnTheGood</a> is the opposite to blame/flame/shame (please delete such content wherever you find it). In wiki terms it refers to work that produces <a href="WikiAji.html">WikiAji</a> and thereby <a href="WikiSatisfaction.html">WikiSatisfaction</a>.

        For example, thready fighting on the <a href="StarTrekUserInterface.html">StarTrekUserInterface</a> was immediately circumvented by whoever it was who added the section at the front <em>(I cannot tell a lie. It was me.)</em>. Rather than play uncultured games of one-upmanship, they added some completely original and interesting ideas that more than justify the existence of that page.

        It was said the diseased person had interests in advancing SocialJustice. In fact he was credited for making PeoplePower workable in the Phillipines and elsewhere.

        It was said when he visited SouthAmerica he did not challenged the establishment/authorities. Instead he focussed on the "humanities" of the disconnected, underprevilidged, etc.

        It was left to the conscience of people who can do things over there, who professed at church gatherings that they were just "children of God" like the rest of the people, to take steps to advance the conditions of the poor.

        <em>This has not been a very quick process in getting results. But maybe much better than the methods adopted by militant priests which he did not agree with.</em>

        <em>On the other hand, you don't clean out the garbage by not making any new. You don't get the weeds out of your garden by planting new plants. Sometimes you have just to do it.</em>...Yes Aalbert, but.  Maybe this particular statement is better placed in a different section on this page. Will be moved by <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a> soon unless done by others, or improved so the entire section is improved by inclusion.

        I don't know enough about Gandhi, but I recall a scene from the film (:-). Gandhi faced a Buddhist man whose children had been killed by Moslems. The man demanded to know how he could not hate Moslems, not make war on them, and not kill them. Gandhi calmly advised him to go to a Moslem orphanage, adopt a Moslem child, raise it in Islam, and love it as his own.
