        If you have an <a href="ExtremeTeam.html">ExtremeTeam</a>, you could sell a percentage of each iteration to a trusted customer. The customer would get exactly the software they wanted. You would get high quality direction without the danger of MarketingAttenuation. At the same time, you could still apply most of the team's effort to more generally interesting features. However, there are often customers who clearly lead the market, and being able to follow them would be valuable for both parties.
