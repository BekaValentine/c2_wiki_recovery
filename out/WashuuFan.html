      <p>
        Adds entries for undefined Wikiized terms if he thinks that he can give a definition. (happens not so often)
      </p>
      <p>
        Is open to discussion on any entries he creates and promises not to forget to add the proper category tag from now on.
        (every wiki is different... I read a lot and now I see what conventions this community has) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Admits that he was writing very few articles for other Wiki. Never edited anything but the sandboxes and  will adher to
        standards described in <a href="FaqForCategories.html">FaqForCategories</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Promises to use a <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> tag in the hope someone will comment instead of just delete his entry.
