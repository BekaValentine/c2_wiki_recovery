      <p>
        Deluge (<a href="http://www.zoho.com/creator/overview/deluge-script.html)">http://www.zoho.com/creator/overview/deluge-script.html)</a> defined by the people in AdventNetIncZoho as the <strong>D</strong>ata <strong>E</strong>nriched <strong>L</strong>anguage for the <strong>U</strong>niversal <strong>G</strong>rid <strong>E</strong>nvironment, is an online scripting language which is integrated with ZohoCreator.
        It enables (according AdventNetIncZoho) the users to add logic to the applications incrementally to make them more powerful and robust.

        Now, the interesting part is this: The elegance of Deluge syntax is that you will only speak in terms of forms and fields as the entire database layer is abstracted. Need a "select... where..." ? Write a while loop and Deluge will automatically translate it to a query to the database... Is this the <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s worst nightmare come true? Is this what <a href="CloudComputing.html">CloudComputing</a> is holding for us as the future for software development? Isn this a step back? are we going back to pre-Relational (Cobol) like programming?
