        Design Velocity

      <p>
        Could this simply be the speed at which a system is designed?

        After reaching the end of an 18 month development 
        effort with 15 developers, I found myself reminiscing
        over the team's gradual transition from analysis/design
        modeling to code.  Initially, the team's core focused
        on creating and reviewing class and object interaction
        models.  As these settled, we coded.  Thus the models
        were used to boot-strap individuals and small teams.
        This transition to code marked a maturity in the 
        developer's understanding of the problem.

        Perhaps <a href="DesignVelocity.html">DesignVelocity</a> encompasses a measure of the
        maturity of understanding of the solution -- the software
        architecture -- which starts off low, picks up momentum
        as the solution space takes on definition, and peaks
        when the team is fully armed with understanding to
        implement.  It then falls away (or changes?), as 
        concepts, mechanisms and patterns get embedded in code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being able to measure this transition in both individual
        and collective understandings would have been a
        useful progress metric.

        I have never had a project where <a href="DesignVelocity.html">DesignVelocity</a> smoothly approached an asymptote. Instead, I see chaotic amounts of design over time. You'll think you have it wired, then have the insight that completely restructures the system. There is an analogous concept in biology called "punctuated evolution". Evolution is not a process of steady "progress" towards a "goal" (me). Instead, it happens in fits and spurts.
