        I'm a Java developer, currently working for Wotif.com. I've been called a <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a>, <a href="SoftwareArchitect.html">SoftwareArchitect</a>, and a few other names, but I tend to ignore the titles and just do what I do. Possibly the best way to describe me would be as a <a href="SoftwareCraftsman.html">SoftwareCraftsman</a>, journeyman-level striving for master, ala <a href="PeteMcBreen.html">PeteMcBreen</a>'s "<a href="SoftwareCraftsmanship.html">SoftwareCraftsmanship</a>" book
      </p>
      <p>
        My current interests include J2EE development, Patterns, and <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, but I'm willing to dabble in just about anything.

        I can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:robertdw@twasink.net.">mailto:robertdw@twasink.net.</a> My personal home page these days is my blog, which is at <a href="http://twasink.net/blog">http://twasink.net/blog</a>

        Having just stumbled across this page, I can confirm that I am a <a href="GentlePersonAfflictedWithPeculiarNotions.html">GentlePersonAfflictedWithPeculiarNotions</a>. <a href="MyMyersBriggsTypeIs.html">MyMyersBriggsTypeIs</a> the IntpType, for those of who you care about those things. Personally, I don't, but I am amused at how many there are on Wiki given that we're meant to be such a small percentage of the population.

        For further information, I live and work in Brisbane, Australia. I've worked for a number of companies within Brisbane, now, and even did a stint as a private contractor. These days, as I said, I work at Wotif.com.

        I'm also the proud owner of a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>, and I find it very useful.

        For the observant, you'll note a Dilbert doll just behind me in the photo. He observes my work and protects me from harm, though not half as well as a Dogbert (Patron Saint of Technology!) doll would do. In many ways, I view Dilbert (the character, not the strip) as my <a href="TotemAnimal.html">TotemAnimal</a>. I wish I could view Dogbert that way, but I'm just not up to that standard yet. In equally many ways, I view Dilbert (the strip, not the character) as a <a href="MetaphorsWeLiveBy.html">MetaphorsWeLiveBy</a>.
