        Logic Analyzer
      </h1>
      <p>
        A logic analyzer records digital electrical signals.  
        Recording (sampling) is either...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Synchronous</em> with some other signal, typically a clock or strobe
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Asynchronous</em> sampling a regular intervals controlled by an internal time base
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The most outstanding diagnostic features of a logic analyzer
        are ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Pre-trigger</em> view of signals leading to a TriggerEvent
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Channel Width</em> large enough to view many signals, including busses
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Logic analyzers are improved when they are made 
        LongerWiderFaster, all attributes of their memory.
        Equally important are sound MechanicalProbe design 
        and SamplingElectronics.  Fancy information processing seems to 
        just get in the way.  With complicated controls one is often 
        left DebuggingTheDebugger.
