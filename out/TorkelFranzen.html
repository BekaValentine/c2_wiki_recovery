        Torkel Franzen
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Swedish logician, philosopher, and computer scientist. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of his favorite pastimes include correcting confusions
        about Godel's Theorem which are often found on the net,
        and, more generally, making a net-nuisance out of himself
        by "taking potshots" at people who, "even if by no means a 
        loon or sectarian, will either fight tooth and nail
        to avoid having to admit to any mistake or defect in [their] 
        reasoning, or else, [their] idea of a good time being as warped as
        [his], happily continue arguing just for the sake of argument."
      </p>
      <p>
        On the former, see <a href="http://www.sm.luth.se/~torkel/eget/godel.html)">http://www.sm.luth.se/~torkel/eget/godel.html)</a> and
        on the latter, see <a href="http://www.sm.luth.se/~torkel/eget/net.html.">http://www.sm.luth.se/~torkel/eget/net.html.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        These two pastimes can sometimes be indulged simultaneously, such
        as can be seen at <a href="GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem.html">GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem</a>.
