        Dont Display Advantage
      </h1>
      <p>
        If the designer displays advantage, she lays her design open to unnecessary criticism.

      <p>
        If the programmer displays advantage, she lays her code open to unnecessary criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you have an advantage, use it for the benefit of the customer: <a href="ExtremeHarmony.html">ExtremeHarmony</a> requires (or appears to) that the shape of the design,
        and the shape of the code, becomes known almost by removing what is <em>not</em> required. Advantage for whom?
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly a harmonious development environment is desirable, if only for the lower stress levels it brings. In an aggressive environment a display of advantage will start your opponents thinking how they can nullify your advantage. And the only benefit you've had is an illusory feeling of ImRightYouAreWrong for a short space of time.
