        <em>I've noticed you often resort to insults -- e.g., "[m]aybe you are just a poor algorithm factorer" or "job-security is the primary goal" -- when you're feeling defensive.  Apparently, you're run out of rational counter-arguments, especially as it's evident you're not reading what I've written.  It's been pointed out </em>'very<strong> clearly above that there aren't "30 very different 'algorithms'".  Anyway, this has all been discussed in detail and at great length in </strong><a href="HofPattern.html">HofPattern</a>.  You might wish to reread it with an open mind, rather than starting from the arbitrary assumption that HOFs are inherently bad or to be avoided categorically.  I see no point in discussing this further as long as you're going to resort to argumentum ad hominem.  If that's all you've got, I'll take it as given that I've won the debate.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You guys accused me of something like not knowing how to use HOF's or "hating" them, and are thus a hypocrite for complaining about that. You even did it in the very paragraph where you complain about me doing it (and is not the first). <strong>I will remove the ad hominem stuff anyhow eventually</strong> because I don't want to stoop to your level. But not today because I am venting. (My apologies to <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> for temporarily being an ahole.)

        <em>Is it inaccurate to state that you don't know how to use HOFs? In </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, you wrote "... I'm not skilled at HOF's".  Is it an ad hominem attack to suggest that you hate HOFs?<em></em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           "Skilled at" and "know how to use" are different levels. I know how to use a drill, but I am not "skilled" at it because I've probably used one a total of like 10 hours in my life, while a professional carpenter has probably used it thousands of hours and knows short-cuts, accuracy tricks, subtle warning signs of a bad hole, etc. Further, echoing one's own statement about oneself does not necessarily "de-homimen" it. (If you were so skilled, I would expect better scenarios.)

        What quantities and ratios are necessary to qualify as "controversial"? Or are you making up your own vocabulary rules?

      <p>
        [Controversy means subject to general debate.  This isn't a general debate -- it's just you vs everyone else.  "Conservative" vs "liberal" is controversial.  "Conservative" vs an individual's "foobism" (or whatever) is not controversy; it's a lone voice in the wilderness.  It'll become a controversy when you can convince others to share your viewpoint, such that there is more than just you arguing with the rest of us.]

        [Why are you looking in my pants?  I think it's sound advice to focus on the content rather than the creator, but it's clear that certain content has one and only one creator, and that creator thinks defending it makes it "controversial".  It doesn't.]

      <p>
        The definition of "controversial" is controversial. I've never seen it being tied to quantity or ratio of participant opinions. Hitler is one guy. Tell me he was not the source of controversy. (Damn, did I just compare myself to Hitler? Self-Goodwinning?)

           Are you serious? I suppose Converse & Park's "PHP Bible" should have been titled "PHP-only Bible" to exclude Lisp, too?

           You are comparing apples to oranges. A language book is usually not a design book. Anyhow, I consider exclusion of consideration, or at least mention of other paradigms to be a "flaw". It's a multi-paradigm world; assumptions of isolation aren't practical. If you disagree, so be it. You can give your opinion and I can give mine. (Granted, GOF may have been written in the era where many thought 100% OOP was the way to go, but I'm judging its practicality based on today's environments. That may be "unfair" to the authors, but I'm not judging the authors, only the book in terms of somebody wondering whether it's worth reading today since studies prove time-machine owners don't read books.)

Why not "Detail in Contemporary Residential Architecture (But Not Bridges or Department Stores or Towers or Skyscrapers or That Tiny Room In My Mum's Basement, If That's Okay With You?)"? Now really -- "Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" is obviously intended to be sufficiently focused on object-oriented software to not be worth mentioning anything else, so it's obviously not functional software or logic-based software or pure procedural software or mixed-paradigm software. If it was, it would have said so. Stop quibbling; if you're bored, go watch a movie or something.

        (Content that used to be in a topic titled "IDE Encourages Bloat". May be <strong>resurrected in the future</strong> when better examples are created.)
      </p>
      <p>
        IDE's tend to encourage bloat with their various "auto-code" features. Be careful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important characteristic of code is readability by future maintainers (after running). Maintenance of existing code is typically about 2/3 of the long-term cost of software such that emphasizing the writing stage is the wrong target.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an IDE generates verbose (bloated wind-bag) code, then it's counter to maintenance because it generally slows readability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Code bloat should be reduced, not automated.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, good code will do something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        humidRef = services.weather.local.humidity;<br/>
        humidRef.requestData();<br/>
        humidRef.requestMap();<br/>
        humidRef.queueProductionRequest();<br/>
        humidRef.setNotifyer(myNotifyEvent);<br/>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, many IDE's make it too easy to create this instead (and/or don't recognize the shorter version):
      </p>
      <code>
        services.weather.local.humidity.requestData();<br/>
        services.weather.local.humidity.requestMap();<br/>
        services.weather.local.humidity.queueProductionRequest();<br/>
        services.weather.local.humidity.setNotifyer(myNotifyEvent);<br/>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Plus, the service object "path" often changes over time, and if we hard-wire the full path, we have more to change, which may also risk more errors. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What IDE does this with which language?  I don't know of any "service object path" in (say) C# or Java, but there is certainly a package name.  However, it almost never changes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure past history is a decent guide to future changes. Either way, repeating long paths like the second example hurts readability of code in my opinion, especially when the parameters are more complex, creating screen wrapping of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In the case of package names, past history is a decent guide to future changes.  The package name convention in C# is <Company>.(<Product>|<Technology>)[.<Feature>][.<Subnamespace>], and in Java it's the company's domain name in reverse, followed by (usually) (<Product>|<Technology>)[.<Feature>][.<Subnamespace>].  How often do these change?  In over a decade of daily Java coding, I can count the number of times I've redefined package names on one hand, and even then it's a trivial matter of using the IDE's (Eclipse, for example) rename facility.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I agree that repeating fully qualified package names is a bad idea -- in Java, using 'import' to avoid it is a good idea.  Are there IDEs that still repeat fully qualified package names when using their wizards and whatnot?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have any specific examples I can present right now, but in general "direct" paths seem to work smoother in IDE's I use. The more indirection (references to references), the more likely IDE's are to be get confused by something, "pressuring" one to use explicit paths. Maybe I was doing something wrong and didn't know about the <a href="MagicFixButton.html">MagicFixButton</a>, but I'm sure others wouldn't know about the <a href="MagicFixButton.html">MagicFixButton</a> either.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What do you mean you "don't have any specific examples"?  Are you just making things up?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, I did not document and record and save the code and conditions of the problem. And your wording is rather harsh. Brush up your <a href="PeopleSkills.html">PeopleSkills</a> bub. You can ask questions without sounding accusatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I find it curiously hypocritical that you can make sweeping statements like "IDE's tend to encourage bloat with their various 'auto-code' features", but get defensive when I take you to task for not providing any realistic evidence to back it up.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then just say, "so far your evidence is weak" rather than "are you making things up?" Don't make stupid justifications for being a rude asshat, you asperger castoff!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But your evidence was worse than weak; it was nonexistent.  Surely, if all this had some basis in reality, you would at least remember that you -- for example -- used Eclipse to generate a SOAP </em><a href="WebService.html">WebService</a> client in Java.  Your lack of any specific content or context makes it sound like you are either making things up, or your experience is so narrow and limited that making reference to it would reveal details about a specific project.  Either way, it appears you have no evidential basis for making a general assertion that "IDE's tend to encourage bloat."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For someone who is frequently so insistent on empirical evidence über alles, you seem peculiarly reluctant to provide it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I only "insist" on it if one implies their argument is very strong. I don't claim my argument is strong. I was hoping to spark interest in the topic on IDE's and code bloat in general rather than to be insistent about my viewpoints on them. If you wish rename the topic to "Do IDE's encourage bloat?" or the like, I'd be happy to consider it. (Although, I can't make a decent wiki-name out of that particular arrangement.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If your argument is weak, why bother mentioning it, then?  Why can't you even give a remotely-realistic example?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I answered that already above.
