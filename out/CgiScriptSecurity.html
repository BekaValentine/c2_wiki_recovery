        Cgi Script Security
      </h1>
      <p>
        An issue with <a href="SheBang.html">SheBang</a> (#!) directed interpreted scripts is that it is possible to overload the server and convince the interpreter to execute a different (hostile) file.  If the script has the uid set to a user, or worse to root, considerable damage is possible.  For this reason, interpreted languages are sometimes prevented from setuid() and assigned the permissions of 'nobody'.  It is possible however to write a short compiled program that sets or acquires a uid and then calls the interpreted script, thereby giving the interpreted script the permissions of the compiled program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Is this workaround actually any more secure than allowing the scripted language to setuid itself?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes, it is more secure. The wrapper program typically has hard-coded path names that point to a directory only writeable by root. Set-uid shell scripts are fundamentally insecure. If you ever find a single one on a system, follow these simple steps to get root access:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1. Create a script that does the desired act, e.g. simply start a shell (the single line "sh" suffices). Call this script "nefarious" and put it in your home directory.
        </li>
        <li>
           2. Link the setuid script to "trusted" in your home directory.
        </li>
        <li>
           3. Now do: "mv nefarious trusted & ./trusted &" 
        </li>
        <li>
           4. If we get a root shell, done. If not, go back to step 2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This will eventually give you a root shell.
