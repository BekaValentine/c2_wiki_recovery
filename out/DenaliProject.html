        Denali Project

        A project that <a href="JimShore.html">JimShore</a> (aka <a href="JimLittle.html">JimLittle</a>) coached for a little over a year.  It was a <a href="GreenfieldApplication.html">GreenfieldApplication</a> developed using all of the XP practices.  He wrote an experience report with a cumbersome title ("Up-Front Design Versus Evolutionary Design in Denali's Persistence Layer") about part of it.  That report can currently be found at <a href="http://www.xpuniverse.com/2001/pdfs/EP203.pdf.">http://www.xpuniverse.com/2001/pdfs/EP203.pdf.</a>

        Jim, I enjoyed your paper.  In particular, I liked your anecdote where writing better tests led you to architecture breakthroughs.  -- <a href="SteveHowell.html">SteveHowell</a>

        Other stories about <a href="DenaliProject.html">DenaliProject</a> appear in <a href="OptimizationStories.html">OptimizationStories</a> (the Denali connection pool) and on the <a href="JimShore.html">JimShore</a> page (Denali internationalization).  This was my most favorite XP project.  I had the pleasure of working with Jim during some of these events, and I learned a great deal from him.  Enjoyed Portland, worked with a top-notch team, learned a lot.  Thanks, Jim!  -- <a href="RobMyers.html">RobMyers</a>
