        I'm currently a Fellow of the Technical Staff at Motorola
        Cellular Infrastructure Group in Arlington Heights, IL.
        I'm general chair for OOPSLA 2003.
        You can contact me at <a href="mailto:Ron.Crocker@Motorola.com.">mailto:Ron.Crocker@Motorola.com.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to working at Motorola, I was at Bell Labs, and
        worked with <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>. Most of my experiences with
        objects came from a brief intro as an undergrad and
        some "hands on" work at BL "debugging" the very first
        releases of C++ (If you think it's bad now, just think
        what it was like in 1984!) 
      </p>
      <p>
        I got interested in patterns at 
        OOPSLA '93 from talking to Cope; my work at Motorola
        had been related to software architecture, and patterns
        seemed to be the natural thing for describing some of the
        reasons behind decisions made in the architecture that
        appeared in either the structure or philosophy but were
        difficult to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it appears that patterns are making in-roads with
        the academic establishment, thanks to the work of people
        like <a href="DougLea.html">DougLea</a>, <a href="JohnVlissides.html">JohnVlissides</a>, <a href="GerardMeszaros.html">GerardMeszaros</a> and others
        interacting with the academic crowd at places like ICSE.

        I'm trying <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> in a project - I'm documenting
        it in <a href="RonsXpProject.html">RonsXpProject</a>. It's purposely abstract (see <a href="VagueVsAbstract.html">VagueVsAbstract</a> so I won't get into
        too much trouble with the lawyers.
