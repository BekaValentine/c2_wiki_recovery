        One of the more frequent <a href="RedShirt.html">RedShirt</a>s was a stuntman/actor named Eddie Paskey who was roughly the same shape and size as <a href="WilliamShatner.html">WilliamShatner</a>. When he wasn't getting killed repeatedly, he would stand-in for Shatner and do most of the stunts.

        One of the amusing things about <a href="StarTrekTheNextGeneration.html">StarTrekTheNextGeneration</a> is that it was the <em>command staff</em> (Captain Picard, Cmdr. Riker, etc.) who wore the red uniforms.  The unlucky color in TNG was the yellow uniforms that the security staff wore.

        <strong>The American School Sports </strong><a href="RedShirt.html">RedShirt</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also used in college or high school sports when a player sits out for a while. Athletes normally have four years of eligibility to participate in sports; however a player can participate (practice, etc., but not play) for a fifth year--a player who does that is considered to be <em>redshirting</em>.  (Such players used to wear red uniforms in practice, apparently).  Sometimes done when a player is injured early in the year; or for incoming freshmen who need (in the coaches view) a year of experience before being ready to play competitively.  See <a href="AmericanCollegeAthletics.html">AmericanCollegeAthletics</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The story I always heard is that the term comes specifically from American collegiate football.  Originally, only the "medical redshirt" (which still exists) was legal:  if a collegiate football player was hurt before the <em>nth</em> game of a season, that athlete was allowed to sit out the season without losing a year of eligibility.  When the player healed enough to practice again, he could, but could not compete in any games.  The injured player would typically wear a red jersey during practice to remind the other players they couldn't make full-contact hits on him due to his injury; hence the 'red shirt' player.  The voluntary redshirt came around a bit later.

        <strong>The U.S. Navy </strong><a href="RedShirt.html">RedShirt</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        On the deck of a US aircraft carrier (such as the USS Enterprise), flight deck crews wear uniforms color-coded to their job function.  Those who handle ordnance wear red, so Redshirts on the Enterprise are the guys who are carrying 2,000-lb bombs <em>verry carrefully</em>.  Keep in mind that all deck crew jobs (not just Redshirts) are considered some of the most dangerous in the Navy, certainly more dangerous than actually flying the planes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm more impressed that they can carry 2,000lb at all. What are they feeding those guys?</em>

        They say the Navy has the best food in the armed forces. Seriously though, they've got special equipment for this.
