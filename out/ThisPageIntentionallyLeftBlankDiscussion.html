        It seemed only fitting that a work the size of <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> should have one of these. Only problem is, I've already ruined it by writing this...

        How about those old DoD-style specification documents that would have pages saying only "<a href="ThisPageIntentionallyLeftBlank.html">ThisPageIntentionallyLeftBlank</a>."  What the hell good does that do?  I kept waiting for the day I'd see "This page unintentionally left blank." :-)  -- RS

        A friend of mine has a machine that mostly handles email.  He replaced the default Apache home page with one that reads "This page unintentionally left blank."  Caused me to double-take when I first saw it. --<a href="RogerLipscombe.html">RogerLipscombe</a>

        <em>Accidental blank pages used to be caused by copier malfunctions or mistakes on the part of the person loading pages into the copier.  "This page left intentionally blank" was invented as a way to know that all </em>really<em> blank pages were duplication mistakes.</em>

        But if the page has the <em>blank</em> message on it, then it is no longer blank.  In one document I wrote, I used the phrase: <strong>This page intentionally left non-blank</strong>. -- <a href="JimWeirich.html">JimWeirich</a>

        An old Atari ST/Macintosh/Amiga game called Brattacus came with a rather cryptic manual which seemed to purposefully leave many many questions in the reader's minds as to the nature of the game's plot and story. Anytime a bit of story or revealing info was suggested, or a question was posed, the answer was always listed like this: "To find out what crime Kyne is accused of committing, refer to page 27." Of course, page 27 had ya'lls favorite phrase on it: "this page intentionally left blank."

        <em>People seem to think this is a stupid thing to do, but it allows a section to be replaced with a slightly larger section, without altering the page numbering of later sections.  Surely that's a </em><a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>(tm), and without deliberately ContentFree pages would be impossible.  To write something standard shows that the page is not an error.  Yes, I know you're all having a laugh about a page deliberately declaring itself blank, and therefore lying, but it always seems that the people poking fun at it just don't get the point.<em></em>

        One of the manuals for the original (pre-Posix compliant) QNX operating system manual had a page that stated "This page was unintentionally left intentionally blank."
