        Hello, my name is Mariano Benitez, and to make a short
        introduction, I am a student in the Factultad de Ingenieria, Universidad
        de Buenos Aires, Argentina, which is somewhere down the ecuator. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently bought the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> book, and I don't think there 
        is another way to make good software other than using, and developing 
        patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking foward to contribute as much as I can in this 
        newsgroup, and I do have some problems that I hope you can help me to 
        resolve. I work for a hospital here in Buenos Aires, and the system
        that gave me the most painful headackes is the reservation system (I hope 
        you understand what I mean: <em>sistema de turnos</em>). I ask you if there is 
        already a group studying the problem or there is a pattern to solve it, 
        if there is not, I hope someone help me describing and solving it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope to contribute to the patterns cause, 
        <em>los saludo atentamente, hasta la proxima!</em>
      </p>
