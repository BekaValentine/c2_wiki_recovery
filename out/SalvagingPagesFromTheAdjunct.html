        Salvaging Pages From The Adjunct
      </h1>
      <p>
        As <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> Wiki has gone to "read only" without warning and without explanation from the owner, it may be a good time to take measures for salvaging any pages that are important to you.  It all goes back to the beginnings of <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a>, when many of us felt that it was just a ruse to rid Wiki of certain pages, and that <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> was always slated for a short life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, and in the future, do not be too hasty in moving pages to <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> (if it ever comes to life again).  The loss of certain so called "controversial" pages is one of the things that has turned Wiki in to a more boring and uninspiring ghost-town environment anyway.

        A healthy community is a good mix of work, innovation, inspiration, chatter, humor and play.

        <em>Maybe such pages ought be clearly marked, so that </em><a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s do not accidentally delete them.  On the other hand, I prefer that this wiki remain topical.  Perhaps using a free wiki hosting service would be preferable?<em></em>
