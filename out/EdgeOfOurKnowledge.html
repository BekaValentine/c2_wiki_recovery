          /5/03: sounds like Vygotsky's (psychologist) idea of '<a href="ZoneOfProximalDevelopmentTheory.html">ZoneOfProximalDevelopmentTheory</a>' to me: you can only learn stuff that is at the limit of what you already know.

           I had a college professor that spoke of knowledge being a white dot surrounded by darkness. As our knowledge grows, the circumference of darkness surrounding it grows as well. Now I know where he got the idea! But, now I realize there must be much more about the issue that I don't know! Yikes! -- <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>
