        The Challenger disaster brought us one of the most cogent summaries of our relationship with technology. The late <a href="RichardFeynman.html">RichardFeynman</a> was commissioned to investigate the cause, and in his final report on the subject said:

        <dd><em>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.</em></dd>

        <em>This morning, I woke to hear news at an odd hour playing in the living room.  I flicked on the TV to find out what happened and was greeted by a graphic that said "Palestine" in the center of the screen. A moment later, I realized they meant Palestine, Texas. A shuttle had blown up again. The first thing that I wondered was whether there were any Israelis on board. There were.</em>

        Holy moly, talk about coincidences.
      </p>

        There have been three disasters in the history of the US space program:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Jan 27, 1967 - Fire breaks out on launch pad of an Apollo mission. Three were killed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Jan 28, 1986 - The Shuttle Challenger exploded soon after lift-off. Seven were killed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Feb 1, 2003  - The Shuttle Columbia breaks apart on re-entry. Seven were killed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Obviously, this is not the time of year to be engaging in space travel!?! Grim humor is that at least we get farther along in each mission before disaster strikes. We're getting better. :-/
      </p>
      <p>
        With regard to the weather, 2&3 might be related.

        Both shuttle disasters had a "first" in space. Challenger had the first teacher in space. Columbia had the first Israeli in space. It also had the first person of Indian descent in space, though this wasn't her first mission.

        Another coincidence. The only two shuttle launches my wife has ever watched were the Challenger disaster and this Columbia launch. She says she'll never watch another.

        This was interesting, but let's stop talking about coincidences. Always remember that a universe constructed entirely of coincidences will always closely resemble one that never ever has them. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        Also note that many shuttle missions have "firsts," so for any three missions, it would be likely that all were some sort of "first."  There were also no monkeys aboard on any of the missions.  Coincidence? -- <a href="BrentNewhall.html">BrentNewhall</a>
