        Warning: Bugzilla aren't the easiest thing in the world to set up. It's improved, but still difficult. The default configuration assumes that you are running the package literally on bugzilla.mozilla.org - if you are <em>anyone</em> else, you will have problems.
      </p>

        Bugzilla has also been criticised for relying heavily on <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a> for its database backend, rather than using an abstract interface compatible with many different databases.

        I actually found it quite easy. Admittedly, I already had Apache, Perl and mySQL installed properly. It was just a matter of running a Perl script to download and install a bunch of stuff from CPAN, creating a user for Bugzilla to access the database, and running a setup script. Furthermore, a quick search on <a href="http://rpmfind.net/">http://rpmfind.net/</a> reveals that there are Bugzilla RPMs for several RPM-based Linux distributions. -- <a href="JosephDale.html">JosephDale</a>

        Well, I don't happen to have a need to do that. Setting it up is one thing, hacking on it is another altogether. -- <a href="JosephDale.html">JosephDale</a>

        Setting up isn't that hard anymore. If you're familiar with MySQL and perl modules, it's pretty easy, actually.
