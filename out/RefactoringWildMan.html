        Refactoring Wild Man
      </h1>
      <p>
        Someone that refactors an original page so many times at once that the original page is essentially deleted. Used as a wild card attempt at winning a wiki edit war.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's a curious interpretation. In the two places I've seen the term used, it appeared only to mean someone who refactors frequently.</em>
