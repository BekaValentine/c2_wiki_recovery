        I'm called an Enterprise Architect, so I guess I do <a href="EnterpriseArchitecture.html">EnterpriseArchitecture</a>. I've done <a href="ToGaf.html">ToGaf</a> certification and much of it makes sense. However, everybody seems to have a different view of EA.

        Ultimately I'm fed up watching business people and IT people pulling in different directions and not working together with a team, and rather than deal with that at the individual project level I want to influence things at the board level.

        It means my job is no longer IT. Instead it's a confusing hybrid of business and IT, suggesting business strategy and trying to enforce IT strategy. So far it's fun, so I'm going to keep on with it.
