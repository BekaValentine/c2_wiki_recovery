        Language Barrier
      </h1>
      <p>
        Wiki has a <a href="LanguageBarrier.html">LanguageBarrier</a>, in that even though <a href="EnglishPlease.html">EnglishPlease</a> is the chosen language, there are still many misinterpretations of meanings and understandings, as the English used in the USA is <a href="AmericanEnglish.html">AmericanEnglish</a>, that can differ in more ways then one might at first think.  Often meanings do not directly interpret, and some languages (including <a href="AmericanEnglish.html">AmericanEnglish</a>) do not have words to describe certain things and/or meanings.  This causes more problems on this Wiki then perhaps many realize.
