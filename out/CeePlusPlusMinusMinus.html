        Cee Plus Plus Minus Minus

        Actually, I believe the term used was <a href="CeePlusPlusMinusMinusPlus.html">CeePlusPlusMinusMinusPlus</a> which is read as "C++ with a lot of stuff removed and then a few added".

        I heard <a href="JamesGosling.html">JamesGosling</a> (I think) say that at a presentation I attended a few years ago.
      </p>

        Does this still exist? Did the prototype make it into product form? If so where would one look to find more complete information? Was it intended as a replacement of C++? How successful is it today? Is it what we now call <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>? (someone has applied that category to the page).

        <em>It's Java.</em>
