        In marketing terms I am now a SITCOM (Single Income Two Children Oppressive Mortgage), which is the logical progression from YUPpie when one gets married and has kids which are such hard work that one partner gives up work to raise them properly (not that we're doing a great job of that).

        Professionally, I am a software Engineer, but with aspirations to do rather more with my life, preferably before I hit 40. The one thing that makes this most likely to happen is parenthood, which is such hard work that my motivation to get out of this rut is probably strong enough to succeed. Watch this space...
