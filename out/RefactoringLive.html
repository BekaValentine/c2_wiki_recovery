        Refactoring Live
      </h1>
      <p>
        A method of presentation which illustrates via current communications and use of complementary presentation technology the art and science of refactoring. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It has as its purpose and goal to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Learn how to improve the design of existing code. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Learn how you don't have to get it right the first time. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Learn how to have more fun and less stress writing code that makes you proud to be a programmer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Refactoring, Live! was first presented as a three day demonstration of refactoring presented by <a href="LeoScott.html">LeoScott</a> and <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>.  It showed how having tests and making tiny changes lets you go faster.  It demonstrated the rhythm of refactoring (for it does have one).  It introduced XP concepts.  Finally, it provided opportunity for everyeone to get to try it for themselves.

        There were Two Sessions held about a month apart. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The first Refactoring, Live! was at IIS in Tempe, AZ, September 5-7.
        </li>
        <li>
           The second Refactoring, Live! was at IIS, October 3-5.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Suggestion following the first two sessions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        What about having a little bit of refactoring demo (15 to 30 min), then a little bit of lecture (15 to 30 min), then <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> a refactoring on the workstations (15 to 30 min) instead of three separate blocks of two hours each? That would give a better rhythm to the presentation. -- JeanMarcHeneman

        I think we'll try moving things around a bit like you suggested.

        Hey, is there anyway you could do this on the 'net so people from other continents could watch? -- <a href="ShaeErisson.html">ShaeErisson</a>

        IIS, where we gave the last two presentations, has a video camera and (so I've heard) all the right stuff to host video streams.  Perhaps we can get IIS to provide someone to run the camera and "stream" the presentation for us.  I'll look into it. -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>

        The idea is a good one, but it needs sponsors, a mechanism or facilitation, and a program and series of presenters.
