        Data Binding
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> is common to <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a>, and describes the case where one value is automatically (<strong>implicitly</strong>) maintained as a function of another. For example, one might bind the height of a picture to be a function of its width, such that changes to height automatically change the width of the image without any explicit code (other than introduction of the binding).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> can potentially incorporate sources that are outside the language in which the binding is performed. In that case, some sort of <a href="PublishSubscribeModel.html">PublishSubscribeModel</a> or (if no other options) plain old <em>polling</em> can be used. This might be performed to support live mashups and <a href="TransClusion.html">TransClusion</a>, track 'views' of a database in realtime, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> is a useful design for describing documents in terms of 'real' data, but is antithetical to the <a href="DocumentObjectModel.html">DocumentObjectModel</a> . In particular, the document 'description' should be produced as a function of one or more data-sources, and so does not require addressable elements that can be explicitly modified. <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> supports many forms of UI composition: inclusion, inheritance or extension, transformations (similar to XSLT or CSS). Linking can be added easily (though <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> doesn't provide any special support for it). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> is especially amenable to automatic caching, parallelization, and <a href="DataDeltaIsolation.html">DataDeltaIsolation</a>... i.e. one only needs to recompute a function when one of its arguments have changed, so maintaining a <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> can cut down on network traffic, and one can recompute and obtain data for many such functions simultaneously. Use of <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> to describe elements of <a href="SceneGraph.html">SceneGraph</a>s relative to a POV can help achieve <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a> displays that 'pop-in' higher LevelOfDetail and access other data based strictly on requirements at the moment. <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> is also amenable to <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a> domain-based addressing of 'data', and for distributed multi-cast trees that cut down on network traffic (i.e. with a distributed network overlay, total traffic can be reduced by an exponential factor to O(log(N)) for N concurrent users of data). So <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> is very 'upwards' scalable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some languages support <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> via 'getters' that may transparently be functions rather than stored data. However, this is incomplete since it lacks support for the optimizations described above. Especially, the ability to introduce <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s as part of a 'getter' can be problematic. Even if you don't use the side-effects, the ability to do so makes verifying any automated optimizations a challenge - doubly so if there is any black-box modularity involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there are costs associated with fine-grained <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a>: when dealing with low-level code, <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> tends to have a large overhead per unit of data. This space overhead includes descriptions of the functions and relationships between them, less-efficient data transport designs (such as use of a message queue) that avoid the problems of cycles but lose something in terms of locality, etc. These costs resist heavy use of <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> at the lower level, resulting in a 'layer' above which <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> influences a <a href="SceneGraph.html">SceneGraph</a> and below which the current data is explicitly transformed and mapped into view code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> will probably be the basis for any truly <a href="DeclarativeGui.html">DeclarativeGui</a> (since <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> itself is declarative in nature). <a href="WindowsPresentationFoundation.html">WindowsPresentationFoundation</a> supports a bit of <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a> is essentially <a href="RestArchitecturalStyle.html">RestArchitecturalStyle</a> + <a href="PublishSubscribeModel.html">PublishSubscribeModel</a>.
