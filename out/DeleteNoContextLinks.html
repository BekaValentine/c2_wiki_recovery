        You've probably just come from a page marked with this tag. The tag would have been applied because sometimes a page is almost an <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>, but not quite. This can be because it's referred to in lists of other pages - for example, suggestions of <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s that need <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a>ing - but not actually used in the context of <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> or <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you agree with the tagging of the page (be sure to check its <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s first), you can complete the deletion by replacing the text <em>DeleteNoContextLinks</em> with the text <em>delete</em>. If not, you can restore it from the <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>. It's good form to leave a note explaining why you think it was worth keeping.
