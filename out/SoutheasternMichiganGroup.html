        Southeastern Michigan Group
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was a participant in this.  I think it started around 1997 with a bunch of folks from the Detroit and Ann Arbor area.  The president of Quintessoft Engineering started it.  I think the guy's name was Martin Noreburg.  The group met for a while in Ann Arbor and then after a while a few from the east side didn't want to make the drive to Ann Arbor and started meeting in Troy, MI.  That lasted a couple of years but it's been a couple of years now now since the group in Troy has met.  Some of the folks in the original group are now part of MXPE.  I don't know if the Ann Arbor group still meets.  -- <a href="CharlesMedcoff.html">CharlesMedcoff</a>
