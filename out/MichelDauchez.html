        I found Wiki perfect to my taste and I found also people that cannot understand it. That's a lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        My house is near Paris, a light city. Family, one cat in the yard, some trees and flowers.
        My job is with people paid for the code they produce. I can read, spell, appreciate, criticize it, I sometimes write scripts and queries and I like it (when it works). The oo things have a great appeal, a friend of mine says it seems that objects are the natural language of mind.

        I loved the <a href="BeautyIsOurBusiness.html">BeautyIsOurBusiness</a> page and the subject is of great importance.
        Maybe the people who added comments to that page should put a link to pages of beautiful code they wrote or met. But maybe it belongs to the company and not to them. However, maybe they are only interested in free substances.
        - - Your ideas be welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still suggest some ideas, as to take a look at cbn <a href="ComputationalBeautyOfNature.html">ComputationalBeautyOfNature</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        - - This should go to its own Wiki page, related to CategoryBookmarks 
        -- OKa.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          c (cunning) people are proud of what they done and Wiki is indeed nicely put up, whatever the code.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I'd like to put here my email but what if it becomes subject to more spam? Maybe I shall delete every mail from people unknown unless the subject is this word now famous, Wiki. [<em>Though spam isn't impossible, I've come across no complaints of spam related to giving an email address on wiki.</em>]

        The paragraph below is candidate to go in the Sand-Booox : 
        To be seen (never heard) the best way is -
        To sign texts everywhere.
        To create favourite links in one own's page, so it shall be found, e.g. in <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a> (good).
        To post well formed samples of code, nice gifs (howTo_?), criticize <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, etc.
        - - your advice -
        A+
