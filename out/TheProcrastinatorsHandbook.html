        The strength of this book is not in its ideas for overcoming chronic procrastination, but in its discussion of the root <em>causes</em> of chronic procrastination. If you know what I mean.  But perhaps you don't, but then why should you?  I find it to be quite difficult to synapse successfully in an obtusian manner for long periods of time.
