        How can the theories and practices of Narrative Family Therapy contribute
        to the thinking behind <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>?

        I am a trained Family Therapist.  In 2000, I made a career change
        and began working with technology.  Most of my graduate studies focused on 
        Narrative Family Therapy, a postmodern theory founded by Michael White and David Epston.

        While reading <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange.html">ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange</a>, I discovered some shared philosophies behind XP and Narrative Therapy.  Below are ongoing thoughts and quotes from
        my research.  -- <a href="DaveHoover.html">DaveHoover</a>

        Not sure if this helps, but I believe <a href="LarryConstantine.html">LarryConstantine</a> was once a family therapist. You might want to take a look at some of his stuff.

      <p>
        <em>Some tidbits on </em><a href="LarryConstantine.html">LarryConstantine</a> as a family therapist:  He left the IT industry for 15 years and entered the field of family therapy from 1972 - 1987.  He published several books on childhood sexuality.  I will eventually get around to reading his book, <a href="PeoplewarePapers.html">PeoplewarePapers</a>.  --<a href="DaveHoover.html">DaveHoover</a><em></em>

        "At its best, letting go of our role as pilots steering toward a specific
        goal encouraged humility and moment-by-moment collaboration about whether
        therapy was moving in a satisfactory direction.  At its worst, it invited
        a sense of helpless, aimless, 'co-drifting.'"  -- NT:8
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is the paradigm for XP.  There is no such thing as straight and level.
        Even if things seem to be going perfectly, don't take your eyes off the road.
        Change is the only constant.  Always be prepared to move a little this way,
        a little that way.  Sometimes you have to move in a completely different
        direction.  That's life as a programmer." -- XPEXP:28

        "In striving to make sense of life, persons face the task of arranging
        their experiences of events in sequences across time in such a way as
        to arrive at a coherent account of themselves and the world around them....
        This account can be referred to as a story or self-narrative." -- NMTE:10
      </p>
      <p>
        "The stories are really the artifact at the heart of the continuing dialog
        between what is possible and what is desirable."  -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>, <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>

        "Change, whether it be a change in belief, relationship, feeling, or 
        self-concept, involves a change in language.  Fortunately...language is always
        changing." -- NT:29

        "Instead of seeing ourselves as mechanics who are working to fix a broken
        machine or ecologists who are trying to understand and influence complex
        ecosystems, we experience ourselves as interested people -- perhaps with an
        anthropological or biographical or journalistic bent -- who are skilled at
        asking questions to bring forth the knowledge and experience that is carried
        in the stories of the people we work with." -- NT:18

        "It was Epston who first called our attention to how talking of resources
        evokes thoughts of mining.  A resource to him seemed like a fixed thing
        inside of someone that you had to go in and get.  He preferred the metaphor
        of 'knowledge' [over 'resource'], as knowledge is something that develops
        and circulates among people." -- NT:17

        "A key to this therapy is that in any life there are always more events that
        don't get 'storied' than there are ones that do -- even the longest and most
        complex autobiography leaves out more than it includes.  This means that when
        life narratives carry hurtful meanings or seem to offer only unpleasant choices,
        they can be changed by highlighting different, previously un-storied events or
        by taking new meaning from already-storied events, thereby constructing new
        narratives." -- NT:32

        "...compassion isn't mere kindness, but a willingness to enter into long-term relationships,
        to accept and nurture the viewpoints of developers, managers, and customers, with any of
        whom you may disagree, to help them find ways to accept each other and build their
        community."  -- XPEXA:25

        General remark about comming from another subject/specialty and seeing common ground with the new area: I think that inescapbly happens for everyone. Its just human to see parallels, make analogies. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing special either. Sometimes the analogies are valid and useful, sometimes not. Sometimes there are more so, sometimes less. -- AnnonymousDonor (hah, I used that badge)
