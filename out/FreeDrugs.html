        Free Drugs
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here is a list of things you can do to experience drug-like effects without actually taking any. The ways proposed here are (mostly) harmless and free!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Stay awake for a long time. You will eventually hallucinate. (not so harmless)
        </li>
        <li>
           Go jogging. Free endorphin.
        </li>
        <li>
           Stand up really fast. You will experience a gentle black-out effect.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any more suggestions?
