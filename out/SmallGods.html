        <a href="SmallGods.html">SmallGods</a>...what can you say?
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="SmallGods.html">SmallGods</a> theory says that small gods are created after a critical mass of believers believes in a concept.  Thus, there is a Small God of Python, a Small God of Ruby, a Medium-Sized God of OOP, and an evil god of Visitor Patterns.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TerryPratchett.html">TerryPratchett</a> coined the theory.  <a href="DiscWorld.html">DiscWorld</a> has so many <a href="SmallGods.html">SmallGods</a> that there are no athiests, as those who openly declare that there are no gods find themselves on the receiving end of Philosophical Proof by Immolation, AKA the thunderbolt.
