        Exceptions Are Our Friends
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sure, don't use exceptions to manage normal non-exceptional conditions,
        like iterating off the end of a container.  On the other hand, exceptions
        (in the larger sense) <strong>do</strong> happen: network connections fail, disks
        get full, databases contain bogus data (yes, this is largely in the
        context of dealing with entities outside the system; if your system is
        self-contained, congratulations!)...  The question is
        how to program so as to handle those cases.  Alternative constructs
        such as error returns, state flags, and the like are vastly more intrusive for
        the same degree of rigor as exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The normal case for most code in a system, even in the face of possible
        exceptional conditions as described above, is neither to care that such 
        can happen nor to be capable of meaningfully responding to such conditions.
        Using throw/catch exceptions, such code is for the most part 
        <em>written as if no exceptions could occur</em>.  The small areas of code which
        originally detect and/or deal with exceptional conditions are essentially
        the same as in other schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Code which is erroneous in the case of exceptions thrown past it (e.g.
        leaving objects in inconsistent states) is equally erroneous in other
        schemes (e.g. ignoring an error status), and possibly more so.
      </p>
      <p>
        (In C++, at least, object lifecycles can be leveraged through
        <a href="ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization.html">ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization</a> such that explicit try/catch code
        is rarely necessary for simple cleanup).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some (pseudo) code which ignores exceptions:
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>open the input sample file</em><br/>
        <em>open the output result file</em><br/>
        <em>for each input sample,</em><br/>
        <em>for each requested value,</em><br/>
        <em>compute the value relative to this sample</em><br/>
        <em>output it</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Each pseudocode line here could generate at least one logical exception:
        the input file may not exist, the output file may be locked,
        the input file may be malformed such that extracting the <em>n</em>th sample
        fails, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the environment, the default behavior might be for the program
        to terminate rapidly, crash the machine, or whatever.
        If the environment is already exception-oriented, and many are, you may get
        an environmentally-reported unhandled-exception message, much as if you
        surrounded the above with:
      </p>
      <code>
        try<br/>
        <em>do all the above</em><br/>
        catch Exception e<br/>
        <em>print e's message</em> -- assume some sensible msg.<br/>
        <em>terminate.</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is probably adequate for this program.  If you wanted to change it to ignore samples which produce exceptions during the <em>compute</em> phase, you
        could localize the catch to there.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, consider recoding this same code to provide a similarly
        minimal error message with status returns: <em>each line</em> would have to be
        extended to at least have something equivalent to:
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>open the input sample file</em><br/>
        <em>if inputfile's status = bad then return my status := bad</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which is far more intrusive. --<a href="JimPerry.html">JimPerry</a>

        Having read quite a few wise words from <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>, I was surprised
        to read all his negative comments about exception mechanisms.  Having
        used exceptions extensively in Lisp, C++, and Java, I have come to
        like them very much.  I agree with the remarks above by <a href="JimPerry.html">JimPerry</a>, but
        I'd like to go further.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider a method whose purpose is to open a file and return, say, a
        File object on which all kinds of nice file operations can be
        performed.  There are many qualitatively different outcomes of
        attempting to open a file.  Maybe the pathname is syntactically
        disallowed and cannot possibly refer to any file.  Maybe no file of
        that name exists.  Maybe one of the directories in the pathname of the
        file doesn't exist.  Maybe there is such a file, but you don't have
        permission to read it.  Maybe you don't even have permission to know
        whether such a file exists or not.  Maybe the medium (singular of
        media) holding the file is currently offline (anyone else remember
        disk drives with removable disk packs?).  Maybe the pathname is a link
        whose target doesn't exist.  Maybe the pathname specifies a file on a
        remote file server, but we cannot open a network connection, which
        might mean that the network is down or that the server is down at this
        moment, but it might come back up later.  Maybe the operating system
        has a limit on the number of open files in the system, and so many
        other processes have so many files open that the system-wide limit has
        been reached.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, a method whose purpose is to open a file has to do <em>something</em>
        in all these cases.  One possibility is to halt the CPU, or, in a more
        civilized operating system, to terminate the process, perhaps after
        printing or logging a message somewhere or other.  But this clearly
        isn't adequate in all cases.  Suppose the program is a mail-handling
        daemon, which looked in a database to find the pathname of where a
        given user's mail should be stored, and it attempts to open that file.
        Surely the mailer should not die; whatever happens to this mail
        delivery, it should live to deliver other mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, the simplest approach would be to treat any failure to open the
        file as it it were a bug in the program.  Control would flow
        non-locally to some kind of bug handler, which might log diagnostic
        information in an error log file, and then cause the mailer to
        continue with what it was doing.  That's better than having the mailer
        die, but it's still pretty lame.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's lame because a good mailer should <em>handle different problems</em>
        differently<em>.  For example, if the problem is that a network</em>
        connection could not be formed, the mailer might want to re-queue this
        mail and try again later, and only give up if many attempts have
        failed over a long enough period. But if the problem is that the
        pathname is syntactically disallowed, there's not much point in trying
        again later.  If the system-wide limit on the number of open files has
        been exceeded, maybe the mailer should stop trying to deliver mail
        altogether for a while, and try again later.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also lame because the mailer should not treat these circumstances
        as if they were bugs in the mailer.  <em>They're not bugs at all.</em>  The
        mailer should <em>anticipate</em> that these things might happen, and do
        something smarter than treat it as a bug.  For example, it might send
        mail back to the original sender explaining that the mail could not be
        delivered, and better yet, explain why not.  It could notify the
        recipient, explaining the problem (provided it has some way to talk to
        the recipient other than sending mail to the file!).
      </p>
      <p>
        So the method that tries to open files should have some way to report
        back to its caller that it did not succeed, and it should furthermore
        be able to tell which of the circumstances listed above occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to do this is to return an "error code".  I first saw
        extensive use of this technique in the source code of applications
        written for the Multics system.  Multics system programs were written
        in a language that supported call-by-reference (it was PL/I), and by
        convention every procedure call's last parameter was named "code" and
        was set by the procedure to an error code saying which thing went
        wrong, or a value (let's say it was zero) meaning success.  The caller
        was required to <em>explicitly check</em> the error code after every
        procedure call.  Your typical simple application, unlike the mailer,
        didn't have any idea what to do with most special circumstances, and
        would just "blow up": the application would print a message and stop
        executing (a non-local goto to the command processor).  So most
        procedure calls looked like this (I don't remember the precise PL/I
        syntax but you get the idea):
      </p>
      <code>
        call file_manager_$open_file(pathname, code);<br/>
        if (code != 0)<br/>
        then do;<br/>
        call error_message_printer(code);<br/>
        return;<br/>
        end;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That's six lines of code, usually preceeded and followed by blank
        lines.  The first line carries all the interesting information and the
        other five are boring boilerplate.  In my opinion, it was really ugly.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I started using Unix (around 1979, AT&T Unix Version 6 on a DEC
        PDP-11; Berkeley Unix was still being built), I was appalled to find
        that things were even worse: callers often did not check error codes,
        causing all kinds of peculiar misbehavior, and if they did check the
        error code, they'd often print an error message with little useful
        content (of the "Could not open file" variety).
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion, it's much better if the <em>default</em> behavior, i.e.  the
        behavior of a caller that does not bother to consider the exceptional
        conditions, ought to be to treat the condition as a bug.  If the
        program has no bug handler, the program should terminate and a useful
        diagnostic shown to the user.  If the program has a bug handler, flow
        of control should be transferred to it, along with enough information
        to provide a useful diagnostic, which might be logged or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, this is what should happen by <em>default</em>, if the caller
        doesn't say anything.  That means you don't need the boring
        boilerplate after every procedure call!  So, no more error code
        parameter.  What you have instead, for the benefit of callers that
        <em>do</em> want to deal with these conditions, is an exception mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exception handlers (in Java, these are try/catch statements) therefore
        have <em>two distinct purposes</em>.  They can be used to explicitly handle
        exceptional conditions that are <em>anticipated</em> by the programmer (the
        mailer knows to requeue if the network is down), and they can be used
        to handle <em>unanticipated</em> occurrences, which are bugs (the mailer
        logs the error and goes to process the next thing).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's turn to the points made by <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> provided this example in <a href="CodeWithoutExceptions.html">CodeWithoutExceptions</a> and
        <a href="AvoidExceptionsWheneverPossible.html">AvoidExceptionsWheneverPossible</a>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>In Smalltalk, if you look in a Dictionary for a key and it isn't present, you'll get an exception if you code it thus:</dd>
      </dl>
      <code>
        someDictionary at: someKey<br/>
      </code>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>If you can't recover the program if the key is missing, let your outside exception handler report the error and eject. However, if you think that the key might legitimately be missing, in Smalltalk you can code:</dd>
      </dl>
      <code>
        someDictionary<br/>
        at: someKey<br/>
        ifAbsent: [^self noKeyAction]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Ron evidently has no problem using exceptions as a way of handling
        bugs, but he does not like using exceptions for anticipated
        conditions, if I understand him properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, look at this example in light of the <em>caller</em> of the
        method containing this code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think about the larger context in which this code fragment appears.
        What method does this code appear in, and what is that method's
        contract (i.e. what behavior does the caller expect of it)?
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose it's a method whose job is to send a given message to
        a given named entity, and to get the reply message from that
        entity.  So the method takes two arguments, the message to
        send and the name of the target entity, and returns one value,
        the message in reply.
      </p>
      <p>
        The method, in order to implement its contract, looks up the name
        of the entity in a Dictionary, where it expects to find a Connection
        (or something) to which the message should be sent and from which
        the reply will be gotten.  Now, what happens if the caller passes
        in a gibberish name, which is not found in the dictionary?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the default case, the program has no idea how to handle this
        circumstance.  The method cannot fulfill its contract.  This means
        that an unanticipated condition has arisen, just the same as if the
        program had evaluated some kind of internal consistency check and the
        check came out false.  It means that there is a bug in the program.
        Every system should provide some way for programs to control what
        happens if a bug is encountered.  <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> seems to agree up to
        this point: he implies that using exception systems as a way to let a
        program handle unforseen problems (bugs).
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, let's consider the alternative: define the contract of the
        method so that the contract explicitly says something about what to do
        if it determines that the name passed in by the caller is gibberish.
        OK, we agree that the contract ought to say something about that case.
        But what should it say?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ron provided code, but did not provide the contract, so I'll have to
        guess, but it sure looks like his contract is that the method returns
        some kind of special value, computed by "self noKeyAction",
        should the name turn out to be gibberish.  To my mind, this is a lot
        like returning an error code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>At this late date (and hour) I may not go back and clarify that, but I use error codes even less frequently than exceptions. What I don't like about exceptions is that they glom up the way the code looks, and the error code technique builds essentially the same (to me)undesirable code structure. I have in mind something more like returning a default value that will in fact work benignly. Where that's impossible, my next preference is for </em><a href="ThrowDontCatch.html">ThrowDontCatch</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't understand how this would work.  For example, could you show an</em>
        example of a program that attempt to open a file, and deals with several
        of the circumstances I listed above?  If there's a way to do it that's
        better than exceptions and better than error codes, I'm all ears. -- <a href="DanWeinreb.html">DanWeinreb</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now consider the callers.  I claim that we want it to be the
        <em>default</em> that if a caller does not <em>explicitly</em> take into account
        the possibility that the name is gibberish, then the <em>default</em>
        behavior should <strong>not</strong> be for the calling method to proceed to
        execute the next statement (or proceed to compute the expression that
        it's in the middle of, or whatever).  That is, it should not proceed
        with normal execution as if nothing unusual had occurred.  Something
        else should happen.  And anything else besides proceeding normally, by
        definition, is for the flow of control to proceed non-locally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ron's example does not have this property.  His method reports the
        fact that the name was gibberish by returning some kind of special
        value that acts as an error code.  If the caller neglects to
        specifically check for that special value, flow of control continues
        normally.  The program thinks that the method succeeded, and proceeds
        to do whatever it would normally do upon success, such as write a log
        record saying that it sent the message, increment the count of how
        many messages were sent, or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has all the disadvantages I discussed above.  Simple programs
        either need to have the boring boilerplate a la Multics, or they can
        just do the wrong thing, a la early Unix.  Whereas if the method
        reported its problem by throwing an exception, sophisticated callers
        could deal with the circumstance, while simple applications would
        print out a message and terminate instead of proceeding to wreak
        further havoc.
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, that was looking at the method's caller's perspective.  Now let's
        look at the method itself and how it uses Dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ron's solution to Dictionary lookup has the properties that I like.
        An unsophisticated program will use the "at:" method, and if the key
        is not found, it's treated like a bug, as described above.
        Sophisticated callers will use "at:ifAbsent:", and can do what they
        like.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what about opening files?  Above, I listed nine unusual
        circumstances that might arise, each of which might need to be handled
        differently.  Surely we don't want a second "open" method that takes
        nine blocks of code as arguments.  Worse, a given caller might want to
        handle only some of them, and leave the rest to be treated as
        unexpected, so we might really want to have two-to-the-ninth different
        methods, which is obviously absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, the exception mechanism allows the sophisticated program to
        anticipate and handle whichever of the conditions it can anticipate.
        If one occurs that it did not anticipate, that's a bug, and would be
        handled by an "omnibus" handler, probably in some stack frame close to
        the base of the stack.

      <p>
        There were various discussions about whether exceptions should be used
        for things like terminating a recursive search.  In my opinion, the
        confusion here results from the fact that some languages, such as
        Java, have no interprocedural non-local flow control primitive, and
        the only way to get interprocedural non-local flow control at all is
        by using exceptions.  (Java does have intraprocedural non-local
        flow control, e.g. return, continue, break, labelled statements.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, there are explicit primitives for non-local flow
        control: throw, return-from, and go.  See chapter 5.2 of the <a href="CommonLispHyperSpec.html">CommonLispHyperSpec</a> (<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/05_b.htm)">http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/05_b.htm)</a>
        for the official language spec.  The exception (Lisp calls them
        "conditions") system is a more sophisticated and heavier-weight
        facility, built on top of the non-local flow control primitives.  See
        chapter 9 (<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/09_a.htm)">http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/09_a.htm)</a>
        for the spec.  So in Lisp, it's fine to terminate a recursive search
        with a throw or a return-from.  It consumes a lot less processor time
        than an exception, and no memory resources (there's no exception object).
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know why Java conflated these two things.  I'd guess that they
        wanted to keep the language that much smaller, but I'm just speculating.

      <p>
        Several people argued that programs should <em>test in advance</em> to
        detect unusual situations, rather than handling exceptions.  That
        works pretty well if the test is very cheap, e.g. testing for zero
        before dividing.  But in the case <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> considered, the cost to
        detect an absent key in a Dictionary is about the same as the cost of
        retrieving the value associated with the key.  Every method that
        anticipated that a key might not exist would have to pay the cost of
        table lookup twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case I described, opening files, the cost of checking for all
        those conditions would be prohibitive.  Also, suppose you check
        whether the network is up, and then you try to open the file, but in
        the interval between your check and your attempt to open, the network
        goes down?

        <em>Another reason for not testing in advance can be security. Now that everything is networked in some way, something as simple as a method call may involve interaction between separate systems behind the scenes. In such a situation advance testing, e.g. of access permissions, is just not possible because it would imply the client and thus the potential attacker would decide whether something is permitted or not. Consider for instance </em>WebApplications. One may execute code on both sides, on the server and in the client, i.e., the Web browser. But when it comes to authentication, session management, etc., one has to make all relevant decisions on the server side. There is just no point in implementing a solely browser-based password check.I think one will encounter similar situations in just about any distributed system. -- <a href="SvenTuerpe.html">SvenTuerpe</a><em></em>

        I have more to say on the topic of the automatic propagation of exceptions, which I'll try to get to in the future.

        It's important to have a way to clean things up when non-local flow of
        control unwinds past a given level.  <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> has unwind-protect, and
        Java has try/finally, which are fine.  C++ awkwardly forces you to do
        such cleanups in an object destructor method, which means you sometimes
        have to make a class for the sole purpose of cleaning something up.

        An issue on which I am still undecided is the question of checked versus
        unchecked exceptions in Java.
