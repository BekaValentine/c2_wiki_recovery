           AlineProject is a Mac software build system.  Formerly <a href="MpwShell.html">MpwShell</a>-based, A-line 2 has been rewritten in C++, using ToolServer only for running proprietary tools like compilers.  It may even be possible to call the IDE plug-in compilers by using the Code Fragment Manager, but Metrowerks engineers assure me this is more or less impossible.

        Other projects I am or have been involved in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           OpenSSL <<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a>>.  I've volunteered to maintain Mac OS support for OpenSsl.  This is on hold pending further development of Lamp.
        </li>
        <li>
           Linux/mac68k <<a href="http://www.mac.linux-m68k.org/">http://www.mac.linux-m68k.org/</a>>.  I'm the second maintainer emeritus of the Mac-OS-hosted m68k Linux bootloader, named Penguin.  I hold the distinction of releasing the first usable version of Penguin, although I probably put in the least effort of all the maintainers.

        Nice, another six-degrees-of-Wiki connection - I used to use TinyMUSH/Mac, back in the day (we swapped mail, once or twice). Thanks for a fun product. (Incidentally, how's Walker going?) -- EarleMartin

        Hey, Earle.  I haven't received any email regarding TinyMUSH/Mac for years, so I'm assuming nobody uses it anymore.  They've probably all switched to Dan's PennMUSH or something whose maintainer actually updates the game engine.  Since I had no users (I wasn't using it either) I stopped working on it.

        Walker, as outlined in a Web page that's been untouched for five years, remains now as it was then -- vaporware.  However, my htget command-line utility, run from Genie, downloads and displays Web documents, if you don't mind that it performs no interpretation of the content and dumps the raw data to the window (or a file).  I had some HTML-parsing code from years ago that I may or may not attempt to salvage (and savage, which would happen if I recoded it in my current vernacular C++).  Walker remains a low priority, for one thing because it's such a huge undertaking to produce a useful product, and for another because I have more pressing projects to spend my time on.  But while you won't see Walker anytime soon, I have been making progress on some very exciting things, if you find new Mac OS software exciting.  -- Josh
