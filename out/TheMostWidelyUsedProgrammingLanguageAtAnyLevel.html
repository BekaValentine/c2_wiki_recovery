        Someone decided to start this one over. That probably was a good idea generally, given the level of emotion growing.

        I found a "distribution of development languages" survey embedded inside this presentation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~akmal/presentations.dir/00.bcsoops.pps">http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~akmal/presentations.dir/00.bcsoops.pps</a>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The source of the survey is "Soundview/Financial Group, 10/97". Numbers were given for 1997, with projections to 1999. The 1997 numbers were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           35% COBOL
        </li>
        <li>
           20% Visual Basic
        </li>
        <li>
           16% C++
        </li>
        <li>
           8% Java
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Disclaimer -- the methodology of the survey is unknown, so take the numbers with due skepticism. -- <a href="StuCharlton.html">StuCharlton</a>

        Let's do a new survey...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>this has already been done with </em><a href="VoteOnProgrammingLanguages.html">VoteOnProgrammingLanguages</a><em></em>

        That is favorites, not usage. We often don't have much of a choice.

        This is just a reminder that the title contains more than one question. "Most widely used" can be interpreted as referring to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           total number of programs written in that language that are in production today
        </li>
        <li>
           the total LOC of those programs
        </li>
        <li>
           number of programs currently being written in that language
        </li>
        <li>
           number of programmers using that language
        </li>
        <li>
           biggest media awareness
        </li>
        <li>
           ... ?
        </li>
      </ul>

        I would be surprised if all these questions had the same answer. -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>

        It appears (after reading some computer magazines) that the following
        five languages are currently the Biggest in <strong>media awareness</strong>:

        The ARM processor core may be competing here now. It's used in most mobile telephones, and they might now outnumber television remote controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nah. People who don't have cell phones surely have TVs. And anyway, MCS-51s are used in millions of cars, microwave ovens, wall thermostats, and zillions of other applications. Use your imagination. Anywhere you can replace $5 worth of electronics with a $2 processor it's been done with an 8051.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. In particular, you almost certainly have an 8051 variant living inside your computer keyboard, translating button presses to serial scan codes. <em>Once upon a time, it was almost always an 8048.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        While I like the 32-bit ARM processor, less than 10% of all the CPUs sold in the world are 32-bit or more. 55% are 8-bit.
        (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor).">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        These stats are from 2002; anyone have more recent stats? I'd also be curious to know how that 55% number divides into Microchip PIC, Atmel AVR, (formerly Intel) 8051, and FreeScale (formerly Motorola) 6800 families. And any others I missed.

        Yeah -- an AtTiny12, at that! Talk about brain dead! Hardly any horsepower there at all. 32 <em>bytes</em> of RAM?!? Enough for the task, though.
