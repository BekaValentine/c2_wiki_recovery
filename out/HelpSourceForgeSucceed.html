        Help Source Forge Succeed

        I'd be interested in a discussion of how to <a href="HelpSourceForgeSucceed.html">HelpSourceForgeSucceed</a>.  <a href="CopyLeft.html">CopyLeft</a> extremists need not join in, since they believe any lucre derived from proprietary software development is tainted, so the <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a> servers are out of bounds.

        <em>What would be a measurement of the "success" of </em><a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>, and what sorts of improvement do you think are needed? It seems to me that SF is already pretty successful at fulfilling its mission - providing webspace for people to maintain free/open-source projects without paying for it - and I don't think there is much danger of it disappearing any time soon. As <a href="HelpSourceForgeSuck.html">HelpSourceForgeSuck</a> indicates, there are many examples of poorly maintained projects, but I don't think that is really a serious problem. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a><em></em>

        As of summer 2003, <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a> is sucking more and more.  Project search was down or flaky for months earlier this year; now anonymous CVS is acting up as a result of the (correct) decision to allocate more bandwidth and CPU resources to developer CVS than to anonymous.  In a nutshell, they're running old code on systems that can't keep up with the load.  A number of the larger, more populous projects are considering moving their hosting.

        One word: Synergy. Now how do you make a metric for that?

        <em>My guess would be something to the effect of syners? You know, kilosyners, centisyners for those who like to only give 10%. -- </em><a href="MichaelKing.html">MichaelKing</a><em></em>

        <em>The opposite of </em><a href="HelpSourceForgeSuck.html">HelpSourceForgeSuck</a> should be something more like HelpSourceForgeRock.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, the opposite of </em><a href="HelpSourceForgeSuck.html">HelpSourceForgeSuck</a> should be something more like HelpSourceForgeBlow.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Or if you're from Apple:  </em>HelpSourceForgeLikeSuckLess.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What about HelpSourceForgeFailToSuck?

        It does rank them by downloads and other criteria, thus the lame ones are mostly at the end. It's kind of like a Google search, the higher the search-results page number, the less relevant or useful the results. Thus, I see little reason to complain: simply give up after page 4. Yes, it would be nice if people weren't flaky, but we don't live in an perfect world. They have their own version of <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a>s.
