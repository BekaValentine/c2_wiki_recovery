        Western Reductionism
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Western Reductionism" is a working term for the idea that with enough resources "everything is dissect-able" to find out why it works by studying and measuring the individual parts and seeing how it affects the whole and vise verse. <a href="StepwiseRefinement.html">StepwiseRefinement</a> is an example of such a view.

        In science it is representative by the practice of holding every variable but one constant to study each variable one a time in terms of the known levels of the other (constant) variables. This is then compared to the model(s) to measure fit. (Perhaps a practical use for <a href="EveryCombinationInManyProgrammingLanguages.html">EveryCombinationInManyProgrammingLanguages</a>.)

        WR tends to conflict with what may be called "eastern thought" and holism (as in "holistic" medicine). In these, one "feels" the correct answer using a combination of experience and wisdom and perhaps meditation. These tend to put a higher value on <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>.

        <em>Reductionism was </em>discovered<em> as successful strategy to conquer nature by the Enlightenment. And that happened in </em>western<em> society. So western in </em><a href="WesternReductionism.html">WesternReductionism</a> is redundant. I assume you put it in to make a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>.<em></em>
        <em>Reductionism doesn't neccessarily hold one variable fixed, though where possible this significantly simplifies matters.</em>

        For now I'll leave it as a standing working definition because it covers more than physical reduction, such as logical and statistical reduction. -t
