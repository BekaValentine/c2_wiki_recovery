        Real Office
      </h1>
      <p>
        A quickly fading reality; the <a href="RealOffice.html">RealOffice</a>. At one time in the corporate world, <a href="RealOffice.html">RealOffice</a> was constructed of four walls and a door. The wall material was immaterial; glass, drywall, wood, anything would do. Most <a href="RealOffice.html">RealOffice</a> would have a black board or white board to visualize ideas to yourself and others. By having the <a href="RealOffice.html">RealOffice</a>; it meant you had arrived and had something to contribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="RealOffice.html">RealOffice</a> allowed one to concentrate, converse on the telephone, and have meetings without disturbing others around your <a href="PersonalSpace.html">PersonalSpace</a>. Your privacy was available in a <a href="RealOffice.html">RealOffice</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now with the disappearance of the <a href="RealOffice.html">RealOffice</a>, disturbance and no privacy rule the day. Even Executives are not immune to privacy breaches, their assistants sit in a <a href="CubeFarm.html">CubeFarm</a> with the Proletariat and conversations are heard with privacy leaks.
