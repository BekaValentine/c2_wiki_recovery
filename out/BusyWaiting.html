        Busy Waiting
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>. Also known as "spinning."
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a process whereby the CPU spends most of its time in a tight loop waiting for a device to become ready. Used by newbies and people not familiar with the myriad ways to avoid this in real time operating systems.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Not always an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>.  Sometimes critical sections, events, context switches, etc. impose unacceptable overhead.  That's when you need a <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a>.  <em>Or when those kinds of sync. objects may not be available on the platform you are using.</em> -- <a href="JamesTwine.html">JamesTwine</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also useful if the worst case busy wait is just a few machine cycles, e.g. when talking to a memory-mapped hardware device; sometimes the only available suspend mechanisms have much too large of a granularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in software-only single processor systems, there's never any point in <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a>, because the resource will only become free once another thread/process runs, which is only possible once the current thread yields explicitly or due to quantum expiration, so one should go ahead and yield the processor immediately rather than pointlessly <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the critical difference between <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> and Polling is that Polling includes blocks of time where the CPU is free to do other things.  For example: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a>:<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        while ( MyFileIsNotReady() )<br/>
        {<br/>
        //Do nothing<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>Polling:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        while ( MyFileIsNotReady() )<br/>
        {<br/>
        Sleep(1000);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Polling is sometimes necessary and sometimes a good idea;  <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> is very rarely necessary and is almost always a bad idea.
