        Full Time Open Source Developer

      <p>
        This page was constructed to start a discussion/explanation of how one would become a <a href="FullTimeOpenSourceDeveloper.html">FullTimeOpenSourceDeveloper</a> and what kind of revenue streams one could depend on. Comments from someone who is presently a <a href="FullTimeOpenSourceDeveloper.html">FullTimeOpenSourceDeveloper</a> would be excellent. Please edit.

      <p>
        An <a href="FullTimeOpenSourceDeveloper.html">FullTimeOpenSourceDeveloper</a> is someone who creates software and invites other OpenSourceDevelopers to enjoin in the project. Most of the time, people find a project that addresses a problem that they might be having and extending the software to solve the problem they are having.

        Issues with Becoming A <a href="FullTimeOpenSourceDeveloper.html">FullTimeOpenSourceDeveloper</a>:

      <p>
        Regarding adding "full time" to the page name: you have to understand that asking about getting paid to do full time open source work is extraordinarily rare, percentage-wise, and really is an utterly different subject than just asking about plain old open source development itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's like the difference between asking about painting, versus asking about becoming rich by painting. Most people paint as a hobby; it is notoriously difficult to even make a good income in the arts and entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've done part time open source development, as a hobby, for decades. Last year for the first time I worked with someone on an open source project that might also yield some income some day, maybe, no guarantees, and not any time soon.

        Some options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           First and foremost, lower your expectations.  You should now be working primarily for idealism, not for money.  Cut your expenses.  Simplify.
        </li>
        <li>
           Get a day job.  This could include becoming the homemaker of your partnership.
        </li>
        <li>
           Find a patron.  Some larger companies will fund your work on <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> technologies if it is important to their markets.  Example: video card and printer companies fund a lot of work on the <a href="XwindowSystem.html">XwindowSystem</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Apply for a grant.  This may require entering academia first.
        </li>
        <li>
           Government work.  See if any local government agencies or non-profits would fund you to create an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> alternative to some expensive piece of business software.  (This would be like contracting, so you'll have to be able to sell your idea.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Try academia or <a href="BigScience.html">BigScience</a> - They often do cutting edge software development (see e.g. <a href="HyperTextHistory.html">HyperTextHistory</a>, <a href="GridComputing.html">GridComputing</a>), and are often (at least in Europe) happy to release the results under an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> license. Try checking for interesting projects at your closest university or research lab.
