        Blame Game
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a fun activity. Something that must be experienced at least once.  It doesn't sound like a very nice game.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've never experienced it before, here's how it goes (one example anyway):
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by identifying a serious problem. Then blame someone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blaming involves:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Point a finger directly at someone unrelated to the problem
        </li>
        <li>
           Come up with some unfounded false accusation to apply, clearly implicating the other person
        </li>
        <li>
           State it loudly and unashamedly
        </li>
        <li>
           Watch that person shrivel in terror
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is to keep the BlameSession going as long as possible. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, at no point in time is anyone allowed to offer a serious remedy of the actual problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bonus points for blaming people not involved in the meeting but keeping the BlameSession alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way to end a <a href="BlameGame.html">BlameGame</a> occurs when it seems inevitable that the BlameSession cannot continue. At this point, election of a <a href="ScapeGoat.html">ScapeGoat</a> should occur.
