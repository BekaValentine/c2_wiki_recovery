        Foreigner who rented cars in US were reported by reader digest (Aug04 issue) caught offguard by heavy fines for speeding, recorded by <a href="WirelessDevices.html">WirelessDevices</a> in newer autos that are linked to GPS. The same type of devices were said to be used in at least one case of stalking individuals.
