        I have the case where people want to take a document home and read it. Hypertext systems don't make this easy.

        I was thinking of taking a root link and for every child link introducing a header and making one big html page that could be printed. Maybe a PDF document. I could check for cycles, create a table of contents, etc.

        Anyone has this sort of thing or have better ideas?

        Haven't you ever wanted to just get a big document and read it instead of jumping links all the time? It reminds me of how people complain that <a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> make OO code hard to understand.

        This creates the same problem as online documentation for applications which substitutes for a printed manual. Major vendors who publish in this way and charge you extra for a printed manual. Remember CorelGraphicsPackage3? I think that was the last time Corel actually published a book that had all the jillions of little clipart images shown in it. It is not easy to spin through all the images on a disk to find the one you need.

        It would be good if somebody came up with a linearizing tool. Until then one is left with capturing a page and all its links using a tool like Site Snagger, realizing that you'll get plenty of useless fluff as well.
