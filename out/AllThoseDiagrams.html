        All Those Diagrams
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many methods propose a large number of diagrams for various things.
        But in real use, you don't have to use them all.
        Depending on your projects, experience, and so forth, you
        can make a good selection.

        Another useful idea is to use these things on demand, much like
        an XPer would use CRC cards.
