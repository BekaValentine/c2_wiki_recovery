        Geraldo:
        There is a project in here somewhere, and it's a 'for-profit' one! In a world of 'convergence'...you've converged. I am hoping we might tag along. Let us know.

        Geraldo, don't take it personally if someone modifies your content or removes your signature from something you wrote. Wiki has a different idea of authorship compared to other forums. If someone revises something you wrote, they might remove your signature so others know that it isn't the work of just one person. -- <a href="RobHarwood.html">RobHarwood</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hi Rob! I am actually happy if someone interacts. However, should I sign what I write or not? It seems to me that signing was a </em><a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They can be a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> or a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>, depending on your perspective. See <a href="UsingSignatures.html">UsingSignatures</a> for some discussion of it. Sometimes I sign, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I read something I wrote a while ago and remove the signature. I <em>do</em> believe that <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> is better than <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, and I also believe that <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> should (usually) present an anonymous document section at the top of the page, but that's just my opinion. It's up to you if you want to sign your contributions, I just wanted to make sure you didn't get offended when I noticed you restored one of your signatures that had been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun... I was just signing things I had written before and thought that should be signed. Not even noticed that you had deleted the signature... ;-)
