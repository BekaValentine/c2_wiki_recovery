        Apathetic Disdain And Pedantic Nitpicking
      </h1>
      <p>
        A common reaction when people promote new ideas or propose action.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reaction can be discouraging.  However, it should be recognized that whenever nobody seriously criticizes an idea, it is either because the idea is basically a good one, or because nobody understands it. If the worst thing critics can say is that you misspelled a few words or didn't use the proper jargon, then you may be on the right track. Lack of vocal enthusiasm from others does not imply lack of support.
