        I am technical director at a small eLearning startup in Dublin, Ireland which you can see more about at <a href="http://www.learnex.com/">http://www.learnex.com/</a> (warning: this is not recommended for those that have a long list of gripes about <a href="WhatsWrongWithFlash.html">WhatsWrongWithFlash</a>.)

        As such I am mostly concerned with <a href="MultiMedia.html">MultiMedia</a> programming of <a href="BusinessAndEthics.html">BusinessAndEthics</a> training software, with a heavy emphasis on the media. I also have to delve into all the issues surrounding LearningManagementSystems, as invariably our clients are more or less interested in tracking the users' use of our products.

        Previously I did a lot of reasonably successful <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> projects, had a <a href="DotCom.html">DotCom</a> experience that is best forgotten about and taught programming on a Digital Media MA course. In a previous life I produced quite a number of MusicVideos and TvCommercials.

        I hang out on the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> because without <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> my job would have a really spooky <a href="ProgrammingDejaVu.html">ProgrammingDejaVu</a> experience virtually every day. I only resort to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> as a last resort though, because mostly I work alone!
