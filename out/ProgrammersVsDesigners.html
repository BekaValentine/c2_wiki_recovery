        The left side of the equation applies equally to all technical experts (engineers, 99% of architects <em>in reality</em>) and the right side to all creative experts (good authors, exceptional architects, artists, et cetera). The basic idea is that they are <em>different</em>.

        Plagiarism is considered a good thing in engineering circles (a good way to learn, educational and so on), and an abomination in artistic circles. Redoing someone else's work is <strong>anti</strong>-design.  <em>Actually, Plagiarism as it relates to publication is considered a bad thing in both engineering and artistic circles.  It's considered a good thing in both circles purely as a learning tool.  There is no distinction.</em> Plagiarism as it relates to publication in artistic circles is considered appropriation or sampling. Artistic circles are the place where 'good/bad' thing have no useful meaning.

                <li>
                   No. XP is all about keeping your high-level design in a state that can accommodate change without failure. There all all kinds of XP practices that give a high level design, and most programming teams should have a huge whiteboard with the current design anyway. And yes, this applies to any definition of high-level you care to take, within the scope of a software project. -- <a href="DaveFayram.html">DaveFayram</a>

               Any critical thinking casts suspicion on this claim. RK made it up. Until he shows us scientific studies backing up his claims of programmers and designers having fundamentally different wiring, it's just bullshit. Mutually exclusive mentalities are a far cry from immutable differences in brain wiring. Mentalities are changeable.

               Some of the best languages I know of are made by programmers. Smalltalk, Ruby, Python, Lisp, Objective-C... all were designed by people who were, in some capacity, a programmer. Other languages that never quite made it were designed by committees.

               You do realize that its difficult to think of even one <em>good</em> computer language that wasn't designed by a programmer, right? Name one. It doesn't even have to be terribly successful, just interesting, powerful and usable. COBOL and Java need not apply. And, "good" doesn't mean "successful" here, it means conceptual purity, along the lines of whatever a designer thinks is good (you get to go wild here!). Heck, I'll throw you a bone. It doesn't have to have been <em>implemented</em>, just show me a whitepaper or description somewhere. -- <a href="DaveFayram.html">DaveFayram</a>

               Way to dodge the hard ones, Richard. <strong>You</strong> have decided it compromises their ability to design, but I've never seen any place where you offer any evidence supporting this claim. "Socrates is a man, therefore all men are Socrates" won't fly here.

               This is not universal. See <a href="DontRepeatYourself.html">DontRepeatYourself</a>. See also <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a>'s musings on <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a>. See also <a href="ThePragmaticProgrammer.html">ThePragmaticProgrammer</a>. For examples of this in action, see the documentation to <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a>, which is designed entirely around removing the repetitive work from <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a> design. See also Apple's Cocoa documentation. Cocoa revolves around trying to remove repetitive work (persistence, preferences, UI, serialization, binding of data to UI objects) from application authoring, freeing the developer to worry about the design and the unique code.

           ideas which everyone knows (eg, array vs list stacks) are valuable to a programmer and worthless to a designer
          <ul>
            <li>
               Is there any evidence to support such a claim?
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Designers might wish to use a higher level of abstraction - rather than concerning themselves with a "list" or a an "array"; they just know they want a LIFO or sequential or associative data structure. Or they may not even care about <em>that</em>, and just know they want a collection.
                </li>
                <li>
                   But sometimes they do care about the nature of it (LIFO, FIFO) for interaction purposes. Therefore, the claim above is false. Trust me when I say the vast majority of programmers don't care about the implementations of their data structures either. Languages are moving people further and further away from such details. See Python and Ruby and Perl for examples of the direction this is moving.

        </li>
        <li>
           the value of a completed implementation is evident to non-programmers, the value of a completed design is <strong>not</strong> evident to non-designers (though this is mostly due to a lack of tools and education which is in turn due to the dominance of programmers over designers)
        </li>
        <li>
           I have yet to meet a productive systems designer who was not capable of being a good programmer.

        What a silly distinction. All good programmers design and if a programmer wants some feedback on design he can ask another programmer. That's like saying you can write a good chess program without ever playing chess, or that chess players would have no useful input on how a chess program should be designed. The context is inextricable. A design that fails to account for the language, database, tools and code methodology is less useful than a programmer's design. Pure designers by definition strip the context of the application's implementation, thereby making their designs inferior.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually Big Blue was programmed by people who barely play chess and without any input from chess players.</em> Wrong. The <a href="DeepBlue.html">DeepBlue</a> project retained several grandmasters to evaluate its play and opening preparation (an <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a>, if you will).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A 'design' that takes into account the language, database, tools and code methodology is a specification. A design is not 'inferior' to a specification anymore than a sketch is inferior to a sculpture, it's a different thing and useful in a completely different way.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Designs which abstract away (non-domain) implementation details are often useful (though in the end, never a substitute for a specification or a working product). "Designs" which abstract away details of the user's problem, OTOH, are utterly useless. Unfortunately, our profession is riddled with examples of skilled programmers attempting to build systems without a good understanding of the problem to be solved, and/or the human factors necessary to produce something which is usable.
