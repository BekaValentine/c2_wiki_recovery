        It never did you harm<br/>
        Your edit slurs my education<br/>
        And whits not to your charm;<br/>
        Our wiki bounds with <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>es<br/>
        And trite and wonting prose<br/>
        Please deal with these excrescences<br/>
        'Fore businessing your nose<br/>
        With my poor form and lacking smarts<br/>
        And bits that show no scintil<br/>

        Your dainty prose with all its chaff belies an ego swollen<br/>
        The same, perchance, that would append your footnote to my colon.<br/>
        You better see you're standing close and safe beside your momma<br/>
        When I commence me trance to put the deles to your comma.<br/>
        The ways to make it stop and go are manifold; and myriad:<br/>
        So why must you insist on ending always with the period?<br/>

        My challenger all meek contends with couplets rhymed and rude<br/>
        Umbrage to entropic prose where form's misunderstood<br/>
        But failing to support this case confuses pride with guileful<br/>
        Antic abstract punctuating misdirected style, full<br/>
        Glamouring the earful eye while turning logics subtle<br/>
        For hearts of beasts that erstwhile fought into a clear rebuttal<br/>
        Ending thus the strife that sets one dog to eat another<br/>
        (Though no dog ever stomached that fell bitch that is your mother)<br/>
        Yet stay our tongue! Beginners need our compliments, not flamage<br/>
        And the better part of valor stays the stroke before its damage<br/>
        Too swiftly ends the parlay. Come young friend and take th'advice<br/>
        Gently to your heart. A stylish slip or phrase not nice<br/>
        Or wording not too smart boots less than threads and butchery<br/>
        Too common round these parts. <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a><br/>
        If you must, but might with banter flip and fey and too familiar<br/>
        Start and leave my fly specs where they lay, now would it kill ya?<br/>

        Then let us settle down to nearly gentler relations<br/>
        As our ancestors would like it, be they canine or what-have-you,<br/>
        And dislodging not thy putrid arthropodic defecations<br/>
        (As I wonder at the cow whose loins were cold enough to calve you<br/>
        In a passion well induced by some iambic pentameter<br/>
        While she crouched in manner pleasing so to suffer much contusion<br/>
        And then anon to plunk it on some chilly double-seater<br/>
        Thus to drop my dear opponent in one glorious extrusion!<br/>
        Now this was not the first time<br/>
        Nor the second but the turd<br/>
        That these bisyllabic udderments<br/>
        Of cow partum were herd.)<br/>
        And lest some reader think that this description lacks decorum<br/>
        I hasten now to warn of such conclusions premature:<br/>
        In my family we despiseth arguments <em>ad feminorem</em><br/>
        Never suffering another such a rudeness to endure.<br/>

      <code>
        These seething imprecations, incorrect and maladroit,<br/>
        Lead the argument "ad feminorem" almost from the start: <br/>
        "Femino", Latin novices, still seated in short pant<br/>
        Will not translate to "feminine" nor otherwise supplant<br/>
        In any conjugation of the fairer constitution<br/>
        "Femina" meaning woman, "femino" means "self pollution".<br/>

        Punctuation being least of all the violence in your verse<br/>
        To refactor, you've become brunt of your own familial curse,<br/>
        Despised by all your tribe, you'll win no friends with your declension<br/>
        For "rem" is single masculine, as you'll stay I've apprehension<br/>
        Until classical intent meets high-class form in future lyric<br/>
        No classy broad would touch this with a many meter stick.<br/>

        Congratulations, learned friend!  You've taken all the piss<br/>
        From out our <em>argumenta</em> [sic] <em>ad matrem hominis.</em><br/>
        And all is much improved since you chose to air your qualm<br/>
        (We realized in afterthought we'd meant "<em>ad feminAM</em>").<br/>
        But when it comes to femmes I think your point is rendered moot<br/>
        By recess of their plumbing, how they do themselves pollute.<br/>
