        Wiki On Pda

        I found myself wishing that I had a PDA (aka <a href="HandHeld.html">HandHeld</a>) for the first time today just so I could jot down some notes (it's probably telling that I didn't wish for a pen and paper). I started thinking about the process of taking notes on a PDA, and thought it would be great to have a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a> available on a PDA. Perhaps it would also be useful to replicate the Wiki to my desktop machine or among PDAs.

           I am running <a href="EmacsWikiMode.html">EmacsWikiMode</a> on my Pocket PC and I am very satisfied with it as <a href="WikiAsPim.html">WikiAsPim</a>.

           This may work if you are willing to plug the parts together (if so, write about it here please): If you can run a CGI-capable http server and Python.org or Perl, then try one of the small Python or Perl wikis. I am using thttpd and Diamond Wiki <a href="http://www.kimbly.com/cgi-bin/diamond">http://www.kimbly.com/cgi-bin/diamond</a> on my Zaurus with acceptable performance, though I have few pages as yet...

           You should have a look a look at the <a href="WikiLikeThing.html">WikiLikeThing</a> page, because maybe one of these suits your needs and some will probably be lean enough to run an a PDA.

        There is a "toy" described somewhere that is integrated with notepad. I'd be interested in collaborating on a real program with synchronization, if several people were seriously interested in making a commercial product. -- <a href="JohnStoshMuczynski.html">JohnStoshMuczynski</a>

        <em>That's all well and good if you've got a </em><a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> machine. (I used to have one, but found I couldn't get used to not having a keyboard.) Does anyone know of such a thing for Psion/EPOC/Symbian? My Series 5mx can run Java apps, so if there's a non-servlet-based Wiki for Java, that might do the trick.<em> -- </em><a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        I'm working on a pocket pc wiki sitting on top of PocketASP (<a href="http://www.modezero.net/pocketasp/overview.htm)from">http://www.modezero.net/pocketasp/overview.htm)from</a> ModeZero. It's a bit of a back burner project so I do bits and pieces when I can. Has a Pocket Access Db for page content and uses ASP for delivery of content and editing of pages.

        Me either. That's why I got an AlphaSmartDana (PalmOS, nice keyboard, <a href="http://alphasmart.com/">http://alphasmart.com/</a> ). Real Soon Now I intend to see if these PalmOS software "work well" with it. (Sure, they'll *run* the same as on any other PDA - tapping with the stylus - but will they also let me use the keyboard, as recommended by <a href="PointerAndKeyboard.html">PointerAndKeyboard</a> ?). -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           have more than 500 pages of information 
        </li>
        <li>
           can use Ward's text formatting rules?
        </li>
        <li>
           have working link to internet (reasonable browser) from within the Wiki?
        </li>
        <li>
           And affordable too?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I am waiting for the above factors to converge before I buy a PDA.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It may be that these operations won't commute. Why not buy a PDA and write the software you want? Then sell it and recoup your investment.</em>
