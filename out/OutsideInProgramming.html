        Outside In Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        Everyone's heard of <a href="BottomUpProgramming.html">BottomUpProgramming</a> and <a href="TopDownProgramming.html">TopDownProgramming</a>, but now I find myself doing what could be called <a href="OutsideInProgramming.html">OutsideInProgramming</a>: starting with a very high level description in well-formed pseudo code, and then starting to build the low level pieces that I need, and incrementally working on both until they meet. It seems to work pretty well!

        Does anyone else <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>?

        Outside-in sounds a little bit like what I described in <a href="SoftwarePuzzleAnalogy.html">SoftwarePuzzleAnalogy</a>. -- <a href="CurtisBartley.html">CurtisBartley</a>
      </p>

        I've seen people <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a> a numbers of times by various names.
        <em>(None of which I can remember right off the top of my head! ;-)</em>
        ...usually described as doing both top-down and bottom-up at the same time - like MeetInTheMiddle.

        I believe everyone who succeeds is doing something pretty much like this. It's just too risky to only take a single perspective. The same pattern also holds for planning. You need a top-down view to bound the overall effort; bottom up estimates to add reality. Then they have to meet somewhere in the middle, or you don't have a plan.

        But I'm curious as to what makes one approach "outside" and another "inside". Is abstract outside and concrete inside? If so, why?

        I just wanted to contribute because I recently noticed this in one of my projects, where I used <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a> to do the top-down (concrete??) and then fully <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ttwo possible solutions to the above follow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          visibility: 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        outside -> abstract/soft<br/>
        inside  -> concrete/hard<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          eggshell:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        outside -> concrete<br/>
        inside  -> abstract<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I first thought of the visibility solution because when you're closer to the implementation, there is less guesswork (ambiguity).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I thought of the eggshell solution; client code sees the outside as concrete, but is interestingly further from the implementation.

        Surely we all do outside-in all the time. You take the big view model and decompose it into sub-models, breaking the problem into digestible chunks.
