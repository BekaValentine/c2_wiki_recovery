      <p>
        An early (mid-80's) bit-mapped animation package for the Macintosh.

      <p>
        <a href="JayFenton.html">JayFenton</a> wrote an animation & music thing for the mac but it didn't fit. He split it into two products. The animation part became the foundation for
        his company, <a href="MacroMind.html">MacroMind</a>, but the music part was cool too.

        Well things have moved on a bit from here. The software referred to above was named Videoworks, if memory serves me correctly. Macromind is the company that created Director, which is a real stalwart of the multimedia industry.

        <a href="MacroMind.html">MacroMind</a> later merged with ParacompInc, to become <a href="MacroMind.html">MacroMind</a>-Paracomp, then with Authorware to become MacromediaInc
