        <em>Why is there no equivalent in other countries; the phase </em><a href="UnBritish.html">UnBritish</a> means nothing!<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because, per that <a href="WebSite.html">WebSite</a>, the USA is full of lame goobers who think their airhead prattle is somehow defiant or unique or rebellious just because it superficially appears to disagree with our government's airhead prattle. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>There's no equivalent because Americans have an OLD democratic process, and there is an underlying current of "If it's law, we as a nation/state/town have made it so."  There is much disagreement but no rebellion - much crime, as well, but only self-interested crime.</strong>

        It should be noted that the meaning of <a href="UnBritish.html">UnBritish</a> is very different from that of <a href="UnAmerican.html">UnAmerican</a>, often having positive connotations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The term comes from the "House Committee on </em><a href="UnAmerican.html">UnAmerican</a> Activities", a bogus <a href="ColdWar.html">ColdWar</a> <a href="WitchHunt.html">WitchHunt</a> that defined the career of SenatorJosephMcCarthy. The committee harassed honest citizens, punished them without trial, and generally did un-American things.<em></em>
