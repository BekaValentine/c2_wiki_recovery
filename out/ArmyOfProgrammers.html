        Army Of Programmers
      </h1>
      <p>
        A large potential labor pool.  One way for management to mitigate personnel-related risks is to make sure that a project isn't dependent on a hard-to-find skillset; in other words, has a desirable <a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a>.  The more programmers there are in the marketplace with a given skillset; the less risky the skillset is.
      </p>
      <p>
        One effect of this is it increases the <a href="BarrierToEntry.html">BarrierToEntry</a> to a new technology.  The new technology isn't acceptable to management until there are an <a href="ArmyOfProgrammers.html">ArmyOfProgrammers</a> who are proficient in its use; many programmers/SW engineers who are in it for the money rather than as a hobby are reluctant to learn a new skill unless there is significant observable demand for that skill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two ways around this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            If the new technology has a MajorCorporateSponsor, said sponsor can spend money to overcome the <a href="BarrierToEntry.html">BarrierToEntry</a>.  A fine example of this is <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, which went from being a research project at Sun (and other places, see the entry on <a href="JamesGosling.html">JamesGosling</a>) to a major component of IT infrastructure in a matter of years.  How was this accomplished?  <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> is decent technology, arguably better at IT stuff than what was in common use at the time (<a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>).  Best language out there?  Probably not.  However, <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a> spent millions and millions of dollars marketing (hyping) Java, touting it as the <a href="CureForCancer.html">CureForCancer</a>, etc.  And it wasn't just a marketing campaign; Sun also spent lots of money on tool development, training, and the like.  It should be noted that the MajorCorporateSponsor must be <em>competent</em>--having <a href="XeroxCorporation.html">XeroxCorporation</a> as a MajorCorporateSponsor, for instance, has long been a death knell for technology (unless it was subsequently "discovered" by Apple or Microsoft.)  
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            New technologies can be adopted without a MajorCorporateSponsor if they a) have a high degree of "geek chic", b) solve a key problem well, and c) can be snuck in the back door. <em>(To be snuck in the back door they have to be free.)</em> <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> and <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a> both achieved mainstream status in more or less this fashion--they were both deployed in inconspicuous applications ("glue code", print servers, etc.) where they proved their mettle.  Many such deployments were kept below management radar for quite a while.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, there is a hole in this way of work. Quantity does not mean quality. And many corporate bosses and HR people can not distinguish between good programmers and bad programmers. ( See the MarketForLemons ). And when there is a lot of programmers,
        there is also higher probability of hiring bad quality programers.
