        <a href="PortlandOregon.html">PortlandOregon</a> has a competition each September to promote commuting by bicycle:  <a href="http://www.bikecommutechallenge.com/">http://www.bikecommutechallenge.com/</a>

        This is especially apropos in 2005 in light of the rising gas prices due to Hurricane Katrina.

        I live in a place that would make that trip about 2 or 3 hours.

        Riding a bike on our roads is taking your life in your hands.

        Now, if I could get my employer to move the work site about 25 miles South, we might have something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and get the city planners to do something like they did in Copenhagen, so that cyclists have their own piece of the roadway, separated by an actual railing.
      </p>

        I rode a bike to work in Copenhagen for years.  When I returned stateside, I was in the best physical shape of my life.

        I once tried to ride my bike to college.
      </p>
      <p>
        That day, I almost got splattered by a bus that stopped in my face to leave people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't left my neighborhood in bike ever since.

        You shouldn't let stuff like that stop you.  The <em>only</em> reason I don't take the bike to work now-a-days is because of a super-tight commute schedule.  If I had the time, the 25 mile trek would be positively <em>delightful</em> to ride by bike.  And, it'd take me little more than an hour to get there (yes, I really do ride that fast).  I miss my bike commute.  :(  --Samuel A. Falvo II

        Oh, that's because you don't know how stupid are people in Guadalajara regarding commuting behavior. Hundreds of people who can only afford a bike get run over every year. And I've seen people here jaywalking under pedestrian bridges. <em>Yes, I said </em>'people jaywalking under pedestrian bridges.<em></em>' -- DaNuke
