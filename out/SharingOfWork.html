        Sharing Of Work
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the things common to success is the <a href="SharingOfWork.html">SharingOfWork</a>. From the gathering of the nets in fishing to the give and take sawing using the two-handled saw to drop large trees, work sharing has been used to good effect. In <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> this is present in the use of <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>. Experience has shown that a SecondSetOfEyes often discovers very quickly the faults and shortcomings of a ProducedArtifact. Particularly useful, the <a href="SharingOfWork.html">SharingOfWork</a> allows the production of artifacts larger, more complete, and composed in a far more complex form, than that possible by a SoloWorker. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be said that with the <a href="SharingOfWork.html">SharingOfWork</a>, Civilization began. When one has proceeded far enough up the NeedsTriangle, one can begin to produce artifacts for community or social use. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also one of the basic tenets of the Wiki, that the page (ProducedArtifact) is improved, extended via Edits, Forward and <a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a>, and by deletion and correction into becoming a UsefulArtifact.
