        Change Log
      </h1>
      <p>
        A log (record) of changes that can be used to restore the original database or content if every change is recorded.
      </p>

        A basic relational log might look something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        Table: changeLog<br/>
        ----------------<br/>
        tableName<br/>
        columnName<br/>
        Key<br/>
        operation  (C=change, D=delete)<br/>
        newValue<br/>
        sequence   (sequence applied in case time is the same)<br/>
        dateTimeOfChange   (ugly name, suggestions? "whenChanged"?)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that we don't need an Add operation because upon restoration Add is assumed if the key is not already there. Also note that "columnName" would be blank if we are doing a delete. Some may suggest using a different table for logging deletes, but that is another <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> about how to normalize.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flexibility of what "newValue" can hold greatly depends upon vendor implementation related to the field types available and the availability of "generic" types. Most <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> RDBMS are static-typed unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this assumes we know the existing schema. Logging schema changes is another issue (unless schemas are also stored in tables, which many DB's do.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect that for efficiency purposes, a highly proprietary representation or access protocol will most likely be used in practice.

        In software, a <a href="ChangeLog.html">ChangeLog</a> records what has changed between versions of a program.  The converse of the <a href="ToDo.html">ToDo</a> list.
