        I work in user interface and other software development.  I think Wiki is a cool idea, very spare.

        I've put a couple of Wiki's up, based on rcswiki.  One is at <a href="http://graflex.org/wiki">http://graflex.org/wiki</a> and the other at <a href="http://curta.org/wiki">http://curta.org/wiki</a>

        Since there can't be too many <a href="LeighKlotz.html">LeighKlotz</a>'s, I presume this is the one I know.
        (I just looked at your url, and there can't be too many <a href="LeighKlotz.html">LeighKlotz</a>'s who look
        like you!)

        Hi Matt.  There are three "Leigh Klotz's" in my family (one produced by marriage) and at least one unrelated "Lee" I know of.  But I'm the one you know.
