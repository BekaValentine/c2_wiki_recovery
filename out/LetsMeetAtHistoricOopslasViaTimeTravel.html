        With OOPSLA <em>(2001)</em> just around the corner it is time again to ask who is going to be there and is it worth trying to get together some evening?

        The second OOPSLA BOF has now come and gone. This year's BOF night (Wednesday) was really squeazed by the heavily attended <a href="ShowTrialOfTheGangOfFour.html">ShowTrialOfTheGangOfFour</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our BOF had a couple of dozen attendees, most of whom were happy to talk about techniques of launching wiki sites. Most agreed that a wiki needs about two months of careful attention before they take hold. During this time a founder would be wise to find something to put up on a new wiki site every day. The best sources are personal email, project documents or web searches. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A second subject of interest was addressing the proliferation of formatting rules. No answer emerged.

        I hosted a <em>birds-of-a-feather</em> sesson devoted to wiki at OOPSLA in Vancouver and would like to do it again this year in Denver. This is one time wiki authors can meet and shared ideas without having to type or spell. Last time we talked about why wiki works for us, what it could do better, and what other versions are available. The talk so inspired one group from Caltech (under the umbrella of the Distributed Coalition) that they wrote their own just two days later. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        A few hundred authors have been collaborating on wiki web pages about patterns and related programming ideas. A few dozen more have been implementing new versions of wiki. This session will give all these authors a chance to meet in person.
