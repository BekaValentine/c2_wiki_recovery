        Two Player Stand Off

      <p>
        A <strong>two-player stand-off" is a term in </strong><a href="GameTheory.html">GameTheory</a> that occurs in a multi-agent model where there is competition for resources in a fixed environment.  Eventually an agent learns a strategy and starts co-opting other players, but since the simulation happens simultaneously across all agents, eventually another agent forms a similarly powerful strategy and ends up making an <a href="EndGame.html">EndGame</a> where neither can defeat the other.
