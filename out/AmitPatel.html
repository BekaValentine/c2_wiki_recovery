        I'm mostly a Wiki lurker. I'm interested in lots of things, including programming languages, emergent systems, computer game design, operating systems, and lemurs. I tend to prefer C++ and Python for my programming. I'm playing with Java but so far I haven't taken a liking to it. I think the main problem is that I don't think everything is an object, so languages that force that style on me I find annoying.

        For those who don't know, Amit's homepage is a wonderful collection of programming information, especially the ever-cited pathfinding archive. If you're traversing his site, somewhere on his homepage there are <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> postings on <a href="news:comp.ai.games">news:comp.ai.games</a> from when I was in high school (and I disavow any knowledge of them). The 'Net is a small place. Welcome to the Wiki, Amit! -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
