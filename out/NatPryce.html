        I'm using this as my home page on the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. If you want to leave me a message, append it to the the bottom of this page and I should notice it pretty soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did a lot of work in distributed systems, middleware, components and frameworks. Check out my old home-page at Imperial <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~np2">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~np2</a> for more info about my research in those areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on my work on distributed component-based systems and frameworks, I contributed to the <a href="ComponentDesignPatterns.html">ComponentDesignPatterns</a>. I have concentrated on the lower-levels of the pattern language, focusing on what distinguishes a component, how components are defined and how they interact. The patterns I have documented include <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a>, <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a>, <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> and <a href="ComponentGlue.html">ComponentGlue</a>. Feel free to add comments; feedback is very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Related to the <a href="ComponentDesignPatterns.html">ComponentDesignPatterns</a>, I collected patterns of  software systems that use scripting (e.g. <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>) or are written in scripting languages. They are available at <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~np2/patterns/scripting.">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~np2/patterns/scripting.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I did quite a bit of Java programming and contributed to the collection of <a href="JavaIdioms.html">JavaIdioms</a> and to the discussion on <a href="ExceptionPatterns.html">ExceptionPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of the Java idoms and ideas relating to the design and implementation of component-based frameworks are used in a framework I wrote called <a href="SceneBeans.html">SceneBeans</a>. Documentation and code are on-line at <a href="http://www-dse.doc.ic.ac.uk/Software/SceneBeans/.">http://www-dse.doc.ic.ac.uk/Software/SceneBeans/.</a>

        I am interested in <a href="TestDrivenProgramming.html">TestDrivenProgramming</a>. I wrote the first version of the dynamic <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s library for Java that became jMock (<a href="http://www.jmock.org),">http://www.jmock.org),</a> now maintained by <a href="OliBye.html">OliBye</a>.  JMock begat <a href="HamCrest.html">HamCrest</a>, which is now used by <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a>.  I have also written <a href="WindowLicker.html">WindowLicker</a>, for test-driving GUI code and TeamPiazza (<a href="http://team-piazza.googlecode.com),">http://team-piazza.googlecode.com),</a> a build monitor plug-in for the TeamCity <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> server.

        I am interested in <a href="PostModernProgramming.html">PostModernProgramming</a> (see <a href="http://www.postmodernprogramming.org)">http://www.postmodernprogramming.org)</a> and ran a ScrapheapChallengeWorkshop at OOPSLA'05, PoMoPro 2006 and SPA 2007 that investigated this topic.

        I am a regular at the <a href="ExtremeTuesdayClub.html">ExtremeTuesdayClub</a> and have been involved in the London XpDay since the first conference in 2000.  I was programme chair in 2004 and 2005, and poster chair in 2006.

        I was honoured to receive the Gordon Pask award from the Agile Alliance in 2006.

        Nat - Thanks for your post on <a href="TestDataBuilder.html">TestDataBuilder</a>s.  How do you solve the problem of testing DAOs with persistent data using data builders?  Thanks.  I can be reached via the comment form on www.systemmobile.com.  
      </p>
      <p>
        My colleague James Richardson has written a good article explaining how we test persistence code with JUnit and <a href="TestDataBuilder.html">TestDataBuilder</a>s: <a href="http://www.time4tea.net/wiki/display/MAIN/Testing+Persistent+Objects+Without+Spring">http://www.time4tea.net/wiki/display/MAIN/Testing+Persistent+Objects+Without+Spring</a>
