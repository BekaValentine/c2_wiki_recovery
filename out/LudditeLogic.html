      <p>
        Luddite Logic is the logic as if you were using the simplest technology that is still capable of realizing the <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>.  See <a href="LudditeOfficeAutomation.html">LudditeOfficeAutomation</a>.

        <em>Luddite Logic is also the logic used by those who refuse to change, no matter what facts are presented to them.</em>

        I don't think it is that simple. Sometimes one spends years perfecting a given technology, and starting over will probably slow them down. Plus, many new things are simply fads rather than truely superior. See <a href="MindOverhaulEconomics.html">MindOverhaulEconomics</a>.

        True, it's a matter of balance. This has been discussed in <a href="OldCodeRusts.html">OldCodeRusts</a> and RefactorLegacyCode. One has to work on the old project, while keeping an eye on new technologies. Development in isolation is often a bad idea - See <a href="XanaduProject.html">XanaduProject</a>.
