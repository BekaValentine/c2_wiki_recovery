        A Question I have been asked about <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        For those that have read Thinking Forth, I am sometimes asked how I now feel about object-oriented programming. I must confess that I am now embarrassed by my take on that subject, especially since the principles it enables -- including encapsulation -- were the very attributes I was espousing for good programming practice. But at the time (1984), I hadn't seen Java or even C++. In the early 90's I had the opportunity to develop some applications using a (somewhat) object-oriented Forth, and I found it extremely powerful.
