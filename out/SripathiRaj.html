        Hi everyone,
      </p>
      <p>
        I am Sripathi Guruprasannaraj, a Masters student in the State University of New York at Buffalo. I recently came to know about Wiki when I was at the Yet Another Perl Conference YAPC. The conference was a great experience getting to know Perl hackers. I am a Perl programmer myself using Perl for Document Processing and Web Development. The wiki has been an amusing (read weird) concept and probably very useful. I believe its a kind of community and its helping promote sharing of information. For a person who likes to write a lot and help out other people while gaining knowledge myself, the wiki has kept me engaged already.

        My area of specialization is InformationRetrieval and <a href="NaturalLanguageProcessing.html">NaturalLanguageProcessing</a>. My other love is 
        <a href="ProgrammingLanguages.html">ProgrammingLanguages</a>. I started out learning Visual Basic but some Godsent guy told me to learn C. So I learnt C 
        when I was in high school and moved on to C++ though I kinda preferred C. When I was in college, we had Fortran, 
        Pascal, COBOL. I taught myself these languages an year before they were to be taught and I was always ahead of the 
        pack which made me very disinterested in class. And then Java came along though I dint take it up right away. I 
        had an accident on my bike and was bed-ridden for like two weeks. I got really bored and when I came back from the 
        hospital, I was looking for something to read which was when I noticed my Java Complete Reference book. I realised 
        that I hadnt read it after I bought it and decided that this was the time to start studying Java. And then I was 
        hooked on to it for like 2 years. Meanwhile my interests wavered from Assembly Language to ASP. 
      </p>

        Perl is a very powerful language that I feel anyone interested in programming should learn. I have done some 
        really good projects with it and I feel that in whatever I have done, I have used probably 0.5% of Perl's power. 
        I currently teach Java to Non-Majors at the University at Buffalo and its been a pretty good experience so far. I 
        have taken up this assignment for the summer and am looking for a job as Perl/Java Developer. I am into J2EE now 
        and am planning to take the Sun Certification exams. In an aim to further my database skills, I am also planning 
        to write the Oracle certification exam. If you have any tips for me on these exams, leave them here or mail them 
        to me at sg47@cse.buffalo.edu.

        It was nice to get started here and I'll be coming back tomorrow to post about a big project I am planning to 
        take up. I'll need you guys' help on that.
