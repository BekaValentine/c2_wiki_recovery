        Parnas Lectures On Sofware Engineering
      </h1>
      <p>
        A set of interested lectures by <a href="DavidParnas.html">DavidParnas</a> on the subject of <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bullet points are available at: <a href="http://www.sqrl.ul.ie/ParnasLectures.html">http://www.sqrl.ul.ie/ParnasLectures.html</a> . Very insightful.

        Since I can subscribe to mostly every point he's making, but I think agile and Xp-ers may have diverging points I invite others to provide their own comments if any. Among issues that we discussed on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> there are <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> as engineering discipline and its relation to CS, professional licensing, SoftwareDocumentation, SoftwareInspections, design methodology, and a few others.
