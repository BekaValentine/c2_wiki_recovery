        Bnf To Dot
      </h1>
      <p>
        A tool for converting yacc's Backus-Naur rules to <a href="GraphViz.html">GraphViz</a> DOT files. Useful for visualization of <a href="BackusNaurForm.html">BackusNaurForm</a> dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this tool really exist, or is it just a theoretical program?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I wrote my own - about 50 lines of AWK making </em>'lots<em>' of assumptions about the formatting. It can't be hard.</em>

        <em>Not a real good example, but here's most of the ANSI C declaration grammar:</em> <img src="http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/images/decl.png" />

        Sweet. Haha! That's what I'm using as the test data - ANSI-C.y, although I didn't group the Flex tokens - instead making them a different color and shape. Your graphs looks cleaner though. . .

        <em>I did touch the DOT file by hand in this case. What I did is easy to automate but I didn't bother. It had already served its purpose.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't suppose I could request to see your .DOT file?

        I'm working on one now in C++, and I'll probably release it once done. I'm not really parsing the BNF as BNF, more just linking the keywords. . .
