      <p>
        TenDRA is a free, <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> C/C++ compiler. It was originally developed by the UK's DefenceEvaluationAndResearchAgency, and is still mostly under Crown copyright, but has been released as an independent <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> project under the BSD license.

        TenDRA was developed as a tool for working with the ArchitectureNeutralDistributionFormat, but is a useful compiler in its own right. It can handle C and C++, with STL support in the works. It can emit native code for x86, Alpha, SPARC, HP-PA, MIPS, Power (but not PowerPC) and 68k instruction sets. The core of the compiler is very clean and sophisticated, but as a working tool, it's not as mature as the <a href="GnuCee.html">GnuCee</a> compiler or a commercial compiler.

        TenDRA is somewhat popular in the BSD world, where some people are unhappy about depending on the GNU project's C compiler.
