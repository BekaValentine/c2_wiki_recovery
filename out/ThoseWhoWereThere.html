        <em>Proposed for deletion, but perhaps could be used as a </em><a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a> for someone to ask for witness testimony from <a href="ThoseWhoWereThere.html">ThoseWhoWereThere</a> which would otherwise be lost. A way to collect a <a href="FamilyHistoryOfWiki.html">FamilyHistoryOfWiki</a>. Alternatively it can flag pages which already contain personal testimony about wiki history.<em> -- </em><a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
