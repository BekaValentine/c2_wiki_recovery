        Microsoft Services For Unix
      </h1>
      <p>
        Microsoft has cancelled this experimental product as of Sept 1 2005, see e.g. <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1855274,00.asp">http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1855274,00.asp</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Microsoft has decided against enhancing its Services for Unix (SFU) product and will not release any new versions of it going forward, according to company officials.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MicrosoftServicesForUnix.html">MicrosoftServicesForUnix</a> (SFU) is a free and highly linux compatible toolkit that is supposedly high performance as well. see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/sfu/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/sfu/default.asp</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        There has been some <a href="MicrosoftExtensions.html">MicrosoftExtensions</a> applied, including native support for Active Directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally designed for easing migration hurdles from Risc based Unix systems to MS environments, in the v3.5 release of Feb2004 it has matured to be able to run the bulk of Linux applications. <em>This release also removed the support for the </em><a href="WindowsNt.html">WindowsNt</a> os.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is an x86 based implementation like Linux (tested with <a href="RedHatLinux.html">RedHatLinux</a> V8) and is "free" of charge. It will require a minimum <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> (Pro edition) to host it. It is, however, not <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software, but is said to be compatible with a few common Unix distributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This software uses Interix technology from Interop Systems and implements a full application execution subsystem and allows the execution of Unix programs in native mode. A MS document listed below compared this to <a href="CygWin.html">CygWin</a> which uses emulation to service requests.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the SFU subsystem is tacked on to the <a href="WindowsOperatingSystems.html">WindowsOperatingSystems</a> as a process, with its own subprocesses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It was said Unix applications can be packaged into <a href="ComComponent.html">ComComponent</a>s and interoperate with <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> applications through this product.
      </p>
      <p>
        The product won a systems integration award in 2003 for an earlier version. See <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/news/1138313">http://www.vnunet.com/news/1138313</a>
      </p>

        <em>(moved from </em><a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a>)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I suggested that it "was" a successful product before MS purchased it. And it got "industry award".
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, in Sep05, I read that after attending PDC, a few sources interpret that this particular product is going to be "restructured" - some goes into the core <a href="WindowsServerTwoThousandThree.html">WindowsServerTwoThousandThree</a> R2 (and even W2003SP1 users will need a paid upgrade), and some becomes components that can be downloaded. See more at <a href="WindowsServerTwoThousandThree.html">WindowsServerTwoThousandThree</a> <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> if it has not yet been defaced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now my opinion. I think this reads to me that this product is "really successful". It would explain to me why Microsoft want to "restructure" it this way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, on 21Sep05, I checked that this SFU is still downloadable from MS site at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/sfu/downloads/default.mspx.">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/sfu/downloads/default.mspx.</a> But may not be for long, given fast developing events.

        <strong>Early experiences</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hefty 217MB download. Not sure whether there is a proper uninstall that comes with it
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Hearsay information</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           comes with Korn and C shells, but a download for Bash shell is available
        </li>
        <li>
           has Perl but no <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           no root user and FIFO speed is 10 times slower than Linux

        Hmm.. how does this compare to <a href="CoLinux.html">CoLinux</a>? 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           have you used <a href="CygWin.html">CygWin</a> or any linux in windows yourself? I searched for links to the <a href="CoLinux.html">CoLinux</a> and not much found. I would therefore tend to think you would use <a href="CoLinux.html">CoLinux</a> if you want to help the development of that product, and avoid it if you want to use the product yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="CoLinux.html">CoLinux</a> works quite well but lacks an easy reliable way to transport files quickly. Samba works fine, but is a bit slow.<em></em>
