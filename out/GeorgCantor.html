        Georg Cantor
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="GeorgCantor.html">GeorgCantor</a> was one of the most stupefyingly original thinkers in all of mathematical history. He placed the study of the various degrees of infinity on a firm set theoretical basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        He proved some amazing theorems, such as that the set of transcendental numbers is uncountable, whereas the set of algebraic numbers is countable. He did this at a time when the only examples of transcendental numbers were <em>pi</em>, <em>e</em>, and numbers based on them (2<em>pi</em>, <em>e</em>+2, etc). See <a href="CantorsProof.html">CantorsProof</a> for another of his celebrated results.
      </p>
      <p>
        His theories were not easily accepted, and he suffered numerous bouts of extreme depression, finally dying in an asylum.
