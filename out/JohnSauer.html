        John currently works for Tellabs doing Advanced Technology in voice and data networking.  Prior to that he worked for Motorola on mobile systems and in voice recognition.  He knew <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> at Bell Labs.  His first memory of patterns was talking to Cope for a few minutes about attaching a radioactive source to a software change request and recording the pattern as it moved through the people doing the work.
