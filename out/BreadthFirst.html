        Breadth First
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="BreadthFirst.html">BreadthFirst</a> traversal of this tree:
      </p>
      <code>
        A<br/>
        B     C<br/>
        D E   F G<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        visits the nodes in this order: A B C D E F G
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="DepthFirst.html">DepthFirst</a> for another common way to traverse trees.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A breadth first traversal usually employs a queue of known but not yet visited nodes. 
      </p>
      <code>
        void visit (Queue q) {<br/>
        q.add(left);<br/>
        q.add(right);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Useful work can be done anywhere in the method with little effect on the traversal. Conditional logic is avoided by making empty trees be <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a>s that implement visit() but do nothing. A non-recursive loop drives this traversal by seeding the queue with the root and looping until the queue is exhausted.
      </p>
      <code>
        Queue q = new Queue (root);<br/>
        while (!q.empty()) {<br/>
        q.remove().visit(q);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The queue can grow to be quite large (as large as the "next" level
        of the tree). If this isn't acceptable, you can fake <a href="BreadthFirst.html">BreadthFirst</a>
        search with IterativeDeepening: search (<a href="DepthFirst.html">DepthFirst</a>) to depth 1,
        then to depth 2, then to depth 3, and so on. At each stage,
        you can ignore all but the maximum-depth nodes if you like.
        This takes more time and less space; it's more attractive
        for trees with a higher branching factor.
