        Hard To Write
      </h1>
      <p>
        If it was <a href="HardToWrite.html">HardToWrite</a>, it's supposed to be hard to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        So throw it out and find an easier way to do it. <a href="HardToWrite.html">HardToWrite</a> means <a href="TooComplex.html">TooComplex</a>, which means bad.

        Case in point - I spent all of yesterday working on an essay. 7AM to 11PM. As I went to bed I thought - that was really hard. It really didn't flow. It's probably not much good, is it?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the morning I started again, from scratch. Didn't even look at the old one. Had a fresh look at some how to write essay pamphlets and started again. Much much better this time.

        There is a quote saying that writing in a simple and clear explanation is much harder, which fully contradicts the proposal: the harder it is to write, the more readable.
        I think that part of the problem is the "lucidus ordo" effect: if one masters the subject, it is easier to write about it; conversaly, if it one has troubles to write about a topic, *maybe* it is because one doesn't master the subject.
        I also think it is one reason why <a href="DocumentsFirstCodeLater.html">DocumentsFirstCodeLater</a> is useful.
