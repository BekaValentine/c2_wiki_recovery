        Fun programmer, answerer of questions, etc. Life, the universe, everything, and the number 42.
        Having fun in real time. I have a home page... <a href="http://www.gwy.org">http://www.gwy.org</a> ...

        If I had a <a href="WikiWish.html">WikiWish</a>

        for <a href="MathQuizOne.html">MathQuizOne</a>, I know the following:

      <p>
        Q3/Task2 is accomplishable. Almost too easy, once you play with it. I hope I'm not going to be slammed by vk for hinting about it, but at least you didn't see it on the main page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If that's too easy, doubtless you'll enjoy the rest of quiz 1, 2, 3...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think Q3/Task1 is accomplishable. If I had a zero, it would be accomplishable multifold. 
        I don't know enough about Q3/T3 to make a judgment. Based upon the graph, the short answer is almost probably yes, though I cannot prove it. Can you help me?

        <em>What happened to "too easy"? :-) The person to ask for clarifications would be the quiz author, </em><a href="VickiKerr.html">VickiKerr</a>. She decides on a question-by-question basis whether answering would be simply clarifying versus giving it away.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know how to respond to that statement. I didn't think I was asking for clarification more than someone who would like to collaborate on an answer. "Too easy" was definitely in response to Task 2 of question 3, but not for the whole of Question3 -- <a href="GeraldYoung.html">GeraldYoung</a>

        <em>I was just kidding around, it didn't mean anything. That's why smiley-faces were invented, after all. Anyway the key thing is to ask </em><a href="VickiKerr.html">VickiKerr</a> -- you can be sure she can answer your questions accurately.<em></em>

        Correct answers seem quite easy - once you've discovered them! I'll allow you a further week from today (June 30). -- vk

        uh. I was just thinking about the period of Task 3... --gy

        Gerald Ref <a href="MathQuizOne.html">MathQuizOne</a> I cannot trade notes. I submitted formally and was told where I'd made an error in one of them sorry. They aren't hard if you are extremely careful though
