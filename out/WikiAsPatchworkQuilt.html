        Wiki As Patchwork Quilt
      </h1>
      <p>
        The technology of the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> allows people to make changes to some text, the same way a programmer patches program source code - a glance at the <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> for a page will show this in action.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that it isn't the technology that makes <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> special, it's the loving care that the <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a> and his <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s put into the patching.  Most of the <a href="ReallyValuablePages.html">ReallyValuablePages</a> weren't woven in one pass, they are patchwork quilts so fine that you can't see the seams between the patches.  The edges meet neatly, and there is just enough thickness covering the whole area.  Some people call this <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>, but it isn't always like that.
