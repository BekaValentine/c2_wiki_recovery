        I am a computer programmer from Florida who has just rediscovered the world of interactive fiction. I'm trying my hand at creating a beginner's guide to Inform. Since I'm learning the language, too, I figure it'll give me a good beginner's perspective on things.
        I'm also a stickler (read: anal retentive) for spelling and grammar, so I spruced up the main page a bit. My Inform guide will be posted on the Web at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/8200/informguide.htm">http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/8200/informguide.htm</a>
        You may e-mail me at <a href="mailto:pawprint@geocities.com">mailto:pawprint@geocities.com</a> or reach me in the newsgroup <a href="news:rec.arts.int-fiction.">news:rec.arts.int-fiction.</a>

        Well, don't forget we're here due to the good graces of the Patterns people--this area was originally set up at InteractiveFictionPatterns to explore the idea of patterns from an <a href="InteractiveFiction.html">InteractiveFiction</a> perspective.  I made the InteractiveFictionInformTips page because, although not truly a pattern per se, it has a lot of the same philosophy behind it--many people converging on a problem from all sides, trying to make sense of it.  --<a href="LucianSmith.html">LucianSmith</a>
