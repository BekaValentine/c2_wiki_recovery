        Could this be a solution for <a href="LotteryNumber.html">LotteryNumber</a>?
        Describe conditions and terms for <a href="LotteryProof.html">LotteryProof</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring in intellectual challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        And immediate feedback from users, maybe (smiles).
      </p>
      <p>
        The conviction of working on something that is making a difference.

        How about AppreciationOfIndividualAccomplishments (see under <a href="TeamsDontThink.html">TeamsDontThink</a>).

        For me, a project is <a href="LotteryProof.html">LotteryProof</a> (that is, I won't leave if I can help it) if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I enjoy my co-workers' company: they get my jokes, we enjoy talking to one another.  Doesn't mean we have to be close friends.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I perceive some beauty in the project.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I find the work intellectually stimulating.  Usually, this means we're doing something I haven't done before; ideally, we're doing something nobody has done before.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The team is making progress; I believe that we will ship a product near some known date.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The organization for which we are working is stable.  I am not worrying about whether the project will be cancelled, the company will go bankrupt, or half the team will be hired away.
        </li>
      </ul>
