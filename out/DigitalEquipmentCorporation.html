        You would have marketed it that way, but just try ordering it!

        A sad but true [<a href="StrangeCustomerService.html">StrangeCustomerService</a>] story:
      </p>
      <p>
        Many winters ago, my colleague and I call from a customer site where we are trying to install <a href="DecMessageQueue.html">DecMessageQueue</a>, and we can't get it off the ground. Some inane configuration issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we call the support number listed on the box.
      </p>
      <p>
        The support guy asks for the serial number on our DEC server.
      </p>
      <p>
        We try to explain, many, many times, that we have software, not hardware, compiled for OS/2, running on generic hardware; and it has a perfectly legitimate serial number on it. The support guy refused to listen to this real DEC serial number.
      </p>
      <p>
        What a sick joke! Asking for a hardware serial number when we need support for our software. I'm certain that dweeb, every time he bounced someone like that, felt a warm glow thinking he was saving his company from theft of tech support. And he did this to us right in front of our customers. What a bunch of [<em>exemplarily incompetent business practices</em>]! --PCP
