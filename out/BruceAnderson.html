        Bruce Anderson
      </h1>
      <p>
        Bruce was a professor of computer science at University of Essex where he investigated principles of architecture and software design. He has bicycled around the world, climbed the tallest trees in America, and meditated to the
        fifth level of enlightenment. He asks very good questions, is a kind leader, and is a friend to ducks everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he worked as a Senior Managing Consultant in IBM Global Services (techie branch), where he shared, applied and developed his ideas. [ And, of course, worked in objects > components > services ]
      </p>
      <p>
        Now he is retired, doing almost no IT, and keeping busy without being paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        He figures prominently in the <a href="HistoryOfPatterns.html">HistoryOfPatterns</a>.

        Seeker, lighthouse on the way,<br/>
        court jester rising above the company<br/>
        on not only wit and cleverness but<br/>
        lifted by the ageless wisdom<br/>
        that weighs the heart of all jesters<br/>
        reminding all he loves<br/>
        of the folly of unbroken gravity.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        He co-invented <a href="CardSwap.html">CardSwap</a>, doesn't like <a href="GettingUpToSpeed.html">GettingUpToSpeed</a>, perhaps sees <a href="GamesAsPatterns.html">GamesAsPatterns</a>, thinks about <a href="PatternsAndHandbooks.html">PatternsAndHandbooks</a>, and believes that <a href="AbstractModelsAnswerQuestions.html">AbstractModelsAnswerQuestions</a>.
