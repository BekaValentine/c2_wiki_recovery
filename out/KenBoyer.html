      </h1>
      <p>
        Ken has worked on the development of a next-generation cardiac-assist system and documentation of software development processes for medical software for over ten years. Before that, he worked in the factory automation field for six years where he watched many things go "boom" because of poorly-written and horribly-maintained software. And even before that, while a computer science "student" at Penn State, he worked summers at a space and defense subcontractor (yes, he worked on the testing of a small part of the "Star Wars" missile defense system, but he's sworn to perpetual secrecy.)
