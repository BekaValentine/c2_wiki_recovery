        Ode To Joy
      </h1>
      <code>
        Joy, thou glorious spark of heaven,<br/>
        Daughter of Elysium,<br/>
        We approach fire-drunk,<br/>
        Heavenly One, your shrine.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Your magic reunites<br/>
        What strict customs would divide;<br/>
        All people become brothers,<br/>
        Where your gentle wing alights.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Be embraced, you millions!<br/>
        This kiss for the whole world!<br/>
        E'en round the ceiling stars<br/>
        Do our loving brothers dwell.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Will you bow down, you millions?<br/>
        Will you sense and make the world?<br/>
        God dwells beyond the star-canopy!<br/>
        And beneath the stars as well.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Whoever wins in the great attempt<br/>
        To be a friend of a friend,<br/>
        Whoever has won a loving partner,<br/>
        Let him add his jubilation!<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Yes, who can call even one soul<br/>
        His own on the earth's globe!<br/>
        Who never has, let him steal,<br/>
        Weeping, away from our tide.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        All creatures drink joy<br/>
        At the breasts of nature;<br/>
        All the good, all the evil<br/>
        Follow her roses' trail.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Kisses gave she us, and wine,<br/>
        A friend, proven unto death;<br/>
        Pleasure was to the worm granted,<br/>
        As to the cherub before God.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Glad, as the suns fly<br/>
        Through glorious space,<br/>
        Run, our brothers, your race,<br/>
        Joyful, as to victory.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Be embraced, you millions!<br/>
        This kiss for the whole world!<br/>
        Below as beyond the star-canopy<br/>
        Do our loving Brothers dwell.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Will you lay down, you millions?<br/>
        Or will you sense and make the world?<br/>
        Seek Him beyond the star-canopy!<br/>
        Beneath the stars He also dwells.<br/>
      </code>
