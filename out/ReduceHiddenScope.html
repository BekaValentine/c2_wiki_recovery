        To go as fast as possible now, we must do as little as possible now.  To go as fast as possible later, we must <a href="PrepareTheWay.html">PrepareTheWay</a> now.  How do we balance these needs?
      </p>
      <p>
        Look for parts of your process that aren't paying their way.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Have you put off refactoring some classes and now you're paying the price in editing the same code in multiple places?
        </li>
        <li>
           Are you writing documents that aren't being read, and that may never be?
        </li>
        <li>
           Are you spending hours in Visio drawing pictures that no one understands?
        </li>
        <li>
           Do you have huge framed comments at the beginning of every method?
        </li>
        <li>
           Are there parts of the system that are so confusing that no one can find their way through them without comprehensive comments?
        </li>
        <li>
           Every time you release the code, are you spending more and more time fixing bugs found by the customers in the running system?
        </li>
        <li>
           Is system integration day a living hell?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These may be the signs that you are doing <strong>too much</strong> of one thing, in favor of <strong>too little</strong> of another.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, amid it all, you aren't adding functionality fast enough, consider whether perhaps you are doing too many other things that are getting in the way of the code:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Refactoring messy classes rather than adding cruft to them can help you go faster.
        </li>
        <li>
           Time spent writing and drawing useless materials can be spent coding or testing.
        </li>
        <li>
           Reduction of comments can help focus on code quality.
        </li>
        <li>
           Treating the need for comments as an even greater indication of the need for refactoring can improve the system and understandability at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
           More comprehensive <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s can help you go faster, by providing faster feedback on how well things are working.
        </li>
        <li>
           Keeping the system integrated all the time can be much less effort than integrating at wide intervals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And one more: are you writing classes and methods in expectation of future use?  Consider whether you would be getting more done by focusing on what you <em>do</em> need, not what you <em>will</em> or <em>may</em> need. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        To address the "Integration is Hell" problem, on my current project (see the <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> page), we've taken the high road: Once a  week, every week, on Monday morning we:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           run all regression tests (using a testing tool)
        </li>
        <li>
           package a run-time image
        </li>
        <li>
           build a version of the config map
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The time spent up-front on these tasks has more than paid for itself as we approach our deliverable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we always have a functioning build that can be packaged at a moments notice (for a surprise demo, for example) that is at most one week old. -- <a href="AnthonyLander.html">AnthonyLander</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Anthony - that's a solid approach.  Also see </em><a href="FrequentReleases.html">FrequentReleases</a> for how the C3 project (developed in <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> and production in <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>) addresses this same issue.  In a nutshell: we make our current config functional all the time!  -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But only from a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> perspective, not from a system test perspective. We have sanity tested builds each night.

        It just dawned on me that <a href="TooMuchToDo.html">TooMuchToDo</a> is really addressed by three strategies, one of which I haven't seen discussed here :
