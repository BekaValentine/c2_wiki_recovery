        Is Java dead?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Certainly, in the </em><a href="YogiBerra.html">YogiBerra</a> sense: "Nobody goes there anymore -- it's too crowded."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No, more in the Keynes sense: In the long run, all languages are dead.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, not yet, but <a href="DotNetWillKillJava.html">DotNetWillKillJava</a> <em>(don't hold your breath :)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Java already has too much market penetration on the in-house server side for it to die any time soon.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You could have said the same thing about <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> five years ago. <em>Yes, and C's not dead either.  (By the way, I'll assume "five years ago" is closer to "ten years ago" now (when Java emerged circa 1996?).  Besides, I'll contend that Java's current market share in that niche is stronger than C's was.</em> -- Since it took a while for Java to go from being "that applets language" to a server-side mainstay, the five-years figure seems defensible.

        In the following discussion, resist the temptation to look at Java as just a language; remember that it's part of a system: language, VM, and class libraries.  Think how inane it would be to discuss the popularity of elisp without taking into account the rest of its system: Emacs.

        Who cares about <em>apps</em> written in Java?  J2EE runs scores of enterprise level web applications.  Servlets redefined the way web apps work.  Goodbye crappy CGI with your 'one-process-per-call' overhead.  Hello easy multithreaded server-side apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java on the client side can be difficult.  We know this.  Unless implemented carefully, it can be too slow.  Often there are things to use on the client side that fit our needs better. Java does not target "packaged" mass-distributed applications, but custom software for Fortune-500-like companies. (Whether it is actually best at that is another story.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But look around you: The whole industry is going thin-client.  Browsers are becoming the ubiquitous 'client', and web services and web apps are the new 'software'.  J2EE has lead the way.  It won't always be at the forefront, but it has been a major factor in the speed with which the web has become a viable platform for applications.

        I've just now (summer 2002) decided to declare that <a href="JavaIsDead.html">JavaIsDead</a> because:

      <p>
        I argue that <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a> was the last chance for the promise of Java to be realized. Now that <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a> is dead, I argue that:

        <li>
           Problems that can be solved using Java development tools can be solved better using C++, or even <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>.

        <dd>And for my money, VAJ is a <strong>terrible</strong> development environment.  Want to use your own editor?  <em>you're screwed</em>.

I could have written some kind of novel in the amount of time VAJ has taken from my life screwing things up, crashing, rebuilding workspaces, and just generally pissing me off that IBM refuses to allow any use of 3rd party tools in their precious <em>JDE</em> (jail development environment).	- richard kilgore</dd>

           vim + ctags ftw!  I currently use IntelliJ IDEA at work.  <strong>HORRIBLE!!!!!</strong>  Eclipse is way better, but let's face it, the working set of Java is <em>immense</em>.  IDEA, in particular, grows about 100MB per day if you leave it running.  Left running for 3 days, and Java goes so ape-#### that it requires a workstation <em>reboot</em> to recover from.  For my project, closing and reloading IDEA is a very costly operation -- with the number of files I have in my project, it takes about 30 minutes to an hour for IDEA to open.  vim and ctags, however, takes all of a small handful of megabytes, which is easily swapped out if needed.  It launches and stops instantly.  And, ctags effortlessly allows me to locate all uses of a symbol.  And it's <em>fast</em>.  Pure bliss.  Alas, I can't use vim+ctags at work, because it's not what everyone else uses, and because CLI-debugging of Java applications makes even gdb look like a diamond in comparison.

           As far as automatic refactoring goes, that <em>is</em> a nice feature to have, but is hardly a necessity.  If you use a sane naming convention (where instances are named for nouns, procedures named imperatively, and functions named for the results they return), you will find that global search and replace really does cover the majority of cases of renaming an identifier.  This works because you're not confusing parts of speech.  Yet one more reason to use <a href="SelfDocumentingCode.html">SelfDocumentingCode</a>.  -- SamuelFalvo

        What the demise of <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a> took away was incremental compilation and debug. The "ide-ness" of <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a> didn't matter so much to me. Please identify <strong>any</strong> other tool that lets me set a breakpoint inside a running servlet, catch the execution, and <strong>without stopping the session or the server</strong> compile and install a change to the method(s) in question. Without that capability, I'm back to logs and restarts. (<em>Note that incremental compile is still there in Eclipse, as is the repository, though based on CVS now</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'd bet that your true problem is a crappy application server.  Assuming you start the application server in a VM with a couple JPDA options seet, using any $100 JPDA-compliant debugger, you can set a breakpoint in a running servlet without stopping the server.  If you find your bug, edit the offending code.  Run Ant and a few seconds later you have a fresh application ready to deploy.  Here's where your real problems show up.  If you have a good J2EE server, maybe ten seconds after you drop in the ear file, your changes will be running.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No, you've missed the point.	</strong><a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> (and any JPDA debugger) allows you to modify the code but keep the currently running stack frame.  That means that you don't lose your place in debugging.  All of the program variables still have their values (except for temporaries within the current method) so you don't have to go through the pain of re-running your test (which often takes WAYYY longer than the application server startup).<strong></strong>

      <p>

        <strong>Java is dead for public applets</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The recent security problems with Java applets (early 2013) have people uninstalling it or switching it off on their browsers. When it becomes chore stay ahead of hackers, people start asking, "why do I need applets? What would happen if I got rid of Java?" Advice to uninstall and deactivate it appeared on many sites. It no longer carries its weight on the general Internet. Intranet? Maybe, but the public stagnation could spill over there also. Flash also has occasional security storms. However, many websites actually use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Except for speciality, mainly in-house applications, Java applets never did get much use.  Due to issues with mobile devices, Flash is on its way out too.  Both are being replaced by HTML5 and Javascript.  Of course, Java is still (as of 2013) very strong in the enterprise application and server-side spaces.</em>  <<And the open-source cross-platform IDE space
