        <em> "Eighty Megabytes...": Some years ago this was "Eight Megabytes...". Probably increases by a magnitude every couple of years. Is this </em>EmacsLaw similar to <a href="MooresLaw.html">MooresLaw</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, it still is eight megabytes.  Doesn't seem so bad these days, does it?  I guess emacs was just a bit ahead of its time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hm, the "constantly swapping" thingie applies better to most Java editors out there than to Emacs these days. Comparatively, Emacs or XEmacs are really slim and faster than their Java counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>
        And EMACS is...

        Ya know, there was a time when this seemed absurd to me (how droll), and then I worked for some years in <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>, and found that <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> was my OS, and the OS du jour was my device driver.  The more more I worked with it, the less I found it couldn't do, to the point where the only thing I wasn't doing with it was running other (binary) applications.  If what I've heard of EMACS is true, then I can well understand how this occurs.  -- <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>

        <em>The coworker who introduced me to Emacs (in 1983) called Unix the "Emacs run-time support system".</em>

        GNU Emacs is a LISP operating system disguised as a text editor.

        Use it often enough and you'll find that you've been emacsculated ...
