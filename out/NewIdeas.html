        New Ideas

      <p>
        How can Anyone know if his idea is a new idea or an old one?
      </p>
      <p>
        He could start facing the linguistic problems which come along 
        while searching for the predecessor (e.g. using <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a>)
        or just expressing his own by giving it a name he chooses.
      </p>
      <p>
        But where are the standards for describing knowledge or ideas?
        You should have linguistic rules for categorizing..
        both grammar and syntax are meant:
        How to deal with CamelWords ?
        Possible solutions are stemming (or splitting the composited words)
        and analysis of the semantic net of the vocabulary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does anyone have different ideas about that
        which are more than just the <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>?

        <em>Sounds like you're talking about ontologies. The W3C is doing things in this direction for the </em><a href="SemanticWeb.html">SemanticWeb</a>. One of those things is the <a href="WebOntologyLanguage.html">WebOntologyLanguage</a>.
