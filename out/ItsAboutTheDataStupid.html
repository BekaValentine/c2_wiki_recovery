        Its About The Data Stupid
      </h1>
      <p>
        After working on distributed systems for many many years
        i have come to the conclusion that seeing the world as
        distributed objects doesn't work as well as i had orginially
        hoped because distributed
        objects require too much common complexity to stay nimble
        and light. DOs require you to buy into complex frameworks
        which eventually kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modeling the distributed world as data flow preserves maximum
        flexibility while maintaining a great deal power. You don't get the same
        power of a DO system but, like the beetle, its simplicity
        and robustness may keep it around while more complex
        organisms have died off...again.
