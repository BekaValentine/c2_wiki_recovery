        Agile development methodologies will one day be the establishment approach.
        What will the radicals be doing then?

        It seems that some <a href="AgileDevelopment.html">AgileDevelopment</a> techniques and principles
        (<em>e.g.</em> <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>) are much more generally applicable than others
        (<em>e.g.</em> <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>), and that an insular existence demands a somewhat
        modified approach. What happens when the social dynamic changes?
      </p>
      <p>
        I've tried some of the tools listed under <a href="VirtualPairProgramming.html">VirtualPairProgramming</a>, but they don;t seem to address the real issues.

        Access to this (and other) Wikis is a valuable training resource.

        No, but I occasionally get enquiries of this nature, so you can reach him as sholden at pobox.com. One day it would be interesting to meet him or her (<em>easy to forget one's own name can apply to both genders</em>). Indeed is it is, and clearly I did -- <em>SH</em>
