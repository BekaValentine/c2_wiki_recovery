        Video Game Designer

      <p>
        Although many design video games, there are several which rise above the crowd. Those that have pages (or may deserve to have them) include:

        BTW, who is Brian Reynolds? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Brian Reynolds was the lead programmer and designer of Sid Meier's Colonization, Sid Meier's Civilization II, and Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. Started with Microprose, founded Firaxis with Sid and Jeff Briggs, then left with several others to start BigHugeGames. Sid Meier's name became a brand and was put on products he was not the lead designer or programmer for. If you look at the splash screen for Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, you will note that it says "A Brain Reynolds Design." In short, Brain was the man behind the Sid Meier curtain for the last three Sid Meier products. Not that Sid is a lame-oid, he did do the work on RR tycoon and games previous to that, and a fair amount of the work on Civilization. (Bruce Shelly also doing a fair amount.)

        Carmack is not as much as designer as a (darn good) developer. The game design of DOOM and QUAKE was mostly done by <a href="SandyPeterson.html">SandyPeterson</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>While Carmack is a coder, I think that ID's games are still very thoroughly stamped with his finger prints, so perhaps he could be included. However, his work has a fundamentally different feel compared to the others listed above.  Abrash is </em><a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a>, and he doesn't leave trademark styles in gameplay.<em></em>
