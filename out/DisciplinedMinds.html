        "In this riveting book about the world of professional work, 
        Jeff Schmidt demonstrates that the workplace is a battleground 
        for the very identity of the individual, as is graduate school, 
        where professionals are trained. He shows that professional work 
        is inherently political, and that professionals are hired to 
        subordinate their own vision and maintain strict “ideological discipline.”
        The hidden root of much career dissatisfaction, argues Schmidt, 
        is the professional’s lack of control over the political component 
        of his or her creative work. Many professionals set out to make a 
        contribution to society and add meaning to their lives. Yet our 
        system of professional education and employment abusively inculcates 
        an acceptance of politically subordinate roles in which professionals
        typically do not make a significant difference, undermining the 
        creative potential of individuals, organizations and even democracy.
        Schmidt details the battle one must fight to be an independent 
        thinker and to pursue one’s own social vision in today’s 
        corporate society. ..."
