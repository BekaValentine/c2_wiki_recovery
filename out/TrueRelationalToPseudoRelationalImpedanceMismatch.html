        True Relational To Pseudo Relational Impedance Mismatch
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalImpedanceMismatch.html">TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalImpedanceMismatch</a> is a label that could be used for the set of problems that could be encountered when using a PseudoRelationalDatabase (<a href="BagAtational.html">BagAtational</a>?), as the mechanism for storing the data for a <a href="TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalMapper.html">TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalMapper</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does it really exist? Does it.. for example, force you to allow nulls in your otherwise perfectly complaint <a href="TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalMapper.html">TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalMapper</a>? or those are just problems with particular implementations ? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the possible mismatches could be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>True Relational  to </strong>PseudoRelational costs time and money<strong> </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               It is not such a big problem, SQL  and <a href="BagAtational.html">BagAtational</a> are <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>. <a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a> are not such a big deal, and <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a><strong>'s can easily deal with them.</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>True Relational to </strong>PseudoRelational forces you to add SurrogateKeys to eliminate duplicates (or to add a column with a "count" of the duplicates)<strong></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               The root cause of the impedance mismatch... some think it is trivial to solve, others, that it is not. See <a href="BagNeedScenarios.html">BagNeedScenarios</a> for a discussion.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>True Relational to </strong>PseudoRelational forces you to use nulls<strong></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               see <a href="NullVersusNone.html">NullVersusNone</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>True Relational to </strong>PseudoRelational needs triggers for constraints<strong></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               is not possible to define constraints using Bag Algebra? or is it just not efficient?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>True Relational to </strong>PseudoRelational needs support of user defined types in the PseudoRelational database<strong></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               how to translate them if there there is no support in the PseudoRelational database?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>True Relational Operation/Constraint to Pseudo Relational </strong>PersistentStorageModule/Trigger<strong></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               What features are required in <a href="PersistentStoredModules.html">PersistentStoredModules</a> so that the a D language (such as <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>) can be compiled in to <a href="PersistentStoredModules.html">PersistentStoredModules</a>? (Compilation is necessary so that the underlying PseudoRelationalDatabase protects its own integrity even if not accessed using the TrueRelationalMapper. One example would be the very powerful constraints available in <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, and the fact that there is not even one Sql database that implements CREATE ASSERTION, so the D constraints would have to be compiled into triggers/materialized views with checks)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>True Relational to </strong>PseudoRelational needs Relvars<strong></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               most (all?) PseudoRelational database have no support for relvars, it is going to be too hard implement them in an efficient way
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Are this real problems/mismatches? or perhaps TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalImpedanceMismatchDoesNotExist and one can perfectly wrap PseudoRelationalDatabase under a TrueRelationalMapper? or perhaps that wrapping is only possible  as long as the PseudoRelationalDatabase has <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> <a href="PersistentStoredModules.html">PersistentStoredModules</a>?
