        The Queens English
      </h1>
      <p>
        A formal dialect of English spoken largely by upper-class English people. It is a common misconception of American people that all English people speak <a href="TheQueensEnglish.html">TheQueensEnglish</a>. In fact, the majority of English people speak in a less formal manner, and regard <a href="TheQueensEnglish.html">TheQueensEnglish</a> as old-fashioned and somewhat amusing. <a href="TheQueensEnglish.html">TheQueensEnglish</a> predates and is precursor to its transatlantic cousin, <a href="AmericanEnglish.html">AmericanEnglish</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Called </em>TheKingsEnglish when a male monarch is on the throne. It is not, of course, defined by how the monarch speaks. By extension, it also covers the written language.<em></em>
