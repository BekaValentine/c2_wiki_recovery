        Out Run
      </h1>
      <p>
        A classic ArcadeDrivingGame from the [X]early 1990s[X] early-to-mid 1980s. Technically feeble by today's standards but still has something special. (The music, maybe?) It can still be enjoyed today thanks to the <a href="MameEmulator.html">MameEmulator</a>.

        Point of reference:
        See <a href="http://www.outrun.org">http://www.outrun.org</a> for a dedicated <a href="OutRun.html">OutRun</a> site, and check the Downloads page for the music.

        As for Programming, it is said that there was some very clever Programming which went into <a href="OutRun.html">OutRun</a>, with respect to the handling of SpriteGraphics and their presentation to the viewer, such that a <em>better</em> representation  / indication / implication of speed of forward movement was made, in comparison to other similar VerticalScrollingGames.
        Part of the success of said Programming was the reduction in processor work required...

        By the way, <em>now</em> (by Q3 2005) there would be more than just the <a href="MameEmulator.html">MameEmulator</a> available as Environments in which to run several different PlatformDependent versions of <a href="OutRun.html">OutRun</a>, many freely available on the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a>.
