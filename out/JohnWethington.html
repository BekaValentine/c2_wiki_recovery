        Hello. I am a 20-year-old male from Ames, IA, USA. This page has been around since June 17, 2001 and I periodically edit it for fun. Wikis really took off in 2005, as the public became aware of wikipedia.org and similar smaller wikis were started.  The wiki honor system is the reason why this page still exists, and I am quite proud of the community for that.

        I am currently a senior in civil engineering at Iowa State University (<a href="http://www.iastate.edu)">http://www.iastate.edu)</a>
        I shall update this sometime in the future.

        No, I don't have the time to belabor. <em>How come you have time to debate, then?</em> I don't. <em>It's certainly not easy to underestimate your abilities!</em>
        That is correct.
