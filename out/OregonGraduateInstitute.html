        Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology is the region's premier provider of high-technology graduate education, and it is home to a talented array of world-class scientists and researchers. Established in 1963 in response to the needs of the emerging high-technology industry in metropolitan Portland, OGI - with its mission of education and research in science and technology - has grown as Oregon's "Silicon Forest" has grown around it.  Today OGI offers master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees in five academic departments.
