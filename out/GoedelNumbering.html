        Goedel Numbering
      </h1>
      <p>
        Since the page was accreting incorrect statements, I've tried to add a more detailed explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
        Goedel invented <a href="GoedelNumbering.html">GoedelNumbering</a> as a way of assigning a unique positive integer to every possible formula in a mathematical system, so that mathematical statements could be translated into numbers, which could then appear within other statements, allowing mathematical statements to become <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> values, which he then used to prove his two famous theorems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clever method he used for this encoding was to take advantage of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: every positive integer has a unique factorization. In <a href="GoedelNumbering.html">GoedelNumbering</a>, the factorization of an integer yields the statement that the integer encoded, and does so uniquely.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do so, every symbol in the alphabet to be used for statements is assigned a unique number, e.g. "a"=100, "b"=200, "c"=300 (large values picked for clarity of exposition) <em>etc.</em>, and every possible position in the statement is assigned a <a href="PrimeNumber.html">PrimeNumber</a>, for instance, position 1 = 2, position 2 = 3, position 3 = 5, position 4 = 7, position 5 = 11, position 6 = 13, <em>etc</em>. The encoding is performed by taking the position encoding and raising it to the power of the symbol encoding at that position, and cumulatively multiplying together each such encoded position/symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, the message "bc" has "b" in position 1; "b" is represented by 200, position 1 is represented by the prime 2, so the first position/value pair is uniquely encoded by 2^200. The second symbol is "c", which is represented by 300, while position 2 is represented by the prime 3, so the second position value pair is uniquely encoded by 3^300, and the whole message is equal to 2^200 * 3^300, multiplied out in full:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          8
        </li>
        <li>
          0
        </li>
        <li>
          6
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The original message can be recovered (in principle) by finding the unique factorization of that number, which has only one unique answer, 2^200 * 3^300, which tells us which symbols were encoded at which positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example uses 200 to encode "b" and 300 to encode "c" merely because use of 2 and 3 would be visually confusingly similar to the encodings of positions 1 and 2, but arithmetically would cause no problems and would yield the correct answers. However, even with minimum encodings, even small statements tend to have <strong>very</strong> large GoedelNumbers, frequently too large to be practical to work with, although factoring them is comparatively easy in principle because the factors come from a known "pool", so the factorization is tedious but straightforward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless, the purpose of <a href="GoedelNumbering.html">GoedelNumbering</a> is to allow statements to be made about statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple <a href="GoedelNumbering.html">GoedelNumbering</a> for a program written in ASCII text is to treat the entire program as a big base-256 number
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I know this is informally called <a href="GoedelNumbering.html">GoedelNumbering</a>, but is this <strong>formally</strong> called <a href="GoedelNumbering.html">GoedelNumbering</a>?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I wonder if there is a parallel in <a href="GoedelNumbering.html">GoedelNumbering</a> with the concept of <a href="PrimeNumber.html">PrimeNumber</a>s;  do prime goedel's constitute new 'primitive' operations? -- <a href="WilliamUnderwood.html">WilliamUnderwood</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           With the new explanation above, this answers itself: primes are essential, not just parallel, and a prime Goedel Number is simply a message containing exactly one symbol with encoding 1, if such exists (e.g. the first symbol, say "a", might have encoding 1) at some position encoded with prime P, yielding Goedel Number P^1 = P.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Is math on <a href="GoedelNumbering.html">GoedelNumbering</a>s ever useful?  Other than the obvious case of concatenating two programs with a (very large) arithmetic operation; I can't think of any mathematical transformations that wouldn't result in a file containing utter rubbish.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In practice, non-trivial statements' Goedel Numbers are too big to factor, so no.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>In practice you would store the numbers in factored form (or rather in source form), so yes.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because these numbers are a mathematical vehicle you could dispense with them altogether in any practical application. Just keep in mind, that whatever representation you use, it could be translated into one number (in a way you can see this in any number program: consider the whole memory as one large number in base-256 notation - for the bytes).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But "any mathematical transformations" would include factorization, which doesn't lead to "utter rubbish". When dealing with large numbers, be tolerant of large amounts of arithmetic.</em>
      </p>

        Hmmm.  This bears some evident relation to the computation of CRC values.  In computing a CRC, the entire message is treated as one large number (string-o'-bits) which is then divided (using digital slight of hand) by an appropriate prime polynomial, yielding a (nearly unique) remainder.  One is never really interested in the "value" of the message as a number, but only in whether the math (performed again later, on retrieval) produces the same remainder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not directly a numerical interpretation, but evidently the <em>consequence</em> of this property.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do I get an "amen" on this?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It bears some relation, but CRC values are not unique - it's quite possible to alter a file and keep the same CRC as a similar file</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        While this is true, it can be pretty darn hard to keep the length and essential content the same (given adequate CRC size), and the "similar" file would have to be really contrived -- which explains why checksums aren't worthless to begin with.  No, the CRCs are not unique, but for a given length of text with substantially the same content, they pretty much are.  
      </p>
      <p>
        We're not describing self-correcting encoding schemes and Hamming distances.  The point was that the <em>numeric nature</em>  of the message can be exploited this way.  The fact that it submits to math in any sort of useful way seems to relate to the "essentially unique number" property of otherwise non-numeric data.
