        <em>09/19/2003</em> - We're consulting on a large medical billing software project developed in .NET. Our client has a history of either <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>, <a href="NoDesignUpFront.html">NoDesignUpFront</a>, or a combination of the two. Based on past history, we'll be evangelizing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> as often as we can, and we're slowly but surely moving the client in that direction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While the idea of doing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is a non-starter right now, we did manage to convince the client of the value of <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> and are implementing that in a way that embeds practices such as <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> along the way. The target (already committed to by our client, with no <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> or, as far as I can tell, any other kind of planning) for delivery of the beta is 12/05/2003. So, I'm not real optimistic, but I'm hoping that the practices we're adopting for this project will work and we can build on that to do XP for the next project. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, we may well end up with the "the project failed for lack of proper practices, let's talk about what went wrong and how we can use <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> to avoid those traps on our next project" scenario, too. We'll see what happens. I'll keep everyone posted.
