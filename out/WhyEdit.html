        Web Collaboration Software and Document Content Management <a href="http://www.YEdit.com/">http://www.YEdit.com/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        An information resource for web collaboration and other related collaborative content management software (including the recovered information about the YEdit collaboration server).
      </p>
      <p>
        You will find information about co-operative and collaborative group document creation, content management, editing and publishing utilising Internet technologies. Being online (on the Web), they can be used from any location world wide, at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the beginning of 2004 YEdit was re-written and split up into easier to read sections.

        Note: Early in 2003 I had all my computer gear stolen (including all my backup CD's). I have since been able to recover the information about YEdit, I have since edited and re-written parts and put it back up on the web. I can't continue the development of the YEdit application at the moment, even so, there is a lot of information there. If my circumstances change, then I may recreate the application.
