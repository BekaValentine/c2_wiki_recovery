        Extra Legs Ontoa Dog
      </h1>
      <p>
        It has often been said that <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is "an octopus made by nailing extra legs onto a dog" (coined by <a href="SteveTaylor.html">SteveTaylor</a>). Of course, that analogy can be extended to other languages as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Really, should be renamed into "An Octopus made by..." or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, here is "how other languages became <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> octopi":

               you now have an 8-legged dog, and the process was rather painful.

           ...made by taking an 8-legged dog, housebreaking it, and tearing out its skeleton. Then giving it a machine shop.
          <ul>
            <li>
               a boneless 8-legged dog manages to be less useful than either an octopus or a dog - but it comes with a machine shop, so that's good.

           ...made by taking an 8-legged boneless dog and drawing bones on its skin to make people think it's more like a dog. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               It also comes with a machine shop, but this one is in imperial units so it matches your existing gear a little better.
            </li>
            <li>
               Also comes with a hamster with 4 boneless dog's legs attached to it, and tools for attaching 4 boneless dog's legs to other animals.

      <ul>
        <li>
           ...made by taking an 8-legged dog and tearing out the part of its skeleton used by the middle four legs. (This was considered a more humane alternative to nailing extra legs on to a 4-legged dog.) It can still run like an ordinary dog, but the boneless extra legs will get in the way and slow it down without special training.
        </li>
        <li>
           In response to criticism about the missing bones, tentacles were added to the middle legs. The dog can now climb trees, but is even more awkward when trying to run like a normal dog. Scientific research is ongoing into the best way to add bones to all the limbs - including the tentacles.

(Contrast with <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>, where the legs are numbered only when the dog jumps.) Can become an octopus only by replacing it with a completely different animal and calling the result VisualDelphiBasic [sic; that is not a typo].
          <ul>
            <li>
               Really more of a hamster than a dog.

It can do anything that a boneless dog in a machine shop can do.
