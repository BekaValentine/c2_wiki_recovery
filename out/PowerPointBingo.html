        Power Point Bingo
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="PowerPointBingo.html">PowerPointBingo</a> is a game rather like <a href="BuzzwordBingo.html">BuzzwordBingo</a>, where you list a series of annoying "features" typically present in <a href="PowerPoint.html">PowerPoint</a> presentations, such as "swirl text effect", "gunshot sound", "clashing colours", "dodgy title and/or end slides", "greying out points", "fade transition", etc., and attempt to spot them all during a presentation.  The first person to make a full house gives a subtle indication to the rest of the room, and is duly awarded kudos for second-guessing the idiocy of the presenter.
