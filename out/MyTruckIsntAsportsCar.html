        <strong>Consider</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I and most of my friends and associates prefer to drive high performance sports cars. So why have trucks and panel-trucks any more? I prefer this neat <a href="HandHeld.html">HandHeld</a> that I can use anywhere, so why should I worry about using a desktop or lap-top computer? 
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Your reaction?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this reflect any scenario you are confronted with, or is it just a fringe effect or inconsequential attitude?

        <em>Gee, I need to create this report. I'll just type it in on my tabl-- oh, wait...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Typing is outmoded. No one reads anymore anyway. Vlog your report.

        <em>Guys, have you </em>seen<em> how fast </em>MongoDB is?  The <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a> is extinct!<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you seen how long it takes to write an ad-hoc query in MongoDB that does a join on seven tables?  The garden hose will make swimming pools extinct before MongoDB makes the <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a> extinct.
