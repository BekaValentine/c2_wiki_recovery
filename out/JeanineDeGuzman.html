        Also known as Jeanine Levy.

      <p>
        A Smalltalker since 1992, Jeanine has experience in Object Analysis and 
        Object Design on numerous projects in multiple problem domains.  In addition
        to being a senior Smalltalk developer on the <a href="VcapsProject.html">VcapsProject</a>, Jeanine has
        instructed, mentored, and led Smalltalk development teams.  She recently 
        received her MBA (1998) with the hope of now being a <em>schooled</em>, as well as
        qualified leader of Object development efforts.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="VcapsProject.html">VcapsProject</a> has affirmed her belief in <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>s, the importance of analyzing Object Behavior (not just State) and building <a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a>.  These practices provide a seamless way of documenting analysis and design decisions throughout the entire project, a practice where deliverables are incrementally updated with integral technical details as the team progresses through the project life cycle.

      <p>
        Personal sticking point:  why do managers insist on using traditional project
        management/planning skills, when the skills that really work are those utilized 
        in <a href="ExtremeScheduleNegotiation.html">ExtremeScheduleNegotiation</a>???  After all, the way an engineer designs a 
        particular component part (<a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>) is planned and managed differently 
        than is a project for building a sub-assembly which may contain the engineer's 
        component part (<a href="CommitmentSchedule.html">CommitmentSchedule</a>)??  This is the same concept in software 
        development projects.  The two perspectives (project deliverable versus 
        engineering task) contain real differences.  Because these differences are just 
        that, <em>real</em>, why do managers typically spend so much time ignoring them??
