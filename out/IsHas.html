               Most systems have discovery mechanisms which allow it to utilize designed, addressable hardware, users, connections, particular files, specific i/o (Printers, Keyboard, Mouse, touch screens, etc. ) and other resources.

               A system can be designed to discover contents or attributes of an artifact. If they are discovered, the system can be notified or made aware that the artifact "has" it.

               A system can also be made aware of readiness and availability of spaces. Example: An i/o device which "has" space to put or contents ready to get.
