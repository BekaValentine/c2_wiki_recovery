        User Persona
      </h1>
      <p>
        User personas are an <a href="InteractionDesign.html">InteractionDesign</a> tool that helps developers make the right decisions about features. A user persona is always a common user of the application and never an uncommon user. Linux development isn't based on user personas and the story from Luke Kanies at <a href="http://luke.hates-software.com/2004/02/28/3b08b06a.html">http://luke.hates-software.com/2004/02/28/3b08b06a.html</a> illustrates this.

      <p>
        User personas are a polite way to say "Well, fuck that guy." about someone who's 0.00001% of your target market and whose needs conflict with 99.9% of it.
