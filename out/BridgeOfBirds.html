        [ISBN 0345321383] "A novel of an ancient China that never was." A somewhat difficult to describe book. Imagine a Chinese version of <a href="ThePrincessBride.html">ThePrincessBride</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A small sample: 
        "My surname is Li, and my personal name is Kao, and I have a slight flaw in my character."
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This byline probably conveys nothing, out of context. Kind of like the Terminator's "I'll be back" sounds like nothing, if you haven't seen the movies. But <strong>in</strong> context it is fun and ironic.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>This is a wonderful, wonderful book; one of a kind. Princess Bride isn't a bad comparison; that had never occurred to me. It's all silly and lightly humorous, there's high adventure, romance, quests, all set in a mythical ancient China of gods and magic.</em>

        Also see TheStoryOfTheStone and EightSkilledGentlemen, the two sequels. There is also an omnibus containing all three entitled "The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox".
