        I have long been uncomfortable with the term <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s. From a purely semantic perspective, it is not very accurate. After all, <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s are Patterns, and often some of the most frequently encountered, most difficult-to-resist patterns there are. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In thinking through the problem, I realized that <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>s captures the idea better for me (YMMV, of course!) I mean Dark here in the Star Wars universe vernacular. I suggest that <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>s are frequently encountered solutions to common problems which:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           are extremely seductive
        </li>
        <li>
           seem like the easy way to quick success
        </li>
        <li>
           but ultimately corrupt whatever good intentions led to their adoption
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is particularly true for organizational <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s, but probably applies to design <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s as well...

        I hate to contribute to <a href="JargonProliferation.html">JargonProliferation</a>, but <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>s seems so much more evocative, somehow. What do you think? -- <a href="BillBarnett.html">BillBarnett</a>

        I'm sure the idea is that to know the <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>s or <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s allows a person to identify one before it is put into production. If we have a problem and while thinking and talking about it we start to re-create that same old <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a> again, hopefully one of us will say, "Stop!" because they will be wise in the ways of darkness ... this has never happened to me, I keep touching the hot stove every chance I get. But I like the term <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>s, better too. -- <a href="EricHerman.html">EricHerman</a>

        <em> While I haven't seen them articulated as formal </em><a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s, there are several <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>s that have kept me from making mistakes and helped me steer others away from similar mistakes. <a href="BrooksLaw.html">BrooksLaw</a>, from Fred Brooks <a href="MythicalManMonth.html">MythicalManMonth</a>, jumps immediately to mind. (And, for a great analysis of why <a href="BrooksLaw.html">BrooksLaw</a> works, see <a href="QualitySoftwareManagement.html">QualitySoftwareManagement</a> (vol 1).) In fact, several of the systems diagrams that Weinberg develops make very effective <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>s, including the <a href="SelfInvalidatingModel.html">SelfInvalidatingModel</a> and the <a href="TitanicEffect.html">TitanicEffect</a>. -- <a href="BillBarnett.html">BillBarnett</a> <em></em>

        I've written my share of <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s and I too like <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>s as what they should be called. For example, (self-promotion mode ON) <a href="TrainTheTrainer.html">TrainTheTrainer</a> is a classic "dark" pattern because it is so widely used and is so completely bogus.
        But it continues to be used because underlying it is the desire to save money in a way that is quantifiable while actually costing much more money in ways that don't show up clearly in budget statistics. To quote <a href="JackieChiles.html">JackieChiles</a>, "Its
        insidious, perfidious, outrageous!" I vote for <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>s too. --<a href="DonOlson.html">DonOlson</a>

        <em></em><a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>, imagine that we are on a project together, and we are both acquainted with the <a href="SelfInvalidatingModel.html">SelfInvalidatingModel</a> <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>. Imagine also, that we're talking about adding a simple little bell or whistle to a module. I might be inclined to say, "Ah, piece of cake, here lemme just take a few minutes and add it in." Then you might be inclined to say, "This is starting to sound like a <a href="SelfInvalidatingModel.html">SelfInvalidatingModel</a> ... be sure not to skip the test cases for that."<em></em>

        <em>Obviously, having a little bit of pattern vocabulary can go a long way from time to time. In this case, I might just say "Oh, good point."

        OK, we've had this debate on the PatternsDiscussion mailing list. No one agrees.  I'm for writing Pattern Languages that document what you guys call <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s in the form of Problems and Misfits.  Either way, it's good that they are being written up. -- <a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>

        <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> talked about patterns that have life, and patterns that don't.  He is interested in the patterns that promote the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>, which is the same thing (to him) as life.  So, my favorite name for antipatterns is "patterns of death".  -- <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>

        I can see some politically incorrect undertones in associating a bad thing with the concept of dark. Anti seems to be a politically correct option.

        In several respects, it sounds like <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> and <a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a> are not the same thing. Also, I am not so sure that what Alexander was after, when naming the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>, is all that much value to a software designer. In the example he gives he talks about an espaliered peach tree against a wall in the sun whose peaches are warm. Alexander was interested in Oriental Rugs, and little walkways through crowded gardens that opened up onto a surprizingly wonderful place to sit and rest. Ok, some of this poetry may translate to the Interactive Insurance Claim form my team is implementing, but, which field represents the peach, again? One can get carried away with the metaphor. Patterns and <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s, in terms of their usage in the software design community, remind me more of therapies one might find for the prevention and treatment of disease. Consequently, a pattern in medicine might be WashingOnesHandsBeforeExaminingThePatient, and an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> might be, Bleeding4PintsOfBadBlood out of the patient. It seemed a good idea for thousands of physicians for many generations, but the vast majority never realized why it was such a bad idea. Patterns, and <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s or Dark Patterns encapsulate wisdom gained from experience for the prevention and treatment of sick software designs. -- <a href="JohnCave.html">JohnCave</a>
