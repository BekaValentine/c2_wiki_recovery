      <p>
        Martin is a program manager at a medium-sized manufacturing company in North West England. He was horrified to discover recently that the company's succession plan has him down as a potential Manager of Quality, Health, Safety & Environment. (Not that these aren't important, just ...)

        And was absolutely ecstatic to be able to start the (first!) 20,000th Wiki page - <a href="WikiAtTwentyThousand.html">WikiAtTwentyThousand</a>.

        <em>The Welcome mat is always down at this wiki! Benefit as well as participate.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well thank you for this, I hope to do and enjoy both. If the Welcome message is automated [<em>it's not</em>], I thank whoever did that, too. -- Martin

        Excuse my asking, but what exactly is a program manager?
      </p>
      <p>
        Good question, and one I keep feeling the need to ask myself.  In my case it's part business process analysis and part managing the implementation of the technology to achieve identified improvements in those processes.  It's based on an understanding of both business and technology, whereas on our site project management is based on one or the other.  At least, that's what I tell my boss at review time.  Enough about me, what about you?  And apologies for the "automated" comment.

        This is from the original welcomer -- I started a page some months ago called <a href="ProcessImprovementTools.html">ProcessImprovementTools</a>, based initially on a comment from another page by <a href="WaldenMathews.html">WaldenMathews</a>. I do not pretend to be an expert, but started the page anyway. Many people contributed and the page has been refactored (edited, improved). Since this seems to be one of the matters you are involved with, could you read the page, and if you have the time and/or inclination, improve it?  I am much interested in improving processess and in particular the process of making computer programming easier for the experts in other disciplines.

        I wish you well in whatever comes of the "Succession Plan". --<a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

        Donald - I must have found the wiki at about the same time you started <a href="ProcessImprovementTools.html">ProcessImprovementTools</a> and I've certainly visited the page and read with interest.  As you might imagine, the wiki concept was hard for me at the time.  I think I've grown since then and I'm proud that you think I can contribute - I'll happily give it my best shot. Martin.

        Martin - As someone who would love a job with the title "Manager of Quality, Health, Safety & Environment", please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I've been in that business (dealing with EH&S issues) for years. Plus, I'm willing to relocate to England... :-) -- <a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sean - If the current holder of the title ever drops off his peg AND I still hold down the same employment AND said employer is still in business ... I'll be on the phone.  Meantime, if you and Sandy get the opportunity to come over here - look me up. And is the <a href="WikiSpringCleaning.html">WikiSpringCleaning</a> page one of yours?  M.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nope, not me. But spring cleaning is a worthy goal. We might just take you up on your offer. We try to get to Europe once a year and it's either Tuscany in June or Paris/London for the end of the Tour de France. -- SeanO
