        The Writers Art
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>The Writer's Art</em> is a book and a syndicated newspaper column by James J. Kilpatrick. ISBN: 0836279190

      <p>
        Mr Kilpatrick approaches grammatical problems with great humor and a heavy dose of seriousness. Or <em>vice versa</em>. While I haven't read the book, I have habitually read his column for years. He addresses such conundrums as <a href="EatsShootsAndLeaves.html">EatsShootsAndLeaves</a> regularly. He responds to readers <a href="PetPeeve.html">PetPeeve</a>s, in addition to many of his own. He doesn't come across as too <a href="AnalRetentive.html">AnalRetentive</a> or anything... just strives to promote actual literacy and the lost arts of careful proofreading, good grammar, and thoughtful editing. -- <a href="RonJandrasi.html">RonJandrasi</a>
