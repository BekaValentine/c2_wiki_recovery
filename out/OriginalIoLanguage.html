        Original Io Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        As with most people, it seems, I first read about this in Raphael A. Finkel's book <a href="AdvancedProgrammingLanguageDesign.html">AdvancedProgrammingLanguageDesign</a>, but he refers to (and uses examples from) R. L. Levien's paper "IO: A New Programming Notation", available at <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=70934&jmp=indexterms&dl=GUIDE&dl=ACM">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=70934&jmp=indexterms&dl=GUIDE&dl=ACM</a> if you have an ACM membership. The language is also catalogued at <a href="http://www.kraml.at/stupid/io.html">http://www.kraml.at/stupid/io.html</a> (<a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>; see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030121155611/http://www.kraml.at/stupid/io.html),">http://web.archive.org/web/20030121155611/http://www.kraml.at/stupid/io.html),</a> where there is a reference to what appears to be the sole implementation, Amalthea, available at <a href="http://www.guldheden.com/~sandin/amalthea.html">http://www.guldheden.com/~sandin/amalthea.html</a> .

      <p>
        Io is based around the concept of continuation passing (see <a href="ContinuationExplanation.html">ContinuationExplanation</a> and <a href="ContinuationPassingStyle.html">ContinuationPassingStyle</a>), and there really isn't much more to it than that. For example if you look at this code tidbit
      </p>
      <code>
        write 5;<br/>
        write 6;<br/>
        terminate<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        it looks fairly procedural. But what "write" actually takes as parameters is a number and a continuation. Thus, "5" is the first parameter, and "write 6; terminate" is the second parameter. "write" prints its first parameter and then invokes the continuation.
      </p>

        If someone wants to expand on this explanation, feel free.

        <em>Didn't Io have power loops? I must be misremembering.</em>
        Yes you are. <a href="PowerLoops.html">PowerLoops</a> are just in the same chapter of APLD as Io's continuations
      </p>

        There is another, newer <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> also called Io. See <a href="IoLanguage.html">IoLanguage</a>.

        I wrote a page explaining the semantics of Io (as far as I understand them; I don't have access to the original paper) at <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/raph-io.html.">http://canonical.org/~kragen/raph-io.html.</a>

        Thanks to my ACM Student membership (worth every dime!) I do have access. For starters, Io has a special syntax concerning "continuations" - actually, they're called "actions" in the paper, and they are the only control structure in the language - there are no functions, or procedures, they're actions. Anyway, if an action is the last argument to another action, it's written as:
      </p>
      <code>
        ; action<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        whereas if it's not the last parameter, it's written as:
      </p>
      <code>
        (action)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and, of course, there will be other parameters following. If you want to define an action the form is:
      </p>
      <code>
        operator<strong>:</strong> action<strong>.</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I'm not sure how to get this language to do more serious output but it makes me want to find out. -- <a href="WaltRorieBaety.html">WaltRorieBaety</a>
