      <p>
        I am actually Robert M. Ioffe.
        In case you are wondering, M. stands for Motelevich. My father's name is Motl, but unscrupulous authorities recorded him as Motel' when he was born, hence he was officially known as Motel', and therefore my middle name has arrived.

        There is another Robert Ioffe out there and wonderfully, he attended the same university (<a href="http://www.lu.lv)">http://www.lu.lv)</a> as I did couple of years earlier. He was in the FizMat department as I was: I guess our famous (in Russia, at least) last name (see <a href="AbramIoffe.html">AbramIoffe</a>) influenced us in such a way.

        I want to write a book titled: "The Tyranny of the Corporation" after reading some notes by Edsger W. Dijkstra. See his homepage <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/</a> for a comprehensive archive of his work.
