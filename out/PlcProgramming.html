        Plc Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        A discipline of programming which makes MachineAutomation possible. Programs are written, usually in <a href="LadderLogic.html">LadderLogic</a>, for a specific ProgrammableLogicController (PLC).
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming of this type has been done in the past by Engineers, Designers, Technicians and Electricians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plcs are programmed to perform automatically in the control of such things as motors, conveyors, robots, pumps and compressors, ovens, bottling machines, welding machines and welding robots, painting machines, stamping machines, mixers, heaters, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The logic used emulates and substitutes for controls formerly supplied by RelayPanels and uses representative symbols for switches, contacts of relays, timers and clocks, special devices and instruments, in a form similar to that of a schematic ladder diagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many if not most of the products you use every day were manufactured in factories employing tens, hundreds and thousands of PLCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programs written for PLCs are written with the idea that every possible condition is anticipated and handled so that failure is not an option.
