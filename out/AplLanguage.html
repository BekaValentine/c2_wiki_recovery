        Now that Unicode support in browsers is decent, I'll try to put the code examples in Unicode characters rather than images. Let me know if there are any problems.

        APL stands for A Programming Language. It is an <a href="ArrayOrientedLanguage.html">ArrayOrientedLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its character set is a superset of ASCII. This is demonstrated in the following APL code sample:

        Reserved words are preceded by a special symbol (called quad). 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no precedence rules in APL: statements are simply read from right to left. For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           - 3 + 4 yields 5, same as 12 - (3 + 4)
        </li>
      </ol>

           Paul: You are right that LJUST & RJUST and VTOM are not primitives. They appear to be variable names or function names, based on the preceding syntax. My guess is the RJUST and Ljst are Left and Right Justify, respectively, but I'm not sure what VTOM is. -- <a href="HansWobbe.html">HansWobbe</a>

           Hans: VTOM is a well-known function (at least to SHARP APL users), the name means Vector TO Matrix. It basically takes a delimiter, followed by a vector which contains lines delimited by that delimiter, and returns a padded matrix with each line as a separate row, each preceded by the delimiter. That is, VTOM '.ab.cde' is the matrix 2 4 {shape} '.ab .cde' -- Leigh Clayton

           Thanks, Leigh. I guess that became a popular function name after my days as IPSA. I still have the primitives code and never did get around to setting it up as a function. Perhaps one of the reasons that I do enjoy following the Object Oriented discussions around here, is that I seem to be guilty of a lot of such over-sights.  By the way, It's nice to have our paths cross, once again. Regards, - 'hwo'.

        Yes, you needed a special keyboard, and yes, you need a special terminal, since at that time we are talking about VT100 and variants, mostly IBM terminals actually, but I can't remember their names.

        </li>
      </ul>

        I found some keyboard designs in Google. The one I used was similar to the most complex.

        Although difficult to get used to, APL was Fun. I know of a large bank in Brazil that had a team of economists just doing what we call today <a href="DataMining.html">DataMining</a> in APL 20 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I understand, if you had an extended APL, you needed an extended keyboard also. IBM must have loved this language at that time.

        APL was originally created to DefineDocumentSpecify the IBM 360...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No; Iverson published a formal spec for the 360 in 1964, but APL was not developed for that purpose. His 1962 book A Programming Language specifically says in the preface that he developed it over severals years teaching graduate courses, as a mathematical notation for discussing algorithms.
        </li>
        <li>
           The notation used in the book used semantically significant fonts, superscripts, subscripts, and such that were replaced by more practically implementable notations in the later implementation of it as a programming language.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ...and it was close enough to being an actual computer language that an interpreter was implemented for it (and a special type ball on the ibm selectric was created to represent it).
      </p>
      <p>
        APL was once used to prototype SQL - SQL could be looked at as an attempt to extract the data-storage aspects of APL into a form which is generally useful.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You could look at it that way as a metaphor or something, but that's not to say that that's where SQL got those aspects of its nature. Those aspects came from Codd's database theory research.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I don't see these as contradictory. Using APL to implement a prototype has little or nothing to do with where SQL as a language came from.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           They *are* contradictory, because in terms of objective documented history, SQL was *not* "an attempt to extract the data-storage aspects of APL into a form which is generally useful". It just wasn't, and there aren't any citations out there to support that speculation. That's why I said (trying to be gentle) that you could say that as a "metaphor", because it sure as hell isn't historical fact.
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm a fan of APL, it doesn't need anyone to lie (or even exaggerate) about its historical contributions to justify its worth.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        APL is now a dead language: the user community is so small that you almost never hear about it
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's a subjective judgement, not an objective fact. I am not part of the APL/J/K community, but I hear about it repeatedly over the years. The APL community was <strong>always</strong> a small one. The introduction of the J and K dialects seem to have kindled some new interest.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ...and there are so many divergent variants that little is held in common beyond the basic language.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I believe that there are only 3 many variants, that they have actually quite a bit in common, and that it is meaningless to say "beyond the basic language", because it sounds like you're saying they do have the basic language in common, and are thus contradicting yourself in the very same phrase in which in make your claim.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Still, there are lessons to be learned from APL which could benefit even the most cutting edge technologies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Agreed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I, too, agree. The Apl community I was privileged to join in 1972, was one of the most educational environments I have encountered in my career. And while it has always been small, its core members undoubtedly have a lot that they could contribute. If there is any interest, I would be pleased to try to find some of the following and try to recruit them to post here. I think we would be the better for it. Specifically:

      </ul>
      <p>
        For example: one of the lessons of UML is that it's a mistake to introduce aggregations or multiplicities early on. These are details which are added later. And yet, "object-oriented" languages force you to learn design patterns dedicated to dealing with these concepts. In APL, on the other hand, you can use the same code to deal with 1:1, 1:n, n:1, or n:n multiplicities (yes, n:n is really 1:1 multiplicity, but you wouldn't know that by the way you have to represent it in a classic OO language). n:m (outer join) multiplicities take a slightly different approach, but we're talking a minor syntactic difference here, not a design pattern which requires the creation of several different classes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This seems interesting but I'm not 100% sure of what you're driving at.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you look at a body of OO code (like .NET, or J2EE), and compare it to a body of APL code (like what you see at <a href="http://www.kx.com/download/documentation.htm,">http://www.kx.com/download/documentation.htm,</a> you can't help but realize that there are lessons about <a href="CodeReuse.html">CodeReuse</a> which we've yet to integrate into the mainstream.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm willing to believe you, but which lessons are those?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The lesson is the point above about n:n multiplicity being the same thing as 1:1, 1:n, n:1, et al, in APL. In Java, operations on an Array of Foos are different from operations on a single Foo. In APL and members of its family, the code doesn't change at all when you move from a single Foo to a collection of Foos. It's a striking and powerful difference.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's certainly a powerful feature of APL and its descendants, but how does it have anything to do with code reuse? --<a href="MarnenLaibowKoser.html">MarnenLaibowKoser</a>
