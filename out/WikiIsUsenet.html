        Wiki Is Usenet
      </h1>
      <p>
        Specifically, <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least that's the way it feels with all this <a href="OoVsRelational.html">OoVsRelational</a> <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> flying around...
      </p>

      <p>
        Somebody made here the assumption that <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> was, at some point, a place so much better than usenet, but it degraded to <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some would argue that wiki was becomming too clubby, attracting a filtered mindset. Plus, there are non-combative ways to clean up thread mess if you don't like it. It just takes elbow grease.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing can be further from the truth. Some areas of <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> (comp.lang.functional, comp.lang.scheme, comp.lang.ml) are still so much better than wiki in terms of substantive discussion, quality of content, technical relevance for programmers that use it as a source of inspiration, quality of contributors, etc. Wiki does have a better potential, too bad it was never fully realized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe a fair title should be Wiki Is Comp.Object .

        More proof:  AOL is now banning its users from <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>, just like how AOL is banned from here!
