        The first time I heard of XP was in September 1999, when <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> gave a lecture about it at Philips Research in Eindhoven (The Netherlands). I knew him from <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>s, but at that time he talked about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> (never heard of at that time) and referenced the book of <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>. I like especially the articles in the book. The Refactoring itself is more like a dictionary. A Refactor browser for C++ (as discussed in the book and as shown for Smalltalk at the XP2000 conference) would be really handy but will probably only partially materialize because of the complexity of the language :-(.

        After the lecture, I found out that the XP2000 was organized in Sardinia, Italy. Met two of <a href="TheThreeExtremos.html">TheThreeExtremos</a> there. I also visited XP2002, XP2007 (Como) and XP2011 (Madrid).

        In February 2001, I gave my XP presentation (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xp-nl/files)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xp-nl/files)</a> at the Philips Software Conference and organized the XPGame (<a href="http://www.xp.be)">http://www.xp.be)</a> of VeraPeeters and PascalVanCauwenberghe.

        I wrote a paper for the XP/Agile 2004 conference in Calgary [ISBN: 3-540-22839-X], "An Agile CMM", describing how we managed to become CMM level 2 certified, while retaining our Agile way of working.
