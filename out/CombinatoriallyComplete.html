        Combinatorially Complete
      </h1>
      <p>
        A representation is <a href="CombinatoriallyComplete.html">CombinatoriallyComplete</a> if it doesn't rely on the order of its symbols to express its semantics. Ordinary integers are a good example. There is no information implicit in the permutations internal to the ZF representation of a number; 1+3 == 2+2 == 3+1 == 4 == {}{{}}{{}{{}}}{{}{{}}{{}{{}}}}. An example of a representation that is not <a href="CombinatoriallyComplete.html">CombinatoriallyComplete</a> is the AdjacencyMatrix of a graph.

        Hey, the ZFC 4 looks pretty cool when you write it out longhand like that, don't it? For those who ain't hip to that, you just start with the empty trip on <a href="MemesAreDigital.html">MemesAreDigital</a> which gives you the empty set for a universe - {} which will do for a one - then pull the same trick inside and outside that {}{{}} for a two, then do it to all the empties again to get  three {}{{}}{{}{{}}} ... and keep right on subdividing to make a four. You can pretend its rings or you can pretend its <a href="PowerSet.html">PowerSet</a>s, which amounts to the same thing for the (zero dimensional) scalars here.
      </p>

        Now we use a whole lot of information day to day, these here words included, that rely on permutations to express their semantics. The notion on <a href="MemesAreDigital.html">MemesAreDigital</a> would require us to find ways to quantize all these permutational birds into a <a href="CombinatoriallyComplete.html">CombinatoriallyComplete</a> representation ... because there's plainly nothing digital about this texty crap you're reading now ...
      </p>

        You might wonder, hey, how could I do that if I had more than one dimension to my number? Shucks, that's easy, <a href="LawsOfForm.html">LawsOfForm</a> shows you how, go look it up ...
