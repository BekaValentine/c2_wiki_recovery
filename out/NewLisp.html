        A new cross-platform dialect of <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> (a <a href="ModernCleanLisp.html">ModernCleanLisp</a>) which (allegedly) strips out lotsa cruft from <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, brings in more interesting features from <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>, and provides a standard and modern set of libraries for interfacing with the OutsideWorld.  Click on the link above for a LaundryList of features.

        To be fair, those items are only required for scheme, and <em>most</em> common lisp implementations lack first class continuations.  Still, I found newlisp pretty lacking in simple things like lexical scope (their claim is a crock -- newlisp has package prefixes, not lexical scope).  I wonder what other features of this language fall down under any scrutiny.  Anyway, nothing mzsheme doesn't have, nothing to see here...

        newLisp claims to have a unique memory management scheme, which they call "One Reference Only Memory Management".  For more info, see <a href="http://www.newlisp.org/MemoryManagement.html">http://www.newlisp.org/MemoryManagement.html</a>

        <em>This sounds like they have re-invented they way C does it -- just make the following replacements in their description and see what it sounds like:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Replace their "reference to memory object on the result stack" or "object not referenced by a symbol" with "function-local variable (on the stack)".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Replace "object referenced by a symbol" with "static or global variable".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Replace "higher order evaluation level is reached" with "the function returns".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That was my impression too, but NewLISP is slightly different.  It uses <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a>, so functions can reference any variable higher in the call stack, so there really are no "function-local variables".  It's more like assembly or Forth with manual memory management. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>
