        Anti Traffic

      <p>
        <a href="http://amasci.com/amateur/traffic/trafexp.html">http://amasci.com/amateur/traffic/trafexp.html</a> provides a method whereby you, personally, yes you, can reduce and often eliminate traffic. At a minimum you can convert your commute from stop 'n' go stress to a leisurely meander with hardly a tap on the brake.

      <p>
        <a href="AntiTraffic.html">AntiTraffic</a> has deep implications for <a href="LettingThingsSlide.html">LettingThingsSlide</a> too. If you regard the use of the brake as <a href="ManagementByCrisis.html">ManagementByCrisis</a>, and if you regard <a href="ManagementByCrisis.html">ManagementByCrisis</a> as something to prevent, then you can observe many situations in life in which you are working stop'n'go. By implementing <a href="AntiTraffic.html">AntiTraffic</a> as a time-management technique you can resolve these situations without effort.
