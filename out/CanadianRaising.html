        Canadian Raising
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the largest distinctions between American and Canadian pronunciations of words is what I understand is called "Canadian Raising". This is the alteration of the first vowel sound of a diphthong when the next consonant is a 'hard' one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction is made to some extent by most Americans I know too; the intensity of difference, and frequency of occurrence, goes down the further south the speaker lives (roughly speaking).
      </p>
      <p>
        At a guess, I'd enumerate "hard" consonants as ch, f, k (including hard c and q), p, sibilant s, and t. Some consonants seem never to follow these diphthongs in <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a> at all! Or at least I can't think of examples, so I can't classify them as "hard" or "soft" for purposes of this rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first vowel sound is "raised" (although I have no idea in what sense the linguists mean the term; if anything, I'd think of the sound as "lowered") in this context.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application is actually very consistent. One thing that obfuscates matters is that <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a> speakers are probably not used to thinking of their long i sound as a diphthong.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The diphthong ah-ee (long i sound) is unchanged before a "soft" consonant, as in "ride"; before a "hard" consonant it becomes uh-ee, or even (schwa)-ee. So a Canadian speaker pronounces "bite" very distinctly from "bide".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The diphthong aa-oo (ou as in "mount") is unchanged again before a "soft" consonant; before a "hard" consonant, it becomes eh-oo, uh-oo or (schwa)-oo. This sound is actually very hard for me to "decompose" and describe: while the first vowel is actually more of a schwa in this case (indistinct in sound), it is accented; the diphthong has a strong "attack" in sound. So "loud" is different from "lout".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (Disclaimer: observations below, not meant to be racist or offensive to Americans.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it is the difficulty in getting the second sound right that results in the common stereotype of the Canadian who speaks of being "oot and aboot" (see <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>, <a href="CanadianCulturalAssumption.html">CanadianCulturalAssumption</a>). Interestingly, though, I once tried to teach some American high school students the differences and get them to pronounce "light" in such a way that they'd blend in, and they couldn't get the hang of it. My experience is that my friends "up here" are a lot more versatile when it comes to picking up new vowel sounds. In high school, I found myself in situations where I was in mixed company with non-immigrant Canadians, non-immigrant Americans and immigrants, typically Asians; and found that I and my Canadian peers had a much easier time of pronouncing the foreign names like "Liu". As well, I can "fit in" with an American "accent" pretty well (although I'll probably be caught for saying "eh" instead of "huh", or other such details), but I can spot an American visitor (except perhaps those from border states or the Eastern Seaboard) to Toronto the first time s/he wants "ice" in a drink.

        I'm francophone so I'm used to thinking of long-i as a diphthong, and being bewildered by the notion that it isn't. Anyways, I learned English in Toronto but I don't notice the distinctions you mention above in my speech. -- RK
