        Safe Refactoring
      </h1>
      <p>
        Safe refactoring is when your refactoring tool doesn't mess up your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: If you rename a method, a good refactoring tool should check that the new
        name is not in conflict with some method already defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some refactoring tools don't care about these things. It may be quite dangerous
        to use them if your program is something more complicated than Hello World.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="RefactoringTools.html">RefactoringTools</a> are here now. I think it's time to start talking about
        this issue. Maybe a Rubicon II (see <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoringRubicon.html)">http://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoringRubicon.html)</a> for safe refactoring?
