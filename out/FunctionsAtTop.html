        Functions At Top
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was editing some perl code yesterday and the author had put the functions below the main code. I was aghast! How could someone do that?!? At least, the functions in question were factored out to make the code more readable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I asked the others in my group (who aren't software guys but they have written code) where they put their functions. They answered that they put their functions below their main code. Ick. That's just plain wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are there any languages that require functions to appear in code after they are called? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Comment? 
      </p>
