        An <a href="OpEd.html">OpEd</a>, or opinion/editorial, is an article in which the author states his opinion. It typically consists of a position, some evidence, and a call to action.  <em>I thought this stood for "open editorial", and was the section of the paper where reader comments are published.</em> Well, <a href="OpEd.html">OpEd</a>s usually <em>are</em> published in their own part of the paper, but I thought that on-staff people could write them too...

        <dt>Acronym "<strong>OP-ED</strong>"</dt>
        <dd>Definition: <em>"Opinion-Editorial" (newspaper article opposite the editorial page)</em> -- from <a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?Acronym=op-ed">http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?Acronym=op-ed</a> (The "Acronym Finder")</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <em>I believe Op-Ed comes from the fact that they are/were usually placed OPposite the EDitorial page. The editorial page contained the opinions of the paper's editorial staff; the op-eds, on the facing page, gave the signed opinion pieces of other authors.</em>

        The responses can be of only a few kinds: contributory agreement, constructive disagreement, thoughtful consideration (which consists of distinguishing different contexts and then agreeing in some of them and disagreeing in others), and outright <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>s.

        On wiki, sometimes an <a href="OpEd.html">OpEd</a> will prompt the creation of whole separate pages for the opposing point of view.
      </p>

        When there is broad consensus, <a href="OpEd.html">OpEd</a>s can be refactored into <a href="PatternMode.html">PatternMode</a> or <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>, but often they remain in <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, and die when they scroll off the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page.

        One of the hard things about writing an <a href="OpEd.html">OpEd</a> is <a href="ChoosingWikiNames.html">ChoosingWikiNames</a>.

        Another hard thing is trying to change people's minds. You can't do it. <a href="MyMindIsMadeUp.html">MyMindIsMadeUp</a>. :-)
