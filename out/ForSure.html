          	Anonymity really matters on Wiki
        </li>
        <li>
          	My <a href="IdentityInferenceEngine.html">IdentityInferenceEngine</a> isn't up to scratch.

      </ul>
      <p>
        See for example the way quick diff to three Wiki pages that matter to me (for some reason) just looked around 11.35 GMT 8th April 2003:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          	<a href="http://clublet.com/c/c/why?WdWhyIsNowClosed">http://clublet.com/c/c/why?WdWhyIsNowClosed</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          	<a href="http://clublet.com/c/c/why?WdIdentityInferenceEngine">http://clublet.com/c/c/why?WdIdentityInferenceEngine</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          	<a href="http://clublet.com/c/c/why?WdForumForChristianTopicsFailedMiserably">http://clublet.com/c/c/why?WdForumForChristianTopicsFailedMiserably</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thanks to 62.64.201.151 for the first two and to 62.64.229.132 for the best joke there. Any disclosures possible that could help me on the identity mystery front? 
      </p>
      <p>
        The "jokes" are now flowing thick and fast, as expected. h00095b006144.ne.client2.attbi.com seems to be the strong, silent type, at least around 13.05 GMT:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          	<a href="http://clublet.com/c/c/why?WdWhyClublet">http://clublet.com/c/c/why?WdWhyClublet</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are of course some significant changes to the page since I last touched it, a few minutes before. 
        People are of course entitled to their differing opinions about <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a>, JesusChrist or <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a> on Wiki but this by now traditional way of expressing them is, quite simply, cowardly. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        Richard, may I gently suggest that you take a break for awhile? It appears to me that you are attributing malice to some combination of

      <ul>
        <li>
           Well-intentioned edits
        </li>
        <li>
           Random page collisions

           Perfectly reasonable unsigned opinion

        When you begin accusing participants of being "cowardly", I believe you cross a line of civility that demeans you and this community. Please stop. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>

        I stand by the word cowardly Tom. For some reason some people seem to be shit scared of what might happen with or through <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a>, if you'll forgive the use of the vernacular. But that nasty accusation does not include any named individual, least of all yourself. And of course there have been plenty of innocent accidents, in the last three days and the last three years. Enough to last a lifetime indeed. Much to my surprise though I for one still seem to be alive. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        <em>You broadened the focus of your displeasure to include </em><a href="KathyBracy.html">KathyBracy</a> and myself (<a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>) in the exchanges on this wiki's <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a> page. You inappropriately chastised me for not signing my contribution, which you then moved from its original location two times. I find your response to Kathy the epitome of what I mean by "cheeky".<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You may stand by your choice of words if you like. I, in turn, stand by my observation that in so doing you demean yourself and this community. -- </em><a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

      <p>
        I totally accept that I have a truly abysmal tendency to be cheeky, even in the very worst and most inappropriate circumstances, such as when someone is very insistently trying to wind up the whole of a community about the likelihood of my premature death unless I mend my ways. For this I am truly, truly ... at ease with myself and frequently chuckling out loud. I just can't do the apology thing about being cheeky I'm afraid.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not true that I chastised you into signing back on <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a>. An email would have done fine. I was being cheeky though. I admit that fully. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>
