        Tighter App And Database Integration
      </h1>
      <p>
        One common complaint about using existing RDBMS is that they are not tightly woven with application languages and/or frameworks. A lot of adaption and conversion code and configuration must be provided in order to communicate between each.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proposed solutions include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use an RDBMS that has an app language built in. Examples include:

        Most such products tend to be either "client-weak" or "server-weak". Client-weak means that the tool is mostly server bound and has poor client-side tools for a "rich client experience" (powerful GUI). Server-weak means it does not scale well in terms of transaction volume and reliability, such as A.C.I.D. compliance.
      </p>

        Perhaps it's asking too much to do well in both database-land and GUI-land. Tools that try to be everything have a high failure rate as far as market acceptance.

        <em>Delphi has always done well because it is both a DB and GUI tool (data aware components and gui-data binding components). Visual Basic has also had data aware components. Aren't these the keys to their success? Problem I see in Delphi is people still use XML, INI files, string lists, and arrays, when they could be using a database built in as if it was a native type inside the language. Similar problems in C++, php, perl where people use hashlists, associative arrays, and containers without having any relational tools in the language natively. Possibly </em><a href="MicrosoftLinq.html">MicrosoftLinq</a> tries to solve some of it in <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>, but LINQ is not likely theoretically sound or based on enough relational theory.<em> </em>
