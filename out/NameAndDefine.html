        Name And Define
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> usually consists of a name, expressed using a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> and is, when thoughtfully used, a Concept which is defined, expanded and linked to related <a href="WikiPages.html">WikiPages</a> or externalLinks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a sense a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> is a Definition, not in a dictionary sense, but in the sense of setting the Value of the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> used in the Title.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a usefulArtifact. It can increase the value of the collection of wikiPages found in a wiki by relating and associating the value of each page such that the value of the whole is more than the sum of the value of each.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this relationship, care needs to be exercised in naming and forming of each page, including what is added and what is trimmed from the page to <a href="RaiseTheWikiPagePotential.html">RaiseTheWikiPagePotential</a>.  It is important also to associate and link the page to the other parts of the wiki to form the wiki "Whole". 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is accomplished best when you participate and <a href="ContributePagesFromYourExpertise.html">ContributePagesFromYourExpertise</a>, and exercise in dialogue with others who are subjectMatterExperts (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Matter_Expert)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Matter_Expert)</a> as well as to link to Locales which expand upon and clarify what is found within the page.
