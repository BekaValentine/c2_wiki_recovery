        Conciseness Conjecture
      </h1>
      <p>
        From <a href="OnExpressivePower.html">OnExpressivePower</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Programs in </em>'more expressive<strong> programming languages, that use additional facilities in a sensible manner contain </strong>fewer programming patterns<em>' than equivalent programs in less expressive programming languages</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The above observation/conjecture belongs to <a href="MatthiasFelleisen.html">MatthiasFelleisen</a>, and I think it is very important to keep in mind when discussing issues related to programming languages, design and patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example? Othwerwise i don't know what it means. Words like sensible and 
        facilities sap a statement of meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="OnExpressivePower.html">OnExpressivePower</a> has a very nice example just before this conjecture. I think that we should duplicate the effort here only if we find a more illustrative example or if we find counterexamples. The assertion being made is that patterns in the code are a bad thing.<em> </em>

        This is a link to a link that is a long paper. A good example here would be useful.

        <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> said "Peter Norvig found that 16 of the 23 patterns in Design Patterns were 'invisible or simpler' in Lisp.", which sounds like a rather similar notion. <a href="http://www.norvig.com/design-patterns/">http://www.norvig.com/design-patterns/</a>
