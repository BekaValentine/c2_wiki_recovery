        Tom founded <a href="ProductivityProductsInternational.html">ProductivityProductsInternational</a>, later to become <a href="StepStone.html">StepStone</a>, where he and <a href="BradCox.html">BradCox</a> developed and took <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> to market.

      <p>
        Tom is a long time admirer of the Macintosh. (He designed parts of his Connecticut home on one.) Tom must have been proud to see <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a> adopt Objective-C, though it doesn't seem to have made him rich.
