        An abelian group is a commutative <a href="AlgebraicGroup.html">AlgebraicGroup</a>. In other words, for all g,h in G, g*h = h*g.

        A friend of mine had the project of enumerating all possible Mathematical Fruit Jokes. I think he found four in total, but I can only remember three; this one, "What's yellow and equivalent to the axiom of choice?" and (more obscure) "What's green and determined up to isomorphism by its first Chern class?". -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>

        Max Zorn's grandson, Eric, is a reporter for the Chicago Tribune. He wrote a touching piece on Max after his grandfather died. He also wrote the often-pirated piece <em>Math Riots Prove Fun Incalculable</em> after the initial announcement of Wiles' <a href="FermatsLastTheorem.html">FermatsLastTheorem</a> proof.
