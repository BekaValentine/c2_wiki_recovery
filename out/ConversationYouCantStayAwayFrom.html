        "I stumbled across the notion of a <a href="ConversationYouCantStayAwayFrom.html">ConversationYouCantStayAwayFrom</a>. Whenever one of these starts, you pause at the doorway and linger, hoping to take part in
        it. For me it started when I was designing hardware... I went past a doorway and heard/saw them discussing a look-ahead typing interface ...
