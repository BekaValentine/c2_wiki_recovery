        Quantum Computers Arent Turing Equivalent
      </h1>
      <p>
        They're not even <a href="NonDeterministicTuringMachine.html">NonDeterministicTuringMachine</a>-equivalent. They're SupraTuring. TienKieu showed in 2002 that quantum computers can solve Turing-incomputable problems including the Halting Problem. See <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110136">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110136</a> for details.

        <em>It should be noted that the conclusions of that paper have been challenged; go to the link for the paper above to read more.</em>

        Yes, and the challenge has been refuted. Looks like we're really through the looking glass on this one.

        The abstract says
      </p>
      <p>
        '[...] where quantum continuous variables and quantum adiabatic evolution are employed.'
      </p>
      <p>
        This means, that it employs <a href="InfiniteNonDeterminism.html">InfiniteNonDeterminism</a>, which really <em>is</em> beyond <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a>, but I doubt, that 'quantum continuous variables' are physically possible.
