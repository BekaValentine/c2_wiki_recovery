        <dd>When inheriting from a class and over-riding one of its methods, how should you constrain the types accepted as arguments and returned as results according to the method being over-ridden?</dd>
      </dl>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Say you have a class Foo, which has a method bar(). Method bar() takes an argument of type middle_type, and returns a value of type middle_type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you make a subclass of Foo called SubFoo, and you override bar(). What types can the new bar() take? What types can it return?
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at return types first: we want to be able to substitute SubFoo where existing code expects Foo, so it needs to return things of type middle_type, or of some subtype (e.g. sub_type). This should be pretty obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for what types our new bar() can take: One answer is: bar() can take only things of type middle_type. You can't declare it to take sub_type, and you can't declare it to take super_type. This is called <em>invariance</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another answer: bar() can only be declared to take things that are a <em>subtype</em> of middle_type - so middle_type is OK, and sub_type is OK, but super_type is out. This is called <em>covariance</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the third answer: bar() can only be declared to take things that are a <em>supertype</em> of middle_type - so any of middle_type, and super_type may be passed to bar(), but sub-type is not allowed. This is called <em>contravariance</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Covariance seems to jibe with our notion that subclasses are more specialized, less general than their superclasses. So you might have a Collection class which takes and returns Objects; you could subclass it to make a FooCollection class which takes and returns Foos (where Foo is a subclass of Object).
      </p>
      <p>
        Contravariance sounds kind of counterintuitive at first, but it's actually just analogous to the famous advice about implementing protocols: "Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send." So just as you have to <em>return</em> a subtype of the original bar()'s return type, you have to <em>accept</em> any supertype of whatever the original bar() accepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your type system enforces contravariance of parameters, then it can tell at compile time whether your code is typesafe (cf. <a href="SatherLanguage.html">SatherLanguage</a>, <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a>). If it enforces covariance (Cf. cf. <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>), it can't really do that, but it can make some good guesses (cf. <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a>) - though Eiffel are known to crash when it guesses wrong.

        Covariance and contravariance : conflict without a cause<br/>

        From the Abstract: (<a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/castagna94covariance.html)">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/castagna94covariance.html)</a> (Full text is on <a href="http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~mlewis/CSCI3294-F01/Papers/p431-castagna.pdf.)">http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~mlewis/CSCI3294-F01/Papers/p431-castagna.pdf.)</a>

        In type-theoretic research on object-oriented programming, the issue of "covariance versus contravariance" is a topic of continuing debate. In this short note we argue that covariance and contravariance appropriately characterize two distinct and independent mechanisms. The so-called contravariance rule correctly captures the <em>subtyping</em> relation (that relation which establishes which sets of functions can replace another given set in <em>every context</em>). A covariant relation, instead, characterizes the <em>specialization</em> of code (i.e., the definition of new code which replaces old definitions <em>in some particular cases</em>). Therefore, covariance and contravariance are not opposing views, but distinct concepts that each have their place in object-oriented systems. Both can (and should) be integrated in a type-safe manner in object-oriented languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also show that the independence of the two mechanisms is not characteristic of a particular model but is valid in general, since covariant specialization is present in record-based models, although it is hidden by a deficiency of all existing calculi that realize this model. As an aside, we show that the lambda-calculus can be taken as the basic calculus for both an overloading-based and a record-based model. Using this approach, one not only obtains a more uniform vision of object-oriented type theories, but in the case of the record-based approach, one also gains multiple dispatching, a feature that existing record-based models do not capture.

        This has some parallel with the example of bounded wildcards for Java generics, from Joshua Bloch's 2006 <a href="JavaOne.html">JavaOne</a> presentation:
      </p>
      <code>
        public interface Shop<T> {<br/>
        T buy();<br/>
        void sell(T item);<br/>
        void sell(Collection<? extends T> lot);<br/>
        void buy(int numItems, Collection<? super T> myStuff);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // You can buy a bunch of models from the train shop<br/>
        modelTrainShop.buy(5, myModels);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // You can sell your train set to the model shop<br/>
        modelShop.sell(myTrains);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Basic rule:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           use <strong>extends</strong> when the method will read from the parameter
        </li>
        <li>
           use <strong>super</strong> when the method will write to the parameter
        </li>
      </ul>
