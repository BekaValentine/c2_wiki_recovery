        Pair Planning
      </h1>
      <p>
        Like <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, using a fellow human to bounce ideas off of while coming up with a plan.  This technique is not, as far as I know, acknowledged by name any where.  It is, however, something I've done for a long time; I just didn't know what name to give it until someone mentioned it in conjunction with <a href="LetYourLogsBecomeYourPlans.html">LetYourLogsBecomeYourPlans</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steps I follow when <a href="PairPlanning.html">PairPlanning</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Define the problem or solution
        </li>
        <li>
           Find a person to pair with
        </li>
        <li>
           Agree on the definition of the problem or solution
        </li>
        <li>
           Brainstorm an approach
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some things to think about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Like with <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, one person is driving at a time; but, that responsibility can be turned over to the other at any time
        </li>
        <li>
           No arguments: refine ideas, don't debate them
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't redefine the problem/solution after its been agreed on, unless both of you agree that your definition is broken first
        </li>
        <li>
           Focus on approach, not implementation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There's definitely more, but I think many people do a lot of this by nature.  Perhaps formalizing it would help with productivity and communication within a team or ProjectTeam.
