        Net Works
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Networking" has been given a bad name by the sort
        of idiot who hands out a business card to his dentist,
        her obstetrician, their seatmate on the rollercoaster...
        "Oh, I'm networking," the idiot says, when explaining
        its appalling behavior.

        In fact, true <a href="NetWorks.html">NetWorks</a> are an essential part of creating excellent software teams.  True <a href="NetWorks.html">NetWorks</a> contain  people who share your recognition of the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>.  You may not like everybody in your network, but you admire their work, and they respect yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every project I work on contains one or two people whom I admire, and who serve as personal catalysts: when I work with them, I'm faster, smarter, and better-informed. I  enjoy working with such people. When spaces open up on my
        next team, I recommend former co-workers, not because
        they may someday do me a reciprocal favor, but because
        they will be doing me an immediate favor by joining my new team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I have pulled friends into jobs, and they
        me, 'not' for the sake of good lunchtime gossip, but because
        I trust them to do good work.  Excellent co-workers raise the bar: they force me to be excellent in order to keep up.

        <a href="NetWorks.html">NetWorks</a> are invaluable for <a href="StayingCurrent.html">StayingCurrent</a>; when I need
        information outside my specialty, or an opinion on an article I haven't read, I ask a member of my
        network.  Again, this is not logrolling; it is delegation. Hello.
