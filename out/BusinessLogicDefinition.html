        Business Logic Definition
      </h1>
      <p>
        Business logic is that portion of an enterprise system which determines how data is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Transformed and/or calculated.  For example, business logic determines how a tax total is calculated from invoice line items.
        </li>
        <li>
           Routed to people or software systems, aka workflow.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Business logic should be distinguished from presentation logic and business rules:
      </p>
      <p>
        Presentation logic is that portion of an enterprise system which determines how data will be displayed or reported.
      </p>
      <p>
        Business rules are formal expressions of business policy, e.g., "all invoices since 2013 will be charged a Value Added Tax of 20.0% on VAT-applicable goods," or "negative dollar amounts shall always be shown in red on financial documents."  As such, business rules can determine both business logic and presentation logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may help to consider a simple but illustrative example like computer chess:  The game itself, i.e., the board and the pieces, their movements, and how the rules of the game are handled <strong>independent of any display or user interaction</strong> is business logic.  Business logic is often exposed -- and only exposed -- as an API.  Presentation logic determines how the board and pieces are displayed, and translates user interaction (e.g., mouse clicks and the like) into moves.  Presentation logic interacts with business logic via the business logic API.

        <em>The chess scenario doesn't help the tricky scenarios so far. For example, a given report can be viewed as a grid of cells, much like a chess-board, and the "logic" may determine which cell has which value. But some seem to consider that "presentation logic", perhaps because there are many ways to display the same info, and a particular report is just one of many (one of many sorts or groupings or column combo's).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A "given report" is presentation logic, by definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Please elaborate, especially in terms of how its different from chess logic. I see no significant conceptual difference.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It isn't.  Your misunderstanding of presentation logic vs business logic appears to apply equally to both.  Do not confuse the presentation of the chessboard with its internal representation.  In other words, a "grid of cells" is how the data is presented, so it's presentation logic.  How the data is generated and manipulated may have nothing to do with a "grid of cells" -- it might be in a linked list.  A "grid of cells" is how the chessboard is presented, so it's presentation logic.  How the data is generated and manipulated may have nothing to do with a "grid of cells" -- it might be in a linked list. Etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We could implement the report via linked lists also. It's just not deemed the best model in most cases.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's irrelevant; I mention it only as an example of the distinction between how something is displayed (presentation logic) vs how it is generated and manipulated (business logic).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Then find a better example. I see no significant or useful conceptual difference between chess computations and report cell computations.</em>

        <em></em><a href="ClassificationIsTough.html">ClassificationIsTough</a>. It's best to focus on practical maintenance patterns rather than get bogged down with classification-mania. You are over-thinking it and making a mess in the process.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The industry seems to have no problem with these distinctions, and my students and colleagues grasp them readily and intuitively.  If you don't understand, I suspect I can't help you.  The "mess" is your own to deal with.
      </p>

        <em>Your difficulty in turning such notions into clear-cut rules suggests the problem is on your side. With enough examples, people can "fit" things into the "proper" categories via the typical features of neural-net-based technologies, such as fitting/predicting/mirroring the teacher's notions. But that's not good enough for definition; that's merely pattern matching based on a sample set. I've done that successfully many times to score better on exams, but its not proper/complete reductionism of concepts. One expects things like, "A chess computation has property foo while report cell computation lacks property foo, and property foo is a necessary requirement per rule 7" or whatnot. That's not asking too much.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's been turned into definitions and an example at the top of this page.  Your difficulty in turning such clear-cut rules into notions suggests the problem is on your side.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They are defined on vague words. We have gone round and round on "determines" for example, without clarity forming. If you think your def is clear, then we'll just have to part ways and </em><a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a>. I see vagueness and flip-flopping.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You may need to spend more time working on developing enterprise systems, in a variety of areas -- not just reporting -- before these things become clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So then I'll "just feel" what is what? Even "Enterprise software" (</em><a href="EnterpriseApplication.html">EnterpriseApplication</a>) is vague. How fitting. Often it's a buzzword for those who want to puff up their resume.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever it is, your response is more evidence that you work outside of it.  When you've worked on -- and been responsible for -- all of the first twelve bullet points under <a href="EnterpriseApplication.html">EnterpriseApplication</a>, I can guarantee (yes, <strong>guarantee</strong>) you'll appreciate the distinction between business logic and presentation logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's a non-answer, and doesn't help the definition along even if it was true.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That may be the case, but given myself and others have tried multiple times to explain what is seemingly obvious to us -- and obvious to much of the industry, it seems -- I can only suggest that more experience may be needed in order to appreciate the context.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If it was "obvious" you'd be able form a clear-cut definition. You've taken no formal survey so we can't verify it's consistent across persons.

      </p>
      <p>
        I've been around since before VAXen and have used punch cards.  I've worked and been responsible for every aspect of <a href="EnterpriseApplication.html">EnterpriseApplication</a> development.  I've managed IT departments and accounting departments.  I've been an IT consultant to everything from one-man businesses to multi-national corporations.  You don't know what you are talking about.  I have thirty years of industry experience.

        <em>Anyhow If separation is not useful for small and medium-sized applications, but only "big expensive" projects, that's useful information. Would you agree to that?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Separation is <strong>always</strong> useful.  For small projects and <strong>only</strong> small projects -- e.g., those written in an afternoon and used for a week before being deleted -- it is perhaps not economical to do anything but bang out bad code as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As I've mentioned somewhere below, I agree separation is useful, but not necessarily on biz-versus-presenation. Our current code is generally 2D such that we only have one primary category we can separate on. If we waste it on one, then we don't have it for another splitting category. I'm just trying to spend complexity wisely. -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect that might work well for developing data entry and reporting applications, i.e., working entirely in the presentation logic domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Everything is "data entry and reporting". A video game gets "data entry" from the joy stick and "reports" the state of the model on the screen. That's not a useful phrase.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The phrase "data entry and reporting" invariably refers to <strong>business</strong> data entry and reporting.  Google for the phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The definition of "business" has fuzzy edges. Anyhow, the phrase implies zero processing beyond canned report features, which is false. Apps I work on usually have a lot of domain-specific business logic. It's a continuous line between "small" biz apps and </em><a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a>/expensive biz apps. I see no useful hard boundary.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My only distinction between big and small apps was that some small apps might be sufficiently urgent and disposable to not be worth any effort to make them good, i.e., bang them out as quickly as possible.  Could you provide an example of the sort of domain-specific business logic you work on? 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's also continuous. </em><a href="BusinessLogicDefinitionDiscussion.html">BusinessLogicDefinitionDiscussion</a> asks the same question about examples.<em></em>

        It does indeed, and I think answers would be helpful.

        "[A]ll invoices since 2013 will be charged a Value Added Tax of 20.0% on VAT-applicable goods"
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How is that conceptually different than "all invoices since 2013 will be marked with footnote #7 on report X"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A tax total exists whether it's presented or not.  "Footnote" and "report" are, by definition, presentation.  Neither are calculated, retrieved or stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Routing packages or bills is really different from </em>'routing photons<em>'? I don't see the logic or practicality in discriminating against photons. Or consider a rule that says "disclaimer X shall be displayed on all bills containing Y". If that ain't biz logic, then I am a monkey's uncle.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Photons are irrelevant at this level, much as wood cells are irrelevant at the level of house architecture.

        <em>3rd scenario: you have a menu with 7 items, but 3 of them are to only be shown to "administrative" users and hidden to regular users.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Menu" and "shown to" clearly indicate presentation logic.  Neither are calculated, retrieved or stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What do you mean by "calculated"? Do you mean a numeric value? In this case it's controlled by a Boolean calculation, which shouldn't get less rank than numbers. And I thought you suggested elsewhere it's not about "storage". The rule scenarios above would typically be a </em>'business decision<em>', not a "presentation" (artist/graphic designer) decision.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not about storage, but use of storage as a data source can be evidence of data manipulation, which is business logic.  Business decisions are supported by or implemented by business logic.  "Presentation (artist/graphic designer) decisions" are presentation logic, by definition.

      <p>
        <em>Evidence? That's still not very specific.</em>

        <em>And why not?  It's being used in its generally-accepted manner.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Generally Accepted" is not measurable and not documented. There is no committee that determines such; and as you should realize by now, different <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> have different views of what is "typical" or "normal" for the industry(s) such that relying on those being stable or accepted for definitive statements is asking far too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We can identify "generally accepted" on this Wiki as being that with which everyone agrees, except you.</em>

      <p>
        I see very little conceptual or organizational reason to consider A and B very different "kinds" of "things":
      </p>
      <code>
        // A:<br/>
        if (complex_decision_calculation()==true) {<br/>
        display_thingy();<br/>
        }<br/>
        // B:<br/>
        if (complex_decision_calculation()==true) {<br/>
        route_package_to_foo();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Again, routing photons versus routing packages is merely a <strong>media difference</strong>. It's old-fashioned to consider them different where physical and bits or electrons are classified and thought of differently. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Whilst there may be a philosophical similarity between emitting photons and calculating tax, from a pragmatic point of view it makes sense to distinguish presentation logic from business logic.  They are treated as distinct because the distinction has a direct impact on systems architecture and design.  Business logic is wholly independent of display mechanisms, so it does not need to consider user interface issues -- thus, an entire area of design complexity need not be considered.  Likewise, presentation logic does not need to consider calculation and data routing, but it does need to consider user interfaces and user devices -- such as mobile vs desktop, or browser vs custom client, or all of these at once.  As a result, business logic tends to run on servers -- in DBMSs and application servers.  Presentation logic tends to run on clients -- in browsers and mobile and desktop devices.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sorry, I still find that nebulous. "Wholly independent" is an extreme criteria. Some interdependency is common and likely and could easily change such that it shouldn't be a pivot-able characteristic.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You seem to be mixing display/presentation with your business logic, but that doesn't mean they're the same. And while 'business logic' may be somewhat vague (as many definitions are, including 'business'), it's still practical.]

      <p>
        <strong>"Business rule"</strong> and "business logic" are typically used interchangeably. Does anyone propose they mean different things in practice? Business rule is usually used to refer a specific feature, request, or activity; while business logic is usually used to refer to sets of business rules or the general concept. But, this is only a tendency and not a solid rule (no pun intended).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Business rule and business logic are only used interchangeably by those who do not know the difference.  I've rarely seen them confused.  Business rules are statements of business policy.  Business logic is code that executes the aspect of business rules that calculates, transforms and routes data.  Presentation logic is code that executes the aspect of business rules that displays data to observers.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You are presenting false rigor. There is no force enforcing or declaring a central definition. At least not one that anybody pays attention to.

      </p>
      <p>
        If it's defined by "typical use", then "by those who do not know the difference" is irrelevant. Definitions are usually defined by usage, even stupid usage, as "quantum leap" demonstrates. And I observe "typical use" of differently. We'll have to <a href="AgreeToDisagree.html">AgreeToDisagree</a> on how it's actually used in practice.

        Working Definition 2
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider the "presentation" to be issues that are not primarily decided for domain reasons. Which "cells" of a report have asterisks or footnote markers is most likely determined by domain issues, for example, and are thus tied to "business logic". The fonts and colors of a report are not. If a presented element can be changed <strong>without hurting or changing domain meaning</strong>, then it's probably only "presentation". -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How does that differ from "presentation logic is that portion of an enterprise system which determines how data will be displayed or reported"?  Your "which 'cells' of a report have asterisks or footnote markers is most likely determined by domain issues" is another way of saying that presentation logic is determined by business rules.  In other words, as I wrote above, "presentation logic is code that executes the aspect of business rules that displays data to observers."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A computation that determines if a given cell gets an asterisk is BOTH business logic and presentation logic. Your description appears to exclude anything remotely related to presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A "cell" in a report is presentation.  A report is presentation, because a report doesn't transform or route data.  It displays it to observers.  Therefore it is presentation logic, based on a business rule to "show <x> with asterisks on report <r> if <y> occurs."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, it's routing photons. To make a distinction is old-world thinking and limiting and arbitrary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, it's a reasonable way of partitioning development.  Blending presentation logic and business logic complicates development and maintenance, because distinct concerns are tangled unnecessarily.  It's like embedding style directives in HTML.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You haven't demonstrated/explained in any usable detail why it overall "complicates development". Anyhow, this topic is primarily about definitions, not partitioning practices. Let's not rekindle that fight here.

           It's the domain that intertwines them, not the designer. You are artificially de-interwining something that is inherently intertwined.

Without <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> studies, it's hard to empirically analyze such. Further, separation is a matter of degree. Separation via function is "weaker" separation than separation via file, for example. It's not all or nothing.

           System? If I "print" to a PDF or HTML file, it's not physically leaving the system. Plus, it's often useful to view "system" in a fractal sense in that each function/object/module/app is its own mini-system to feeds to and from other mini-systems. Hard-partitioning based on a certain level size creates both conceptual and actual reuse problems.

           Some HTML pages are generated merely for indexing systems to scan. (It may not always be ethical, but that's another issue.) My point is there is very little reason to make a hard-wired partition between machine and people as the target. For example, if people complain they want to customize the look-and-feel of a report, then you stop giving them a formatted report and instead generate CSV and let them or their batch processes grab and re-shuffle it as needed. This is a fairly common change (or at least generate both a report and a data file). We shouldn't have to rearrange all our code just because we switched it to send to machines instead of printers. <strong>Transformation for usage by another process is a common activity.</strong> For example, a given API expects inputs in a certain way and we have to make a little conversion interface or activities to give the API the info in the format/way it wants. Those of us who write a lot of "glue" code spend a lot of time doing just that: converting between sub-systems that "want" data in different ways. It's not conceptually really different than adapting info for human usage: it's just another sub-system that wants things a certain way. I see very little utility in making a blunt distinction between machine users and human users, other than the fact that the latter usually requires more effort to satisfy. It's the same thing, just more of it. -t

           <em>The "someone" can be an external system.  A handy way to distinguish business logic and presentation logic is to note that presentation logic is essentially about formatting.  Business logic is essentially about calculations on business data and state changes.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Formatting" matters to systems also. For example, a given device may want info row-wise when we currently have it column-wise. Thus we have to "flip it" for the other process. It's not human, but it still wants information "formatted" a certain way. Same with adapting our info into API's: the API's want things given to it in a certain way: it cannot just magically transform the current representation we have on it's own. It has to be "reformatted" for the API.  Again, to make a distinction between humans and other systems is rather arbitrary and probably inflexible.

      <ul>

           But there's no reason to hard-wire a distinction between and internal and external system either. It's just more of a pain to prepare for external systems (human or machines). Effort is an arbitrary thing to partition by. And again, the distinction between "adapting" and "formatting" is fuzzy and continuous, as already described. You seemed to ignore that point.

           I should point out that in custom biz apps I see, very little "calculation" actually happens. Most of the logic is about routing and "switches", toggling features and presentation on/off, etc. and filtering transfers between sub-systems (including "output"). It's a lot of conditionals and very little numeric math.

           [An algorithm isn't a general category, and domain-specific procedures aren't distinguished from them by being instances of that category. Your correspondent in fact implies that an algorithm is characterised by its ability to solve a general category of <em>problems</em>, as previously noted: <a href="AstarSearch.html">AstarSearch</a> is an algorithm that solves a general category of path-finding problems, and it may be applied whenever any such path-finding problem arises. A domain-specific procedure, being domain-specific, does not solve a general category of problems. Indeed, a domain-specific procedure will usually solve only exactly one problem. "If a customer orders more than $300 worth in a year and has bought at least 3 items from List X, then they get a coupon for 10% of their yearly total" solves only the problem of "should a customer with the following sales records receive a coupon?", not a general category of problems. -DavidMcLean]

We might describe "if (tax_rate && total>0) tax = total * tax_rate" as an algorithm for calculating tax, and it certainly would be.  In the context of this debate, I'm sure Top has implemented plenty of the latter form of algorithm, and if I made it seem like I thought he hasn't, then I take it back.

           It's not of much use to characterize my design recommendations for "separation" if we cannot agree on how to describe what to separate. Statements such as "his development focus is almost entirely on presentation logic" is hard to verify unless we have a solid definition, which is apparently hard to come by. If the concept is fuzzy, which I believe it is, then that's yet another argument for being wary of unconditional separation design rules. Like I said before, we are paid to produce results for end users, not classify the universe. If classification has utility, I have no problem with relying it for design. But if it's fuzzy and/or produces no demonstratable economic benefit, then consider chucking it. Perhaps some of you are "classiholics", having an inborn urge or personality defect to classify everything, whether warranted or not. -t

               I interpret "determines how" as synonymous with "affects", and the rule indeed "affects" the output in this case, and thus triggers your def rule. You are just adding indirection with the above, but your def doesn't use any stated indirection as a cut-off mechanism to boot such out of the def rule scope.

               [Yes, "determines how data will be displayed" is equivalent to "affects how data will be displayed", but "which customer needs to renew his/her subscription" does not affect <em>how</em> data will be displayed; it only affects <em>what</em> data will be displayed. "which customer needs to renew his/her subscription" doesn't decide if needed-renewals should be shown using asterisks, or highlighting colours, or anything like that. It just decides whether a customer needs to renew a subscription. -DavidMcLean]

            <li>
               So you consider the existence versus non-existence of output of an item a different category than asterisks? I only see it as an "output granularity" issue.  The existence of an asterisk versus the existence of a piece of paper is just output granularity. Paper division is just a "big cell". It's too arbitrary of a difference. We could change the report to print multiple customers on one paper or have it one customer per sheet. We could consider the "output" the entire print stream, not just per sheet, and it's then no diff from asterisks. In short, "sheet" is an arbitrary difference maker. It affects the print stream. Further, asterisk is no more "how" than existence of a sheet. The asterisk font is "how", not mere existence.

               [Top, you still seem to be thinking "determines how data is displayed" means "solely determines the output". It doesn't. All logic in an application is involved in determining the output; this is trivially true because any logic not contributing to the system's output in some form does nothing of value. The key word, however, is that presentation logic only determines <em>how</em>, while business logic determines <em>what</em>. Business logic determines things like "this customer needs to renew his/her subscription", and presentation logic decides how that should be displayed. The existence of an asterisk on a report relies on both business and presentation logic; this does not mean that business logic is presentation logic. Whether customers are all printed as rows on one paper sheet or given their own separate paper sheets is presentation. The actual data shown is independent of whether it's shown on one sheet of paper or many, however, and it's also independent of whether asterisks or colour-highlighting were chosen to display a certain fact. -DavidMcLean]

The replacement example, "which customers need to renew their subscriptions", is much clearer. Note that we could certainly have "which customers should be marked with asterisks" = "does this customer need to renew a subscription?", yet this would still leave "which customers need asterisks" as presentation logic and "which customers need to renew" as business logic. -DavidMcLean]

           That's a rather <strong>arbitrary distinction</strong>. Some situation (condition) may be determined deep in the system. Whether such situation affects only printing or some activity can change over time. It's thus not maintenance-friendly because info may be used for only printing one period, for both printing and other purposes other times, and for only non-printing purposes yet another period as requirements change. Maybe postcards are sent out to special customers during a special sale, but this sale may not lost and nobody knows whether it will be used again.

Everything may change; if we put presentational info, like "an asterisk is wanted on this item", in our business-logic-level data structures, that inhibits change. Consider the case where the asterisk is originally shown if a customer needs to be sent a product-recall notice, then suppose there's a change, and now the asterisk is also shown if a customer's made a warranty claim. If you have fields customer.needsRecall and customer.madeWarrantyClaim, then you merely change your presentation logic: if customer.needsRecall or customer.madeWarrantyClaim then showAsterisk. If you have a field customer.needsAsterisk, you don't change your presentation logic (if customer.needsAsterisk then showAsterisk), but how will you calculate and generate the recall forms elsewhere in your application when you can't tell if customer.needsAsterisk means a recall or a warranty? -DavidMcLean]

Interactive facilities bring the business logic and the presentation logic closer together -- e.g., "when you press the "Who's Available" button, find out which employees haven't been allocated yet (business logic) and show them in a list at the side of the schedule grid (presentation logic) -- but they're still clearly defined and sharply delineated.</em>

Internal department metrics are another such area because one is trying to translate a manager's notions of his/her staff's "productivity" into something compute-able.

        "Produces" is vague. The steps and stages are many. If you have an objective algorithm to determine produces-ness, I invite you to document as an algorithm or a formula. "I know it when I see it" won't cut it.

        Also note that sometimes it's best to make a determination early in the process and other times later in the process. Efficiency, resource allocation, timeliness, concurrency issues, etc. all affect at what stage some determination is made, such as what gets included or marked on a report.

           But you are only focusing on one factor/metric: a service visit. If other factors are important, such as fuel efficiency, then THAT should be part of the evaluation model. From the consumer's perspective, total cost of ownership is a key metric, but also passenger/cargo space, and performance. If I'm missing OTHER key factors, please do identify them. I'm not censoring <em>other</em> metrics, but you need to be clear about what they are and justify their importance.

           <em>I'm focusing on one vital factor/metric: feasibility.  Using the car analogy (which is </em>'very<strong> apt), it simply isn't feasible or reasonable to combine the brake pads and air filter, as it simply isn't feasible or reasonable to combine functionality that is only related by likelihood of change.  Using </strong><a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a>s as a basis for <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> -- such that change is the only "concern" -- <strong>is</strong> purely a "service visit" (i.e., maintenance) issue.<em></em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't see how your car analogy maps to software. Engines are generally designed for constructability (easiest to manufacture and put together), maintainability, reliability, and efficiency.  If you put certain parts far apart from each other but they have to interact, then you need long control rods or electronic actuators (term?) to communicate motion or activity. These hurt both reliability and maintenance. But I don't know what you believe the software counterpart is exactly. Software doesn't wear out in the same sense that cars do. And "related" is generally multi-dimensional such that our grouping choices tend to be somewhat arbitrary anyhow because there are multiple interweaving grouping candidates and code text generally forces us to pick one over the others because it's linear (or 1.5D I'd say). We'd probably have to explore specific software specimen. And when you have RAM, "position" doesn't really mean much (although can affect machine performance). We can build 8D models in software if it serves our purpose, but the problem is that maintainers generally can only view 2 D's at a time. The constraints are too different in software to compare to cars.

      </ul>
      <ul>

           <em>The software analogies to "long control rods or electronic actuators" are function calls and inclusion dependencies.  Good </em><a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> results in minimal, loose coupling -- a few function calls, and one external module reference, for example.  The car analogy is the drivetrain coupling between the engine and transmission -- a single shaft.  That's because the transmission demonstrates high cohesion, as does the engine, but they are (relatively) loosely coupled with each other.  Breaking cohesion in order to, say, make it easier to change the clutch -- and the clutch is the high <a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a> item here -- would necessarily (vastly!) complicate the coupling between engine and transmission.  The same applies to software:  If we implement <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> based on <a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a>s rather than functional concerns, we would inevitably need far more complex coupling between components.<em></em>

However, at each point where change is bound to occur, simply extract the changeable code into a new function defined in a global Policy class (or module) and invoke it.

           I did NOT propose "undifferentiated code". That is flat false. I'm tempted to call it a straw-man. As pointed out elsewhere, we can only group code by one primary dimension. Spending that split on one factor wastes it for another. I choose my major divisions primarily around what I estimate as the likely maintenance patterns. Granted, there's no "free lunch" and sometimes one just has to know the shop's framework/conventions to know how and where to find and change things.

           I'm still having trouble translating between your car-speak and code comparisons. Like I said, RAM allows us not to need to care about "position", and we are limited to one primary dimension for grouping code so that related concerns must be forced apart because there are usually more than one. Anyhow, "bad coupling" would result in a poor maintainability score, although "coupling" has not been clearly and usefully defined. I suggest we explore specific examples; I doubt generalities will suffice and "coupling" is probably a messy <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> trap.

We've had enough stupid fads that fuck up designs, like the OOP hierarchical taxonomy fad or the expert system fad or the anti-factoring <a href="MirrorModel.html">MirrorModel</a> MVC and ORM fads, the CASE fad, etc. It's supposed to be the age of science, not the dark ages where the church tells you what to think. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It may be </em>'your<strong> opinion that "stupid fads ... fuck up designs", except there are a lot of us -- and this is indubitable -- who successfully use OOP hierarchies, MVC, ORM, and CASE tools.  None of them are perfect, of course -- nothing is, and there is no </strong><a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a> -- but they're often an improvement over what precedes them, or they effectively address a particular category of problems.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They work in some cases/situations, but the fad eras usually over-sell their scope and don't bother to research and document their benefits and drawbacks in terms of the alternatives.

      <p>
        That's why I seek empirical evidence and representative samples/scenarios. However, many suckers fall for the buzzword bingo show and it generates a fad.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps.  Or, maybe you're missing out on something good.  Just because it's a fad doesn't mean it's all bad.  People: "Have cake! Cake is tasty!" Top: "I'm not going to taste it -- it's a fad."</em>

        If I live to 200 years, maybe I'll have time to thoroughly try and test them all.

        [Does <a href="RealInformation.html">RealInformation</a> ever come into the picture or is <a href="BusinessLogic.html">BusinessLogic</a> only concerned with data? The definition at the top of the page starts with 'Business logic is that portion of an enterprise system which determines how data is:'. It mentions data specifically. Is this intentional or can information also somehow be included in the definition? Presentation logic usually adds context to the data being displayed and is therefore a common form of AdHocInformation. If information is generated inside the middle tier and is not displayed, this would be part of the <a href="BusinessLogic.html">BusinessLogic</a>. So information can be part of either section. Then what do you call it if you suddenly decide to show the middle tier information just as it is, in the UI with a <a href="RepresentationalUserInterface.html">RepresentationalUserInterface</a>? Would that be business logic or presentation logic?] --<a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>

           <em>I don't know what the distinction is between </em><a href="RealInformation.html">RealInformation</a>/information and data, so I can't answer the first two questions.  Any mechanism that displays information "just as it is" is presentation logic.  Data, on computer systems, is stored in various binary encodings so there is no "just as it is" that is directly displayable.  Making it visible on a printout or a screen (or audio, or lines on a plotter) requires presentation logic.<em></em>

        Everybody classifies stuff differently in their head.

        It's pretty clear by now that the concept or classification of "business logic" is <strong>vague</strong>, especially in relation to "presentation logic". Needs some work, guys. -t

        <em>No, it's </em>'really<strong> clear that </strong>you<em>' are not understanding the distinction between business logic and presentation logic. </em>

        You are right! I don't know whether it's me or it's you. I try to probe by asking questions and giving scenarios, but get contradictory answers. You just define vague words/phrases with yet more vague words/phrases. You are patching fuzz with fog. "I know it when I see it" is not good documentation. I read your statements 3 or more times and it's vague each time through.

        It appears to be cheating: if you save the results of a calculation in a database, then you call that calculation "business logic". But that's rather arbitrary. We may choose not the save it to a database but rather email it directly one day. The calculations are still there just as before, it's just that now different things are done with the result. I can define Zlob as anything that goes to device A, Hiffnag anything that goes to device B, etc. But that's not a very useful distinction for general design.

        Summary of Problems with Designing Around (Hard-Partitioning With) What's Done with Results:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           What a given result is used for could easily change over time. We don't want to have to re-group our logic when results are used for multiple or diff purposes over time. Shuffling code back and forth costs time and money and risks introducing bugs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Modular construction and task division generally dictate the module only solve the problem the module is designed for and that it shouldn't care what happens to the results outside the module. In other words, the module's internal structure should not be guided by <strong>external</strong> uses of the module (outside of the spec). Whether the output of a module assigned to me to build is used for printing postcards or firing slackers is not my concern as the module builder and I shouldn't design the module around such guesses. (In practice, it helps to know to fill in the fuzzy areas of the "requirements", which are often fuzzy in the real world.)

        Business logic is that [portion*] of an [[enterprise] [system*]] which [determines] [how] [data] is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Transformed] and/or [calculated]. For example, business logic determines [how] a tax total is [calculated] from invoice line items.

        <li>
           [Routed] to people or software [systems*], aka [workflow].

        Business logic should be distinguished from presentation logic and business rules:

        Presentation logic is that [portion*] of an [[enterprise] [system*]] which [determines] [how] [data] will be displayed or [reported*].
