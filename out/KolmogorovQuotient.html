        Kolmogorov Quotient
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm proposing the concept of <strong>Kolmogorov Quotient</strong> as a calculable number that represents the amount a high-level language reduces the complex. That is, the amount of expressivity or <em>succinctness</em> of a programming language. This idea of "simplification" is a factor of <strong>text-wise reduction</strong> (fewer characters needed to express a complex concept, Ã  la <a href="AlgorithmicInformationTheory.html">AlgorithmicInformationTheory</a>) and another, less easy to quantify concept of <strong>maintainability</strong>. Fleshing out this latter concept, it is clear it has to do with how easily one can establish programmer <em>consensus</em> for the given task (i.e. how many programmers of the language would put it back the same way you've expressed it or otherwise agree on the best implementation for a given problem?).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a <em>Quotient</em> so that higher Kolmogorov numbers for a given language denote a <em>reduction</em> in the complexity of solving the problem in the given language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How do you propose to calculate the Kolmogorov Quotient?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, once the basic premise/methodology above is agreed to, it is only a matter of a rough <strong>constant</strong> addendum of difference for any specific implementation. (That is, as long as the implementation is the same across all measurements, the number should be valid and comparable.) But it could go something like this: Pick a language "close to the machine", like C or Assembly, and measure the amount of bytes of <strong>machine code</strong> it generated to implement a standardized suite of common, independent, programming tasks(*) (base_language_count). Then code the exact same <em>functionality</em> in the target language (no external libraries allowed) and count the number of bytes of <strong>source code</strong> (test_language_count).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>KQuotient = (base_language_count / test_language_count) / number_of_equivalent_programs</strong>. - <a href="MarkJanssen.html">MarkJanssen</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>number_of_equivalent_programs</strong> is the number of programs fluent programmers of the language agree that are the <strong>best</strong> and <strong>equal</strong> solutions to the problem.  (<em>In case it's not clear</em>, <strong>equivalent programs</strong> are those whose <em>output</em> is the same for all <em>inputs</em>.)  This accounts for the "Perl problem" (I hope), because although fewer characters are required for many tasks, they would have 50 different implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This should always be greater than 1.0. {why?} I'd guess Python or Ruby has the highest Kolmogorov Quotient.  
      </p>
      <p>
        [As for "why?": if your <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> isn't reducing the complexity of programming an operation beyond the machine code (or even C) equivalent, <em>there's no point in creating it</em>.]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           First, a language doesn't need to reduce complexity for <em>every program</em> (and logically, by the pigeonhole principle, cannot). Second, even if we operate at the 'suite' level, any suite of programming tasks is likely to be biased - e.g. favoring procedural languages, or dataflow languages, or logic programming languages, or languages with good concurrency models, or languages with good IO models, etc.. Third, "bytes of source code" is an extremely incomplete metric of complexity, e.g. not adequately addressing the issues of debugging, documentation, validation, maintenance, extension; large variable names, explicit typing, and assertions, for example, may worsen the KQuotient but improve other metrics for complexity. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Programming languages are not necessarily about reducing the complexity of performing an operation beyond the machine code equivalent. Sometimes they're about providing a way to express problems more easily. Sometimes the former and the latter are the same thing. Sometimes they aren't.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So you actually calculated your KQuotient here, or are you guessing?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Python? Really? It's a rather conventional imperative programming language, with roughly equivalent expressivity to any other. What about Haskell? Or Prolog? Or even </em><a href="CoffeeScript.html">CoffeeScript</a>?<em></em>

           Give me a quicksort algorithm in Prolog. Or calculate 2^(i*pi) in Haskell. For Coffee Script, hmmm, maybe join two tables in a database.

        Lisp cheats (edit:  on a <a href="VonNeumann.html">VonNeumann</a> achitecture): it uses recursion and hides all the actual machine code cycles it takes to run the program.  <em>Also:  making macros to cheat at source length would count against you on the other heuristic: maintainability or "programmer consensus".</em>

        Show me the machine code for a recursive factorial function on standard hardware. I bet it will be larger than the iterative version. If you're not going to limit yourself to such hardware, the KQuotient concept is probably inapplicable or, at minimum, would have to be reformulated for SymbolicComputing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On a modern architecture with instructions for procedure calls, the machine code is not going to be significantly larger than the iterative equivalent. It might be slightly slower and less efficient. Of course, any recursive function can be converted to an iterative equivalent, but a solution is often much easier to express recursively.

           Sorry, I don't know what I was thinking; with <a href="TailRecursion.html">TailRecursion</a>, a factorial function can be made into a fairly trivial "iterative" version (or I think more accurately called a "jump call with continuation").

      </ul>
      <p>
        "On a modern architecture..." -- un huh, recursive functions require arbitrarily large stacks, iterative procedures never do. Show me a CPU ("modern architecture") that has an unbounded stack. None. Thank you. You have to emulate stacks in software, so you have to include that code in your count. Next time, I'm going to ask you for the <a href="AckermannFunction.html">AckermannFunction</a>, 'ya bastid. (I chose a bad example above, as the factorial function can easily be written to use <a href="TailRecursion.html">TailRecursion</a>.  <snap>....Now I'm going to have to make sure the <strong>test suite</strong> includes a non-primitive recursive function....)

        <em> There are architectures (which is not necessarily limited to the CPU, but is typically dependent on the operating system as well) that allow stack sizes up to the limit of available RAM.

           <em>What do you mean by "all such stacks are emulated" and how is it related to my point about the expressiveness of recursive solutions?

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Because the KQuotient is a factor of both source code, and emitted code. If you have to emulate a stack, then that code counts against you. Additionally, I'm making a specific point of using a non-tail recursive function, so you won't get a away with just one stack. Such recursive solutions are <em>expensive</em> on standard hardware, (i.e. VonNeumannMachines).
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Why should the amount of emitted code matter? And why are you only now adding this as a criterion?</em>

        <li>
           {Modeling a stack is cheap. Doesn't matter whether it's an explicit class or an implied procedure-call stack; it still doesn't involve much code. But as far as this dubiously useful 'KQuotient' is concerned, only the actual code for the stack (and NOT the runtime stack size) is relevant.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Intuitively, I doubt your KQuotient would be useful as a </em>'general<strong> measure of language expressiveness, because you can almost always find a problem for which language <a> is more expressive (has a higher KQuotient) than language <b> and another problem where language <b> has a higher KQuotient than language <a>. It might, however, be a useful way of comparing languages given a </strong>particular<em>' problem.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think that will be that much of a problem -- I believe one will be able to find a more-or-less agreeable set of "suites" to test languages with. The key for a fair comparison though will be to separate out the functions which require graphical I/O (computation towards the user) vs computation towards the machine (like scientific computing).

        <em>Anyway, it's obvious that among well-known, mainstream languages, SQL, Prolog and APL are tied for first place, Haskell is second. Python and Ruby are so far behind they're not even in the race, along with C, C++, C# and Java.</em>

        <em>Well, as you can see, you've proven my point: Python, Ruby, Perl, and Javascript have the smallest code size for the same functionality.
