        Located at <a href="http://dataphor.org,">http://dataphor.org,</a> a modern implementation of a faithful <a href="RelationalLanguage.html">RelationalLanguage</a>.

        <em>[Actually, there are a number of them.  See </em><a href="RelationalLanguage.html">RelationalLanguage</a> and <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>.]<em>  </em>

        Not yet a standalone RDBMS, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a Virtual RDBMS incorporating a develpment framework.  It sits between users and SQL DBMSs, hiding SQL ugliness and relational violations away and presenting a clean relational language and a RAD environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are only two languages, D4 which is Pascal-flavoured and RealSQL for SQL familiarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is quite simple.  One defines the data model and integrity constraints, interfaces and business rules are derived.  Sticking to the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> and good language design principles makes it much simpler than current alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't implement <a href="HughDarwen.html">HughDarwen</a>'s and <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a>'s hierarchical type system, but it does have user-defined types.

        <em>Is </em><a href="AlphoraDataphor.html">AlphoraDataphor</a> really 100 percent faithful or just aiming to be pretty close? <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Should someone invite the authors (Alphora) of Dataphor to participate in Wiki an clarify their intentions? Or would that be wrong because they would provide us with a biased "our product is perfect and everything else sucks" perspective? --<a href="LuxSpes.html">LuxSpes</a>
