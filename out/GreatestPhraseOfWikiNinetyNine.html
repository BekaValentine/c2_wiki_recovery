           <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>' "I've never been able to make a complicated system work.  I've always had to make it simple first" nominated by <a href="GlennVanderburg.html">GlennVanderburg</a>.  <em>(This is a paraphrase from memory because I can't remember what page it's on.  And since Wiki now only supports keyword searching, and the phrase contains no words that don't occur dozens of times on Wiki, I can't find it.  Any help will be appreciated.)</em>
