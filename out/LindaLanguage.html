        A set of primitives orthogonal to implementation languages (such as <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, etc.) that implement operations on a <a href="TupleSpace.html">TupleSpace</a>, for use in parallel and <a href="DistributedProgramming.html">DistributedProgramming</a> environments. Created by <a href="DavidGelernter.html">DavidGelernter</a> and popularized by DG and <a href="NicholasCarriero.html">NicholasCarriero</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are four fundamental operations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           out (tuple): put a tuple into tuple space.
        </li>
        <li>
           rd (pattern): read a tuple based on a tuple pattern from a tuple space.
        </li>
        <li>
           in (pattern): read and remove a tuple based on a tuple pattern from a tuple space.
        </li>
        <li>
           eval (expression): 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These operations open up the possibilities of <a href="DataStructures.html">DataStructures</a> in <a href="TupleSpace.html">TupleSpace</a>s. Sets become more important....

        DG and Carriero refer to Linda as a "coordination language": its job is to tie together components which can be written in different languages.  <a href="FlowBasedProgramming.html">FlowBasedProgramming</a> shares this characteristic, as it is a connection language, rather than a <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> in the conventional sense.  FBP components also communicate by means of structured data objects which exist in their own space, rather like Linda's <a href="TupleSpace.html">TupleSpace</a>.  They differ from Linda's tuples in that they travel across <a href="BoundedBuffer.html">BoundedBuffer</a> connections between components, rather than being retrieved associatively. -- <a href="PaulMorrison.html">PaulMorrison</a>
