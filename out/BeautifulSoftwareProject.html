        This exhibition, the result of a collaboration between book and installation artist KarenHanmer, digital media artist AndreaPolli, and software systems architect <a href="BobHanmer.html">BobHanmer</a> asks and attempts to find answers to the question: What are aesthetic values in contemporary computer programming and how they are similar to (or different from) aesthetic values in art?
      </p>
      <p>
        The exhibition is the result of two years of research including: the study of the most influential authors on the art of computer programming (<a href="DonKnuth.html">DonKnuth</a>, <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>,  <a href="BrianKernighan.html">BrianKernighan</a> and <a href="JonBentley.html">JonBentley</a>, for example), group interviews at computer programming conferences, and written questionnaires completed by computer professionals. KarenHanmer instigated this project out of a desire to find a point of entry into her husband <a href="BobHanmer.html">BobHanmer</a>'s world of programming, and to find a way to convey the aesthetic nature of coding to other non-technical people. <a href="BobHanmer.html">BobHanmer</a>'s interest in the project came not only from a desire to communicate the beauty of programming, but also to illustrate 'good' coding practice and structures versus 'bad' coding to programmers, on-programmers, and programmers of the future. AndreaPolli was naturally drawn to this project because at a young age, her computer scientist father conveyed to her the beauty and elegance of mathematical proofs, a kind of conceptual beauty she strives for in her own work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exhibition includes quotes from the interviews, representations of artifacts from the history of programming, and illustrations of programming structures and processes in print and interactive format.
