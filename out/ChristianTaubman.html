        I think <a href="SpecializationIsForInsects.html">SpecializationIsForInsects</a>, so I like to do a lot of different things.  Most of them are outside (sailing, canoeing, skiing) but I also try (and usually, it must be admitted, fail) to take advantage of the myriad cultural opportunities in BostonCity, where I live.

        Oh yeah, I also love to write software.  When it comes to that I'm interested in <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, and anything else that might help with the unsolved problem that is developing large and complex software systems.  Programming has had me hooked since I first played with BASIC on the <a href="AppleIi.html">AppleIi</a> at school.  What could be cooler than building something and watching it work right in front of your eyes?  Throw a small team of people at a problem and you can really get things done.

        The more software I develop the more I see people and their relationships as the things that really make a difference.

        I'm Australian by birth, went to High School in Hawai'i, and went to university in Boston, so don't ask me where I'm "from" ;)
