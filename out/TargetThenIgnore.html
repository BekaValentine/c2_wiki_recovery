        Target Then Ignore
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> used by dubious large companies to kill off competition so that they can later slack and profit. Sometimes this practice is known as "dumping".
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a large company that sells multiple products may decide to corner market X using <a href="TargetThenIgnore.html">TargetThenIgnore</a>. They do this by first copying most of the favorite features of the competitor(s) product. They have an army of designers and/or programmers due to their size, allowing them to toss in at least as many features as the competitors. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then they sell at a steep discount, <strong>willing to take a loss</strong> for a few years. Buyers shopping market X are pretty much forced to choose the large company's product because they get mostly the same features at a clear discount. After a while all the competitors in market X are gone. They cannot compete with a loss-taking venture and <strong>fold</strong>. The large company lives off of their other products (AKA "cash cows") in order to live at a loss in market X, but a small company rarely can afford this wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the large company raises the prices and kicks back. Their <strong>product stagnates</strong> because their competitors are dead and thus have little incentive to improve it. If by chance a new competitor pops up it's head, they either bring back the discounts, and/or add in the new features.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's then nearly impossible for a small company to enter the X market (barring some grand patent). Only a big company can do it, but they often don't bother because it would just result in a long and costly price war.
