        <li>
           Hilariously ignorant. Best known as a super-GM chess player and World Champion, he had the backing of the state, personal trainers, seconds, researchers, etc.  No champion has ever really stood alone.  He himself trained the next generation of champions, both in country and abroad (including the current wunderkind, Magnus Karlsen).

           In his current career as a Russian politician, he of course has to be a team player to get anything done. That's politics!

               <em>To be a political commentator you don't. That's a better role for him.</em>
