        Wiki Vandalism Analysis
      </h1>
      <p>
        What are the requirements for good <a href="WikiVandalismSolutions.html">WikiVandalismSolutions</a>? It is a tough question. I suggest we break the analysis into four phases:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Phase one, we list our internal factors that annoy us.
        </li>
        <li>
           Phase two, we list specific externally observable triggers that lead to the phase one items.
        </li>
        <li>
           Phase three, we describe the externally observable behavior of others that leads to the phase two items.
        </li>
        <li>
           Phase four, we enumerate whole strategies that others take, leading to observable actions listed in phase three.
        </li>
        <li>
           Phase five, we guess about the internal motivations of the others that lead to the phase four items.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>All jokes about "phase zero, we list the phases", will be promptly vandalized. :)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that these lists are formatted in a specific way so that they can be processed by the visualization program. Please stick with the format, or at least make your format change consistent so that the page is still machine-readable. Each item has a short name that is highlighted in bold. Items can refer to other items with the (leads to: xyz) syntax, where xyz is a short name that is defined elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phase one: What are the things we dislike?
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           I dislike <strong>clutter</strong>. (leads to: gnome, topicality)
        </li>

           I dislike <strong>offensive</strong> content. (leads to: topicality)

      <p>

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>

      <p>
        [[[This is a work in progress. I expect to do some more refactoring and then tie the two ends together, showing how regular users can be drawn to the dark side. Also, add a section to discuss cycles in the graph.]]]

        Here is a visualization of the dependencies among the above items (the "leads to:" references). The colors indicate which phase an item belongs to (in R,G,B,C,Y,M order). See <a href="WikiVandalismAnalysisVisualization.html">WikiVandalismAnalysisVisualization</a> for details.

        The picture came out as pretty unintelligible this time... still trying to tweak with dot's attributes.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> The pictures may look pretty and allow the occasional cycle to be spotted, but what other use do they have?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Some people think better in pictures than in lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> How will guessing the internal motivations of vandals help us find solutions?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Technical solutions can only address some problems.  Many problems are better solved by improved understanding and communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Given a large enough population or enough time, every possible internal motivation will induce vandalism.  Any effective solution must succeed regardless of a vandal's motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> We can't address everyone's unique motivations, but we may have some success by generalizing and addressing some that appear to be common.
