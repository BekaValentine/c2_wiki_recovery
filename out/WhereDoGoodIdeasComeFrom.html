        Where Do Good Ideas Come From
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ideas, Ideas, Ideas. What's the Big Idea?
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone likes Ideas -- they are the spark of the fire. Everyone has their ideas, but <a href="GoodIdeasAreExpensive.html">GoodIdeasAreExpensive</a>. So <a href="WhereDoGoodIdeasComeFrom.html">WhereDoGoodIdeasComeFrom</a>? How do you get your good ideas?
      </p>
      <p>
        Mostly I find that good ideas come from deep within my brain, when I have already thought out a problem thoroughly and am involved in a completely different task. Good Ideas come from the subconscience. I get my best ideas when I am walking around admiring the sights in the neighborhood. Or writing in my journal. Or taking a shower.

        <em>In my experience, good ideas are born of necessity. You know "Necessity is the mother of invention".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this mean therefore that to be productive at creating good ideas that we should deliberately put <em>ourselves</em> into a state of need?
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this mean that suffering is a necessary prerequisite to creating good ideas (or creativity, or art)?
      </p>
      <p>
        How does this apply to software development: are the good idea creators in software design those people who are more sensitive to other people's computer/computing needs?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's a pressure, or emergency, kind of thing. The greater the need or urgency, the better the really good ideas seem to flow. Kind of like "water reaches hotter temperatures under pressure."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not for me -- pressure makes for a faster flow of my ideas, yes. But not Good ideas. In fact, I think quite the opposite -- relaxed <em>inattention</em> to the problem at hand is what causes my best ideas. It is after my brain has had <em>unpressured</em> time to mull over all of the various possibilities that it harkens upon the Good idea.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I find that I can generate ideas (of random caliber) when I want to, and I can usually recognize a Good idea when I see one. However, I never seem to be able to generate a Good idea on demand. Therefore I must generate tens, or even hundreds of ideas, if I want to end up with a Good one.
