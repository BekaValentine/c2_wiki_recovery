        <em>While this may be true today in some way, there is more than one way to deal with them.  This line of italic text was originally written by a person who has never run software from </em><a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> on a private computer of his on a serious level.  At work he develops on a <a href="DebianGnuLinux.html">DebianGnuLinux</a> box, and only uses <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> software  to test.

          Pitney-Bowes -- Years ago I worked for a Pitney-Bowes subsidiary, and learned that, because they had something like 95% of the postage meter market, they had been investigated for anti-trust violations, but the Department of Justice concluded that their market share was so high because no one really tried to compete with them. So a large market share is not automatically an illegal monopoly.

           There are segments of our society which hold to positions as expressed above, but there is a much larger segment found to behave in the marketplace in direct opposition to the characterizations. They realize that even though Crude Oil stinks, there are huge, multinational Corporations who have the ability to convert it into available and usable gasoline, plastics, cosmetics, medicines, machines and products found useful if not essential.

        <li>
          Part of the problem may be that when you are under thirty five and a multi-millionaire (as are many MS program managers) you naturally don't care.  *You'll retire soon and comfortably no matter what happens. So why stir the pot? Ship it.

          I've had experience with programmers in this situation, including some from <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>.  Few of them are on the "more millions" treadmill.  
        </li>

        <strong>Cynical Suggestions</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I was struck by the <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> "Prepare for Liftoff" conceit somewhere on their web site that I wrote them, asking whether they had considered how much this sounded like "Prepare for Ripoff"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What do they care, they're simply in it for the money.

        <li>
          Now, some would say that in a capitalist society every business that stays in business must be driven by this principle (i.e. everything comes down to bean-counting).  . 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Two-tiered product schemes, such as <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>'s 'consumer grade' versus 'professional grade' versions of Windows, by definition have to be a ripoff. If the 'professional' grade is indeed made as well as possible, then the 'consumer grade' version must be a degraded disgrace that is distributed to prop up the inflated price of the 'professional' version. The incremental costs of duplicating, distributing, packaging either version is virtually the same. The cost of having two different lines of code development, each with untold millions of lines of code we are told, is definitely more expensive for <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> then simply employing the 'professional' grade programmers to make one, definitive operating system. Obviously, it must be far more profitable for <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> to incur the additional cost of producing and selling an inferior product, the 'consumer' version, simply by the fact that they would be irrational to choose a course that didn't maximize profits, not to mention their profit history. (See recent <a href="RedHat.html">RedHat</a> strategies for a Linux comparison)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Capitalism the MarketPlace and individuals cannot be trusted : So, contrary to popular belief, capitalism does NOT produce optimal product quality...in fact it creates as degraded a quality product as a gullable public will pay for. And, as the adage goes, you get what you pay for.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A societal disaster : A factor in the ongoing disaster that is <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> (a disaster for society at large) is that since <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> is a monopoly, it may be keeping the 'consumer' grade Windows simply to keep a pool of programmers in their own camp rather than freeing them to work at potential competitors. After all, there are only a finite number of OS programmers, so buying them up (what used to be called "co-opting" them) and giving them a pretext for drawing a paycheck lets <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> create whatever dreck it likes without fear of meaningful competition, charging whatever price it wishes.

        <li>
          Breaking up Microsoft a good thing, it will unemploy programmers : THIS is only one of the compelling reasons for breaking <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> apart--to liberate programmers. Society would doubtless benefit far more from cheaper programmers working on a diverse mix of competing operating systems than the present situation, which benefits no one on the basis of quality and reliability and rewards Gates, the managers and stockholders all out of proportion to the value being created....whilst BLOCKING alternative situations, some of which, in all probability, would be a greater gain for society at large.

        <strong>Integrate and Implement Everything</strong>
        The problem with Microsoft is that they tend to be <strong>too greedy</strong>. They want everything, the birthday cake, the crumbs, the gifts and eventually they'll want to eat the guests too. <strong>They just don't know when to stop!</strong> That may be the first error in their strategy.  People in business are like guests at a party; they tend to dislike over-eaters, pigs who want to have the whole cake. They want a piece too. If there was a street-musician making a lot of money playing music in the streets of Seattle, soon enough you'd see Bill Gates cashing in!

        <strong>Gain Some Lose Some</strong>
        Gates and Ballmer should have used the gain-some-lose-some mantra and everything would have been fine for them. To the contrary their motto was: Win everything at all costs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Comparing behaviour before and after </strong><a href="SteveBallmer.html">SteveBallmer</a> became CEO may be instructive: MS has moved towards settling lawsuits rather than pursuing them and many at the company are aware of the bad relations their attitude and actions have caused. If you find public apologies compelling, listen to almost any speech by Steve Ballmer.

        For example, an excellent sacrifice would have been to not integrate Internet Explorer in Windows 98. This way they would have given a chance to Netscape and other browsers. No they couldn't resist putting Netscape out of business. They wanted that market too. (When I last checked you can get and use Netscape and scores of other browsers 20020312). <em>it's not the same Netscape</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Also Netscape contributed significantly to its own downfall by attempting to charge heavily for the distribution of the Netscape browser when dealing with magazines and ISPs (at a time when personal downloads of the Netscape browser were free). In fact Netscape distributed more copies of its browser than there were users on the Internet and still failed to displace IE. This is not to suggest that IE lacks flaws - only to point out that many companies make mistakes. A behemoth like Microsoft does need to reach higher standards than others to be fair, not lower standards.</strong>

           Anyone who is familiar with the difference in computing today as opposed to what it was in 1980, can thank Microsoft for improving software and making the way for improved and enhanced hardware we find used the world over. Would we be where we are today without Microsoft? Would an individual user be able to assemble a computing system with hardrives allowing access to Terabytes of information and programs for under 3000 dollars? That is about the cost of a state of the art machine in almost any generation of computers. Would you choose to negate progress made in your behalf because someone has gotten rich providing it for you?  Probably not. This is not to say that tomorrows providers will be the same as currently, or even that progress is inevitable. One has but to look at history to see that mankind has not always moved from good to better to best. Let us hope that in our own lifetimes that such will be the case.  -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

        <strong>Microsoft's monopoly</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is just not sane for the economy, for the business world and for the software world to have one single company that is so huge and so powerful. <strong>Wealth like power has to be distributed between many</strong>. This being said, if Microsoft offered me a big contract, I'd certainly change my tune (see <a href="AnimalFarm.html">AnimalFarm</a> by George Orwell). But deep inside I'd still believe what I just said! 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where we are headed though: less and less small companies. More and more huge companies and multi-nationals. Savage capitalism. Just not right... I wonder what the solutions could be?

        <strong>The Microsoft possibility</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The second word in a typical abstract now required in every software business plan: 'The Microsoft Possibility' must describe preparations for the time when this behemoth sets its sights hungrily upon your innovations and inventions.  For when you wake the slumbering giant, you must anticipate its co-opting of your standards and corruption of your ideals in its pursuit of 'universal adoption' (a derivative of Marxian belief, I think).

        Microsoft tablet ads have been trashing Apple and Apple Siri of late. In the Jobs era, revenge would be swift and heavy. Let's see how Apple responds. The problem is that counter ads would legitimize MS as a competitor in the minds of viewers, which so far based on market share, it's not. Maybe Apple will try another route such as including <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> pre-installed on all Macs.
