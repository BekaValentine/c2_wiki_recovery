        Design For Development
      </h1>
      <p>
        The following is my attempt to generalize <a href="DesignForTestability.html">DesignForTestability</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The software design process should be targeted at development process in whole as well as at the product being designed. 
        Development process includes "listen-test-code-refactor" chain, according to <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>. Design is being spread in all links of the chain. So, doing your design and producing <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>, try keeping in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "The user" (the real user and a software developer) should be able to listen to your system, to learn from it. This can include ability to do experiments with a system
        </li>
        <li>
           The system on each abstraction layer should be testable (<a href="DesignForTestability.html">DesignForTestability</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           It should be natural to add code to your system (don't design the application, design the "language" instead).
        </li>
        <li>
           The system should permit refactoring
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've found above statements somehow related to the <a href="GreatDesign.html">GreatDesign</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thoughts anyone?
