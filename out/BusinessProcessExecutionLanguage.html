        <a href="BusinessProcessExecutionLanguage.html">BusinessProcessExecutionLanguage</a>4WebServices (BPEL or BPEL4WS) is an <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> based script designed for orchestration of work tasks between <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>. It is an important technology response to the needs for <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a>.

        "BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) for Web services is an XML-based language designed to enable task-sharing for a distributed computing or grid computing environment - even across multiple organizations - using a combination of Web services. Written by developers from BEA Systems, IBM, and Microsoft, BPEL combines and replaces IBM's <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> Flow Language (WSFL) and Microsoft's XLANG specification. (BPEL is also sometimes identified as BPELWS or BPEL4WS.)"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Using BPEL, a programmer formally describes a business process that will take place across the Web in such a way that any cooperating entity can perform one or more steps in the process the same way. In a supply chain process, for example, a BPEL program might describe a business protocol that formalizes what pieces of information a product order consists of, and what exceptions may have to be handled. The BPEL program would not, however, specify how a given Web service should process a given order internally."

        I wonder what the Sun-Oracle camp has to say about this collaboration. <em>Sun and Oracle joined the technical committee and Oracle (at least) is working on an implementation.  Do you think they are being suckered?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It means absolutely nothing for companies to join committees. They very often do this just to stay in touch with what is going on. It certainly does not imply support for an effort, in itself.
        </li>
        <li>
           Working on an implementation implies a somewhat higher degree of interest, but still does not show commitment, in itself. A large company will often do such things just to explore the feasibility and potential value in something, especially if it's relatively cheap (e.g. only requires a couple of full time "plug compatible" <a href="BrainsAsaCheapCommodity.html">BrainsAsaCheapCommodity</a>Units)

        <em>Oracle just announced that they bought Collaxa and have rebranded their BPEL engine. </em><a href="http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/dailyarchives.jhtml?articleId=22102867''.">http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/dailyarchives.jhtml?articleId=22102867''.</a>

           The W3C standard originates from <a href="AdobeSystemsInc.html">AdobeSystemsInc</a>. See W3C introductory material at <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Talks/www05-WS-CDL.pdf">http://www.w3.org/2005/Talks/www05-WS-CDL.pdf</a>

        A year later, the article at <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/07/02/27TCwsibpel_1.html">http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/07/02/27TCwsibpel_1.html</a> concluded its analysis with this statement:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Focusing BPEL on internal processes and WSCL (WebServicesConverationLanguage) on external processes could eventually make these languages complementary
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Mar05 <a href="OasisOrganization.html">OasisOrganization</a> webpage has also mentioned WSCL in its technology report on "Messaging and Transaction Coordination", at <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/coordination.html">http://xml.coverpages.org/coordination.html</a>

        BPEL has been criticized as unable to incorporate processing needs outside the scope of <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> (e.g. those requiring human interventions). See the topic in this section for more.
