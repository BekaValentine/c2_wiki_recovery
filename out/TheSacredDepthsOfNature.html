        The Sacred Depths Of Nature
      </h1>
      <p>
        An interesting book by Ursula <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>. She is a leading cell biologist. This book attempts to reconcile traditional religious beliefs and evolution. She considers herself a ReligiousNaturalist: She respects the sacredness and tradition of religion, but she doesn't believe in a "higher power".
      </p>
      <p>
        The book is segmented into biological descriptions of evolution and life paired with personal reflections that dive into the religious feelings she has.
