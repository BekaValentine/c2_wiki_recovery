        Shape What You Can Control Category Wiki Maintenance
      </h1>
      <p>
        Describe <a href="ShapeWhatYouCanControl.html">ShapeWhatYouCanControl</a> | <a href="CategoryWikiMaintenance.html">CategoryWikiMaintenance</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        The result of a bot reversal of edit change created this as a WantedPage. I tried to fix it by inserting a horizontal rule betweeen <a href="ShapeWhatYouCanControl.html">ShapeWhatYouCanControl</a> and <a href="CategoryWikiMaintenance.html">CategoryWikiMaintenance</a>, but it was reversed. alas!
      </p>
      <p>
        This merely illustrates what can happen when bots make changes. Perhaps the Bot's Master will correct this.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the result of an original edit meant to remove pages I had written from the <a href="SeeAlso.html">SeeAlso</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I put it in correct form, viewed it, then shaped it into what I could control: a local pdf, properly constructed with the removals missing.

        I am investingating and testing ways that wiki pages can be stored locally or perhaps in a cloud using <a href="WoolenLanguage.html">WoolenLanguage</a> techniques and processes

      <ul>
        <li>
           By using <a href="WikiBatics.html">WikiBatics</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               done by viewing and locally shaping the pages in the list as a local fully linking pdf)
            </li>
            <li>
               This technique has been used to store thousands of pages from multiple sources in forms that are shaped around a topic or category, and can be viewed using only my local machine (computer offline).
