        Given the relative lack of real problems, many people are asking if the whole thing was just a hoax.

        <strong>A Third World Suspicion: Was Y2K Bug a Hoax?</strong>
        (Anthony Faiola, International Herald Tribune/Washington Post Service)
        <a href="http://www.iht.com/IHT/TODAY/FRI/FPAGE/y2kcon.2.html">http://www.iht.com/IHT/TODAY/FRI/FPAGE/y2kcon.2.html</a>

        <dd><em>"The money spent on updating computers is drawing widespread popular outrage (in Argentina) and in many Third World nations. Suspicions of overspending on the Y2K bug that never materialized are increasing with every day that passes without a computer breakdown."</em></dd>

        <strong>Actual and perceived Y2K errors:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="YtwokErrors.html">YtwokErrors</a> - actual production system errors that occurred
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="YtwokErrorsFixed.html">YtwokErrorsFixed</a> - errors found and fixed before they had an impact on production
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Many business people probably used "Y2K" money for other upgrades they wanted, but which were not really needed for Y2K compliance.

        In late 1998, <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a> worked on a "Y2K" project that was failing, for political reasons.
        Guess who suddenly found a technical fix for the old "non-compliant" legacy system that "couldn't be fixed?"
