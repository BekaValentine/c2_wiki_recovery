        So esoteric they don't even have a description here.

        This page was last changed (created actually) at the end of September, 1999.  Does anyone still use Booch diagrams in production any more?  I ask specifically because I've done UML exclusively for two years or so but now I have a coworker (the technical lead actually) asking for my class diagrams in Booch notation.  It's been so long I'm not even sure I recall what Booch looks like, and I know I don't have a tool that supports it.

        Sometimes I still use the <a href="BoochMethod.html">BoochMethod</a> for white-board work but for as long as UML tools have been around I have been using that. Of course, I must say that I still prefer the Booch Clouds to those boring OMT boxes, but hey, who am I to fight momentum. You should probably tell your co-worker to get with the program and learn UML. If you have Rose, you can always just print using the Booch Look & Feel. --<a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>
