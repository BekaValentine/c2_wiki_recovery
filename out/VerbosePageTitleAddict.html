        Verbose Page Title Addict
      </h1>
      <p>
        I notice a pattern when people create pages on this wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people prefer to keep pages concise, short, and to the point. Others seem to be addicted to VeryLongOverlyNicePageTitles. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>For Example</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the humorous notes in <a href="AhSimple.html">AhSimple</a> and compare <a href="AhSimple.html">AhSimple</a> to a long page that is supposed to be simple such as <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Verbosity to Hide </strong><a href="BadWord.html">BadWord</a>s<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some try to avoid the <a href="NotNiceEnough.html">NotNiceEnough</a> pattern by adding verbosity to their page titles - replacing words such as <em>damage</em> with equally rude but more verbose phrases such as <em></em>SomethingThatIsReallyPoor<em> or </em>VeryBerryBad<em> or </em>NotGoodNotGoodNotGreat<em>. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider people renaming funny precise pages like <a href="BrainDamage.html">BrainDamage</a> (a well known pattern and coined term) to longer and not really nicer (but claimed nicer) pages which don't even act as direct replacements such as <a href="ToolsThatTeachPoorHabits.html">ToolsThatTeachPoorHabits</a> (that's another page all together, specific to Tools). A <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a> might take it one step further and change it to ToolsThatMayOrMayNotDependingOnTheSituationCausePoorOrEvenGoodHabits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the words <em>verbose</em>,  <em>bad</em>, <em>addict</em>, or <em>poor</em> can be considered <em>inflammatory</em> - so a <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a> is in fact a hypocrite who usually uses inflammatory words in new pages that replace old elegant pages. A <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a> may hijack a page, delete it, and create a new title with long words (with some bad words thrown here and there) in place of the old terse page title. The verbosity acts like icing or <em>with a cherry on top</em>, to hide the so called <em>inflammatory</em> old concise and precise elegant page title. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But does prettying up this wiki with verbosity really solve a problem, and does <em>reacting</em> and creating verbose title flames actually <em>cause</em> more problems than the original terse page did? I.e is the one who is claiming a page is inflammatory actually being hypocritcally inflammatory themselves by creating verbose pages which will cause more flames? Should <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a>s first check in with their own sense of humor before jumping to conclusions and assuming that a precise and concise page is meant to be inflammatory toward them specifically? 
      </p>
      <p>
        How are we to have pages such as <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> when a <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a> will just come in and claim that the page needs to be changed since the word <em>smell</em> is inflammatory and that the title should be more correctly CodeThatOffersCertainBadOrNiceOdors.
      </p>
      <p>
        How are we to have pages such as <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a> when a <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a> will just storm in and declare that the <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a> page is far too terse and inflammatory? 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I suggest </em>SomethingThatIsNotAsNiceLooking instead of <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How are we to have pages such as <a href="GetOverIt.html">GetOverIt</a> when a <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a> will just storm in and declare:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I suggest </em>ItWouldBeNiceIfYouCouldPleaseGetOverTopOfIt instead of <a href="GetOverIt.html">GetOverIt</a>. The title <strong></strong><a href="GetOverIt.html">GetOverIt</a><em>' is too inflammatory</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Theories</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One theory is that a <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a> is trying to gain BrowniePoints by appearing to do something useful on this wiki (a fake <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> possibly), when in fact <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a>s are generally more destructive to a wiki than constructive - they stir up more trouble than existed in the first place.

        Suggestions for <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Precision and concision is good. <a href="GetOverIt.html">GetOverIt</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't react and <a href="FlameRename.html">FlameRename</a> pages by claiming that they are flames - your verbose flame may be an even worse flame. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Get a sense of humor. Terse page titles such as <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a>, <a href="BrainDamage.html">BrainDamage</a>, <a href="GetOverIt.html">GetOverIt</a>, <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>, etc. are very humorous and well known patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <em>I suggest </em>ForSomeoneWhoMayBeUsedToUsingMoreVerboseTitles as a title for this page. The current <a href="VerbosePageTitleAddict.html">VerbosePageTitleAddict</a> is too inflammatory.<em></em>
