        Actually killing all snakes is just about the dumbest thing you can do with them. In Australia, where we have a lot of genuine man-killing snakes, your safety is greatly increased by keeping a carpet snake in your ceiling. Snakes are cross-species territorial, and a big python in the attic will keep away the night tigers, death adders, and aggressive brown snakes we get in these here hospitable parts.

        You may think that <a href="WhenYouSeeaSnakeYouKillIt.html">WhenYouSeeaSnakeYouKillIt</a> is still good advice re poisonous snakes. But down here we've also learned to prize the red-bellied black snake, which, while deadly, is both non-aggressive to humans and a voracious consumer of the brown snakes. And those browns really are savage bastards.
