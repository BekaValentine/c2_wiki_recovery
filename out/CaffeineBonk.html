        <em>It's mountain biker slang for what happens when you attempt a heroic feat of exertion and run afoul of your own physical limitations in a dramatic way.  Illustrated in a recent advertisement in which the biker is climbing a steep hill then appears to hit an invisible wall and begins rolling backwards downhill.  "Bonk" is the sound your head makes when it hits the wall.</em>
