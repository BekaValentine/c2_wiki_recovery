        Conditional Operator
      </h1>
      <p>
        You might be a <a href="ThreeStarProgrammer.html">ThreeStarProgrammer</a> if you use the ternary conditional operator <strong>?:</strong> in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> or <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> or <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>.  Especially if you used it as an LValue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You have used ?: to avoid writing an if statement.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a useful technique when instrumenting code for profiling:
      </p>
      <code>
        if(x)<br/>
        {<br/>
        }<br/>
        else<br/>
        {<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        becomes:
      </p>
      <code>
        if((x) ? <br/>
        TRACE(1),1 :  // executed when (x) is true,  continues into "if" block<br/>
        TRACE(2),0)	// executed when (x) is false, continues into "else" block <br/>
        {<br/>
        }<br/>
        else<br/>
        {<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In this context the technique doesn't interfere with the block code if the original didn't use brackets, and the conditional is still evaluated <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, so it won't cause macro-expansion problems.  I consider this usage to be a special case; I'd discourage regularly using ? in place of if-else.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ummm...this technique doesn't work  Consider this simplification:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        if (x? foo(),1: bar(),0) { ... }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Because ? and : are brackets, there is no binding problem with the first comma.  However, comma has lower precedence than ?:, so this statement should be parsed as</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        if ((x? (foo(), 1): bar()), 0) { ... }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>which implies that the { ... } will never be executed.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am leaving the original suggestion uncorrected because I think it's a useful lesson.  --</em><a href="AndrewKoenig.html">AndrewKoenig</a><em></em>

        I'd like to add another use of ?: that can make mathematically based code much easier to read.  Guards in languages like <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> are an immensely useful feature and ?: can be used to implement them in C/C++.
      </p>
      <code>
        const double a =<br/>
        expression1	? a1<br/>
        : expression2	? a2<br/>
        : expression3	? a3<br/>
        : /*otherwise*/	a4;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Compare this to the equivalent if statements version which is more error prone and procedural instead of the mathematical declarative form.  Also note that in the above code a can be declared as const as we intended it.
      </p>
      <code>
        double a;<br/>
        if( expression1 )<br/>
        a = a1;<br/>
        else if( expression2 )<br/>
        a = a2;<br/>
        else if( expression3 )<br/>
        a = a3;<br/>
        else /*otherwise*/<br/>
        a = a4;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Like anything else ?: can be abused, but used well it can produce better code. --DavidSankel

        <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> 2.4 and below had no official ternary conditional, but it could be emulated with short-circuiting and/or:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = p <strong>and</strong> t <strong>or</strong> f<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, this is not a perfect solution because, for this to behave the same as the conditional operator, t must not evaluate to False. If it does, the "and" test will fail and the expression will evaluate to f, regardless of the value of p.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python 2.5 introduced a true conditional operator with the following syntax:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = t <strong>if</strong> p <strong>else</strong> f<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> and many others simply use if-then-else or cond, since they are already expressions.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        As pointed out in the introductory paragraph, it is possible (though generally discouraged) to use the ternary operator as a <a href="LeftValue.html">LeftValue</a> selector:
      </p>
      <code>
        ((foo) ? bar : baz) = frink;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which is equivalent to:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (foo)<br/>
        bar = frink;<br/>
        else<br/>
        baz = frink;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Defenders of the device hold that it makes the intention of a selected assignment clear, but the vast majority of programmers consider this extremely poor style, if only because the technique's obscurity. (Personally, I have a certain fondness for it, but then I'm a manic Lisp weenie; I would never use it in anything anyone else would ever have to maintain, however, unless I intended it as <a href="EvilCode.html">EvilCode</a>. -- <a href="JayOsako.html">JayOsako</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        The same thing can be done with function calls: foo = (bar ? baz : quux)(frink)
      </p>
      <p>
        Using ?: in lvalues are not supported in C, but you can still do this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (foo?&bar:&baz)=frink;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A good use for the conditional operator is when you have code like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (a)<br/>
        f(b);<br/>
        else<br/>
        f(c);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It can be re-written as:
      </p>
      <code>
        f( a ? b : c);<br/>
      </code>
