        A fan of sense and logic, although I am not logical. I discovered computers after I was diagnosed with epilepsy, and I felt a kinship with their crazy logic. After all, computers are only weaker, convulsed clones of individual ways of thinking.

        "The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value. I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death."   ThomasPaine
