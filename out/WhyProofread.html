        Why Proofread
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WhyProofread.html">WhyProofread</a>? I'm starting this page to call attention to an ever increasing problem. I have done a lot of minor corrections here (my efforts pale compared to <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a> and others...) and lately some knuckle-head seems to be arbitrarily reverting pages without reading what has changed or anything. Others have restored appropriate revisions, but not all. Basically, this is a waste of everyones precious time. <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s are difficult to spot at a glance and these corrections quickly get lost. (thanks to the aforementioned knuckle-head.. who could certainly use some <a href="ParkingLotTherapy.html">ParkingLotTherapy</a>!)

        Personally, this type of thing, along with spam, and <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s are the most annoying things that make me not want to participate in Wiki. Much more so than the occasional <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> PageOfDrivel. <a href="LifeIsShort.html">LifeIsShort</a>.

        So, I'm asking my fellow wikizens to do a little extra proofreading before they hit the save button. I actually don't mind fixing typos and spelling errors, but, I can't stand to do it twice on the same page. I want to read a new page and fix any errors there instead... Thanks in advance for helping! -- <a href="RonJandrasi.html">RonJandrasi</a>
