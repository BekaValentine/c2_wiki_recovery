        In his books, he defines the basic unit of information as <em>a </em><a href="DifferenceThatMakesaDifference.html">DifferenceThatMakesaDifference</a><em> and elaborates this idea into the growth processes of life, the mind, and the universe, seeing the world around us and in us as intertwined communication circuits (</em>YouCannotNotCommunicate - not by GB but related)
      </p>
      <p>
        He claimed that progress in thinking is made by the interplay of strict and loose thinking, and that <a href="TheMapIsNotTheTerritory.html">TheMapIsNotTheTerritory</a>.

      <p>
        When studying the world, he always tried to understand the whole of the picture. He was looking for the ThePatternWhichConnects in superficially diverse areas as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Mind and nature (also the title of one of his last books)
        </li>
        <li>
           Human culture (he studied the folks over at PapuaNewGuinea as well as the rest of the world)
        </li>
        <li>
           Learning, learning to learn, learning to learn to learn...
        </li>
        <li>
           Creativity, humor, schizophrenia, alcoholics
        </li>
        <li>
           Language and communication processes in and between cultures, cells, the universe, steam engines, trees, governments, humans and dolphins, cats, dogs
        </li>
        <li>
           Growth
        </li>
        <li>
           Complexity and combination of information, as related to:
        </li>
        <li>
           Moire effects, holography, the stripes of zebras
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="InformationTheory.html">InformationTheory</a>, system theory
        </li>
        <li>
           Symmetry in flowers and armaments races
        </li>
        <li>
           this list could go on forever, so you should read his books
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It feels like one of his passions was to make the patterns behind communication processes evident and find <em>explicit</em> knowledge about them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of his books include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Steps to an Ecology of Mind. Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology", [ISBN: 0226039056] his chef d'oeuvre, methinks
        </li>
        <li>
           "Mind and Nature : A Necessary Unity", [ASIN: 0525155902], <em>every schoolboy should know</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           "Naven", about his experiences in PapuaNewGuinea
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        He was married with anthropologist MargaretMead, their daughter is named Mary Catherine.

        So there it is in words<br/>
        Precise<br/>
        And if you read between the lines<br/>
        You will find nothing there<br/>
        For that is the discipline I ask<br/>
        Not more, not less <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Not the world as it is<br/>
        Nor ought to be -<br/>
        Only the precision<br/>
        The skeleton of truth<br/>
        I do not dabble in emotion<br/>
        Hint at implications<br/>
        Evoke the ghosts of old forgotten creeds. <br/>

        All that is for the preacher<br/>
        The hypnotist, therapist and missionary<br/>
        They will come after me<br/>
        And use the little that I said<br/>
        To bait more traps<br/>
        For those who cannot bear<br/>
        The lonely<br/>
        Skeleton<br/>
        of Truth<br/>
