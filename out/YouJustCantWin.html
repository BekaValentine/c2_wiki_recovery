        You Just Cant Win
      </h1>
      <p>
        You can't win.
        You can't break even either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds like a tongue-in-cheek description of the first two laws of thermodynamics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           0th law: there is a game
        </li>
        <li>
           1st law: you can't win
        </li>
        <li>
           2nd law: you can't break even 
        </li>
        <li>
           3rd law: You can't even quit the game
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Solutions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           become smaller
        </li>
        <li>
           slow time
        </li>
        <li>
           lose gracefully
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Alternatively
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           learn to create energy
        </li>
      </ul>
