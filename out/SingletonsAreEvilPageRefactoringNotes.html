        Singletons Are Evil Page Refactoring Notes
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Moved from </em><a href="SingletonsAreEvil.html">SingletonsAreEvil</a> in Jan. 2005. The discussion below appears to have taken place in 2002.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that this page [<a href="SingletonsAreEvil.html">SingletonsAreEvil</a>] is being slowly merged into <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>, and the idea is that I would like to refactor it away into nothingness. -- <a href="FrancisHwang.html">FrancisHwang</a>

        I hope you don't delete this page.  This page is distinct from <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> because it expresses a peculiar, controversial judgement about singletons.  I'm already disappointed that this page has been watered down from its rhetorically excessive former glory.  Also, the <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> page has grown enormous. -- <a href="BenKovitz.html">BenKovitz</a>

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Ben, the idea behind merging this page into <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> is that it contains a lot of interesting text that would be easier to find if it were either a) on the main page or b) on a page that were named after a topic, not an opinion. A page title like <a href="SingletonsAreEvil.html">SingletonsAreEvil</a> tells me they're evil, but not why. A page title like <a href="SingletonGlobalProblems.html">SingletonGlobalProblems</a> tells me more. -- francis</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>I'm afraid I must disagree.  The body of the text on <a href="SingletonsAreEvil.html">SingletonsAreEvil</a> can tell you why.  A title like <a href="SingletonsAreEvil.html">SingletonsAreEvil</a> is a promise that the body will present an argument, and in hyperbolic style.  I think duplicating ideas here and on other pages is fine.  I point people to this page to demonstrate how opinionated programmers are and the moral terms in which they think.  Please don't water down this page. Let there be <em>fun!</em> -- <a href="BenKovitz.html">BenKovitz</a></dd>

        <em>Francis, I just retrieved a relevant chunk of the 'double checked locking' page and stuffed it into the singleton page. It looks like most of the issues are in there now. I'm not sure whether it's best to condense the issues on the one page, or refactor them into lots of little pages which express each issue. I like the idea of the latter, but don't want to get in your way. Nice to see someone getting on with it. Cheers. :) -- </em><a href="RichardHenderson.html">RichardHenderson</a>.<em></em>

        Thanks for the help.

        The reason I'm doing this is because I don't think <a href="SingletonsAreEvil.html">SingletonsAreEvil</a> is a sufficiently distinct page title from <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>. I'd rather <a href="SplitByTopicNotByOpinion.html">SplitByTopicNotByOpinion</a>, so eventually we might have pages like SingletonCreation and SingletonsAreGlobal, or whatever. Moving everything to <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> is just an intermediate step. -- francis

        Wow, this is a very very bad refactoring.  This used to be a page I could direct people to.  Now, well, I guess I'll have to wait until you get rid of this page and then I'll make another one with the same title.  So, Francis, you "don't think" it is a good idea to have this page.  Perhaps, we should do some kind of poll.  I'll bet I can drum up several hundred people that "do think" it is a good idea to have this page.  One of the great values of the Wiki has been to have a place to discuss opinions.  You are in the process of destroying that value.  Perhaps, I'll move on as many others have. -- <a href="MikeCorum.html">MikeCorum</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Francis, I'm a great admirer of your work, but I think you've erred a little here; whilst the idea of "merging this page into <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> [because] it contains a lot of interesting text that would be easier to find" is a good one (information wants to be useful!), to "refactor it away into nothingness" would, I think, be an error. The name reflects an opinion which some people evidently hold, and which has attracted useful discussion; it's also a classic hackish way of naming the position. Perhaps the final form of the page should reflect its name: it should state the case and refer to problems with singletons (on their own pages) - with, if possible, a healthy dose of excessive rhetoric! -- <a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Plus then </em><a href="MikeCorum.html">MikeCorum</a> and (presumably) others would be able to direct people to a page for the specific problem they're referring to in each particular case (if they have a particular one in mind).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sorry if other people think this is a bad refactoring. I thought I was doing the right thing, but then, I never claimed to be perfect. Allow me to state my concerns, and why I did what I did, and maybe we can come to a solution that keeps everybody happy.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I remember the state of the singleton-related pages correctly in the past, there were actually three separate pages covering the topic in general: <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>, <a href="SingletonsAreGood.html">SingletonsAreGood</a>, and <a href="SingletonsAreEvil.html">SingletonsAreEvil</a>. After a time of heavy discussion all three were quite big and sprawling, which leads to problems like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The same singleton issue might be explored on all different pages.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you had a particular question about singletons, you wouldn't necessarily know where to go to ask it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So I figured that I could merge them all into the neutrally-named <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>, and spin off subtopics as necessary. I've done a similar thing on <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, swallowing pages like YouArentGonnaNeedItDiscussion but spinning off pages like <a href="ElicitingRequirements.html">ElicitingRequirements</a>, <a href="YagniAndDatabases.html">YagniAndDatabases</a>, and <a href="DoesYagniInterruptFlow.html">DoesYagniInterruptFlow</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd also like to make it clear that my attempts at refactoring are in no way an attempt to rewrite the discussion to give the "Singletons are good" side the upper hand. I don't consider it a resolved issue. <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> is, to me, the best neutral title for this material to start at. Just because I'm advocating that we do away with the page title <a href="SingletonsAreEvil.html">SingletonsAreEvil</a> does not at all mean that I'm advocating we do away with that opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        But others are saying they found the page useful for expressing a certain sort of opinion. I think that's legitimate. Maybe they're seeing a form there that I couldn't see. From my memory, it looked a lot like the original <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> page. That page goes like this:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Singletons are good. <em>No, they're not.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        And I remember the original <a href="SingletonsAreEvil.html">SingletonsAreEvil</a> reading like this:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Singletons are evil. <em>No, they're not.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        So, maybe my question is, if we'd like to maintain <a href="SingletonsAreEvil.html">SingletonsAreEvil</a> as a separate page, is there something about the form that would distinguish it from <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>? Besides, I mean, just the opinion. -- francis
      </p>
      <p>
        It would appear that the smart thing to do is to put the pros and cons in bullet points in <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>, then reference all discussion to a SingletonPatternDiscussion page. This seems to be the trend in reducing clutter and duplication for other contentious issues. I'm trying to do some of this for the document and requirements pages; work is going slooooow. -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        So then would we delete this page? -- francis
      </p>
      <p>
        Affimative. I imagine all the Singleton diatribe can be pared down to a single page, either as a pro/con <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> thing or as a point/counterpoint "discussion" between two <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> actors, a la <a href="DialecticMode.html">DialecticMode</a>. Eh?
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggest restructuring thusly: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SingletonPatternTermAsCoined.html">SingletonPatternTermAsCoined</a> (eventually just replaced by a refactored <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> that respects its heritage).

        <a href="SingletonPatternDeprecated.html">SingletonPatternDeprecated</a>
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
