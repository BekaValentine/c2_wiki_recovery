        Make Others Look Incompetent
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is different from <a href="MakeOthersBecomeIncompetent.html">MakeOthersBecomeIncompetent</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When somebody wants to look competent, but there is somebody who is more competent in the room, he can do 2 things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Make the other look incompetent by <a href="ChestThumping.html">ChestThumping</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make himself look more competent by not arguing with the other, but developing the other's idea further.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The first is an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> called <a href="MakeOthersLookIncompetent.html">MakeOthersLookIncompetent</a>, while the second is a technique called <a href="GoWithTheFlow.html">GoWithTheFlow</a> in which no one gets incompetent.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are some who use a more subtle method which could be described as down talking than chest thumping. This is to deliver an unnecessary lecture in front of a manager on a technology that the target already is very familiar with, to create the impression in the manager that the target is ignorant or incompetent. The intended target needs to find a way to try to explain his or her knowledge and competence diplomatically yet assertively; success in this will make the lecture backfire.
