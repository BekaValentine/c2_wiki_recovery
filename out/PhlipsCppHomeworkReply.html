        Some students actually copy and paste their instructor's homework<br/>
        assignments into their e-mail windows and post these. You would never<br/>
        consider doing that, would you? Did you know instructors also know how<br/>
        to use Netscape? And they could search for your name on <a href="DejaNews.html">DejaNews</a>?<br/>

        Trick. What if your MAK file says your Recycle Bin is a dependency of<br/>
        class2.cpp? It will compile each time you recycle something! This is a<br/>
        physical design issue, not a logical one. Refuse to answer the question<br/>

        Again a trick question. What if it points to dynamic data that someone<br/>
        _else_ created and will destroy? Are there any other colleges (or high<br/>

        Any line of code initializes lots of tiny little values. Your CPU<br/>

        You can get an underling (assuming you ever have one) to write the<br/>
        contents of the functions for you while you dig a hole in the sand and<br/>
        chase seagulls away from your picnic basket. Until your pager goes off.<br/>

        To increase the odds that member pointers to owned data leak memory when<br/>
        those exceptions throw. Next obvious question!<br/>

        All of them. You can make readable statements unreadable by chaining<br/>
        them all together. <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        That alphanumeric page you just got that looked like static (radio<br/>

      </code>
      <code>
        It depends on the type of 'p', the contents of Person, and what compiler<br/>
        you have. For example, VC++ will let you use certain kinds of 'p1=p'<br/>
        even when it is illegal.<br/>

        This is the subject of many books, web sites and flames. Smalltalk and<br/>
        Java proponents, for different reasons, say you write each program<br/>
        feature needed on an index card, drop them all in a bag, mix them up,<br/>
        pull one out at random, and begin the program by adding this feature.<br/>
        But there is still a stylistic difference between Java and Smalltalk.<br/>
        Java coders usually only have one index card, but Smalltalk coders<br/>
        always use 3M Post-Its.<br/>

        Pascal and FORTRAN coders (who think FORTRAN is good for power math<br/>
        [like Fermat's last theorem] and Pascal is a teaching language), say you<br/>
        must write a very small program that has the general outline of a<br/>
        program that works but does not, then keep adding little outlines until<br/>
        the program appears deep and profound. Especially if each part of the<br/>
        program contains many links and dependencies to each other part. The<br/>
        problem is there are many automated tools that do this part for you<br/>
        nowadays - write an outline of a program that compiles, contains<br/>
        literally hundreds of cross-references, but does nothing. As a result of<br/>
        this many Pascal and FORTRAN programmers are unemployed and reduced to<br/>
