        Darcs Vs Subversion
      </h1>
      <p>
        What's the difference?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>See </em><a href="http://www.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/DifferencesFromSubversion">http://www.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/DifferencesFromSubversion</a> , <a href="http://www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20060102_172958''">http://www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20060102_172958''</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the relevant differences (with resp. to <a href="ManaMana.html">ManaMana</a>) are:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Less space requirements in some situations</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Darcs is able to create a repository that doesn't include a physical copy of every file, which may be useful for keeping your repository on a usb key, for example. (see darcs get --no-pristine-tree) 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>More powerful merging</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Darcs is based on a theory of patch algebra, which allows merging to be more flexible in a lot of cases. i.e. re-naming variables 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Branching in darcs is simpler</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A new branch is just another local copy of the repository. You can selectively move patches between branches, and to/from the server. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Every workspace is a repository</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no distinction between a workspace and a repository under Darcs. So <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> under <a href="ManaMana.html">ManaMana</a> needn't employ a central root wiki. Continuations could be squirted around promiscuously a la <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>, but without expiration. Or hived off to special purpose wikis with their own concepts of <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>. All while keeping the central wiki concepts in global sync through merging. <a href="WikiDom.html">WikiDom</a> unite!
