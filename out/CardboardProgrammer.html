        Cardboard Programmer
      </h1>
      <p>
        You've just spent the whole day trying to solve a problem, a design problem, a bug, etc. You know the solution is simple but you just can't see it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A colleague walks past and notices your anguish: "What's up?".
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, I'm ...". You explain the problem and what you have done so far. However you suddenly discover the solution before you have finished speaking! So far your colleague has been as useful as a cardboard cutout.
      </p>
      <p>
        This happens often and I think it is due to you having to present your problem to someone in a way that you think will aid their understanding, often dispensing with some of the details. In doing so, you also clarify your own thoughts, untying them in your mind to eventually cite a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes all it needs is a cardboard cutout of your favorite GURU!

        This page is an excellent example of <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a>! It shows the value of converting mental problem solving models into speech descriptions. Illustrating the value of EmployingOtherAssets. In the process of verbalizing, one employs other factors of the mental process (other parts of the brain), and searches for the words which are associated with the problem model. Often when in a problem solving mode, one is "trying stuff", not "finding stuff" to solve the problem.

        Perhaps this is why in speaking to the "<a href="CardboardProgrammer.html">CardboardProgrammer</a>" one finds the solution.

        This is one of the benefits of <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>. Explaining the problem to a coworker (even a <a href="CowOrker.html">CowOrker</a>) is beneficial in and of itself. Explaining forces you to rethink the design and implementation in simple terms (since language is always simpler than thought).

        You know, folks, this is something that I've been saying for a looong time: if you can't explain it to someone else then you don't know it yer own bad sef. If you can explain it clearly to someone else then you know what you're talking about. If you can do that then you can write it down so that someone else can read it and understand it as well as you do. If that happens then you've just created a useful document, haven't you?
      </p>
      <p>
        So, why again is there all this resistance to writing stuff down? Huh?

        <em>Speaking engages different parts of the brain then writing, and thus forces a different style of cognition that helps to clarify the thoughts. Writing it down certainly should be done, but it often takes the speaking to get to the solution first.</em> -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        <strong>Hmm.</strong> That makes a great deal of sense. I'd like to find out how to engage that part of the brain that is stimulated during a spoken conversation. It would be pretty cool to get the benefit of using that part of the head-bone without actually wasting somebody else's time.
