           A dish, principally aimed at children, in which the pasta in a Minestrone is in the form of the letters of the alphabet. (In the UK, "Alphabetti Spaghetti".)

        We used to exchange media on tapes, records, and disks.  Now we use CD's, CD-ROM's, and DVD's.  Notice the apostrophes, which are proper for pluralizing alphabet soup, but I fear this helps encourage people to use them in other inappropriate place's.  I suppose we still need the acronyms to distinguish CD's from DVD's, but I wish we'd taken the 80's approach so that we could call DVD's "double-density disks".

        Why are the apostrophes <em>appropriate</em>? They seem unnecessary.

        <em>Apostrophes are acceptable for acronyms, according to most authorities I'm aware of.</em>
