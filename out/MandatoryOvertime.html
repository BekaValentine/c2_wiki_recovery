        I wonder if there is ever a type of "mandatory overtime" where the employment contract obliges employees to do overtime. Even if you receive good overtime pay, surely there is no obligation. It annoys me that people (including myself at times I'll admit) say 'yes' to overtime so freely and then talk as if they are doing it under protest. Is that what "mandatory overtime" is?

        <em>It usually means that the assigned tasks are greater than what is achievable in a notional full-time week, so you have to either do overtime or fail to meet your assigned goals (which, even if it isn't punished in itself (say, because you aren't allowed to do that under local labour laws), will get you written up as "not a team player" or the like).</em>

        And what are the EthicsOfOvertime? Should I feel obilged to do overtime if I have the opportunity? Or can I say 'no' to overtime without feeling guilty even if I only planned to watch Simpsons re-runs that evening? Do the answers to those questions change depending on how often overtime is scheduled? Do the answers change depending on how urgent overtime is? --<a href="ChrisSteinbach.html">ChrisSteinbach</a>

        In companies that abuse this, I *RELIGIOUSLY* enforce 40 hours per week. Meaning I track all hours and if I do 41 hours I will definitely do 39 (or compensate for it) down the road. I make it a rule to only do this in companies that expect it.

        <strong>Hmm.</strong> Being a greedy, money-grubbing consultant, I actively look for clients who require overtime regularly. Of course, they are paying for it all at the regular rate, so why not? More hours worked for Client A means I don't have to chase Client B down for more work, and I could care less if Client C comes up with any work at all. Until Client A goes in the tank, naturally.
