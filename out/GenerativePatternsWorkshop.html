        Generative Patterns Workshop

      <p>
        In 1993, <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> and <a href="GradyBooch.html">GradyBooch</a> called a bunch of people together to "do something with patterns".  A lot of talking was done and then, eventually, the participants (led by <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>) decided to walk out to the hillside and use <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>'s patterns to design the Center for Collaborative Object-Oriented Development where experts from all sorts of domains would come to work with Expert Object-Oriented Software folks.  During the experience, many had an Epiphany, and the <a href="HillsideGroup.html">HillsideGroup</a> was formed.
