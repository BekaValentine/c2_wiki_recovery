        Better than Solitaire.

        Much better than Solitaire. I have been playing a game called Spider Solitaire. Hardest game I've ever played. Haven't won yet. Tried to put the game on this screen, but I can't figure out how.

        Some games of <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a> have no solution [<a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/~hansb/d.freecell/freecellhtml.html].">http://www.cs.uu.nl/~hansb/d.freecell/freecellhtml.html].</a> However, the <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a> program distributed with <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> has a fixed (and relatively small) number of games, all of which have solutions except #11982.

        I used to prefer <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a>, but now I prefer Solitaire with "Draw Three" and Vegas scoring. I find it quite deep and subtle.

        <em>I use standard scoring, but always aim for the max.</em>

        <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a> and many other solitaires are available for <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> in the <em>Solitaire Till Dawn X</em> app from <a href="http://www.semicolon.com/">http://www.semicolon.com/</a> The clickability is great, and the cards feature beautiful portraits by Van Gogh, da Vinci, etc. Hmm... it's almost dawn here now...

        I think that <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a> is an excellent learning tool that gives some general guidelines as to how solve nebulous problems.  In fact, I could argue that eveything that I've needed to know about life I learned from <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a>... (see <a href="ImportantFreeCellLessons.html">ImportantFreeCellLessons</a>).
