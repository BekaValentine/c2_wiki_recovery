        <strong>Documentation-procrastination technique:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TrainUsersFirst.html">TrainUsersFirst</a>.  Train at least one user before writing any documentation for a piece of software.  While training that user, develop a one-page cheat sheet (either paper or Wiki).  Repeat process for 2nd, 3rd, 4th users, etc., until you either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Find a user willing to write documentation for the software.
        </li>
        <li>
           Have enough knowledgeable users that they support each other.
        </li>
        <li>
           Have enough cheat sheets that producing documentation is more about editing than writing.
        </li>
        <li>
           Discover your software is not usable enough yet to distribute.
        </li>
        <li>
           Realize you can't write intelligible documentation so users are just out of luck  (<a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is a good idea for documentation.  But there have been cases where the users were trained before any<em>software</em> was created.  This is generally not a good idea, although it can be a good mental exercise for generating stories.
