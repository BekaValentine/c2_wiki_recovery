        Relevant Changes Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> fills up with pages which are not about People, Projects and Patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a page called relevant changes which contains the paged accumulated during a calendar week which are Categorized under topics generally accepted as being useful for most participants, or those related to specific areas initially described when this wiki was set up. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The page is 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           maintained by a Sponsor or Sponsors
        </li>
        <li>
           provides a place where those interested can find pages which are grouped under relevant topics.
        </li>
        <li>
           resides in a file which is intended to be edited by the sponsors. 
        </li>
        <li>
           presently constructed via a manual operation, perhaps a script could construct it automatically once a day (at least).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
           How does one decide which pages are 'relevant'?
          <ul>
            <li>
               The sponsor makes his/her own observations, first by classifying by titles, then later refining by content.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A new <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a>? RelevantChange type tag? 
          <ul>
            <li>
               No
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           How does one exclude pages that are vandalized or newbie edits?
          <ul>
            <li>
               Sponsor excludes from the list
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A side effect of such a ListPage, is that the Changes page would contain listings of Pages under a Topic or Classification. It can be a Roadmap which newcomers and veterans alike could use to check out what things were happening without having to sort through the TestPages, PageDeletionWars and other such pages.

        First of all, I think it's a great idea, so kudos to Donald (or whoever came up with it if it's not Donald). It's such a great idea that it deserves to be automated somehow, so in any case it is intended to be one of the features in <a href="WikiChangeProposal.html">WikiChangeProposal</a> (if you excuse the plug). Second, it's such an interesting coincidence that this idea that is rediscovered anew (just like wcp was rediscovered anew) and the first who pioneered is still <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>, see <a href="SignificantRecentChanges.html">SignificantRecentChanges</a> [the original has a spelling error], <a href="ChangeSummary.html">ChangeSummary</a>, <a href="ChangeSummaryDiscussion.html">ChangeSummaryDiscussion</a>. So history repeats itself in very interesting ways, hopefully not like in GroundHogDay.

        The risks involved are political disagreements and disagreements on what's relevant and what's not, but I think bickering over such things is not very relevant now as relevant changes is unlikely to have approached the popularity of normal <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> (quick, new and other varieties). If anything, I think the controversy is based on the high expectations people have to get this thing "right".

        I would suggest a different analysis. For each category in <a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a>, create a page that contains a list of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> of pages only in that category. <strong>CategoryWikiRecentChanges</strong>, or possibly <strong>RecentChangesByCategory</strong> might be an example. This could be auto-generated, and would allow people to search for changes by category. If you like, this can be augmented by a new category, <strong></strong>CategoryCoreTopic<strong>, which can be put on those pages strongly related to </strong><a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a>. Now you automatically have relevant changes.

        <em>And you could even highlight the topical parts by looking if they have a topic tag of the current month. -- </em><a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Er, if it's in recent changes, doesn't that make it topical?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>That would be a good feature, particularly if implemented also in the RSS feed, to support </em><a href="AggregationOnTheClient.html">AggregationOnTheClient</a>. I still think that a human edited relevant changes would be useful in addition to that. -- Costin<em></em>

        [Now that I have looked at this page a few more times, I think the concept is a good one, especially if gnoming work is filtered out first (manually?). I don't know whether people here is familiar with related work elsewhere, similar to PageClusters and a filtered <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> on <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> and <a href="CommunityWiki.html">CommunityWiki</a>. There is always room to <a href="RefactorTheWheel.html">RefactorTheWheel</a>.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [And I should suggest a <strong>RecentRandomPages</strong> list of 50 pages, to be sourced on the Filteredrelevant changes over a 52 week period, and regenerated weekly. The target audience would be someone who comes here every month or so for a visit.]
      </p>
      <p>
        With the explosion of information and the number of places many people visit, it is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> if a means of managing information such as is proposed here is continued.
