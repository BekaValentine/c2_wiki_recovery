        Collaboration Explosion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Now that the <a href="WikiSpringCleaning.html">WikiSpringCleaning</a> is over we can resume efforts in CollaborativeParticipation in the areas, topics and categories that interest us most.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ward indicated that we may expect a wave of of newbies as a result of increasing levels of exposure of the <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>. This together with the appearance of publications and books on agile methods and XP methodologies will promote a curioustiy which will result in the visitation of several thousand visitors.  
      </p>
      <p>
        While the visitors may be new to Wiki, many of them will be quite accomplished in their own fields of endeavour, and could have a significant effect on the creation of new pages, topics and categories that have not yet appeared.  Since the majority will have computer backgrounds, their interests will be quite compatible to this place.  
      </p>
      <p>
        We can be helpful in getting the newcomers to feel at home by welcoming them when they create their home page. This can be done by expressing interest in their background and what interests them.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I was welcomed and encouraged when I posted my first page, and now this wiki is a place I visit at least 3 or 4 times a week. There is already a legacy of good, informative, professional pages in the first 20000 pages, let us encourage the creation of additional high quality pages and participate in the ongoing dialogue of improvement by making our comments and interactions constructive and communicative.  The <a href="CollaborationExplosion.html">CollaborationExplosion</a> is only beginning.
