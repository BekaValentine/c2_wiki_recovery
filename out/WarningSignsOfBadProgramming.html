        Warning Signs Of Bad Programming
      </h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
           That slight tension of the brows which reminds you that mental effort is required to understand the program.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>Unless of course it was written by a programmer who understands more patterns than you do. It is possible to write a very clean, simple, beautiful program that another-probably less experienced-programmer would find baffling. For example, if you have no exposure to patterns using a </em><a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>, code that uses them can be pretty baffling until you realize what's going on.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, '<a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> earlier statement (to create loop)' is what may confuse; '<a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> later statement (within scope!)' is relatively harmless.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I disagree - </em><a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> earlier statement to create a loop is ok, going forward is bad ... and any use of <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> is usually a sign that something is wrong. -- <a href="NissimHadar.html">NissimHadar</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> isn't usually needed for loops, whereas those who don't use it to go forward usually achieve much the same thing with nested IF statements instead, and end up with something less easy to understand than it would have been if <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> had been used. (I'm referring to what tends to confuse rather than suggesting that <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> <em>should</em> be used.)

        For me, personally, overly-long methods together with badly-named variables and methods are the number one sign. For if the person doesn't even bother or know how to refactor his methods, the same will probably be true for his classes and his program. At least, that's what I guess. -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>

        Well, I guess it's all those puzzled looks and statements of "we don't really know why our software is so unreliable, hard to support and hard to maintain; we write lots of code, but it always seems so difficult." -- anon

        In a language like perl or C,

      <ul>
        <li>
           Reference fields with offsets instead of names (foo[0] instead of foo->bar)

           Use arrays instead of structs or classes

           Use too-cryptic variable names (sc instead of sampleCount)

           No white space (long lines, no vertical space between functions, no indents)

        I have found that <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a> is very often to blame, as well. From <a href="BadProgrammer.html">BadProgrammer</a>:

        <em>One of the best coders I ever knew was a notably </em><a href="BadProgrammer.html">BadProgrammer</a>. We've all <a href="SeenThisPattern.html">SeenThisPattern</a>: he can write code faster than he can design it, so when he needs a the same operation done in fourteen different places, rather than write one function to handle all fourteen cases, he writes fourteen slightly different functions scattered about the code. Multiply this by the number of times he's done this and by the number of changes that have to be applied to each similar function, and you have a maintenance nightmare that can bring a project to it's knees.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not buying it; I can normally design the function in much less time than it would take me to find the 14 insertion points and hit control-V - much less make and verify the minor modifications (of course, the tests are the real verification regardless, but I always want my tests to pass the first time, and I'm <strong>much</strong> more confident calling a function than modifying copy-and-pasted code). Seriously, <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a> <strong>slows you down</strong> in most cases, <strong>even initially</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I teach students how to refactor the duplication out, yes, but I also emphasize the importance of avoiding it (at least in trivial cases) in the first place - you should only have to refactor it out of someone <strong>else's</strong> code ;)

        Code starts to smell after a while even when doing "good" programming, unless you refactor your code. Bad programming makes it stink immediately.

        <strong>UML diagrams</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="UmlDiagram.html">UmlDiagram</a>s that are considered design. Any real engineer knows the difference between the <em>plan</em> and the <em>design.</em> Real designs are such that Boeing can estimate the mass of one of their planes within a couple hundred kilograms from the design alone. <em>By weighing the design doc and taking that as the estimate, right? ;)</em> In software, <a href="TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign.html">TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign</a>. UML is the plan, and as such, should not take more than a couple weeks to write, if at all - we do iterative design in software, after all. Really, they should rarely exist because UML diagrams communicate very little. Not only are UML diagrams C++ dependent (C++ in pictures!), but they are chiefly used to communicate class relationships. Class relationships are apparent from the codebase. Not many people write interaction diagrams.

        <dd><em>Yay to this, with bells on. UML as I've seen it used is a great way to cast everything in cast-iron and stop any refactoring ('because it takes too long to update the model').

        Actually, this gives me an idea. Next time I get trapped in a useless "design" meeting, I'm going to ask where the interaction diagram is. That should delay the wankers for another two months. ;) -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        "Any real engineer" knows that various design resolutions are needed for non-trivial products.  For a software application, there is a resolution where the whole application is one box in an enterprise services deployment diagram.  Then there is a worms-eye-view of the product in the code. For resolutions in between these two, UML models are effective and economical. For non-trivial products, there are a lot of risks and design issues you want handled well above the code. Modeling is how you do that. If UML is getting in the way of code refactoring, you aren't using it properly. If you are trying to do high level design in code, you are using the wrong tool, and that is Bad Programming. --<a href="MarcThibault.html">MarcThibault</a>

        I would suggest that the warning signs of bad programming are not important or enlightening; all programs will show signs of bad programming.  The key issue is whether something is being done to address the bad programming.  Face it, sooner or later we all are going to write something that we wished we didn't at some later time.  If a project has a legitimate, above ground refactoring process, the sections of bad programming will get uncovered and fixed.  If not, the project is just hoping everyone writes perfect code, without fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We have to be able to spot bad code, but we must use this power for good and not for evil, to improve the system rather than to blame someone for wrecking it. Improving the code and the process that produces it is constructive; blaming people is destructive. So it's better to identify </em><a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s than <a href="BadProgrammer.html">BadProgrammer</a>s.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nonetheless, we often put too much focus on code and not enough on process. You can rearchitect and rebuild all you want; but if you keep doing what you've always done, you'll keep getting what you've always gotten. Without practices like </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> and <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>, your designs will continue to degenerate, no matter how much thought you put into architecture.<em></em>
