        Act Instead Of Complain
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you see a problem that needs correction, the most effective thing to do is often to fix it yourself. This is usually much more effective than complaining about it (see <a href="JustCorrectDontPoint.html">JustCorrectDontPoint</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can't fix the problem yourself (because it is too big, or because you have no influence), presenting a realistic plan to those who can fix it is an action that is a lot more effective than complaining.

        You may think you don't have the power or authority to make the necessary changes. But just try it - you may be surprised at how easy it is to effect change. <a href="ActBoldly.html">ActBoldly</a>.

        <em>However, it can be an </em><a href="AlarmBellPhrase.html">AlarmBellPhrase</a> if your manager is telling you to do this. I spent several years in a company where I was told this every time I tried to discuss what I thought needed to be changed. When I acted, I couldn't make it happen, and this got pretty soul-destroying. Eventually, I did change my organization, and left, and found it really was the organization, and not me, that couldn't change.<em></em>

        There is an old saying that it is easier to obtain forgiveness than permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And in some organizations, that screed is proudly repeated. And it works - until the day comes when permission wasn't sought and forgiveness becomes required - in which case, it often turns out to be the case that permission </em>'is<em>' easier to obtain than forgiveness. It all depends on how badly you screw up. :)</em>

        Complaints are 1) Identification of the problem, and 2) Catharsis. While overuse of this technique can indicate avoidance of actual solutions, this is not necessarily so.

        <a href="LookForTheDeepReason.html">LookForTheDeepReason</a>. Don't just fix problems out of hand. It is better to act than to complain, but a lot of the time it's better to <em>think</em> before acting.

        One needs to be sensitive while applying this rule. A lot of turbulence on <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> is caused by deciding to fix problems that are not seen as problems by the rest of the community.
