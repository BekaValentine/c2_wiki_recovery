        Qualifying Employees
      </h1>
      <p>
        Suppose one is looking for an employee, and wants one that will integrate well and happily with your XP team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suggestions from the <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Have the interviewee pair program with one or more members of the team (both to see how well they do and to get them over the 'fear factor' of pair programming)
        </li>
        <li>
           Give them the book XPE, ask them to read it, and get back to you with Thoughtful Reactions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other ideas?
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps rephrasing the question: What skills enable developers to contribute to an XP team?
