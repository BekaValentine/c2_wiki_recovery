        <strong></strong>TeX: The Program<strong> (ISBN 0-201-13437-3) is the name of a book written by </strong><a href="DonKnuth.html">DonKnuth</a> which contains the <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a> documentation output of the source code to the typesetting language TeX.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not only a good example of how to mix documentation and programming, but is a very good catalog of then-cutting-edge algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is an interesting question: What Patterns could be derived from studying the TeX system of documentation? Perhaps one day someone could produce a <a href="TexThePatterns.html">TexThePatterns</a> book.

        TeX is the last hurrah of procedural/functional structured (read: non-OO) programming. Do not take as a criticism; in fact, I stand in awe at what was achieved without some of the modern code-structuring tools we have today. I don't think the modern programmer raised in an OO culture could do the same. I anticipate obtaining this book and learning from it. -- <a href="DavidBrantley.html">DavidBrantley</a>

        TeX being <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a>, you can get the source of the program/the book on the web:
      </p>
      <code>
        % wget <a href="http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Build/source/texk/web2c/tex.web">http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Build/source/texk/web2c/tex.web</a><br/>
        % weave tex.web # You need the WEB system for this command. It is included in some TeX distributions<br/>
        % tex tex.tex<br/>
        % xdvi tex.dvi<br/>
      </code>

        <em>Perhaps this statement should wait until there is a comparable (size, complexity) success in OO programming ;) </em>

        You don't need the smiley there.  TeX has been frozen and bug-free since 1982.  It is truly a <a href="SoftwareMasterpiece.html">SoftwareMasterpiece</a>.

        Not quite frozen: <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news03.html">http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news03.html</a>

        Perhaps it is time to try to go beyond: <a href="TeXmacs.html">TeXmacs</a> is a free scientific text editor, which was inspired by both TeX and GNU Emacs. See <a href="http://www.texmacs.org/">http://www.texmacs.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.alqua.com/tmresources/.">http://www.alqua.com/tmresources/.</a>

        What are the top competitors to TeX? I imagine there are some XML-based protocols floating around.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm not sure there are any actual competitors, but there are a couple alternatives: Lout (</em><a href="http://snark.ptc.spbu.ru/~uwe/lout/lout.html),">http://snark.ptc.spbu.ru/~uwe/lout/lout.html),</a> which is similar to TeX but somewhat cleaned up, and Skribe (<a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Skribe/)">http://www-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Skribe/)</a> which is Scheme-based and can do some pretty neat things.<em></em>

        I guess XSL FO based solutions are serious competitors, or at least they will be when FO-to-<a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> processors that output with the same professional quality as TeX does will be available. And they certainly will be, as XSL FO is a "standard" of W3C, and basically whatever they do (good or bad), the IT industry will force it on people. Of course, when I put TeX and FO based solutions into the same category, then I'm speaking about TeX as a typesetting/making-up system, and I don't talk about higher level applications as LaTeX. In my point of view, the source document is in a content centric (as oposed to presentation centric) format like <a href="DocBook.html">DocBook</a>, which a program converts to a presentation centrict format as TeX file or XSL FO XML file, which then goes through a making-up system (as the TeX program or an FO-to-<a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> processor) to produce the final high quality paged output (which is stored as DVI or <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> or PDF). And, I have to emphasize that unlike TeX, the XSL FO "standard" itself doesn't implement or define any concrete making-up system, but the point is that XSL FO based solutions may will take over the lead, so FO is a competitor.
