        Community Of Practice
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="CommunityOfPractice.html">CommunityOfPractice</a> is a group of people who are in some sense defined by their task. Here's one definition [1]:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Community of Practice: A group of practitioners involved in a common activity, albeit performing different roles. Essential characteristics of communities of practice are: 1) they are not defined by organizational mandate (e.g., the "org chart"), but rather by the ways people actually work together, 2) they involve many different "roles", as opposed to a flat structure, and 3) they experience a ongoing flux of community members, who enter the community from the periphery and gain status as knowledgeable members through participation in the community of practice.</dd>

        Here's another [2], from a page devoted to the topic.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>A Community of Practice (COP) is a special type of informal network that emerges from a desire to work more effectively or to understand work more deeply among members of a particular specialty or work group. At the simplest level, CoPs are small groups of people who've worked together over a period of time and through extensive communication have developed a common sense of purpose and a desire to share work-related knowledge and experience.</dd>

        Here's a final one, from a book on <a href="LegitimatePeripheralParticipation.html">LegitimatePeripheralParticipation</a>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>A community of practice is a set of relations among persons, activity, and world, over time and in relation with other tangential and overlapping communities of practice. A community of practice is an intrinsic condition for the existence of knowledge...</dd>

        In my so-far cursory reading, some additional features stick out:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Personal identity is bound up with the task that defines the community. For example, someone might refer to himself as a "hacker" (in either the old sense of compulsive programmer or in the new sense of security cracker) or a "Smalltalk programmer". Despite the emphasis on the verb (what one does), this statement also implies a great deal about what one <strong>is</strong>. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Learning is done by telling stories to each other and by performing ever-more-central tasks. This is called <a href="LegitimatePeripheralParticipation.html">LegitimatePeripheralParticipation</a>.

           "Learning, from this point of view, is not simply a matter of acquiring information; it requires developing the disposition, demeanor, and outlook of the practitioners." -- John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid. That's why saying "I'm a hacker" is a statement that usually says much more than "I program a lot". 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Reputation plays a central role. In the crudest terms, there are "masters" and "apprentices". A person's life within the community tends to be "centripetal" - it is important to move closer to mastery of the task.
