        Founder of Fog Creek Software, which makes an HTML editor/content manager called <a href="CityDesk.html">CityDesk</a>, and, in many people's opinion, exceptionally nice bug tracking software called FogBugz.

               That fact probably has more to do with "Spolsky" than "On Software".  I bought his book before I ever remembered the name Spolsky long enough to tell it to a friend. -- <a href="SteveJorgensen.html">SteveJorgensen</a>

        He does something similar to XP's <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> - it's more-or-less the prioritization part without the scheduling.

        JS has a clean and vivid writing style - a major acheivement considering the subjects. The drawback is when he's completely wrong he is very hard to counter. --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        His essay on "Five Worlds" -- <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FiveWorlds.html">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FiveWorlds.html</a> -- sheds a lot of light on his skepticism about XP. XP methodologies are very effective in corporate-internal development like the storied C3 project, where requirements can change at any time over the course of the project, but they don't exactly add a whole lot when writing shrink-wrap software (his preferred world), and they'd probably be actively obstructive in embedded-software and game development. (There's a reason embedded and games are almost exclusively <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.)
