        Goto Considered Harmful
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>For those too young to remember the goto statement, it was used much as Exceptions are today, but had a more concise, elegant syntax #gotocph</em> --@bigballofmud <a href="BrianFoote.html">BrianFoote</a>

        In 1978, Berkeley scientists did a study on the effects of <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> on rats. Twenty rats in a control group were fed a normal diet, while twenty other rats were forced to program in Apple BASIC. Their health was to be monitored for a month, but after two weeks all of the rats in the programming group had melted into a dense goo that tasted a little like quiche. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But some rats learned to execute GOTO END_OF_MAZE, and finished in record time, while the nested block rats took too long to climb into and out of nested boxes to get to the end.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Seriously, though, don't use <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> statements. Like any four letter words, they are not appropriate for polite company.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unless of course, failure to use goto results in the code being more buggy and unreadable. Also, there are the hidden </em>'gotos<strong> (in </strong><a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>) such as <strong>continue</strong>, <strong>break</strong>, or a mid-function <strong>return</strong> which the extremists generally lump in. Personally, I have seen code which introduced a number of extra <strong>control</strong> booleans, doubled the number of lines of code with a factor of ten indentation blocks (the stuff that wraps 3 times on an 80 column screen) to be <strong>pure</strong> and was not correct due to the twisted logic. In the end, there are those who write bad unreadable code no matter what constructs they limit themselves to, and those who write good/obvious code no matter what constructs they use. I like to ask about gotos during interviews to at least see whether the candidate has thought about the issues, or simply regurgitates the dogma.<em> - </em><a href="ChrisHyser.html">ChrisHyser</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a good rule of thumb: don't use <em>backward</em> <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> statements. Notice that <strong>continue</strong>, <strong>break</strong>, and mid-function <strong>return</strong> statements are all forward gotos (and switch is a computed forward goto). <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a>'s argument does not apply to them. I have noticed subjectively that they aren't confusing, unless you jump into something else (like the middle of a loop - see <a href="DuffsDevice.html">DuffsDevice</a>). I don't think there's anything wrong with using <strong>goto</strong> to do, for example, a double break. Forward gotos are also useful for jumping to cleanup code after an error - they're often much more readable than doing your real work inside an if statement, and they're always more readable than doing your real work in a terraced landscape of nested if statements. (<a href="SyntaxMatters.html">SyntaxMatters</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Backward <strong>gotos</strong> could be <em>ok</em> when it makes sense that your error case would repeat the last iteration. I like to call it <em>rare looping.</em>
        A good example exists in beej's networking guide. <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/">http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/</a> See section 8. <strong>Why does select() keep falling out on a signal?</strong>

        In this article he makes some compelling arguments for why GO TO (and its relatives) are useful. For example he demonstrates how a jump <em>into the middle of a loop</em> can be elegant (example 6c). The article also presents some constructs which could be considered a primitive form of exception handling. (He also mentions the <a href="ComeFrom.html">ComeFrom</a> statement, BTW.)

        A summary of <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a>'s original paper:
      </p>
      <p>
        We write programs as lines of text in a file. But our programs execute as microseconds of clock cycles in a machine. We as programmers think in terms of the lines of text, but what really matters is what happens during the microseconds of clock cycles. Therefore, we should make the relationship between the two as easy to understand as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dijkstra used a set of so-called coordinates to show how far along the program execution is at any given point. For a straight piece of code, we can simply cite the file and line number to show how far along the program execution is. For a function call, we provide a call stack. For a loop, we give the number of iterations so far executed in the loop. Dijkstra reasoned that if you can state a set of such coordinates at each point during the execution of the program, then it's clear enough how the lines of text map to the microseconds of clock cycles.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also reasoned that many uses of <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> break this understanding, because in <a href="SpaghettiCode.html">SpaghettiCode</a>, it becomes impossible to state, at some points during the execution of the program, how far along the program is.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It is important to understand that Dijkstra wrote his paper at a time when people used <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>s without ControlConstructs, and thus their programs were littered with gotos -- <a href="SpaghettiCode.html">SpaghettiCode</a>. It does not follow that a 10,000 line C program is poisoned by one goto; leaping to that conclusion is an example of <a href="ThinkingInCliches.html">ThinkingInCliches</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There are two major approaches to programming: <em>[is there a page that covers this? there should be]</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pragmatic: <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s should be considered on a case by case basis
        </li>
        <li>
           Purist: all <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s should be avoided, no exceptions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ...And therefore a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> is a hint of possible bad practice to a pragmatist, but a sure sign of bad practice to a purist.
      </p>
      <p>
        For purists, the rule is simple: don't use GOTOs. This is not hard in any language. Even in assembler, one can write macros that simulate structured control constructs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For pragmatists, I think it's important to notice that even Dijkstra(as I recall) and Wirth (definitely) admit that there are certain circumstances when GOTOs are best practice: to exit deeply nested structures (of IFs/FORs/WHILEs) in case of unrecoverable error, because doing so with a goto results in far more readable code than does the same code rewritten to test for FATAL_ERROR everywhere. E.g.
      </p>
      <code>
        for (i=0; i<10; i++) {<br/>
        for (j=0; j<10; j++) {<br/>
        for (k=0; k<10; k++) {<br/>
        if (NOT_FOUND == find(i, j, k))<br/>
        goto error;<br/>
        func1(i, j, k);<br/>
        }<br/>
        func2(i, j, k);<br/>
        }<br/>
        func3(i, j, k);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        error:
      </p>
      <code>
        ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Compared with
      </p>
      <code>
        FATAL_ERROR = 0;<br/>
        for (i=0; i<10 && !FATAL_ERROR; i++) {<br/>
        for (j=0; j<10 && !FATAL_ERROR; j++) {<br/>
        for (k=0; k<10 && !FATAL_ERROR; k++) {<br/>
        if (NOT_FOUND == find(i, j, k))<br/>
        FATAL_ERROR = 1;<br/>
        if (!FATAL_ERROR)<br/>
        func1(i, j, k);<br/>
        }<br/>
        if (!FATAL_ERROR)<br/>
        func2(i, j, k);<br/>
        }<br/>
        if (!FATAL_ERROR)<br/>
        func3(i, j, k);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ...where you can hardly see the code amidst the references to FATAL_ERROR.
      </p>
      <p>
        ABOUT THE CODE ABOVE: I would say all this code is wrong. The call of func2 cannot be outside k loop. func3 cannot be outside j loop. using the goto construct clearly shows that this code is designed wrongly. A better designed code would automatically lead to code without goto statements. Yes, (as below) this code really SMELLS, or even better the design SMELLS. Deaply nested structures are also mostly bad code design (also below). Clearly you don't understand Dijkstra by making such claims. Not fixing SMELLY code leads to high cost in maintenance and updates of the code. So tolerating bad code (as below) is a bad management decision.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Let's say, just for the sake of argument, that func2 and func3 are not really functions on (i,j,k) but just some series of statements that happen after the nested for, which was clearly the point of the example. And as for "designed wrongly", how do you know that without any context? What if you're doing multiplication or other operations on matrices? Just try avoiding nested loops.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>If I recall correctly, this is was part of the reason (was it </em><a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> or <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>) chose that name for the term. They wanted to emphasize the pragrammatic view of <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s by the connotation of the word "smell". If something smells, it definitely needs to be checked out, but it may not actually need fixing or might have to just be tolerated.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Deeply nested structures themselves are a </em><a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> (cf. <a href="ArrowAntiPattern.html">ArrowAntiPattern</a>), but yeah, sometimes they are indeed unavoidable.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For simple cases, it is generally preferable to use "return" rather than "goto". It can be considered to be a form of goto, and some dislike it more than GOTOs (it violates the single entry/single exit condition for functions), but others prefer it:
      </p>
      <code>
        for (i=0; i<10; i++) {<br/>
        for (j=0; j<10; j++) {<br/>
        for (k=0; k<10; k++) {<br/>
        if (NOT_FOUND == find(i, j, k)) {<br/>
        complain(NOT_FOUND);<br/>
        return;<br/>
        }<br/>
        func1(i, j, k);<br/>
        }<br/>
        func2(i, j, k);<br/>
        }<br/>
        func3(i, j, k);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        sub complain(complaint) {<br/>
        // pass along complaint and then do whatever was in error:<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ...but this is not directly possible if more work remains to be done following the loops. (Even then, refactoring may save the day.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people agree that, in languages that support exceptions, this would be an ideal place to throw one, and since setjmp/longjmp is merely a non-local goto, it, too, is justifiable for error recovery. Exceptions, in languages that support them, are a more controlled means of doing exactly the same thing: a non-local goto!
      </p>
      <p>
        The same reasoning leads to the conclusion that GOTOs or their equivalents could be used anytime there is a need to immediately escape from deeply nested control structures and/or functions, e.g. upon finding the target of an extensive search, not just on fatal error.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question is merely, does the GOTO improve legibility or lessen it. In almost all circumstances it lessens it, but there are exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, since exceptions are a type of GOTO, <strong>precisely</strong> the same reasoning applies to them: most of the places they <strong>could</strong> be used for non-error processing, they should not be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am under the impression that a function call was considered an acceptable alternative to a GOTO, even in the original debate about GOTO's. An exception system makes things even easier (although the Java exception system is fundamentally broken compared to several of those that preceded it).</em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Throwing an exception is nothing like a calling a function, because control never returns to the caller (the thrower).</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Yes, in this particular example, I personally would agree that using "complain(NOT_FOUND); return;" as in the code above is preferable to the goto in my previous example, and don't get me wrong, that's what I usually do in this precise circumstance. But:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Many people think that return out of the middle of a function is just as bad, stylistically, as the goto you replaced, because it violates the single-entry single-exit condition for functions.
        </li>
        <li>
           If there is further work to be done in the current function, then using return won't work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (Just wanted to throw in that quick comment before I returned to the stuff below later, which is getting messy.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Returning from the middle of a function is language-dependent. Zillions of languages, and in particular Pascal, viewed as the king of the structured languages in the 1970s when <a href="GotoConsideredHarmful.html">GotoConsideredHarmful</a> was a new hot subject, did not allow return from the middle of a function. <em>Which is a very good example of why those languages have now been replaced by </em><a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> or its descendents. On the other hand, by the time I started coding in Pascal in 1982, return could be called anyplace you wanted. The difference between a "procedure" and a "function" was that we had to assign a value to the function name in order to return a value from a function. I'm pretty sure that's how the language works today, but I haven't coded it in twenty years.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pascal (at least the version described by Wirth in <em>Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs</em> and <em>Systematic Programming: An Introduction</em>) could not return from the middle of a function, but it <em>did</em> have a goto statement, which Wirth used in the mini-compiler at the end of <em>Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs</em> in order to handle an error by jumping to near the end of a function. See page 301. He not only does a goto, but he goes to a label inside of a <em>calling function</em>! For example, the following only prints out "there":
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        program test;<br/>
        label 10;<br/>
        begin<br/>
        goto 10;<br/>
        writeln('hello');<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          :
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        writeln('there')<br/>
        end.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Given that, can you see that all this about exceptions and returns is just nitpicking? The point is that sometimes, in some languages, GOTOs are best practice. <em>No, I don't think a GOTO such as you're proposing has EVER been "best practice". I haven't even looked at a Pascal manual in twenty years, so I've long since forgotten what the Pascal syntax is or was for this situation. It surely did NOT include GOTO as "best practice", however (given Pascal's role as the first "structured" language". Wirth and all that.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it true all the time in all languages? Of course not. Some languages aren't even imperative to start with. Or don't even have a GOTO.
      </p>
      <p>
        And even with your purported solution in C, surely you don't think that using a return will <strong>always</strong> be better than a GOTO-on-error? In a more complicated function, when return is the wrong thing to do, because one needs to get out of deep nesting but not leave the function yet, refactoring will always allow you to fix that? Always? I don't think so. <em>In more than twenty years of coding, it always has for me.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And even if it were true, the refactoring might have to wait for another day, and until it happens, the GOTO solution might be the best interim one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nitpicks: death of a thousand cuts.

I don't even know the syntax these days. The paragraph at the top cites "return" as a forward GOTO, which Dykstra's argument did not apply to. Nitpick all you want. If you find it a "best practice", be my guest. If I'm supporting code like we were talking about here, I'll replace it with my function call.

      <p>
        My concept of a function is that it takes input, tries to do some processing and reports - as soon as possible - either a result, or an indication that processing was impossible for some reason, in which case the input data should be (still in | returned to) its original state.

        Which is why you wrap the current bit of work up in a function. Forward GOTOs can be removed, generally speaking, by <a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a> and allowing returns from the middle of the new function. Of course, the same potential problems arise here (mainly, potentially having to pass in a large amount of context) as when refactoring away <a href="TrivialDoWhileLoop.html">TrivialDoWhileLoop</a>. But how did your code ever get <strong>that</strong> complicated?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's not necessarily that complicated, all it takes is any amount of further work at the end of the function, e.g.:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        func() {
      </p>
      <code>
        while(condition()) {<br/>
        work1();<br/>
        if (fatal_error()) goto done;<br/>
        work2();<br/>
        }<br/>
        done:<br/>
        x = sqrt(x) + x*x*x;<br/>
        work3();<br/>
        return work4();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's not complicated, but you can't change the goto into a return without </em><a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a> or something...and yes, a purist will want to do exactly that refactoring, but a pragmatist may believe that it is more important to keep all of the related work together in one place where it is easier to understand and grasp all at once.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>To a pragmatist, it's not a question of being forced to use a goto unwillingly, it's a question of whether it will increase readability in some circumstances such as this. A purist will insist that the pragmatist shouldn't have that freedom, or that the result will inherently be less readable. There isn't a "right" answer at this point, because there isn't agreement on the premises used to deduce an answer.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The example given is trivial to refactor: 
      </p>
      <code>
        func_loop() {<br/>
        while(condition()) {<br/>
        work1();<br/>
        if (fatal_error()) return;<br/>
        work2();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        func() {<br/>
        func_loop();<br/>
        x = sqrt(x) + x*x*x;<br/>
        work3();<br/>
        return work4();    <br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        As long as the two functions are nearby in the source file, readability shouldn't suffer, and if you can give a <a href="MeaningfulName.html">MeaningfulName</a> to the loop, it should even increase (as you don't need to keep the context for func() in mind when looking at the loop. But a simple variation on this becomes much more difficult to refactor:
      </p>
      <code>
        func(num, str) {<br/>
        x = num / 2 + 34;<br/>
        y = substr(0, x, str);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        while(condition(x, y)) {<br/>
        y = work1(x, str);<br/>
        if (fatal_error()) goto done;<br/>
        x = work2(y, num);<br/>
        }<br/>
        do_regular_termination(x, y);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        done:<br/>
        x = sqrt(num) * y*x*x;<br/>
        str = work3(x, num);<br/>
        return work4(y, str);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The addition of local variables means that <a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a> would need a parameter list of 4 variables, and would need to return both x and y (meaning a struct in most languages). The problem persists if you try to do an <a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a> on 'done:' and tail-call that from the loop and at the end of the function: you'd need to pass in x, y, and num.

        This illustrates a legitimate use for <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a>:  control flow transfer out of a loop where there's a large amount of lexical context that the loop requires. It also illustrates why <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> is a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> - most algorithms shouldn't need this much context, and it's worth trying to see if the algorithm can be simplified before reaching for the <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a>.

        <em>Yes, it is, because it's contrived. It's not complicated in, say, number of statements or variables, but those are the wrong measures of complexity.

        Dijkstra's article really addressed the issue that a goto in the middle of a loop with an autoindex causes difficulty in understanding program flow. In that limited sense the argument is strong. He didn't address at all the use of goto in general coding practice, other than a general comment in his introduction that quality of programming was inversely related to goto density. kd4ttc

        I <em>looove</em> the labeled block in java: it makes people's hair stand on end.

        <em>This is pretty awkward. It looks like a backward goto but it really is a forward goto. Confusing. Maybe they should have had it typed out "{ ...; break found_ok; } : found_ok;" This would clearly indicate the start and destination of the jump.</em>

        Why not <a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a> it? Here's how in <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> you can use a sub to return a value, instead of a block and having to throw an exception:
      </p>
      <code>
        sub found_ok {<br/>
        my @items = @_; <br/>
        foreach (@items) {<br/>
        return 1 if $_ eq "foo";<br/>
        } <br/>
        return; # gives undef<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then you can handle the result of the check a little more cleanly with "if (found_ok(@things))". Of course, this depends on if you think <a href="InternalLoopExitsAreOk.html">InternalLoopExitsAreOk</a> or not.

        What about this C function:
      </p>
      <code>
        void someFunc()<br/>
        {<br/>
        T *X1, *X2;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        X1 = (T*)malloc(...);<br/>
        ...<br/>
        if (FAILED(func1())<br/>
        goto clean1;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        X2 = (T*)malloc(...);<br/>
        ...<br/>
        if (FAILED(func2())<br/>
        goto clean2;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        clean2:<br/>
        free(X2);<br/>
        clean1:<br/>
        free(X1);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Am I supposed to make a function call per malloc? These gotos produce essentially the same code as would class instances with destructors in C++. Fragmenting such a function to avoid gotos can and will reduce readability, as well as force you to think up useless function names like someFuncBeforeAllocatingX2(). Sometimes this refactoring can be done nicely, sometimes not.

        If clauses are a good solution, but it bothers me that this issue of destruction interferes with the flow of the program presented to the programmer. By that I mean, in C++ the same function would look like (given T_wrapper that that does the needed [de]allocation during [de]construction and has operator T*:
      </p>
      <p>
        void someFunc() {
      </p>
      <code>
        T_wrapper X1;<br/>
        if (FAILED(func1()))<br/>
        return;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        T_wrapper X2;<br/>
        if (FAILED(func2()))<br/>
        return;<br/>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        And it seems to me that what I wrote looks closer to the form I want, compared with the code that puts ... inside if clauses. 
        Besides, it can get more complicated than this example, if the last ... is something like two or three nested for statements that can terminate at any time, I'd like to goto cleanup2 there also.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gotos implement destruction; I don't think of them as part of the flow control of the "actual" program. I'm merely emulating C++ here. It's similar to using function pointer tables to emulate virtual in C. It looks uglier of course, but this is strictly in the syntax level. Of course, hand-crafted emulation is prone to errors, and it would be best to do it using a C++ to C compiler, if only I could find one.

        <em>Why not pass a function pointer to a function that allocates T, calls the function pointer function and then deallocates T?</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        That's an extra virtual call (call [ecx]) per allocation, and you have to split someFunc() into parts (each time you allocate something, you need another function like someFuncAfter3Allocations()) which is exactly what I was trying to avoid. I don't see how that is more acceptable in any possible sense than using cleanup labels at the end to emulate destruction.
