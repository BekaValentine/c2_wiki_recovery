      <p>
        In the following example, I will attempt (feebly) to
        show a possibly natural and reasonable (more or less)
        development for a situation which is finally recognized
        as "bad" in order to motivate the description of an
        amelioration pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, take a situation in which three streams of
        chronological data are processed sequentially: the first
        to completion, then the second stream, then the third.
        Each stream represents a particular type of data.  The
        situation may have arisen because it was thought simple
        to isolate the processing due to a given type of data.
        This happens in "phase one" of the project.  (Perhaps, in
        a phase zero, the first data stream's processing was
        implemented -- and the second and third stream-tasks
        were rip-offs.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, assert the desire to process the elements of the
        streams in an interleaved fashion.  We are in phase
        three of the project.  This desire is asserted for
        several reasons.  The existing sequential multi-stream
        processing
        situation includes adjustments in the processing of
        later streams due to elements being chronologically
        earlier than some elements already processed from the
        previous streams.  This added complication of
        adjustments is assumed to have arisen, in phase two,
        when the results of the three streams were combined to
        compute some inter-stream relationships where none had
        been desired before.  Note that the designers of the
        adjustment approach may have felt the adjustment
        approach legitimate if they envisioned a later possible
        need to dynamically handle elements whose processing
        order could never be made chronological (e.g., given
        performance constraints.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So what has happened to cause the new desire to be
        asserted?  Perhaps, the inter-stream relationships are
        about to become much more intense and would thus
        required significant extensions to the adjustment code.
        Further, in the time since the addition of the
        adjustment code, it has been recognized that the "later
        possible need" is very unlikely to arise in practice.
        Hence, now one wishes that an interleaving approach had
        been used as an earlier solution rather than post-hoc
        adjustment.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, in phase three, what does one do to transform from
        the pattern (used very loosely) of sequential
        chronological stream processing with inter-stream
        chronological adjustments to a pattern of chronological
        interleaving with no adjustments required?  (If this
        example doesn't seem to provide enough motivation, you
        are encouraged to provide your own caveats and
        suppositions to help it along.)
      </p>
      <p>
        What we want to do is interleave the streams
        chronologically, add the new inter-stream calculations
        to be performed on the fly, and rip out the adjustment
        code.  This should simplify the understanding of how the
        stream processing works.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rearrangement could be as follows (this kind of
        transformation has likely been more ably described
        elsewhere).  Each stream processing task currently has
        an initialization stage, then a loop within which it
        gets the next stream element and processes it (including
        any adjustments required due to the processing viz a viz
        other stream processing) and a finalization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part of the [pattern] is a
        Functional Inversion (put your vote for a better term
        right here).  What we want is to run each stream
        processing task's initialization, then use a
        multi-stream reader (new) which looks at the next
        element from each stream, picks the chronologically
        winning element, invokes the correct
        stream's processing task, and finally (for
        implementation simplicity) stub out the stream task's
        next element grabber so that it just returns the
        multi-stream reader's next element.  In essence, we
        evert the stream-task and next-element functions so
        that the stream-task gets called by the next-element
        function where it used to be the reverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second part of the [pattern] is to
        EncapsulateLocalState for each stream-task.  (We've been
        assuming that a stream-task is implemented as a
        function, in case you haven't noticed.)  
        That is, at run-time we want to preserve the
        local values which a stream-task currently keeps between
        loop iterations.  The reason is that, now, we will be
        returning from the stream-task to the next-element (the
        multi-stream reader) function after each iteration --
        thus, blowing off the inter-iteration state which would
        normally have been preserved between iterations within
        that stream-task.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to do this would be to create an object which
        contains this state and change the stream-task's local
        access code to perform some external access to get to
        the state now encapsulated in the object.  (This
        roundabout elocution means we'll make the object
        accessible via a path from some globally accessible
        root.)  Another way to do this, if the implementation
        language allows (e.g., Algol "own" or C/C++
        "static" variables), would be to make this local state
        persistent across calls to the stream-task.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third part of the [pattern] is to Clone
        NonEssentialSharing (and this is a definite candidate
        for terminology upgrade).  For example, the
        stream-tasks may gratuitously share (because of foolish
        convenience) data storage for intermediate
        (inter-iteration) results.  That is, each stream-task
        uses the same global (yes, an ugly word, but
        enlightenment hadn't reached the ends of the Earth when
        this code was laid) variable for its own purposes over 
        several element iterations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because we may switch from one stream-task to another
        while the first has carefully cached away an
        inter-iteration value for use on its next loop
        go-around, the second stream-task could either trash the
        cached value with one of its own or (worse?) assume that
        the value currently there was one it had placed there
        earlier.  If so, then the gratuitous shared storage will
        need to be cloned so that each stream-task gets its own
        copy.  (And while we're at it, we could hide the fargin
        clones in a state object for each stream-task, of
        course.)  
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, before you protest that such a situation would never
        happen with modern coding practices, let me provide a
        possible modern-style situation where it might.
        To wit, one should remember that such
        temporary values can be sufficiently interesting or
        large so as to be cached in a database -- a
        practice which isn't always thought of as bad (because
        we don't think of persistent storage as a form of global
        variable).
      </p>
      <p>
        So, having walked through the above mess, our
        amelioration pattern has the following three pieces
        which need to be performed in order to transform the
        multiple sequential streams situation into a multiple
        interleaved streams situation.  (And, no, I don't like
        the terms.)

        It looks useful, but is it art?  Is this <em>really</em> a
        pattern, or an <em></em><a href="AmeliorationPattern.html">AmeliorationPattern</a>"?  Time for feedback
        to show me the error of my ways.  (And thanks in advance
        for it, too.)

        <em>I can certainly vouch for the pattern-ness of this, if only because it seems to encapsulate a very very common task in computer game development (and especially in porting from one platform to another).  You have your data in format F1 for code C1 which is optimized for machine M1.  Then you wish to create the same game for machine M2.  You rewrite C1 as C2, heavily optimised for machine M2, and discover that, really, C2 wants data in format F2, not in format F1.</em>

        <em>A concrete example is the sprites (flat bitmap images) from Id Software's Wolfenstein3D.  They are run-length encoded in RAM to be decompressed on-the-fly when rendering.  On the PC they are encoded in vertical strips, and the engine paints out vertical strips.  This works fine for the standard PC architecture, but for the ARM conversion a better solution was to paint out horizontal strips, requiring horizontally-compressed data.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Other applications include rendering from heightmaps.  The optimum access pattern changes depending on the view angle.  You write the X first Y second version then perform </em><a href="FunctionalInversion.html">FunctionalInversion</a> on this code to create the Y first X second version.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Granted, in these situations, the actual process performed on each element is simple, and it is often easier just to rewrite the code from scratch.  Where knowledge of the pattern comes into its own is when optimising a piece of raw assembly, where rotating the data access order literally does involve finding memory locations for values that previously could be held in a register (Clone Non-Essential Sharing and </em>EncapsulateLocalState).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Lastly, consider attempting to keep the same run-length sprite format (vertical) and refactor the code which renders it as vertical strips to render from </em>'the same data<em>' as horizontal strips.  Every vertical strip has to be assigned its own cache of loop state data.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you view the pattern from this angle, it seems to be more appropriate to call it </em>IterationRotation ;)<em></em>
