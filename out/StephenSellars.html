        Hello Ward...we met briefly several months ago at a Triangle Java User's Group meeting where Ken Auer was presenting!
      </p>
      <p>
        I was introduced to the concept of a Wiki by Don MacQueen of the Washington Smalltalk User's Group, but haven't actually tried one out until now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work for the EDS Raleigh Solution Center, doing a variety of things for enterprise type clients. I have just recently been working on an internet e-commerce application for an RTP pre-IPO company.

      <p>
        Ken's talk has me hooked on the idea of wireless & palm based computing, so I've just been fiddling with Pocket Smalltalk for my Palm.
