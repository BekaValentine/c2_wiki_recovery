        <a href="SwingDeveloper.html">SwingDeveloper</a> is a an HCI programmer of many years interested in the HCI aspects of the representation of computer programs. I am aware of the RealNames policy, and will post under this moniker solely. Since employers are free to fire anyone at any time for otherwise free speech acts committed by their employees on the web, I take refuge in anonymity. This is not a philosophical or theoretical thing for me. Thanks for understanding, and I in my part will respect the conventions and norms of this site.
