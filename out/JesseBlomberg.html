        He worked for <a href="BlizzardEntertainment.html">BlizzardEntertainment</a> but may have moved on given recent events at that company.
      </p>
      <p>
        I certainly didn't move on.  Still here, still working like crazy.  Recent events affected me not in the least.

        Jesse has adopted some XP working practices.
        This is true.  I have.

        I'm a recent college graduate, and after entering the work force, I realized how piteous my education really was. After talking and working with several other recent grads, I've realized that college barely teaches you the basics. Sure, I learned the syntax of several languages, and how operating systems work, etc.  But they failed to teach good programming. This backwards approach is a serious problem, as it it produces a lot of people that are sort of programmers, but not really.  Everything that I really use day to day is stuff I've taught myself or learned from sources outside of school.

        I'm not here anymore.  The signal to noise ratio got too low, so I left for greener pastures.  Would you like me to delete myself?

        <em>Not at all, if you show up rarely rather than never -- which you must, else you wouldn't have left that note. :-)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I certainly do show up from time to time.  I don't think I'll ever leave, because there are some pages here that hold precious knowledge that I like to keep my eye on.
