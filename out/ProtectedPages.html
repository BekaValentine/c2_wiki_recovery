        <a href="ProtectedPages.html">ProtectedPages</a> could be done with a PGP signing mechanism operating transparently giving secure pages, or at least pages that can be seen as really written by someone or some group (perhaps showing up as highlighted in a yellow background, any modification leading to being marked as non-verified (red background) or as unsigned (background as now). To reduce load, the protected area could be noted for a verification engine to check it when load levels permit.

      <p>
        Having a PGP key (or really anything else but PGP {or OpenPGP/GPG} is available enough that it would make a good starting point) associated with a particular person's page allows for comments signed by that person to be verified as the <a href="AuthenticatedAuthor.html">AuthenticatedAuthor</a>; initially, I imagine that PGP signed comments can be inserted into another text box (or uploaded?) and are included at rendering as text without the PGP encapsulation, but with an appropriate color background as described above. Not sure how those individual chunks should be named but sequential numbering might be good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once inserting <a href="AuthenticatedAuthor.html">AuthenticatedAuthor</a> chunks works well, controls could be experimented on for limiting privileges for who can move, edit, delete or possibly view? At that stage, <a href="ProtectedPages.html">ProtectedPages</a> would be achieved. -- <a href="AndrewMcMeikan.html">AndrewMcMeikan</a>
