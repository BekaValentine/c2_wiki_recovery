        When I was a kid, I really wanted to play video games. I could spend the whole three days merely eating, playing video games, and sleeping. I remember that this became an inspiration for me to enter the top ten class of the creme of the crop way back in my elementary days. Well, here I am today. I hope that my ideas will be beneficial not only to this group but to the entire humanity.

        <strong>Let's play</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ems for MUSIC.. music as a universal language of musicians.. 
      </p>

        Visualize a keyboard with five octaves. Each octave represents a vowel. First octave is for A, second is for E, third is for I, fourth is for O, and fifth is for U. Now, the thirty five notes are for the consonants. We still have B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z..
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST OCTAVE 
      </p>
      <p>
        C D E F G A B  
      </p>
      <p>
        B C D E F G H
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND OCTAVE
      </p>
      <p>
        C D E F G A B  
      </p>
      <p>
        J K L M N P Q 
      </p>
      <p>
        THIRD OCTAVE
      </p>
      <p>
        C D E F G A B
      </p>
      <p>
        R S T V W X Y
      </p>
      <p>
        FOURTH OCTAVE
      </p>
      <p>
        C D E F G A B
      </p>
      <p>
        Z   - . 1 2 3
      </p>
      <p>
        FIFTH OCTAVE
      </p>
      <p>
        C D E F G A B
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           5 6 7 8 9 0
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The FIRST rule is that you spell it as you pronounce it. For example, the sentence I LOVE YOU is pronounced as AY LAV YU
      </p>
      <p>
        The SECOND rule is that vowels could be played as chords, since you only work with the position of the octaves and consonants would be played by a single tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The THIRD rule is that punctuations are also observed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's play.. 
      </p>
      <p>
        AY - For A, any chord on the first octave would do. Let's play my favorite chord, C-E-G. So C-E-G was pressed in the first octave. For Y, just press B in the third octave. The tone results to "out of tune" because B is not included in the C chord family. So if you wanted to customize it and make it in tune, we will go for the B chord in the first octave. So instead of pressing C-E-G, we should press B-D#-F. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun fUn fuN ... under the sun
      </p>
      <p>
        The tones could also be used as a switch..
      </p>
      <p>
        To be continued. 
      </p>
