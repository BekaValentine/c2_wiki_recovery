        Rw Cpp Unit

      <p>
        I liked the <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> idea, but was unable to use the code because the project that I am working on does not use the <a href="StandardTemplateLibrary.html">StandardTemplateLibrary</a>, but rather <a href="RogueWave.html">RogueWave</a>. I have created a version of <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> that works for me (I gave a copy to <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>, but haven't seen it on his web site).  The differences between the two libraries would make creating a common source difficult, so I sort of expect to end up having to maintain my own version. I'll try to keep up with the latest ideas, but keep me in mind if you're making changes as I might miss something. Thanks.

        The SystemWeenies here have altered the configuration of the machine I was
        using and so I had to figure out, under the new configuration how to build
        the software, including <a href="RwCppUnit.html">RwCppUnit</a>. Turned out that something has changed
        which is causing name space pollution between the current version of <a href="RwCppUnit.html">RwCppUnit</a>
        and the <a href="RogueWave.html">RogueWave</a> software - redefining "assert" is now causing compile
        errors in <a href="RogueWave.html">RogueWave</a>. I hate changing horses in the middle of a race, but
        rather than risk my sanity trying to get everything to live together, I'm
        going to bite the bullet and use a different macro in my test objects.

        I think I'll call it "pass if". Seems to me to be the shortest, most direct
        phrase that covers what's happening. I can also create a "fail if" macro
        for the inverse case as the C/C++ not operator (!) is not exactly the
        height of readability.

        Don - how are you progressing with this? I see no mention of <a href="RwCppUnit.html">RwCppUnit</a> on the xprogramming website, and unfortunately I can't find your email address here to drop you a mail. I have similar problems and don't particularly want to reinvent the wheel!

        Hello,
        I am having the same sort of namespace conflicts (even though we are using
        STL - I'm getting "blah already defined" linker errors). I'd be very interested 
        in taking a look at <a href="RwCppUnit.html">RwCppUnit</a>. Drop me a line, if you read this (Donald, Steve, or whoever has access to the code). Thanks!

        Follow-up:
        It seems that with our app, we were having a conflict because we were
        using MFC statically linked, but cppUnit uses it dynamically linked.
        We changed our project settings (for the debug version) to use MFC
        dynamically linked as well.

        'assert' is reserved for c/c++ compiler implementors. <a href="DontUseReservedNames.html">DontUseReservedNames</a>.

        I'm also working on a project with non-STL <a href="RogueWave.html">RogueWave</a> tools and would appreciate being able to try <a href="RwCppUnit.html">RwCppUnit</a>. Thanks.
