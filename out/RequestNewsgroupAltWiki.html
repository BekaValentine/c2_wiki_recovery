        <strong>Request Newsgroup </strong><a href="news:alt.wiki'''">news:alt.wiki'''</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        What about creating a <em>newsgroup</em>: <a href="news:alt.wiki.">news:alt.wiki.</a> Taking together all interested wiki friends, dispersed over different wikis, we should get enough votes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Motivation:</strong> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Solve the </strong><a href="WikiBackup.html">WikiBackup</a> problem<strong> for original contributions</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               What, you don't archive the bits you think are important? <a href="CutAndPaste.html">CutAndPaste</a> is more than adequate for this.

           <strong>Allows easier organization</strong> of Special Interest Wiki Communities (creation, differentiation, migration and synchronization)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Why aren't special purpose wikis the best way to organize special interest wiki communities? 
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Yes, but they need a place to synchronize -- fp

               <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> happens. We need a wiki-based solution. <a href="MakeSignalNotNoise.html">MakeSignalNotNoise</a> is the only way this is going to work.

                <li>
                   This Thread technique creates much noise. <a href="CritLink.html">CritLink</a> might be helpful to overcome this -- fp

                       <a href="MakeSignalNotNoise.html">MakeSignalNotNoise</a> hasn't been demonstrated to create noise. In fact it hasn't been demonstrated on any scale at all. What leads you to think a non-wiki solution is required here?

           <strong>Helps to relocate Offtopic stuff</strong> to the appropriate Special Interest Wiki
          <ul>
            <li>
               How on earth can usenet help this? If you need to relocate something, just go and relocate it. <a href="CutAndPaste.html">CutAndPaste</a>.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   The newsgroup is searchable by <a href="DejaNews.html">DejaNews</a>, so there is a better chance for successful special interest calls for Wikipages -- fp
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       Wiki was once searchable by content. Regrettably (?) that's not what the title backlinks do any more. Happily page groups are so small I've seen no one complain about the difficulty of relocating anything. Have you?

           <strong>Encourage valuable contributions</strong> of book authors, who otherwise wouldn't trust to contribute, because at least in this Wiki it is legal (though not ethical) to <em>rip off signatures and afterwards cannibalize the intellectual property</em>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Fridemar, I've been contributing here for over 2 years. In that time I've had content squelched, misappropriated, mangled, diddled and cannibalized too many times to count. I expect, encourage and enjoy that - it's part of <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>. If you want to publish unalterable content, just go to any mailing list or usenet and keep your stuff there. Or make a new kind of thing. Or, best of all, stick around here and play with this medium until you too learn to enjoy being cannibalized. --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

                   Peter help is in sight. Fortunataly there is the annotation system <a href="CritLink.html">CritLink</a>. This is your asked for new thing, to could reconcile the needs of all persons involved. -- fp
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       FP, you're not listening. Help ain't necessary or desirable. The whole point of wiki is collective ownership of content. Cannibalization is a necessary and thoroughly enjoyable part of that. I confess I still have to track down <a href="CritLink.html">CritLink</a> and understand it, but if it doesn't make deletion easy I expect it'll go the way of all thready online forums to date.

If you're worried about having things changed from under you, WikiIsntForYou, it's like a game of tennis or <a href="UltimateFrisbee.html">UltimateFrisbee</a> it only exists while it's happening. -- <a href="LarryPrice.html">LarryPrice</a> (signed only because it makes some people nervous if you don't)
              <ul>

                   Ok, let's play -- fp

        <strong>Downside:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Alt.wiki will gate vast numbers of noisy, foolish, and destructive children into wiki. Can <a href="EndOfWiki.html">EndOfWiki</a> be far behind?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you prefer another more complicated name, not easily typed in by kids?
        Since a lot of Wikis can set their pointers in the newsgroup, special kid friendly wikis could serve as absorbers -- fp
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hell yes! Accelerating </em><a href="EndOfWiki.html">EndOfWiki</a> by gating <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> into it really is best for the form. People will be most encouraged to start fresh with more functional (==cannibalistic) editorial policies. Sure FP, all my objections are swept away, please do gate <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> into wiki and put the poor bugger out of its misery.<em></em>

        I think you will like my annotation experiment, where Wiki people can neatly make their annotations, not putting a burden to Wikimaster<strong>'s. Same load reduction effect as in email lists, but better readable in context. -- fp</strong>

        If there was a way of attaching a new thread to any wiki page, we could factor out most of the transient content into the discussion threads.
        If any of the transient content is useful it can be copied into wiki.
