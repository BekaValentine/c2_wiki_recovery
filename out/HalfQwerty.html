        Half Qwerty

        I think this is just a software wedge that re-interprets the (KeyUp, KeyDown) messages from a normal QWERTY keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there a version for Linux?
      </p>

        <em>Does "Linux Half-key Keyboard patch" </em><a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~john/computer/hk/">http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~john/computer/hk/</a> do what you want?<em></em>

        <em>This is a terrible solution for people who can only type with one hand. Please see the left hand layout on the </em><a href="DvorakKeyboard.html">DvorakKeyboard</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm guessing this is an excellent solution for people with only half a keyboard :-). But thanks for the pointer to the one-handed Dvorak keyboard.

        When you say "half QWERTY" I think of this:

        Cool.
      </p>

        I think a person could take an off-the-shelf full QWERTY keyboard
        and chop off half the keys (following the directions at
        <a href="http://www.trevorblackwell.com/keyboardchop.html).">http://www.trevorblackwell.com/keyboardchop.html).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I can tell, the result would be practically identical to the above half-keyboards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, is the software from
        <a href="http://half-qwerty.com/">http://half-qwerty.com/</a>
        all you need to use this hacked-up half keyboard?

        IBM developed an experimental laptop with a dual-mode keyboard with half the keys:

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I wonder: Why is IBM's prototype the right half of a QWERTY keyboard, while <a href="http://www.halfkeyboard.com/">http://www.halfkeyboard.com/</a> is the left half of a QWERTY keyboard?
      </p>
      <p>
        In my experience, most computer mice live to the right of a computer keyboard. So using the left half of a keyboard and a mouse would feel natural to many people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I personally alternate between using left hand for mouse and right hand for mouse, trying to introduce enough variety to stave off <a href="RepetitiveStrainInjury.html">RepetitiveStrainInjury</a>.

        The WolfKing Warrior seems to be a variant <a href="HalfQwerty.html">HalfQwerty</a> aimed at gamers: <a href="http://www.wolfkingusa.com/prdts_wolfking.html">http://www.wolfkingusa.com/prdts_wolfking.html</a>
