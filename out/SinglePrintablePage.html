        Using this arbitrary size for a style in a <a href="WikiPageWritingConcept.html">WikiPageWritingConcept</a> might be a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a><br/>
        for certain of the pages I write here and perhaps for others as well<br/>
        particularly those acting as summaries and condensations - such as <br/>
        my own <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> : <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> - Initiated as a practice 20141020<br/>

        The scheme<br/>
        would limit the number of lines included within a page to be about 50 (plus or minus a few)<br/>
        This would enable <br/>
        the PrintingOnPaper of the particular page suitable for insertion in a book<br/>
        ThreeRingNotebook - for easy and quick reference and the addition of new notes ( <a href="DontLoseGoodIdeas.html">DontLoseGoodIdeas</a> )<br/>

        Some pages, often serving only as a battle-ground for Rants and Edit-Wars, <br/>
        can grow<br/>
        to a length<br/>
        not convenient for WikiReading, and also<br/>
        difficult to edit and compose using the participants own edit-and-composition medium<br/>
        they become unreadable and very difficult to reduce to EasilyRememberedConcepts<br/>
        It would be much more likely that pages would be read and understood as <a href="ThoughtsIdeasNotions.html">ThoughtsIdeasNotions</a><br/>
        if kept short<br/>
        and named with <a href="IntentionRevealingNames.html">IntentionRevealingNames</a><br/>
