        Fair Use
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Fair-Use Statute is a part of the U.S. Copyright Act. It permits certain types of uses of <a href="CopyRight.html">CopyRight</a>ed material.
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107">http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In brief (with the proviso that <a href="IamNotaLawyer.html">IamNotaLawyer</a>), fair use allows <strong>excerpts</strong> of a <a href="CopyRight.html">CopyRight</a>ed work to be used for teaching, "scholarship", news reporting, and criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Posting an entire copyrighted work without the copyright holder's permission violates fair use. Please don't do this on Wiki. -- <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        But isn't this all changed now with the DMCA? <a href="CopyRight.html">CopyRight</a> now is superseded by ParaCopyRight, you can not get an excerpt if it requires circumventing a TechnicalProtectionMeasure -- <a href="AndrewMcMeikan.html">AndrewMcMeikan</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, not really. DMCA attempts to create a lockable software container whereupon it would be clear (in a legal sense) when a user transgressed across it (otherwise software-on-disk is just "code exposed to the public domain"), but this is mostly a societal agreement which won't necessarily hold sway over time. The reason is thus: there is no legal right to profit. If software makers want to make revenue, exclusively, for their software, they can set up a business where people can come in and use the software on their own (protected) machines where the machine code can't be accessed.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That being said, those who figured out the code for DMCA should be noted as doing a service for the underdog, but keep their achievement on the "downlow", so it can continue to be a service to humanity.</em>

        Systems similar to <a href="FairUse.html">FairUse</a> exist in other places, too.

        Here is what you need to know:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Copyright</strong> is about protecting "authorship", or, in other words, preserving <a href="FairCreditAssignment.html">FairCreditAssignment</a>. (I.e. you can't use another's words under your own name.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fair-use</strong> allows others to use another's work, possibly making a derived work.   Acknowledging that after publication, it is easy to copy text or machine code (in whole or in part), "Fair Use" says you cannot do so simply for <em>personal gain</em> if you are depriving the original author of legitimate gains.  If copyright by an individual, non-commercial re-use is always allowed.  The only known points of contention are with corporate claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        Points to evaluate:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you are enhancing the intellectual or creative <strong>community</strong> by reusing already published material, you are likely *protected*. (ShareAlike)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>No, you are not likely to be protected.  The law does not make exceptions for some notion of community enhancement.</em> 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           If you make money from another's material, you are <em>not</em> protected and claims <em>could</em> be held against you (though they may not win, depending on whether the "spirit" of your use was innocent and/or fair) 
          <ul>
            <li>
               {In the UK, not making money off the material does not grant immunity from prosecution}.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Nor should it.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           If you are re-using, non-commercially, of an individual's copyright, you are protected, but are probably not if it is a corporate copyright 
          <ul>
            <li>
               {Vague to the point of meaninglessness}.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>And untrue.  If you're "re-using an individual's copyright" -- which I take to mean stealing someone's intellectual property -- the law does not distinguish individuals from corporations.  You are only "protected" by the fact that individuals often lack the resources to take you to court.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               ...using an individual's copyright -- "which I take to mean stealing someone's intellectual property":  You are an idiot.  Please delete your nonsense.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Rather than cast aspersions, wouldn't it be more effective to rationally identify precisely how I am being "an idiot"?</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>The description of fair use immediately above is simplistic to the point of being misleading. See </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use</a> for a better explanation.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> is wrong, and it even says so. <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> isn't always authoritative, but generally only a representation of "mass consensus", however misguided. I'm only saying what's defendable, not what the level of the law has <em>created</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Be that as it may, the description of fair use above is simplistic to the point of being misleading. I'd encourage you to remove or correct it, rather than spread misinformation.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You're speaking as if the law exist for its own sake:  <strong>it doesn't</strong>.  The law exists to serve People, not lawyers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What you want the law to be has nothing to do with what the law is.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What the law "is", is not always relevant to what would be decided, should someone make the sound and correct arguments, in court.  This is called <a href="CaseLaw.html">CaseLaw</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="CaseLaw.html">CaseLaw</a> is generally not the result of sound and correct arguments, merely the result of finding a judge or jury who will wave your argument through on some basis, sound or otherwise. Entropy ensures that bad <a href="CaseLaw.html">CaseLaw</a> generally outweighs the good as it is easier to find a stupid judge than an intelligent one and therefore easier for a good law to be undermined by bad <a href="CaseLaw.html">CaseLaw</a> than for a bad law to be fixed by good <a href="CaseLaw.html">CaseLaw</a>.<em></em>
