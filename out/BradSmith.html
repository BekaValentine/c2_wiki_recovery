        Describe <a href="BradSmith.html">BradSmith</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently manage a small software development team for a US federal agency in lovely Bend, Oregon. I was recently introduced to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> via a discussion on the Straight Talking mailing list.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an ecologist (scientist not environmentalist) by training with a long background in programming in order to create and/or use the software needed to do any DataAnalysis or modelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have yet to figure out why I ended up managing this development team.
