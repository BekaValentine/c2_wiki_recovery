        Reference Value
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="ReferenceValue.html">ReferenceValue</a> is a special type of value in programming languages that allow side effects and are based on the environment model.
      </p>
      <p>
        The essential property of a <a href="ReferenceValue.html">ReferenceValue</a> is that it both <em>is</em> a value and <em>can have</em> a value, and it can <em>have</em> different values at different times.
      </p>
      <p>
        The property enables stateful computation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The operation of making a <a href="ReferenceValue.html">ReferenceValue</a> denote a new value (which can be another <a href="ReferenceValue.html">ReferenceValue</a>) is called <em>assignment</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The operation of obtaining the value that a <a href="ReferenceValue.html">ReferenceValue</a> denotes is called <em>dereferencing</em>, and in most language one level of dereferencing is implicit, except on the left hand side of the assignment operator and in other distinguished cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there have been languages like the <a href="BlissLanguage.html">BlissLanguage</a> where all dereferencing had to explicitly notated, for example as in (the dot is the dereference operator):
      </p>
      <code>
        a = .a + 1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        NOTE: operators like $ or @ in the <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> are not dereferencing operators, they are operators on <strong>strings</strong>, and they are property lookup operators for the  atom named by the following string, as in the <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pointers are usually implemented as a <a href="ReferenceValue.html">ReferenceValue</a>, and variables are usually implemented as a manifestly named constant <a href="ReferenceValue.html">ReferenceValue</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many languages, those that have <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a>, a <a href="ReferenceValue.html">ReferenceValue</a> may be associated with a constraint as to the values it can denote. This allows for several optimizations, as well as being of documentary value.
        This all means that a common definition like
      </p>
      <code>
        auto int i;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        is really a shorthand for something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        manifest i == auto new reference;<br/>
        ensure typeof(valueof i) == int;<br/>
      </code>
