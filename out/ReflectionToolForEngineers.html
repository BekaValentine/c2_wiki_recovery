        Reflection Tool For Engineers

        One current interest I have is for a <a href="ReflectionToolForEngineers.html">ReflectionToolForEngineers</a> to be able to accumulate linked data about activities. At present I use quite a lot of different tools none of which provide all the desired functionality and I would be interested in any thoughts about possible implementations. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        Can you build a sample schema? Before pursuing a new database-like engine, let's make sure existing RDBMS or RDBMS-like tools cannot handle it satisfactorily. Perhaps we can tease out the reasons why existing ones are insufficient and form some candidate general rules for fit difficulties.

        I was not thinking myself of a new database engine. I am an engineer at the application end of programming. I tend to want to take tools other people have built, for example <a href="MetaKit.html">MetaKit</a> and <a href="EfourGraph.html">EfourGraph</a>, and use them to implement ideas. I also use many existing tools, e.g. <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a>, <a href="TiddlyWiki.html">TiddlyWiki</a> and other tools for collecting ideas. There are problems for me with each tool, but the main lack is an export system where I can bring together data from different systems. The ideas of the <a href="SemanticWiki.html">SemanticWiki</a> are important here, but again I don't have any tools which will help. I was hopeful of <a href="CubicWeb.html">CubicWeb</a> but find it too restrictive and difficult to adapt. I know this is not a schema and therefore not a direct answer. I am having another look at <a href="ConnectedText.html">ConnectedText</a> for use as an individual note taking tool. I am finding that the semantic tools it contains help with building an ontology of the objects in a natural way. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        I have now encountered the <a href="ProgrammersStone.html">ProgrammersStone</a> and have a lot more things to reflect about. I think any tool will need to capture the dimensions there. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
