        In Vivo Test Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You need to use <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> to create an application on a platform like <a href="MicrosoftFoundationClasses.html">MicrosoftFoundationClasses</a>, architected for some form of <a href="VendorLockIn.html">VendorLockIn</a>. The platform controls your main() and your View message pump.
      </p>
      <p>
        (To be fair, sometimes the platform is just big and slow, and <a href="VendorLockIn.html">VendorLockIn</a> is not to blame!)
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve <a href="TestIsolation.html">TestIsolation</a>, you might need to create everything in each setup() and break it all down in each teardown(). This can be slow, or even impossible, if the platform constrains how you can call its parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Write the default application skeleton, in all its hairy glory. Then - maybe even as low in the call tree as your early View events - call into your test runner, and pass in a reference to your environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each test case expects a fully-formed environment, with all its elements, possibly even including a main window.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Benefits</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        TDD is better than debugging, no matter how sick your TDD rig must be!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Drawbacks</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For each bug, and each unexpected test failure, you must consider and work around <a href="TestIsolation.html">TestIsolation</a>. Your teardown() method might, for example, whack every object in your object model that's further down the object tree from your basic objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fixing the Drawbacks</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Run the tests as often as possible, constantly refactor them for cleanness, and if tests fail unexpectedly revert the code until they pass.
