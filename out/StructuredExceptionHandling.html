        Structured Exception Handling
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Structured Exception Handling</em> is an extension for C/C++ (and other languages) that is supported on <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> platforms. It adds exception handling to C, allowing it to trap hardware exceptions such as general protection faults or division by zero. In standard C environments, SignalHandlers are used to handle exceptions from the hardware or <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>.

      <p>
        In C/C++ on the Windows platform a __try block (note the underscores) is used to do this.

        This technique is apparently subject to a <a href="SoftwarePatent.html">SoftwarePatent</a> held by Borland (who licenses the technology to <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>). Work on the WINE emulator to support <a href="StructuredExceptionHandling.html">StructuredExceptionHandling</a> in GCC was halted in May 2005 due to this patent.
