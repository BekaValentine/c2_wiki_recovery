        Collaboration Is Not One Person Doing All The Work
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="CollaborationIsNotOnePersonDoingAllTheWork.html">CollaborationIsNotOnePersonDoingAllTheWork</a>. There is no option but to think <a href="ThinkWinWin.html">ThinkWinWin</a> and develop a CollaborationMaturityModel. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiSym.html">WikiSym</a> came and went as well. I tried to draw attention to people here that <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> <a href="GodKing.html">GodKing</a> needed help. What LessonsInCollaboration did we learn?
      </p>
      <p>
        And when was the last time we had a CommunityProject where more than 3 or 4 people come together to create <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> material that is useful? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you gone out and try to invite people to come to C2 this year? I know how I behaved when a lot of people were busy in their <a href="EditWars.html">EditWars</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And I am comforted by the fact that despite all the <a href="WikiNoisePollution.html">WikiNoisePollution</a>, there are people here that can serve as my role model. They are contented to cleaning up spelling mistakes, create useful material for entry level people, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you ask me <a href="WhatIsaCommunity.html">WhatIsaCommunity</a>, then my response would be people listed above. And content will come, if these people stick around. This is not <a href="VoiceOfWiki.html">VoiceOfWiki</a>, it is created by one person, but the delete by another very visible person has been left unsupported for three weeks.
