        <em>Are there any major differences between this and other unit testing tools?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course! <a href="CsUnit.html">CsUnit</a> is much better!
      </p>
      <p>
        But seriously: Each of the unit testing tools offers a different set of features. For each feature it is a question of personal taste or preference, whether it is regarded as being essential, nice to have, or a waste of time. This is a decision each programmer has to make by himself. -- <a href="ManfredLange.html">ManfredLange</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Also, can this framework be used to test code written in other </em><a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> languages (VB.NET, <a href="VisualJaySharpDotNet.html">VisualJaySharpDotNet</a>, MSIL), or is it specifically limited to C#?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please see <a href="http://www.csunit.org">http://www.csunit.org</a> for a list of supported programming languages. -- <a href="ManfredLange.html">ManfredLange</a>

        <em></em><a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>, please. Is there a way to use csUnit to test your code without having to GPL your code?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you only use csUnit in house, and do not ship your test cases, then you can use it without GPL'ing your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question becomes more important when you want to ship your tests along with a non-GPL'ed software. The authors of the GPL make it clear that they consider any program linked against GPL software to be a "derivative work", and subject to the terms of the GPL. Therefore, we are considering a modification to the licensing so that for instance csUnit.dll can be LGPL, which means you can ship your tests along with a non-GPL software, but csUnit will be able to enjoy most of the benefits of the GPL. For more information about the LGPL, please see: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Stay tuned. -- <a href="ManfredLange.html">ManfredLange</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Update: starting with csUnit 2.0 the licensing is more flexible, and now also allows for the use in commercial, closed-source products. There is no need anymore to GPL any software that incorporates csUnit or portions of it. Please see <a href="http://www.csunit.org">http://www.csunit.org</a> for more details. -- <a href="ManfredLange.html">ManfredLange</a>.

        (Superficially) I can't see the differences between csUnit and NUnit. There is a non-answer above, saying they are different, as each offers different features. But what are these features?
