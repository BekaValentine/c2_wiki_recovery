      <p>
        During my 20 years developing software I've seen heavy failures and agile successes.  Since 2000 I've been learning and practicing XP.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work at IBM where many folks have used heavier methods.  Yet our team has used XP for a year, though we rated ourselves at 72% XP.  My goal is to have an unbiased set of metrics that shows if we are doing xp, and quantifies success or failure of XP.  I've written two papers on this subject: "Turning the Knobs: A Coaching Pattern for XP through Agile Metrics", and, in conjunction with <a href="LaurieWilliams.html">LaurieWilliams</a> and <a href="LucasLayman.html">LucasLayman</a> at <a href="NorthCarolinaStateUniversity.html">NorthCarolinaStateUniversity</a>: "Toward an XP Evaluation Framework".
