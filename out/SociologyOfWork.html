        Sociology Of Work
      </h1>
      <p>
        Work is an interesting social construct.  Most of the people on the C2 Wiki go to work in an environment with many coworkers, and their postings on these pages about <a href="ProjectManagement.html">ProjectManagement</a>, a <a href="SharedVision.html">SharedVision</a>, and <a href="OrganizationalPathologies.html">OrganizationalPathologies</a> reflect the viewpoints raised in a multi-personality ManyVectored workplace.  But a very large proportion of the people who work in the world do so nearly alone.  They raise kids.  They run a small business.  They write articles for a magazine.
