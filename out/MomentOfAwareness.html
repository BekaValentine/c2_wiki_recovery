        If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely 100
        people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it would
        look something like the following. 
      </p>
      <code>
        There would be:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        _57 Asians<br/>
        _21 Europeans<br/>
        _14 from the Western Hemisphere, (both north and South) <br/>
        __8 Africans<br/>
        _52 would be female<br/>
        _48 would be male<br/>
        _70 would be non-white<br/>
        _30 would be white<br/>
        _70 would be non-Christian<br/>
        _30 would be Christian<br/>
        _89 would be heterosexual<br/>
        _11 would be homosexual<br/>
        __6 people would possess 59% of the entire<br/>
        world's wealth<br/>
        and all 6 would be from the United States<br/>
        _80 would live in substandard housing<br/>
        _70 would be unable to read<br/>
        _50 would suffer from malnutrition<br/>
        __1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth<br/>
        __1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education<br/>
        __1 would own a computer<br/>

        When one considers our world from such a perspective, the need for both acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly apparent.

        Hmm, the above formatting presents itself *extremely strangely* in my Netscape 3.0 browser.  <em>(I worked around the formatting--it was triggering the numeric list handling.)</em>

      <ol>
        <li>
          /3 of the people in the US own a computer.  So there has to be more
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        than 1% of the world who owns a computer.  Perhaps these are old figures.

        <li>
          % homosexuals is too big.  Perhaps that is the percent of people

        who have performed a homosexual act.  Some cultures have almost no
        homosexuals.  Are there <em>any</em> cultures with 11% homosexuals?
        There must be some bisexuals.
      </p>

        Actually ,statistically, about 10-11% of the world's population is homosexual.
        If one were to count everybody who had even a single homosexual experience as 
        gay, that figure would move up to 50%.

        White/non-white is imprecise.  Usually someone who is half European
        is considered non-white.  Or three-quarters.  Or seven-eighths.
        I wonder how they counted South American cultures that are a mixture of
        Spanish and native american?  
      </p>

        I don't believe that 70% of people can't read.  China has a good literacy
        program, and it has one third of the population.  Literacy in Africa is
        poor, but it doesn't have as many people.  Literacy in India is poor, and
        it has more people.  But I bet over half of all people over 8 can read.
        Maybe the literacy rate is so low because they are counting babies.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this is all beside the point.  You can't teach tolerance with statistics.
        You have to get to know people who are different from yourself.  A South
        African once told me that the biggest force for racial unity in South
        Africa (during the time of apartheid) was the army, because it forced a
        lot of white men to work with, depend on, and get to know black men, and
        so ruined their stereotypes.  Better communication and more interaction are what
        will help us get along better, not statistics.  Statistics just make us
        start to argue about how they were gathered and whether they are accurate.

        The world literacy rate, including kids, is probably 70-80%.  I think 70 people would be able to read.
