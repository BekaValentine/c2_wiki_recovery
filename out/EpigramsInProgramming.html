        Epigrams In Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="AlanPerlis.html">AlanPerlis</a> wrote a set of wonderful <a href="EpigramsInProgramming.html">EpigramsInProgramming</a> (aka Perlisisms). They appeared in SigplanNotices Vol 17 Number 9, Sept 1982.
      </p>
      <p>
        They can be found on the web at <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html.">http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html.</a> If this stops working, just search on "perlisisms".

        A few comments on these:

        "9. It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures."  Why?  This seems to go against everything that I've ever learned about distributing behavior in OO programs.  I can't see a good reason for this one.
      </p>

        "24. Perhaps if we wrote programs from childhood on, as adults we'd be able to read them. " -- Uhhhh...I wrote my first BASIC program in seventh grade.  I started getting <em>paid</em> for programming at 15.  Is that close enough to Childhood? :)

        A couple comments on the above, which unfortunately probably totally ruin the impact they would otherwise make:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>9. It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.</em>
        This may require some background to fully comprehend: the first time I ran across this was in reference to the <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, where the single idea of what a list should be resulted in an astonishing number of functions that can manipulate them.  <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> has <strong>mapc</strong>, 
        <strong>acons</strong>, 
        <strong>list*</strong>, and numerous others; my own (as yet unreleased) Lisp utilities package has numerous others.  Contrast this with something like C or Pascal, with hundreds of implementations and reimplementations of this fundamental data structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the 10 data structures are radically different, granted it makes no sense to unify them.  But 10 different list structures is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>24. Perhaps if we wrote programs from childhood on, as adults we'd be able to read them.</em>  
        This speaks less of a single person than as a community.  Remember that it takes many many years to learn to write English or any other language well; much of this is learning how to put your thoughts onto paper in a useful, coherent form.  I see no particular reason why programming should be any different.  I, too, started programming in BASIC at a ridiculously early age, but it's only in these last few years that I've really matured much as a programmer.

        "49 - "Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon bra and fig-leaf."

        Is he saying that we were wrong to move on from assembly?

        Sounds like a compiler implementation detail to me and not something that a good language should bother you with. Pretty bad argument against abstraction.

        neat way of phrasing an interesting idea.

        Man adjusting the machine didn't occur to him?
