        Bounds Checker
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="BoundsChecker.html">BoundsChecker</a> is an indispensable tool for Windows programming. It finds errors that no one else can find (including tons in Microsoft's code!!). Its main focus is on finding memory leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I have used the </em><a href="BoundsChecker.html">BoundsChecker</a> tool a little bit. It did a good job of finding routine <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> errors. I haven't used it enough, however, to say whether it's a solution to some of the problems described in <a href="ThingsWeHateAboutVbClassic.html">ThingsWeHateAboutVbClassic</a>. -- <a href="RobertEikel.html">RobertEikel</a><em></em>
      </p>

        <em>How does it compare to leak detectors like Purify and </em><a href="ElectricFence.html">ElectricFence</a>???<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ElectricFence.html">ElectricFence</a> appears to be a malloc replacement that places each memory block onto a separate page with guard pages on either side to catch overwrites. The trick is to place the memory at the end of the block so writing off the end causes a fault. You can set up read/write faults.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="BoundsChecker.html">BoundsChecker</a> does not currently do this. (The main reason is that all the guard pages make your program run extremely slowly. Also there is a lot of software out there that thinks writing beyond the end isn't bad.)  
        <a href="BoundsChecker.html">BoundsChecker</a> catches writing off the end using a technique that warns you of the error but won't cause your application to crash when you touch the block.
      </p>
      <p>
        Microsoft's VC++ compiler and libraries include tools that help with finding off-the-end errors and memory leaks. There are also new compiler settings in VC7.1 that can help find stack overwrites.
