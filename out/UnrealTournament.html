        Unreal tournament is often considered to be one of the best first person shooters of all time... Its major advantage (or disadvantage) is that it is not story based.

        <em>I had more fun playing UnrealTournament2004 than Halo 2 (which, uhm, comes out in a month . .). UT2K4 has better and more responsive vehicles </em>'and<strong> balances the vehicles perfectly with deathmatch style play (i.e. on foot). In short if you liked UT2K3, then UT2K4 loses nothing and adds an immense amount. I'm usually anti-spam, but I have no affiliation with Unreal and just love playing it - </strong><a href="LayneThomas.html">LayneThomas</a> (CoderLlama on UT2K4).<em></em>
