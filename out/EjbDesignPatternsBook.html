        This isn't so much a book of <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> as idioms and best practices. Much of the material is concerned with architectural principles and workarounds to bugs rather than describing patterns. The <a href="RuleOfThree.html">RuleOfThree</a> isn't really adhered to, largely because it's hard to find examples of enterprise applications with available source code, which makes the entire book seem very theoretical. Fowler's <a href="PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture.html">PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture</a> suffers from the same problem.
