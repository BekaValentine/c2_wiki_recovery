               In Australia ... I do recall that it wasn't available on video, but I think this was actually at the behest of Kubrick - no? -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               Was it not withdrawn in the UK, by Kubrick, after his family had received threats from people who <em>thought</em> that the film promoted violence, or something equally nonsensical? 
            </li>
            <li>
               Apparently there were some copycat crimes in the UK in the year following its release.
            </li>
            <li>
               Yes, it was never banned in the UK, but quietly withdrawn by Kubrick. The reasons were never made clear. A stage version was performed in UK theatres however. The movie was recently reissued for UK cinema distribution, now that he is no longer with us.
            </li>
            <li>
               Wasn't it that the censors wanted it cut, and Kubrick withdrew it rather than do so?

           "The Sixth Sense" is very good: Semi-romance, semi-nurturing, and a mild ghost story. But not nearly as violent or gory as other recent ghost stories.

           War and Peace (the Bondarchuk movie)
        </li>
        <li>
           War and Peace is my favorite book. I have read and studied it multiple times. The reason I think this movie is a faithful version of the book within the limits of film is that it contains only key scenes from the book that I recalled from my reading as having distinct and dense purpose. These chosen scenes not only are of key dramatic value but illustrate important and worthy points that the novel addresses. Pierre and Natasha are portrayed dead on, and the sordid party scene with Pierre and Dolokov is done splendidly with appropriate lunacy.  If War and Peace is one of your favorite books, see this film!

           Memento -- psychological thriller
          <ul>
            <li>
               About a man who can't form new memories who is trying to track down his wife's killer. Uses notes, Polaroids, and tattoos to keep his facts straight, but is susceptible to manipulation by other characters. Main action scenes are presented in reverse order, interwoven with backstory in regular order, converging on a surprising ending of the movie. Takes several viewings and a lot of thought to unravel what's going on, and even then you can't be sure about what's actually happened. Very thought provoking, some humorous moments to break up the tension...

           I absolutely loved this movie! A rather chilling portrayal of a man caught in the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>. Also highly recommend "Following", a clever film noir effort by the same director.

           Oh, hell yeah! This is a fantastic movie! Definitely rent it. I also recommend "Following", though not quite as highly. I have to be in a particular mood to really enjoy film noir, otherwise the plot twists can seem too contrived. "Following" is an excellent example of the film noir genre. If you like the genre, you'll definitely like the movie.

           Safe House -- psychological thriller
          <ul>
            <li>
               somewhat unknown but very good whodunnit about an ex-CIA agent that <em>may</em> be succumbing to the affects of Alzheimer's or age-related confusion but who <em>may</em> have special information that somebody would kill for. Patrick Stewart (I think that is the guy - captain on Star Trek Next Generation) does a fine job of acting.

                   agreed. I saw this a fews years back, and it does a great job of tension, and humor.
