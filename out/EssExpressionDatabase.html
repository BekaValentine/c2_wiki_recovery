        Ess Expression Database
      </h1>
      <p>
        Under <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a>, the idea of an <a href="EssExpression.html">EssExpression</a> Database popped up. What if a database had "tables" with more or less this structure (emulation-wise):
      </p>
      <code>
        table: EssExs<br/>
        ------------<br/>
        table_name<br/>
        row_id        // auto-gen<br/>
        ess_expression  // long-text<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Suppose we made an SQL-like query language for such a tool. What would a query language look like for it? What do <a href="EssExpression.html">EssExpression</a> query systems look like in general. A quick googling didn't turn up anything about query languages for ess-expressions. perhaps general tree query languages can be studied, but there's the issue of ordered trees versus unordered trees. (Lisp uses ordered trees). 
      </p>
      <p>
        How could one effectively index the bugger besides on just ID and table name? I suppose every item in the ess-expression could be indexed, similar to text indexers, but this would only do part of the job.
      </p>

        <em>A query language on quoted </em><a href="EssExpression.html">EssExpression</a>s would look a lot like XPath/XQuery minus the XML bias, likely integrated with a transform language. Within the SQL context, such a query language would be a bit like a function over the ess_expression column, excepting with the ability to return multiple values (each of which would become a row in the returned table... e.g. if you applied a function over ess_expression that returned leaves of the tree, you might end up with a table where 'row_id' is repeated once per leaf). One cannot express 'unordered trees' in <a href="EssExpression.html">EssExpression</a>s; instead, one would need to craft some queries and operators themselves so they are unconcerned about order (e.g. describing pattern-matches within the tree).<em></em>
