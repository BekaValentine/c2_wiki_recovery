        I graduated from Florida Atlantic University in December of 2004. 
        My website was <a href="http://student.fau.edu/tburkhar/web">http://student.fau.edu/tburkhar/web</a> but has been recently deleted. My other website I have (with Stella) is <a href="http://www.bootblues.com.">http://www.bootblues.com.</a> It hasn't been updated in over a year but it's still worth looking at ;)
