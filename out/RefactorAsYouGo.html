        I believe this becomes more difficult with <a href="WikiRefactoring.html">WikiRefactoring</a> as opposed to CodeRefactoring because there is even more emotional attachment to written words in conversation as there is to written code. --<a href="JasonYip.html">JasonYip</a>

      <p>
        Refactoring for code works because it is supported by other XP practices, namely: testing, group ownership, and pair programming.  Which of those practices do we have here?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: How can you test Wiki content?  I think the only thing we have is group ownership which suggests that even if we don't want to be </em><a href="UsingSignatures.html">UsingSignatures</a>, we at least can't be too attached to what we write.<em></em>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In traditional </em><a href="PeerReview.html">PeerReview</a>, the original author still maintains ownership.  I don't think that is nor should be the case here.  <a href="CollectiveOwnership.html">CollectiveOwnership</a> still seems to be the only "quality control" practice that Wiki has.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PeerReview.html">PeerReview</a> simply means that your peers will review your actions. <a href="IntellectualProperty.html">IntellectualProperty</a> laws are not important. Consider a source control system in a <a href="CollectiveOwnership.html">CollectiveOwnership</a> lab. It is necessary to frequently browse changes of your co-workers (your peers) to catch mistakes. It is in this sense that I mean <a href="PeerReview.html">PeerReview</a>. Call it the "thousand eyeball" system if you want. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
