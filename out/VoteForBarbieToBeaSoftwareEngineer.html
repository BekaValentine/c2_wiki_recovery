        Vote For Barbie To Bea Software Engineer
      </h1>
      <p>
        Very Important news for the profession: 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can now vote for Barbie to become a software engineer! More info here: <a href="http://www.barbie.com/vote/">http://www.barbie.com/vote/</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe this could encourage Mattel to contribute to <a href="OneLaptopPerChild.html">OneLaptopPerChild</a> for every "Computer Engineer Barbie" sold. Lisa Simpson would love it!
      </p>

        <em>Maybe I should vote for Barbie to become a </em>'radical environmentalist<em>'.</em>  >;->

      <p>
        When Barbie shows up at user group meetings, everyone assumes that she's a recruiter. >;->  (Yes, that's sexist and unfair, but it's true, and it's often a correct assumption.)  Our industry <strong>needs</strong> to mature -- in more than one way.

        <em>The first female software developer I worked with had a very solid math and science background and came from a military, defense contractor background. Sometimes the stereotypes are just wrong. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I had the good fortune to work for a young woman, a few years ago, who was stunningly beautiful and so smart and capable in leading software development teams that just observing her gave me quite an education in just how sexist my assumptions had been.  It was an education.
