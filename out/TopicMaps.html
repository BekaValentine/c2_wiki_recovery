        <em>Topic maps are a way of modelling a set of subjects; the relationships between them; and additional information about them. The topic map paradigm is described in the ISO standard ISO 13250:2002 along with an interchange syntax which uses SGML. Since the publication of the first edition of the ISO specification early in 2000, a separate consortium, </em><a href="http://TopicMaps.Org,">http://TopicMaps.Org,</a> have produced a version of the topic map paradigm for use in a web environment which provides an interchange syntax in XML. This XML interchange syntax, known as XTM has since been adopted by ISO and forms part of the ISO 13250 standard in its second edition.<em></em>

        "... a topic is an InformationObject that represents a subject"
      </p>
      <p>
        It may even represent an object which is not directly available in electronic form for use by the information processor of the computer. A topic "Reifies" its subject, making it available for computer handling.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There are five things we can add" (to the InformationObject called a topic):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Names
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
