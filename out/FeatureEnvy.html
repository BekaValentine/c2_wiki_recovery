        Feature Envy
      </h1>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FeatureEnvy.html">FeatureEnvy</a>, related to <a href="DisciplineEnvy.html">DisciplineEnvy</a>, is when a Weenie or language enthusiast sees a feature from another language that has no equivalent in his own, gets past the <a href="BlubParadox.html">BlubParadox</a> and actually recognizes the value in the feature, then, in a fit of jealous weeniedom, starts attempting to denigrate the feature to convince himself that it really isn't that great, that the language or paradigm of weeniedom will suffice, maybe even that it is <em>too</em> powerful and will obviously be abused to such a degree that it makes everyone else suffer.  If the weenie is of the more vociferous sort, this is accompanied by a keen wailing that sounds vaguely like a proper argument.

        <strong>Examples</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Lisp syntax sucks. It is powerful, but it isn't very <em>different</em> from all its other syntax! Even when macros are used to define special mini languages that fit a situation at hand - they really aren't mini languages at all - its just more lisp. It leads to a bowl of oatmeal with nail clippings mixed in (thanks <a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a>) - its strength is a weakness.
        </li>
        <li>
           Perl sucks. Too many features, too complicated, too much regex abuse.
        </li>
        <li>
           Tail call elimination sucks. How can you debug when <a href="TailCallOptimization.html">TailCallOptimization</a> is deleting the stack? You can just replace it with explicit iteration anyway! (though note that you can't replace TCO with iteration for <a href="ContinuationPassingStyle.html">ContinuationPassingStyle</a>, which leads to... '<a href="ContinuationPassingStyle.html">ContinuationPassingStyle</a> sucks...')
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> sucks. I can use unit tests to find everything that a type checker could, and besides, I like dynamic languages like <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="MessagePassing.html">MessagePassing</a>, <a href="ActorsModel.html">ActorsModel</a>, <a href="CommunicatingSequentialProcesses.html">CommunicatingSequentialProcesses</a>, etc. sucks. RealProgrammers use threads which allow for better performance.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Python sucks!  All that <a href="SyntacticallySignificantWhitespace.html">SyntacticallySignificantWhitespace</a> makes it hard to find the start and end of a block of code.  Keeping code blocks so short it fits conveniently in most editor windows is not a work-around.
        </li>
        <li>
           Lambdas suck!  They make the code too hard to understand! Every function should be explicitly named so your manager can read it and correct your work.
        </li>
