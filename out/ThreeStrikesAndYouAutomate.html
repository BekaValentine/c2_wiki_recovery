        Three Strikes And You Automate
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The first time you do something, you just do it manually.
        </li>
        <li>
           The second time you do something similar, you wince at the repetition, but you do it anyway.
        </li>
        <li>
           The third time you do something similar, you automate. <a href="AutomationIsOurFriend.html">AutomationIsOurFriend</a>.

        <strong>Examples:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>
           The process of renaming a class.  When you're using file-based source code and a file-based version control (such as CVS), renaming a single class is an ordeal.  Use something like <a href="ReadWriteGrep.html">ReadWriteGrep</a> and some ad-hoc scripts to make renaming a class more enjoyable event. <em>(Or use </em><a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> -- or IntelliJ IDEA)<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Build dependencies in C++.  You really shouldn't have to recalculate these by hand.  See the suggestions on <a href="RecursiveMakeConsideredHarmful.html">RecursiveMakeConsideredHarmful</a>.

           construct a GUI test-free, by running it over and over again, frequently by using the debugger
        </li>
      </ul>

           Don't forget <a href="TabCompletion.html">TabCompletion</a>, just because you use it without thinking.

        This violates the <a href="ZeroOneInfinityRule.html">ZeroOneInfinityRule</a>. You should automate on the second step because you KNOW you will repeat it.
