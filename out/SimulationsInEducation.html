        Simulations In Education

        In high school and college, I never got history, especially military history.  None of it seemed to make much sense; the only general principle was that, given a few years, the Americans tend to beat the Germans (cf. World Wars I-II, the American Revolution).

        Then, I started playing the computer version of Risk.  Suddenly, things like borders, and fortifying them, and defense in depth, and strategic alliances started making sense to me.  Later, I started playing Civilization (the computer game, not <a href="CivilizationGame.html">CivilizationGame</a>), and economic production started making sense.  I began by playing pretty militaristically (given my Risk experience), but gradually started paying attention to other things, like optimizing a city's production, specializing cities for military vs. other production, and citizen happiness.

        Now I get history better.  If I were a high school teacher, I'd shove computer simulations into my students' hands.  --<a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>
