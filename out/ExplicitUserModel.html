        Explicit User Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        In computing contexts, the "Explicit User Model" refers to a practice in which programmers attempt to define the model that users have for their software, then write the software to conform to that model.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems sensible until you discover that the users model <em>everything</em>, even your model. So, once you have your software that conforms to the users' model, the users will construct a model of that model. If you want to respond to that, you have to construct a model of the user's model of the current model. And so it continues.

        <em>[...] And so it continues.</em>

        Not necessarily. After all, humans also build models of each other without running into this problem. You stop if you reach a fixed point (which is guaranteed, because every modelling iteration throws away some detail to fit a complexity limit). But I fear software engineering has yet to reach this level; I suppose it's <a href="AiComplete.html">AiComplete</a>. -- <a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a>

        You know, this seems erroneous. For most software and for most users, users don't have <strong>any</strong> model of the software. They just have a list of predefined tasks which they've memorized. That's not a model. Or if it is then it's a pathological one.

           You know, that seems erroneous. The model is inside the user's head. It is our task to discover then animate it. -- <a href="PeterLynch.html">PeterLynch</a>

        Do you have <em>any</em> evidence for this rather extraordinary claim?  Surely it depends on the user, and whether they are a mapper or a packer, a hedgehog or a fox, a model-maker or a stamp-collector.

      <p>
        Users are complex, software doubly so. Control that complexity and you're winning, even if you don't know the rules.
