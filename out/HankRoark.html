        I am the Senior Architect for Agris Corporation, a division of John Deere.  I can be reached at <a href="mailto:hroark@acm.com.">mailto:hroark@acm.com.</a>

        I am an ENTP (I used to be an ENTJ, but the life as a consultant has changed me. Now nothing is ever settled in my life.)  I think P's have more fun than J's.

        I am a reformed CppProgrammer now prefering to use Java.  Java, mainly because of the market focus (I suspect), is a much more enjoyable language with better tools.  I don't know how I ever lived without MetaObjects and an Envy-like environment (ala <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> For Java).

        My interests these days are focused on what does it take to turn someone from a OO-language expert to an OO expert (i.e.: Why does the person next to me know so much about C++ (for example) and yet so little about OO and the idioms that go along with it?).  Also, I am interested in why there seems to be so few good OO people.

        I commonly recommend <em>Thinking in C++</em>
        ISBN:0139177094 and <em>Thinking in Java</em>
        ISBN:0136597238 to people wishing to learn OO.  I love <em>Design Patterns</em>
        (GOF) but find it difficult to those new to OO to understand.  As such, I am now recommending <em></em><a href="ObjectOrientedDesignHeuristics.html">ObjectOrientedDesignHeuristics</a><em></em>
        by Arthur J. Riel ISBN:020163385X, <em>Designing Object-Oriented C++ Applications : Using the Booch Method</em>
        by Robert Martin ISBN:0132038374, and <em></em><a href="TheCrcCardBook.html">TheCrcCardBook</a><em></em>
        by David Bellin and Susan Suchman Simone ISBN:0201895358.  All are excellent and tend to get developers thinking in terms of objects quickly.

        <em>Isn't </em><a href="HankRoark.html">HankRoark</a> the name of an AynRand protagonist?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hank Roark is two AynRand heroes in one.  Howard Roark was the hero of TheFountainhead; Hank Rearden was a hero of <a href="AtlasShrugged.html">AtlasShrugged</a>.
