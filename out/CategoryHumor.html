        I was not aware of <a href="CategoryWhimsy.html">CategoryWhimsy</a>. Some might fit into <a href="CategoryWhimsy.html">CategoryWhimsy</a>, but probably don't quite fit into <a href="CategoryJoke.html">CategoryJoke</a>. Others probably best fit <a href="CategoryJoke.html">CategoryJoke</a>. I think the combination of the two, however, would be sufficient. I'm starting to change a few of them. -- <a href="JasonNocks.html">JasonNocks</a>

        A <a href="SenseOfHumor.html">SenseOfHumor</a> is necessary for those who believe they are sane to cling to that belief. Especially when dealing with boring, technical matters all day. So <a href="AlmostNeverDeleteHumor.html">AlmostNeverDeleteHumor</a>.
