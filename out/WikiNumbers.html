        All right, try not to wet your pants laughing.

        I'm trying to construct a calendar using wiki -- a WikiCalendar if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have puzzled over a variety of anti-intuitive naming systems that will allow years, month names, and day numbers to be represented with words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, yeah, and the data should sort properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Has anyone out there managed to concoct a (viable, sortable) way to represent numerical data in a wiki using no digits?
      </p>

        <em>I doubt that it can be done. However, some wikis allow digits as well as letters in a pagename.</em>

        It is trivial if you allow digits.  <a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a> wrote this PacificTime 20040121.230805 -- look but don't laugh at
