        Windows Reboot After Changing Settings
      </h1>
      <p>
        Windows 9x is notorious for requiring a restart after changes to trivial settings such as the machine's IP address, default gateway, or even DNS addresses!  This has caused millions of hours of time to be wasted in attempting to troubleshoot PCs which for some reason or another aren't cooperating with a newly-attached network.

        It is about quality of software that deals with networking. That explains why so much security holes were, and makes think that things are not very likely to change considerably. -- <a href="VadimKonovalov.html">VadimKonovalov</a>
