        We are all in this together.  Frankly, if we stop treating each other so badly and try rather to understand one another and elevate those things that are good and confront those that are bad without recriminations then life would be better.

        Everyone is a pearl of great price -- there are no 
        <em> losers </em>
        there are no 
        <em> winners </em> -- for in the final act all the players die.  I'm always a little amused by the bumper sticker, 
        <em> The one who dies with the most toys, wins! </em>

        So become a student of your fellow man.  Look with eyes of wonder on each person that you meet, because they are an original, a work of art and if you don't see that, perhaps it is because you have not looked hard enough. --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>

        I always liked <em>He who dies with the most toys, dies anyway.</em>
