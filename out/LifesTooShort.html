        Lifes Too Short
      </h1>
      <p>
        Used in statements like, "life's too short to spend it standing in line."
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea that there's little enough time to do interesting things in life, so why waste it on stupid stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interesting counter assertion is that LifesTooLong.  Think about it.  If you're actually doing something fun, then, indeed, life's too short.  If you're doing something that hurts -- daily -- then every hour spent doing it is like days or weeks, and now life's too long <em>if it's spent in pain</em>. - <em>There is a video about Johny kennedy suffering daily from Epidermolysis Bullosa, a genetic disorder that cause blistering and shearing of the skin from even the mildest of friction.

        Life does in fact go on and on, but specific lives have a beginning and an end. 
        The duration of a life is indeterminate and unpredictable.  
        The statement "Life is too short" begs the question; too short for what?
        If you only had one more hour, day, week, year; what would you do?
        Why are you not doing these now?

        This assumes that time can be wasted and that some activities ("something fun", activities that trigger pleasure responses) are not a waste of time.

        For me, that means I don't want to spend any more time wondering where a pointer is pointing, what is on the heap; I don't want to write another linked list; in fact, I don't want to write any more transaction logs in my life. There are much more interesting things to program. Rumor reaches me the Talmud says, "Plant a tree, have a child, write a book." Now I just have to go plant that tree. Alistair (1997)

        Actually, I made that <a href="LifesTooShort.html">LifesTooShort</a> decision back in 1988, deciding against C++ and for Smalltalk / Prolog / Lisp. I have since dropped Prolog as being too low level. I wrote the opening paragraph back in 1996 or 97, when I was also fed up with transaction logs and trying to find reusable components at a higher level. Now I am faced with Java and itty bitty Java beans.

        The sad fact is that in my 21 years in the Biz developing software, despite all the hype to the contrary, it looks to me like we still seem to be doing it the same old way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Organizations under ever-increasing competitive and cost pressures revert to behavior that feels comfortable - no matter how much we try to change the process of development, it always collapses into the rubble of the waterfall. Peel back the skin of whatever the current rage may be, it's still the same old same old. We still work at lower levels than seems to make sense after all this time, we still organize our work so that it's easy to manage rather than organizing so that it's easier to do, and I'm very nearly at the point where I want to say the hell with it. Life is too short to repeat the same stupid experiences again and again.

      </p>
      <p>
        Make the next tree you plant a Shrieking Tree. Whenever you get that frustrated feeling (and we all feel it sometimes!), go and shout at the tree. The tree can take all the curses and frustrations and hurts, and you may even get to feel better. The world would be a much better place if more people talked to (or even shouted at) trees more often. Of course it would be much, <em>much</em> better if more people actually <em>listened</em> to the trees once in awhile... but that's a whole other topic.

The response was amazement that I would waste the time learning a library interface.

        You may be missing the point that the experience crafting something well is an enjoyment. What does it matter that it has done 1000 times before? Everyone has looked at a sunset. Should I not because of that? The difference is in our personal experience of it. Maybe next time they won't write the link list because they have experienced it. Maybe they will write it new every time. Life is too short to try and tell other people what is a waste of their time.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even if they wrote a linked list three times before, they are still going to screw up some pointer or some mutex or something, just because they insist that <em>the linked list in our common library is not </em>'entirely<em>' what they want</em>. And I have to call their cr*ppy library from <em>our</em> project at work, and we will get access violations all over the place. -- <a href="BjarkeEbert.html">BjarkeEbert</a>

        I worked in London as a contractor for a number of years. I spent most of my time either in work or being stressed about travelling to and from work. I'd usually spend 14 hours a day away from home and my beautiful baby daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was travelling home on a train and it stopped in the dark in the middle of nowhere for an hour, with no reason why. Then an announcement, as the train began to move, that there had been a fatality on the line and that all services on the line had been suspended. The train pulled into a station and we all got off and walked down the platform intending to find taxis home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was impatient, and was about the third person off the train.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I walked down the platform, I began to see, in the half light, that someone had dropped some meat on the platform. I thought "that's fairly stupid, someone will kick themselves when they get home and discover that their shopping bag has ripped and that their steak has fallen out somewhere". In retrospect, I find it amazing that my mind was trying to protect me in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I got closer to the meat, the image began to get clearer. It was steaming, and covered in little pipelets each of which had a drip of blood at the end. The strangest thing was the pattern covering it. It was all wrinkled, and gray with red smears on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started to retch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started to vomit.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked up. The rest of the platform was covered in various bits of body. Arms, legs, bits of lung.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just so wrong that we (15 of us in all) had been forced to walk through <em>that</em>. I saw a policeman, got angry, punched him. He didn't complain, odd, perhaps he was in shock too. It was the wrong thing to do; it didn't make me feel any better.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the news the next day, I learnt that an 18 year old had seen his train waiting at the platform, and had just run across the tracks behind it in the hope of catching it. He was hit by an express train (the Flying Scotsman) passing on the central track. It was doing about 120 miles an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        An 18 year old!

        I don't waste time anymore. I don't program for programming's sake. I do XP because it allows me to spend less time at work and more time with my beautiful daughters (we have three now). I don't waste time doing anything more than once. I don't waste time doing things for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        A month later, I quit my contracts and we moved to New Zealand; now I'm a consultant over here. I show people how to do XP, I teach Java, I swim, I play with my girls, I eat, I have a life. I plan to plant a tree. I keep thinking about a book, but I don't really have time for that, I'm too busy enjoying life. I only work where I know that I'll enjoy it.

        "There is nothing new under the sun" was uttered thousands of years ago. As time goes by, I wonder where all of this technobabble is taking us. People waste valuable oxygen debating miniscule points which are just as ridiculous as "it depends on what the meaning of 'is' is". When enough people learn a particular jargon and the people who speak it are no longer the elite, someone will come up with a 'new and fresh' approach and terminology. If you haven't read 'Jacques Barzun, The House of Intellect', please do and you will realize that the guild system is still around and people have made fortunes convincing us the Emperor has something on. Nevertheless, projects keep on failing at a greater rate than at any time in history.

        As a practical matter, any occupation has some degree of apprenticeship. We all work toward mastery of something, but the drive to be the next so-and-so (Bill Gates, Grady Booch, Dennis Rodman) does consume valuable time and some of us are not up to it. If we are lucky enough to have the choice in the manner in which we spend our time, we should spend it in the way that gives us the most satisfaction. So if I want to waste my hours playing PC games rather than preparing a class on UML, I should be allowed to do this - of course my boss disagrees. Since I rent my time to him, I guess I have to do something I don't want to do. Maybe that's why they call it 'work'. On the other hand, I 'earn' time periods in which I can do whatever I like and empty my mind of everything, which is where the vacate in vacation must come from.

Also, my process automation gear has made the workplace safer for lots of people in factory settings. Is that not something to take pride in? Life <em>is</em> short, so I'd prefer to work on the stuff that matters. (I'm going to pretend I had nothing to do with those 8051-based TV remote controls.)

        I had a Eureka moment recently where I realized something that is inter-twined with <a href="LifesTooShort.html">LifesTooShort</a>. It is this -- "There are no style points." Or, you might word it as "No one is grading this."

        I think a lot of computer programmers like me can tend to be neurotic, or perhaps borderline obsessive-compulsive (not necessarily to the extreme that would be clinically diagnosed, but nearly all psychological disorders are simply matters of degrees). We have the capacity to manage thousands of details and create a system which controls all of them, in order to make a group of computers do what we want. To do that, we need some amount of perfectionism or obsessive-compulsion or something like that.

        As a result, in other areas of life, we might get too caught up in things. For example, imagine that you took great pride at having a perfect attendance in third grade. Well, now that you're an adult, and are 15 years into your career, does it *really* *matter* that you got a perfect attendance award? Looking back from your vantage point now, did it really make as much difference in how your life unfolded as you would have expected? Were the rewards proportional to the amount of mental devotion you put into it at the time?

        My dad died in October, and one of the things that struck me was that, one day, he just died. It's not like he "finished things up", and then was "ready to move on to the next adventure", like you might see in some fantasy novel. No, he just died one day. That's how we'll all go. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And in the meantime, *no* *one* *is* *grading* how we perform each day. Whether or not you believe in God, even He is not grading every little detail of how clean your house is, or whether your car is waxed, or whatever it is you obsess over these days.

        <a href="LifesTooShort.html">LifesTooShort</a>, and there are no style points. No one is grading this. So just decide what is important to you, what helps you self-actualize, and invest your time in those things as much as possible. <a href="CharlieFlowers.html">CharlieFlowers</a>
