        Code Is Law
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a meme (purportedly) created by Lawrence Lessig of Harvard University, noting his observations on the dominating power of computers and the software that runs on them.

      <p>
        As software becomes ubiquitous, their power rises proportionally.  If people cannot inspect or modify the code, they, through a more-or-less subconscious "assimilation", become entrenched to the rules and protocols implemented by the creator's of that software, whereby it becomes difficult to abandon the manufacturer; in effect, creating a post facto dependency.  At the time, because of the power of Windows and its marketing machine, this was seen as a possible <strong>totalitarian</strong> danger.
