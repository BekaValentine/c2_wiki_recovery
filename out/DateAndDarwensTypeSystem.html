        Date And Darwens Type System
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>, <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> and <a href="HughDarwen.html">HughDarwen</a> propose ways of "marrying" OO and the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>; a key part of that is a type system with some interesting properties. (It is claimed by others that this type system is insufficiently rigorous to be useful; see bottom of this page.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, there are three versions described in <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>.  In the base version, there is no inheritance or subtyping.  In the "second" version, subtype polymorphism is added, but only single inheritance is allowed ("inheritance" is used loosely here; as the mechansim for subtyping isn't necessarily inheritance).  In the "third" version, a limited form of <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a> (<a href="SingleMeetMultipleInheritance.html">SingleMeetMultipleInheritance</a>) is allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The text below applies to the second and third versions (unless indicated otherwise).
      </p>
      <p>

        </li>
        <li>
           In a design choice reminiscent of <a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a>, object methods (called "operators" in <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>) are not associated with a type, but instead are external to the types ("domains") themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
           Subtyping can be implemented in one of several ways, including:
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="InterfaceInheritance.html">InterfaceInheritance</a>.  A subtype must be able to handle all of the "read operators" (accessors) and honor all of the type invariants ("constraints") of its supertypes.  However, it may discard the implementation details (in particular, the data representation--the "possible representation(s)", or possreps) of the supertype.  In an interesting twist, subtypes do <em>not</em> need to honor all the mutators ("update operators") of their supertype.  Considering the <a href="CircleAndEllipseProblem.html">CircleAndEllipseProblem</a>, <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> come down firmly on the side of those who claim than a circle is a subtype of an ellipse, and not vice versa.

        <li>
           <a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a> (as found in OO languages) doesn't exist; instead <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> speak of "values" and "variables".  A value is always immutable; a variable is a cell which can refer to one value at one time, another value at another time.  Variables are only allowed within function bodies, and within the "database" type (which is a dictionary of <a href="RelationalVariable.html">RelationalVariable</a>s).  
          <ul>
            <li>
               Tuples, attributes, and domains still are immutable (they may not contain variables)--essentially, they all are <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>s. Only mutable entities in a database are <a href="RelationalVariable.html">RelationalVariable</a>s. This is somewhat at odds with many types of "traditional" OO programming; which use objects to model changing state. (In D&D's world; handling changing persistent state is the job of the DBMS).
            </li>
            <li>
               In furtherance of the above, what the OO world calls "constructors" are instead called "selectors".  Rather than calling a constructor to create a new and unique object (which didn't exist before, and is independent of and distinct from other objects created with the same constructor call), the selector "selects" a particular value from the already-extant set of possible values in the universe; two subsequent selectors with the same arguments return the same "value"; the two values are indistinguishable.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           PointersAreExcluded: Still no "pointers" (but see comments below). Proper way to do indirection is via composition or <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a>s. It's OK to have objects containing other objects, or relations (but <em>not</em> <a href="RelationalVariable.html">RelationalVariable</a>s), or have relations as attributes.
        </li>
        <li>
           There are no method calls per se. Run-time polymorphism of operator calls is described, exactly like multimethods, although Date, at least, appears not to be familiar with that term. (In fact, it seems possible that they have independently reinvented MultiMethods.)
        </li>
        <li>
           The object system is more akin to the <a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a> (<a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a>, etc.) than to the <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, or Java models.  That's not a bad thing, but it's not familiar to most programmers.

        <strong>On inconsistency and undecidability:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, D&D do have a seemingly complete treatment, except where it leaks: here and there, especially in the essential parts. Most notably a compiler/database system, type checker, etc, will not be able to decide if the type system declared by the user is sound. It is also unclear what exactly defines a type, what are the programmer's responsibilities with regards to declaring types, subtypes, "posreps", operations, etc. Well, with a little bit of imagination, one can fill in the dots, and arrive at a type system that will have unsuitable properties for building software systems. The jury is still out until they do actually come up with a rigorous and complete proposals for a type system, rather than sketches of this or that principle. Their documentation with regards to type theory is especially weak.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The main thing to remember about types, however is that they are a syntactic tool for abstraction. A type system will have the essential role of realizing type judgement, assign a type to a legal syntactic element in the language, and that type assignment will ensure that the expression can be evaluated, and when evaluated it will yield a value in a certain domain. But the key thing to remember is that they are a tool for abstraction, and a syntactic tool at that. The typing judgement should be deterministic, and computationally feasible.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hear, hear. This is one reason why DependentTypeSystems have not become popular.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>All the other consideration cannot be entirely separated from language design pragamatics, there's no such thing like </em>'the<em>' right way of constructing a type system, which D&D naively imply (they even have a pseudo-theorem stating that if "type inheritance" is to be supported, then it will have to conform to their model). Different languages take different decisions that are motivated by many trade-offs in the overall exercise of language design for real. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [[One of the most basic tradeoffs, in fact, is whether the type system's power should be purposefully crippled to force it to be decideable (which some think is the only way to go), or whether it should be as powerful as possible, and thus undecideable (as others think is the only way to go).]]
      </p>
      <p>
        [[It doesn't seem to me to be possible to "prove" that one or the other is the only way to go, because both have been done, and both have separate strengths and weaknesses, and so far, some prefer the one while some prefer the other.]]

        <strong>On convertibility:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing I have wondered about is whether a "looser" type system based more on <em>convertibility</em> between types, rather than superset/subset relationships, would work within their relational algebra context. (Sorry if this is getting a bit off-topic for the page -- feel free to move this discussion elsewhere.) -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        [[What do you have in mind? The most general kind of "convertibility" is any function whatsoever that takes as parameter an object or value of type T1 and returns one of type T2, but that's too general.]]
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I haven't thought it through much, but I was thinking in terms of discarding the notions of supertype/subtype and IS-A, and instead focusing just on programmer-defined implicit convertibility between types. In other words, the programmer defining a type can define explicitly how values of that type can be converted to or from other types. Thus you get a web of connections based on convertibility rather than IS-A or set relationships. This seems like it might be a bit more -- flexible? pragmatic? I dunno. It doesn't directly address the semantic-substitutability view of types, I guess, but remember that I'm coming from a focus on D&D's point of view. Also, I've been developing a dislike for the object-message type of OOP in favor of the more flexible and general multimethod style of polymorphism; this probably also has implications for how one prefers to view types, by eliminating the special status of the message receiver and putting all "objects" back in the role of data passed as arguments or returned as values.

        On <strong>Everything but </strong><a href="RelationalVariable.html">RelationalVariable</a>s should be immutable<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If all objects are immutable (and many think they ought to be), this would be workable. After all, there is no discernible difference between a given immutable object and its copy. Likewise, if a type coercion results in a new object which is isomorphic in some sense to the original - it doesn't matter that it's not the same physical object. Where this breaks down is when objects are mutable. Type casts (which only matter in a statically typed language), including subsumption of subtypes (upcasts), downcasts, etc. all return a reference to <em>the same object</em>; though with a new associated type (of the reference, not the object). An upcast (converting from a subtype to a supertype) involves a weaker invariant; a downcast (the other way) involves a stronger one. However, in all cases it's the same object -and <em>any mutation performed via one reference to an object is (potentially) visible through all references</em>. With type coercions, a <em>new</em> object is created; and if either the original or new objects are mutable; changes to one do <em>not</em> become reflected on the other (at least not without a whole lot of additional work). For <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>s, your proposal might work well; and many languages <em>do</em> have a type coercion graph with lots of edges. For <a href="ReferenceObject.html">ReferenceObject</a>s, that's another matter altogether. -- <a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In D&D's type system there is no casting, because specialization is by constraint. There is no down cast because an object always knows it's most specific type. There is no upcast because all members of a subtype must be a valid member of the supertype. For example, in traditional OO you may have Polygon with the method Perimeter. For the polygon type the perimeter is calculated by looping through each of the sides and summing them. A subtype of Polygon is Square. For square perimeter is calculated simply by multiplying the size of a side by 4, since there are always 4 sides of equal length. If you have a polygon with 4 equal sides, it will still be calculated by the longer methods unless you cast it to square. In D & Ds type system Square is declare as a subtype of Polygon where there are 4 sides of equal length. Whenever you have a polygon with 4 sides of equal length it will always be treated as a square, regardless of what type it was declared with. There is no need to downcast, since you will always have the most specific type. There is no need to upcast because the square is always a valid polygon. It meets all of the necessary constraints of a polygon. -- Ged Byrne
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ged, what you say is not quite true. There is a (family of) downcast operator(s) in <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> (TREAT_DOWN_AS_T). Since Tutorial D is statically typed, it might sometimes be necessary to satisfy static type checking by downcasting values or variables. Furthermore, although it is conceptually true that every value has a <em>most-specific type</em>, it is not necessarily true that every value "knows" its most-specific type, and it's certainly not true that a <em>variable</em> necessarily "knows" the most-specific type of its current value. Whether that's the case or not is an implementation detail, something which is touched on briefly in one of the appendices or footnotes in the second edition of <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>. I had an exchange with Date where he said that he and Hugh suspected that it would not, in fact, be necessary for the most-specific type to be known for every value -- or perhaps ever, unless there was a way for a programmer to interrogate it. In working on code based on many of their ideas, I'd say that the suspicion is likely correct, although I can't claim to have implemented anything like the full type system yet. It depends in part on what guarantees one does or does not make regarding polymorphic operator invocations, and D&D are explicitly vague on this point -- although they justify the vagueness in ways that I think are compelling, but which are certainly open to debate. Costin is in fact right to question their type system -- it needs to be tested more in practice. (But I would still like to see more specifics from him on why he deems it insufficiently formal. I'm examining the allegation as time permits, but I don't know enough to definitely agree or disagree with him yet. I suspect at this point that his objections boil down more to one of form than content, but I'm sure he'd disagree.) -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Yes, <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a>'s type system is based on immutable values. They make a sharp distinction between values and variables, eschewing the term "object". I find that their insistence on a sharp distinction between "value" and "variable" clarifies certain things; the definitions of these terms are more easily agreed on than that of "object", and are sufficient. They do allow for indirect references to <em>variables</em>, via in/out parameters of operators and via a downcast operator. (They call these references "pseudo-variables".) Binding a variable to an in-out parameter requires that the type of the variable be a supertype of the parameter's. Downcasting a variable requires a run-time check of the variables value to ensure that the value conforms to the target subtype. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It should be noted that in the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, the only thing which may be a variable is a <a href="RelationalVariable.html">RelationalVariable</a> (relvar for short); records/tuples and attributes are always values. -- <a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since the only primitive mutator of a variable is assignment (other notations being merely a shorthand for some combination of value-construction and variable-assignment), it seems to me that type coercion might suffice in place of supertype/subtype relationships.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           One can, of course, model mutable objects as a sequence of immutable objects, referenced by a single mutable pointer (which all users of the object must go through--a sort-of <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>). When one modifies an object, one creates a new object with the new state, and then updates the mutable pointer to point to the new object. Of course, it can be shown that the old object is no longer live, in-place mutation may be performed as an optimization. The <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> does that to some extent--clients only access the database through relational variables; never accessing relations directly. As everything else is a value (records, attributes), copy semantics can be used to read/write stuff from the database. This brings us to the <a href="ValueObjectHypotheses.html">ValueObjectHypotheses</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Demonstrating liveness isn't that difficult, because in D, <em>all objects are stack allocated</em>.  <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> never explicitly mention this, but it's a consequence (possibly unintended) of their variable/value distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Surely you mean, </em>an implementation of D could always stack-allocate objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variables in D are never aliased: there is always exactly one copy in scope at a given time.  If they were, you'd run into the difficulties described below (and in Appendix G).  It'd also violate OO Proscription 2, "No object identities".
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, you know that when the variable containing a value gets assigned to, mutated, or goes out of scope, the existing value is dead.  Thus, you can always use in-place mutation for assignment, syntactic sugar for "update" operators, and stack allocation of AllocationRecords.
      </p>
      <p>
        A corollary of this is that any value with indefinite extent <em>must</em> be global.  In other words, we're programming in pointer-less C (with a database, of course).  Whether this is a good thing is somewhat debatable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn't apply if D supports <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>s or any other form of non-LIFO scoping, but if you have any sort of nested scopes, you're allowing aliasing in the presence of update operators.  I have a moderately long analysis prepared on how this would make <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> inconsistent.  I snipped it because I realized that as written, the prescriptions in the manifesto <em>aren't</em> inconsistent, so it would just be wankery on my part to post it.  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

        On <strong>Pointers are excluded</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that I feel might be missing from <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a>'s type system is a means of having one variable refer to another; in other words, there is nothing directly recognizable as a pointer. I think that they might argue that the relational aspects of the system, which define <em>tuples</em> and <em>relations</em> as the only aggregate types, can fulfill the roles that pointers or <a href="GeneralizedReference.html">GeneralizedReference</a>s would. It is indeed a very relational-model-centric view of programming. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pointers are deliberately excluded, though Date (haven't read <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>; have read and own <a href="AnIntroductionToDatabaseSystems.html">AnIntroductionToDatabaseSystems</a>) engages in a little bit of obfuscation as to why. He tends to equate "pointer" with "physical address"; implying that any pointers that are less abstract than the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>s method of indirection (the <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a>) are just as dirty and nasty as hardcoded physical addresses. Which is nonsense, of course; one could conceivable have "pointers" to specific relations/tuples/attributes that don't go through a <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a>, but operate at a higher level than a physical address (allowing RDBMS optimizations, as appropriate). Indeed - given that relations/tuples/attributes are immutable (as opposed to relvars, which aren't) - the difference between a pointer to a particular relation/tuple/attribute and an "inline copy" is an optimization detail. -- <a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I thought they were pretty clear why pointers didn't work, and it had nothing to do with physical addresses.  It's all about aliasing.  If you have any sort of reference, then you may have multiple variables that might be affected by any sort of mutation.  That's the whole point of references.  In fact, you can think of a mutable "object" as being a set of variables that all change their values simultaneously when one of them is updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        This runs into problems with <a href="SpecializationByConstraint.html">SpecializationByConstraint</a>, as D&D explain in Appendix G.  To recap their argument (almost verbatim), consider the following code:
      </p>
      <code>
        VAR E ELLIPSE;<br/>
        VAR C CIRCLE;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        C := CIRCLE(LENGTH(3.0));<br/>
        E := C;<br/>
        THE_MINOR_AXIS(E) := LENGTH(4.0));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is all legal <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> code.  The first assignment just invokes a Circle selector to assign a particular value.  The second assignment is legal because Circles are substitutable for Ellipses: every Circle is an Ellipse.  The third assignment is legal because the declared type of E is Ellipse, and THE_MINOR_AXIS is an operator defined on Ellipses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under normal <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> semantics, this presents no problem.  GeneralizationByConstraint occurs on the third assignment, so E now holds an Ellipse.  And only values are stored in variables, so this doesn't affect C at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you allow references or <a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a>, then C would have to change with the mutation of E.  But Circles don't have a minor axis!  How can you set the minor axis when it doesn't have one?  You'd either have to break the constraint that a circle's minor axis equal its major axis, or you'd have to change the major axis too, which isn't what the code asked for.

        One of the anonymous writers here has a rather dim view of D&D's work, at least partly unjustifiable, I think. In particular, this statement: "It is also unclear what exactly defines a type, what are the programmers responsibility with regards to declaring types, subtypes, "posreps" [sic], operations..." is patently incorrect. These issues are made quite clear in the <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>, and the suggested syntax for the admittedly (by the authors) incomplete language "Tutorial D" even includes all the constructs necessary for this. I'm under no illusions that their type system is the only possible right one, nor am I even convinced that all of their stated requirements are really necessary to support their goals with respect to relational rigor, but I've yet to see (here or elsewhere on this wiki) any significant, valid criticisms of it. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>

        <em>Valid criticisms are to be expected when we will have a formally defined language with that particular type system. There's nothing to criticize about language D, as there's no such thing as language D.

      </p>
      <code>
        TYPE point is<br/>
        POSSREP cartesian { x double, y double}<br/>
        POSSREP polar { r double, theta double }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Is this enough to properly define the type point? It is, according to Tutorial D syntax. The semantics however, are left as an exercise:</em> 
      </p>
      <code>
        POINT p= cartesian ( 1, 2);<br/>
        THE_x(p) := 2;<br/>
        THE_theta(p) := PI;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>How about defining a + operator?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        OPERATOR '+' ( P1: POINT, P2: POINT ) RETURNS POINT
        BEGIN
        /* what goes in here? */ 
        END
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Similar holes are there with regards to subtyping and many other crucial aspects. Of course a language without formal semantics and without a serious implementation exercise is doomed to have many holes, so the presumption should be that it is incomplete until proven otherwise.

      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that some parts of the language are not specified does not automatically invalidate other parts of the language. And the semantics of the language are fairly well defined in the book.

      <p>
        <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> explicitly declined to fill in details of defining and manipulating actual representations in Tutorial D's syntax, although in spite of this they give some speculative examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They do not define the semantics of the constructs in a rigorous way.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, you can easily define an addition operator with what <em>is</em> given in the book -- you don't need actual representations to do that. (Although they do not address the definition of infix operators, nor is that in any way necessary.):
      </p>
      <code>
        OPERATOR ADD (P1: POINT, P2: POINT) RETURNS POINT<br/>
        BEGIN<br/>
        RETURN cartesian(THE_x(P1) + THE_x(P2), THE_y(P1) + THE_y(P2));<br/>
        END<br/>

        <em>Part 3 of the book that is suppose to define the "meat" of the language has the title "informal discussions and explanations", and that's exactly what it is, they are not a systematic attempt in any way shape or form to define the semantics of the language.

           One does not define a language by its implementation, nor is a large body of documentation a formal specification of a language, nor is a large body of documentation a good sign when describing a <em>language</em> itself.

        Implementation of Tutorial D would be difficult not because of a lack of completeness or rigor in the language's definition, but rather because of the demands imposed by its relational operations. Some aspects of the type system that might be difficult to implement (e.g. rigorous type system verification) are quality-of-implementation rather than correctness issues, and are mentioned explicitly by D&D in footnotes or appendices.

           What does <strong>formal</strong> mean? They do not define properly (i.e. acceptable mathematical definition) what is a scalar type what is a scalar value, what is a non-scalar type. Then there is the sweeping under the rug of possrep problems. If one scalar type may have several possible representations, but there shall be an <strong>storage structure definition language</strong>??? An unnecessary entity that should have gone by way of <a href="OccamsRazor.html">OccamsRazor</a>. How can any one claim that if a system (dbms or otherwise), knows how to physically represent integers, the same system will be at a loss representing the product type ( x:integer ; y:integer )? Then there is this extra feature that a "scalar operator" can only produce a scalar? You mean, is it verbotten for somebody to write a function that takes input an integer and produces a set of integers? Why? In all part II the formal part, the only "formal" thing is chapter 5, the BNF syntax , which is, like I've said incomplete. Go to page 64, you'll see that there's not type inheritance clause.

           Note that there is a misunderstanding in the above paragraph. D&D use the term "scalar operator" to describe operators that produce a scalar result.

           They are not formal to begin with. They are informal English discussions on what this or that means. Even if informal, they are in the sense of "not mathematically formal", they are also "informal" in the sense that they are imprecise, and incomplete. Not all the concepts with which authors operate have been precisely defined. Even basic concepts like variable, and scalar value. In comparison, you can always find "informal semantics" but precise and complete semantics for major programming languages. I've posted some references above.

While they do seem a lot more formal than most language definitions, I do think he has a point.  There's a <em>lot</em> of ambiguity in concepts like "variable".

        If you find it objectionable that the details of how to get from the actual representation, whatever it is, to either polar coordinates or cartesian coordinates, then you're quite missing the point of the book. If some people are holding <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> up as an exemplar of good programming language design, then they also are missing the point. The book is about investigating the requirements for relational database systems. The authors acknowledge that there are open issues that require further investigation; if you can come up with concrete arguments as to why those issues are unresolvable or debilitating, I'm sure that the authors would be interested in hearing them. As it stands, I think that their type system is quite interesting. I agree that a concrete implementation based on these ideas would be illuminating. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>

        [Whoa, hold up, guys, things are drifting out of control. As a not-so-innocent bystander, it seems clear to me that the central argument was already clearly stated: ``"It is also unclear what exactly defines a type, what are the programmers responsibility with regards to declaring types, subtypes, "posreps" [sic], operations..." is patently incorrect<em>.]</em>

        OK, then I'll have to wait for Costin to post more specific objections that haven't already been refuted. The issue of how to define and work with actual representations is immaterial to the type system, so if he's objecting to the type system per se, this was an irrelevant digression.

        [Actually, the type implementer has to choose an actual implementation and then to provide operators to convert between the actual representation and the possible representation(s).

           I don't think it's useless, but I do think it can be dangerous, and sometimes less than helpful.  The problem is that LanguageFeaturesAreNotOrthogonal.  The various interactions between parts of a programming language can often have unintended consequences when you try to actually use them for real work.  I doubt that the designer of Pascal (<a href="NiklausWirth.html">NiklausWirth</a>?) thought "Lets break strings" when he figured that arrays of different sizes should be different types.  There's a reason why automatic PartialApplication only appears in languages with <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a>: with <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a>, it leads to incorrect but uncaught behavior every time you forget a function argument.

           More to the point, it's a lot easier for people to test an actual implementation for both bugs (logical inconsistencies) and usage problems (hard to do X).

        Thanks for the insightful comments, Jonathan. After reviewing that part of Appendix G, I understood your explanation of the consequences of aliasing and nested lexical scopes immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that there is, of course, a form of aliasing implied by virtual relvars. I think that using a TREAT_DOWN operator in a relational expression that defines a virtual relvar can cause an interesting problem. Inserting a tuple containing supertype value in a referenced base relvar would cause the virtual relvar to become unreadable, due to run-time type errors. One could imagine a similar approach to aliasing of variables, although the overhead would be high. Given the defined parts of the language, and allowing nested lexical scopes, a TREAT_DOWN operator can facilitate aliasing of a variable via an update parameter, as you implied. The initial invocation of TREAT_DOWN does a run-time check of the source to make sure that its MST conforms. In analogy to the use of TREAT_DOWN in virtual relvars, I can imagine tagging the referencing variable (parameter) in a fashion that requires the check to be repeated every time that the variable is read. This approach could, of course, be extended to pointers, too. Not very attractive from a performance POV, perhaps, but it seems consistent with the aliasing that occurs in relvars. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>
