        Hyper Pentahedron

        At 12:00, the room is empty. At 12:05, a point-sized tetrahedron appears in the 
        middle of the room, which keeps growing with constant speed, until at 12:15, it
        simply disappears. What you just witnessed was a <a href="HyperPentahedron.html">HyperPentahedron</a> (if my four-dimensional intuition is right :-) --<a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a> <em>Someone has read </em><a href="FlatLand.html">FlatLand</a>.<em></em>

        Of course this is assuming it is aligned with the time axis, and its height is about 10 minutes. :-) --<a href="HaskoHeinecke.html">HaskoHeinecke</a>

           minutes = 111600000 miles as Einstein flies. You better hope that thing ain't spinning. Or that it's a verrrry <a href="BigRoom.html">BigRoom</a>.

        <em>I've read </em><a href="FlatLand.html">FlatLand</a>, and I say that Einstein's air speed is largely irrelevant. We get to assume that the <a href="HyperPentahedron.html">HyperPentahedron</a> exists for all time, but took 10 minutes to pass through our three-dimensional slice of <a href="FourSpace.html">FourSpace</a>. -- <a href="IanKjos.html">IanKjos</a><em></em>

        Mathematicians call this a 4-simplex. (A tetrahedron is a 3-simplex, a triangle is a 2-simplex, a line segment is a 1-simplex, a point is a 0-simplex.)
