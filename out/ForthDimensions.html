      <p>
        Forth Dimensions is a magazine that went out of print a decade ago... and recently scanned versions of every copy have been released to the public.

        From the webpage: <em>The Forth Interest Group's bi-monthly, hard-copy magazine with an international circulation was founded in 1978. The owner of one of Silicon Valley's most successful computer bookstores called it, "The best special-interest technical magazine ever". Forth Dimensions is no longer published.</em>
