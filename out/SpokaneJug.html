        We meet the 3rd Monday of each month from 4-6pm at the 
        Spokane Intercollegiate Research and Technology Institute
        (SIRTI).
      </p>
      <p>
        SIRTI is at 665 N. Riverpoint Blvd. Take the Division St. exit off I-90,
        turn east on to Trent. The second left off of Trent is Riverpoint Blvd.
        SIRTI is the first building on the right. SIRTI is and odd shaped brick
        building that looks like a tug-boat and it is on the north side of Trent
        and is visible from Trent.
