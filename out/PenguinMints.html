        They go great in cola-flavored <a href="JoltCola.html">JoltCola</a>, or on the side with WaterJoe. The CaffeineRush will get you moving, but you probably won't go anywhere.

        They're ScaryFast: they give you the same kind of rush as a strong ShortBlack, but it seems like the caffeine is more easily absorbed.

        I put that there because I thought the folks here would find it funny. They're penguins (think Linux). They're caffeine. They're about the funniest way to head yourself into the non-productive caffeine daze you think is necessary before you begin to glimpse <a href="DeveloperMaturity.html">DeveloperMaturity</a>. -- <a href="JasonRiedy.html">JasonRiedy</a>

        Another vote for the original link (restored above). I've always wondered where I could order these. Interestingly enough, the website does not mention the Linux/Penguin connection. -- <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a> (drinker of the OneTrueBeverage)

        Is the URL for the product site <em>really</em> off-topic on a page about the product? There are many other examples on Wiki (like <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>, <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a>, <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a>, etc.). Some people have questioned the <a href="AmazonAssociate.html">AmazonAssociate</a> links. There is a possibility of abuse, but it seems that debates over advertising are more disruptive than the occasional borderline topic. -- <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>

        I wish I could discuss the first spam I received in polite company. ;) And I didn't realize you could order them on-line, or else I would have hesitated to post the URL myself. I just get them locally. However, it is really nice to see that other people have sworn off all-nighters. People think me less-than-dedicated around here, as I'm still in grad school and refuse to pull them... Oh, and it'd be nice to see someone else as a book associate rather than Amazon.
