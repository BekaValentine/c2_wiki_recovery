        Mathematics PhD, with special interest in category theory,
        recursive function theory, and theory of automata. Former <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>.

        I recently (May, 2000) read <a href="ZenAndTheArtOfMotorcycleMaintenance.html">ZenAndTheArtOfMotorcycleMaintenance</a>,
        which has changed my outlook on work and on life in general.

        Currently employed by LexisNexis, where I have been trying
        to promote <a href="WikiInTheWorkplace.html">WikiInTheWorkplace</a>.  I wrote my own Wiki variant
        (based originally on Ward's code, but now about 7 times as large
        and with almost none of the original code left) and have used it
        to create several <a href="ProjectWiki.html">ProjectWiki</a> and <a href="TeamWiki.html">TeamWiki</a> sites at work.
        (In hindsight what I really should have set up was a <a href="WikiFarm.html">WikiFarm</a>,
        but that wasn't clear until I had nearly a dozen independent instances
        of Wiki.) Wiki has been enormously useful to <em>me</em> at work,
        but my attempts to sell it to others have met with mixed success.

        So far, my greatest contributions to the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> are an idea
        for a <a href="WikiWikiThemeSong.html">WikiWikiThemeSong</a>, and a semi-doggerel <a href="PetrarchanSonnet.html">PetrarchanSonnet</a>
        in <a href="PoemWiki.html">PoemWiki</a>.  I'll try to be more constructive and less <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>
        in the future.

        An anecdote about me:
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was preparing for my oral exams (en route to a PhD),
        I knew that I would be nervous when the Big Day came.
        I wanted to lead off with an ice-breaker to quickly dissipate the
        tension in the room.  So I had a T-shirt made up with the following
        motto on it (which, as far as I know, is original with me):
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Logic, logic everywhere, but not a thought to think.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        (It helps to know that my major subject was mathematical logic.)
        This had the desired effect: I walked into the room, the examiners
        read the shirt, they cracked up, and a friendly atmosphere was
        established.  (And I passed the exam.)
