        It answers it very well, thank you.  In essense you are saying that
        you work in a typical organization.  That you wish you could do lots
        of up-front work, but that you're organization doesn't have the
        patience to let you do it.  They seem to be driven more by dates than
        by rational thought.  No wonder you wish you had time to do the
        analysis and design up front.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me paint you a different story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every <a href="TwoWeeks.html">TwoWeeks</a> you and your team deliver new features to your
        business. They get to choose which new features they are; and you get
        to tell them how many new features you can do in two weeks.  They see
        progress every two weeks.  Not only that, its the progress that they
        want to see. 
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        The schedule belongs to your managers.  They see how much you get done
        every two weeks; and they order the features such that you get the
        most important things done first.  
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>, <a href="CustomerBillOfRights.html">CustomerBillOfRights</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Each iteration you and your team work together in the same room.  You
        work in pairs; and the pairs work three to a table.  Perhaps there are
        two or even three tables in the room.  Every day the entire team meets
        for thirty minutes to plan the day's activities.  If someone is going
        to use an Observer, you're likely to find out about it at that
        meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="AllEngineersInOneRoom.html">AllEngineersInOneRoom</a>, <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Pairs switch off twice per day.  Over the course of two weeks,
        everybody works with everyone else on everything.  Nobody owns any
        particular module, everybody is reasonably familiar with the whole of
        the code base.  
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="PairPromiscuously.html">PairPromiscuously</a>, SharedCodeOwnership]
      </p>
      <p>
        Integration occurs several times per day.  There is one code baseline
        supported by a bevy of unit and acceptance tests.  Every couple of
        hours each pair checks in their changes, makes any merges necessary,
        and makes sure all the tests continue to pass.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        No integration woes, no "callbacks instead of Observer" woes,
        continuous reviews, continuous design, managers who know the status of
        the project in detail, and who manage the schedule by selecting
        features.
