        Meditations On Emergence
      </h1>
      <p>
        Emergence is the phenomenon referred to in phrases like <a href="EmergentBehavior.html">EmergentBehavior</a> and <a href="EmergentDesign.html">EmergentDesign</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the <em>American Heritage Dictionary</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>emerge</strong>: (4) To come into existence. [<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=emerge&db=*]">http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=emerge&db=*]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>emergence</strong>: (1) The act or process of emerging. [<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=emergence&db=*]">http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=emergence&db=*]</a>

        For the purposes of this Wiki, there seem to be three important questions about the phenomenon of emergence:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. What is it?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Emergence is the existence in a system of a property, characteristic or behavior that is not a property, characteristic or behavior of any of the constituents of that system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. How does it happen?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Emergence arises due to the interactions of the constituents of a system, either among themselves alone, or in concert with external entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. What are its implications for software development?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many (most?, all?) types of emergence exhibit a curious characteristic: simple changes at the level of the constituents of a system generate complex results at the level of the system as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design of any but the simplest of software systems is inherently complex. Yet it has been stated that consistent application of the rules of code quality advocated by <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> yields well-formed software design, even though these rules are themselves quite simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"What is interesting - I claim - is the extent to which good design is the emergent result of the rules of code quality in </em>XP Explained<em>:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>1, Runs all the tests.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>2. Expresses all the ideas you want to express.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>3. Contains no duplicate code.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>4. Contains minimum number of classes and methods."</em>
      </p>

        This phenomenon of <a href="EmergentDesign.html">EmergentDesign</a>, which seems to be an essential feature of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, warrants further thought and investigation.
