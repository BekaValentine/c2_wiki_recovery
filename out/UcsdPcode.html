        Ucsd Pcode

      <p>
        Also known as the UcsdPsystem.

      <p>
        UCSD-P code (or simply UCSD-P) was a virtual machine used
        as a foundation for such languages as UCSD Pascal and
        DigitalResearch C-BASIC (CeeBasic).
      </p>
      <p>
        This allowed the UCSD-P runtime "engine" to be implemented
        on the CPU & OS of choice, and take code written on some
        other machine (already compiled) and run the "<a href="MachineCode.html">MachineCode</a>"
        on the new target without change.
      </p>
      <p>
        One might say it allowed "<a href="WriteOnceRunAnywhere.html">WriteOnceRunAnywhere</a>" -- or
        something like that.
