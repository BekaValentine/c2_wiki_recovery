        Paris Extreme Hour
      </h1>
      <p>
        I recently changed jobs. My new employer appears to be keenly interested in my bringing in XP, more, probably, due to my enthusiasm for it than for my relatively limited experience with it. During the initial interviews, we agreed that it was important for me to provide an overview of the process for the different people who will be involved, and I suggested <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> as an efficient, instructive and fun format for such an overview.
      </p>
      <p>
        With some anxiety, I therefore found myself faced with the task of organizing an <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a>. Though realizing how foolish I was to be doing this without previous experience - but comforted by the thought that others had been there before and reported on the Wiki - I embarked on the adventure, and lived to tell the tale, some of which is told below.
      </p>
      <p>
        For various reasons, the <a href="ParisExtremeHour.html">ParisExtremeHour</a> was to some extent modeled on the <a href="TorontoExtremeHour.html">TorontoExtremeHour</a>. I am especially grateful for the kind advice <a href="MikeBowler.html">MikeBowler</a> offered; several others lent support and encouragement, to whom I am also indebted.

        <strong>Rehearsal</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I held a "rehearsal" session (May 23, 2001) with people not involved with my future employer. I don't have that many friends who might be interested in such a crazy thing, so I got in touch with the <a href="FrenchXpCommunity.html">FrenchXpCommunity</a> - by itself a nice thing to be doing, possibly something I should have done sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned quite a lot of things which I wouldn't have wanted to learn in the professional context. We finished one iteration without any acceptance tests passed, didn't get around to a second iteration, and cheerfully declared the project a failure - albeit a very instructive one. We did have a good time !
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>"Official" session #1</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This was held on May 28, to the reasonable satisfaction of all involved. Acting on suggestions from the rehearsal group, I pitched the presentation from a more concrete, pragmatic angle; essentially restating Kent's argument in the <a href="XpSeries.html">XpSeries</a> frontispiece that in actual application most non-agile methods are essentially half-measures piled upon half-measures, to the point that we lose sight of the truly important aspects of our work - to which XP responds with the notion that we will do less, but that what we will do is directly related to software development and consists of a minimal set of practices that can actually be followed wholeheartedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We went through two iterations, building the traditional coffee machine. The project wasn't a full success, but the dynamics of XP came into play more fully than in the rehearsal session. Somehow I suspect that this session was paradoxically <em>less</em> convincing to the developers and project managers on the audience - although this may be just my own anxieties speaking, I intend to follow up with interviews over the next few days to get more feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further sessions are planned to bring other coworkers up to speed on XP.

      <p>
        <strong>"Official" session #2</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Held on June 13. This one didn't even get off the ground. We went through the theoretical part, which generated a lot of interesting discussion and thoughtful objections. I felt unable, however, to run the <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> proper, as the non-Development participants had taken a rain check at the last moment and one of the Development players didn't come back from the half-time break.

      <p>
        <a href="MikeBowler.html">MikeBowler</a> suggests having these, to "nail down" the ideas people were exposed to during the session. For the rehearsal, I mimicked the <a href="TorontoExtremeHour.html">TorontoExtremeHour</a> format in a 2-page handout, which was appreciated by the participants and served to focus attention on some of the imperfections of the session. I revised these significantly for he "official" session. At <a href="MikeBowler.html">MikeBowler</a>'s invitation I used the slides at <a href="http://www.redhookgroup.com/presentations.html">http://www.redhookgroup.com/presentations.html</a> as a handy "cheat sheet".

        <strong>People</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Rehearsal :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Four developers (three from the XpFrance mailing list, and my brother)
        </li>
        <li>
           One journalist (who played on the Development side, somehwat surprisingly)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Session 1 :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The BigBoss played the Customer
        </li>
        <li>
           Two developers, one developer/analyst, one project manager filled out the roster
        </li>
        <li>
           I played the part of QA to get the Customer started writing tests
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Session 2 :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Four developers
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Schedule</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The official session ran 2PM-6PM. I kept the "intro to XP" down to half an hour; what with explaining all the rules and the first round of generating <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, the pre-production phase took one hour, the first iteration one hour, and the second iteration half an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When we do it, the first iteration takes an hour and the second takes half an hour.  Then we fill the rest of the time with more detailed explanations of XP.  In our experience, two iterations is good enough to ensure that everyone understands the process.  One iteration is not.  For schedule, we have a very brief intro, followed by the </em><a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a>, followed by a more detailed discussion of XP -- <a href="MikeBowler.html">MikeBowler</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Theme</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The rehearsal made it clear that it was better to impose a specific product theme. I initially left this up to the team to decide; what they came up with (a new & improved swing) was interesting but didn't leave enough conceptual room to generate interesting stories, made it difficult to discuss the effect of the metaphor, and so on. Some of the rejected alternates would have displayed the same difficulties, only exacerbated (the "Better Government Toolkit" to name but one example). It might be interesting to see what an experienced XP team could dream up and how it might follow through, though.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Metaphor</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In both the rehearsal and the official session, I felt that the absence of a metaphor (or whatever could have been usefully designated by that term) was one of the critical factors in not being able to deliver a fully satisfactory product. This might be just my bias showing - it is the one practice that has captured most of my attention lately - but some of the other participants concurred.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Limitations</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> - together with the initial XP introduction, and taking advantages of the many opportunities it affords to discuss various aspects of software projects - was in my experience an interesting and effective way to introduce XP to groups of people. It does have several limitations and blind spots, which must be addressed otherwise. [More later...]

        <strong>Follow-ups</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my coworkers, BenjaminSiband, and myself produced the following code in an afternoon-long <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> session, <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>-style. We implemented one "story", the intent of which was to output calendars in the following form :
      </p>
      <code>
        L  M  M  J  V  S  D<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
            2  3  4  5  6
          <ol>
            <li>
                8  9 10 11 12 13
              <ol>
                <li>
                   15 16 17 18 19 20
                </li>
                <li>
                   22 23 24 25 26 27
                </li>
                <li>
                   29 30 31
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
