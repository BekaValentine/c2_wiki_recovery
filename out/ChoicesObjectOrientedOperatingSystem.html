        Choices Object Oriented Operating System
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Choices</strong> is an <a href="ObjectOrientedOperatingSystem.html">ObjectOrientedOperatingSystem</a> written almost entirely in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.  It utilizes <a href="FrameWork.html">FrameWork</a>s, <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a>s, and <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> concepts extensively.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Choices is written as an object-oriented operating system in C++. As an object-oriented operating system, its architecture is organized into frameworks of objects that are hierarchically classified by function and performance. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The operating system is customized by replacing subframeworks and objects. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The application interface is a collection of kernel objects exported through the application/kernel protection layer. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Kernel and application objects are examined through application browsers. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Choices runs on bare hardware on desktop computers, distributed and parallel computers, and small mobile devices. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Choices is supported on the SPARC, x86 and ARM processor architectures. Virtual Choices (VChoices) also runs under UNIX System V and Linux.

           There is a paper that was presented at OOPSLA96 on instrumenting the system.  It has some really good ideas about profiling object oriented systems at the object and subsystem level.

               Tracing the changing dynamics of object-oriented frameworks, design patterns, architectural styles, and subsystems during the development and reuse cycle can aid producing complex systems. Unfortunately, current object-oriented programming tools are relatively oblivious to the rich architectural abstractions in a system. 
            </li>
            <li>
               This paper shows that architecture-oriented visualization, the presentation of system dynamics in terms of its architectural abstractions, is highly beneficial in designing complex systems. In addition, the paper presents architecture-aware instrumentation, a new technique for building efficient on-line instrumentation to support architectural queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the scheme with case studies in the design of the Choices object-oriented operations system.
