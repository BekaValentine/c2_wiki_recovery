        Calling Convention
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="CallingConvention.html">CallingConvention</a> is a particular way of passing in parameters, saving registers, cleaning up the stack and restoring the stack, and sometimes even a means to translate errors or exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        With stdcall calling convention, for example, the parameters get pushed onto the stack in right-to-left order, and the called routine is responsible for saving and restoring registers. Many <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> API calls use this calling convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        With C calling convention, the parameters get pushed onto the stack in the same order as stdcall, but it's the caller that has to save and restore register values.
      </p>
      <p>
        With fastcall, parameters use as many registers as possible (on IntelMachines, these are the EAX, EBX and EDX registers) before considering putting things on the stack. <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a> uses this model by default.
