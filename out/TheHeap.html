        The Heap
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TheHeap.html">TheHeap</a> is a (somewhat archaic, but still in common use) term for the memory from which a program may dynamically allocate memory blocks.  <a href="TheHeap.html">TheHeap</a> may or may not be contiguous.  Lots of different allocation strategies are used to assign a particular memory block for a given request (FirstFit, BestFit, etc.).  
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to be confused with the data structure known as a "heap" (<a href="HeapDataStructure.html">HeapDataStructure</a>--think <a href="HeapSort.html">HeapSort</a>).  
      </p>
      <p>
        Some languages (such as <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>) provide a way for different data types to be allocated from different heaps.  This can be used to improve performance, but unless the programmer knows what he/she is doing, this frequently makes things worse.  Unless it is done in response to profiling showing that the "default" memory allocator is a bottleneck, this is <a href="PrematureOptimization.html">PrematureOptimization</a>.

           Unfortunately, there are still many C/C++ implementations out there with lousy implementations of malloc/OperatorNew.
