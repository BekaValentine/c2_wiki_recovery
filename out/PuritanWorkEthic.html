        Puritan Work Ethic
      </h1>
      <p>
        This one probably came from the fact that the Puritans, coming over to a rocky Cape Cod (in Massachusetts, in the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a>), had to work quite hard to survive.  They were also driven from behind by Calvinist religions of predestination (either you're saved or you're not, and you must be perfect; if you have the urge to not be perfect, you must not show it or otherwise you have not been saved).
