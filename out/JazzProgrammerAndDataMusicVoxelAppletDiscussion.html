        Jazz Programmer And Data Music Voxel Applet Discussion

        <strong>Discussion of the connection between </strong><a href="DataMusicVoxelApplet.html">DataMusicVoxelApplet</a> and <a href="JazzProgrammer.html">JazzProgrammer</a><strong></strong>

           To visualize and visually play the subtle rythms, dynamics and pitch bends, typical for Jazz, the <a href="DataMusicVoxelApplet.html">DataMusicVoxelApplet</a> would be a nice tool. Besides stimulating Jazz improvisation, it should stimulate new generations of Jazz loving programmers to build better sequencers that represent music in a different way, real time and 3D.

           To find a synthesis between fixed Bluesschemes and semi-chaotic time-series of all kinds (not necessarily stocks) it's a challenging creativity tool.

        <li>
           It's a great starting point for developing (not only Jazz-related) Computer Games with music content.

        The visual cortex can processes more complex structures than the audio part of the brain. The chart technique is kind of an evolutive product to make 'typical chart patterns' easier to recognize and to estimate. I think the metapher of chart patterns <em>(piecewise linear)</em> is a better way to represent music on sequencer displays than horizontal bar charts as the present standard <em>(piecewise constant)</em>, especially when dealing with Jazz.

        Fridemar, the ideas you mention here do interest me. Well at least mildly interest me. But the connection with jazz as a <em>metaphor</em> for small group development, which is what I judge <a href="JazzProgrammer.html">JazzProgrammer</a> to be about, still eludes me.

        I think I can see, Richard what you mean. Therefore I added "and to estimate".
        When having a (jam)<strong>session</strong>, the Jazz players (humans) always <strong>have to estimate somehow</strong> the musical trajectories of their peers. The same holds true for "players" of the stock market. Knowing the history and some more or less fundamental context the players <strong>make their own adjustments</strong> accordingly.

        The analogy with "playing" the stock market is cool, fp. Combine this with the option pricing analogy/risk awareness of an extreme approach (as in <a href="IsEarlierCancellationFailure.html">IsEarlierCancellationFailure</a> and <a href="AnalyzingXpWithOptionsPricing.html">AnalyzingXpWithOptionsPricing</a>) and we could have a really fertile three way analogy going - jazz/trading/programming. It's the programming that has needed to catch up with the dynamism <em>and</em> rigor of the others. Sorry though that my visual cortex (and the rest of my brain) doesn't have enough time for the details of the <a href="DataMusicVoxelApplet.html">DataMusicVoxelApplet</a> as yet. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>
