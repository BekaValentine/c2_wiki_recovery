        Meta Refactoring
      </h1>
      <p>
        Say you have a function something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        char andGate(char a, char b) throws InvalidInput<br/>
        {<br/>
        if (a=='0' && b=='0') return '0';<br/>
        if (a=='0' && b=='1') return '0';<br/>
        if (a=='1' && b=='0') return '0';<br/>
        if (a=='1' && b=='1') return '1';<br/>
        throw new InvalidInput();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You might also have some tests:
      </p>
      <code>
        void testAndGate()<br/>
        {<br/>
        assertEqual(andGate('0', '0'), '0');<br/>
        assertEqual(andGate('0', '1'), '0');<br/>
        assertEqual(andGate('1', '0'), '0');<br/>
        assertEqual(andGate('1', '1'), '1');<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When you do an OR gate, then an XOR, then...; then you
        start to notice that they all look rather similar.
        <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> should suggest then common structure
        should be localized!
      </p>
      <p>
        Its difficult to see how to refactor this in most
        languages. Sure, you could go to a data driven approach,
        but then you might lose performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        An approach I find useful is to refactor into a meta-domain.
        The 'and' gate can be can be re-written as
      </p>
      <code>
        AND<br/>
        a b f<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
           0 0
        </li>
        <li>
           1 0
        </li>
        <li>
           0 0
        </li>
        <li>
           1 1
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        (or something similar). I have found it nice to put the
        table in a Word/Framemaker document, and extract it via
        HTML -- though more recently I've turned to XML. I can
        thus apply <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> to the documentation
        as well as the code. Also, the documentation then becomes
        part of the source code. (I do tend to have a rather
        extreme approach to translation based programming).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is then very easy to write simple Perl scripts (or
        whatever) to generate both the tests and the implementation.
        (this is not as silly as it sounds, because the translation
        scripts may have bugs which are detected by the tests).
        Note that, if the Perl script is non-trivial, it will need
        its own <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. For any change in that script,
        use the previous version of its output as a GoldenLog
        for regression testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have a simple minded implementation in a script,
        then you can use the scripts on multiple datasets. When
        you find a better implementation, then you can make the
        change in just one place (you don't change the tests).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you ever decide that you want to stop using translation
        then the refactoring to remove the scripts is a simple
        matter of telling your build system (and possibly the
        version control system) then the derived files are now
        source files (again).
      </p>
      <p>
        In general the transition into any <a href="GenerativeProgramming.html">GenerativeProgramming</a>
        technique will lead to more cohesive source code. And sometimes
        you need to go the other direction.

        <em>It is then very easy to write simple Perl scripts (or</em>
        <em>whatever) to generate both the tests and the implementation.</em>
        <em>(this is not as silly as it sounds, because the translation</em>
        <em>scripts may have bugs which are detected by the tests).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if the source data used to generate both the tests and
        the implementation has errors?  Potentially, your test will be
        bogified in exactly the same way as the implementation.  The bogus
        test could erroneously pass when run against the bogus code.  E.g.
        I might accidentally change a value in the result column of the
        AND data table mentioned above.  Tests should be implemented
        separately and independently of the code-under-test. <em>-- yes, but that would be an </em><a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>, which should be invariant over any refactorings of the implementation<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note that, if the Perl script is non-trivial, it will need</em>
        <em>its own </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. For any change in that script,<em></em>
        <em>use the previous version of its output as a </em>GoldenLog<em></em>
        <em>for regression testing.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows that if the source data being translated by the Perl
        script is non-trivial, and used to generate both test cases and
        production code, then the source data must have a unit test of its
        own as well...
