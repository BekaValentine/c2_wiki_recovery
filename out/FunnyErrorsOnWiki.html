        Funny Errors On Wiki

        This page lists some errors encountered on Wiki that are so wrong that they are slightly amusing. :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the demands for <a href="EnglishPlease.html">EnglishPlease</a>, coupled with the number of non-native speakers of English on Wiki and the ease of fixing such trivial errors, poking fun at these errors is somewhat unfair. So just correct them in situ? [They were corrected when noticed, but I didn't search for further occurrences.]
      </p>
      <p>
        I give these without explanations, since it's quite easy to see what's wrong in each case. Most are examples of words being written as they sound, rather than as they should be. The context is given where appropriate. Please add any further examples you come across that make you smile.

      </ul>
      <p>
        While it is certainly possible that some of the above were written by wikizens with a mother-tongue other than English, my experience from reading Wiki suggests that they are more likely the result of bad typing, poor spelling skills and non-existent proofreading.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the ability to proof read and correct such errors is one of the major benefits of Wiki. Therefore, <a href="JustCorrectDontPoint.html">JustCorrectDontPoint</a>.

        <strong>Common corrections that are not errors</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           under way (The context was "There's actually a project under way to do this..."  This is actually correct.  e.g. give way, make way, ships are under way.)
