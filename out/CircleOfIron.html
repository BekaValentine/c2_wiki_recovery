        Circle Of Iron
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="CircleOfIron.html">CircleOfIron</a> is a wonderful movie of SelfDiscovery and a QuestForTruth (slightly different than <a href="SearchForTruth.html">SearchForTruth</a>..). Co-written by, and originally intended to star <a href="BruceLee.html">BruceLee</a>, but, he died before it was filmed. The wise sage martial arts master character was played by DavidCarradine of KungFu fame. I was inspired to make a combination flute/staff by the one DavidCarradine carries. Okay, it's a little campy, but, you won't regret seeing it. -- <a href="RonJandrasi.html">RonJandrasi</a>
