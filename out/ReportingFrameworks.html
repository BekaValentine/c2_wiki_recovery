        <strong>Reporting frameworks</strong> are iffy, especially if you don't have an app that is mostly reports.  You may need a reasonable number of small reports that would be better programmed directly.  As number and complexity of reports increases, value of reporting frameworks goes up.  Requirements for HTML formatting or Rich Text Format are also indicators that you might want a framework.

        If you do have an application that is mostly reports, that may be a problem itself, taking form as <a href="ReportsSmell.html">ReportsSmell</a>.

        <em>Please give some examples of reporting frameworks?  Does </em><a href="CrystalReports.html">CrystalReports</a> count?  What about the reporting system in <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a>?<em></em>

      <p>
        In my opinion, there is a market demand for a new reporting system.  This system needs to sit somewhere between using <a href="CrystalReports.html">CrystalReports</a> and rolling your own report.  I've envisioned this product as being a framework that allows you to start in a <a href="WysiWyg.html">WysiWyg</a> manner like <a href="CrystalReports.html">CrystalReports</a>, but also be able to add new elements that you wrote, and programmatically override every part of the report.  And I always envision it looking somewhat like the graphics frameworks I've worked with over the years. --JoshuaBoyd
