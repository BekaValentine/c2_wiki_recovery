        <em>Donald - why are you putting "</em><a href="CategoryProgrammingLanguage.html">CategoryProgrammingLanguage</a>" on pages that are not about programming languages?  For example, "<a href="ThreadSafeLanguage.html">ThreadSafeLanguage</a>" is not a language.  I believe this categorisation is misleading and unhelpful.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I categorized "<a href="ThreadSafeLanguage.html">ThreadSafeLanguage</a>" because it has on the first line the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em>'A <a href="ThreadSafe.html">ThreadSafe</a> language<em>' is one in which two activations of a method simply cannot run simultaneously within the same object.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is about a language, if not a specific language, one which shows certain characteristics. To me that is helpful, and not misleading. It mentions <a href="ErlangLanguage.html">ErlangLanguage</a>, but it would be more helpful if other languages were mentioned so that the reader would know what particular languages are  <strong></strong><a href="ThreadSafe.html">ThreadSafe</a><strong>.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CategoryProgrammingLanguage.html">CategoryProgrammingLanguage</a> has a section about types of programming languages so i agree that this categorization is ok.
