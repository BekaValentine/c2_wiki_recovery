        Arrgh, this shouldn't have been deleted, but instead the "<a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> from previous Author" feature should have been used to restore the original content. AFAIK, there has once been something useful here. Why can't I get older versions of this page? Is this somehow possible?

        Yes, if the <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> isn't sufficient, you can retrieve the old copy from <a href="HistoryPages.html">HistoryPages</a>
