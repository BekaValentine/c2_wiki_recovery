      <p>
        A goal of most "free" societies.  The idea that given two people with identical initial resources, the relative success or failure of those two people will be determined solely by their individual actions, plus a certain non-discriminatory luck factor.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This goal has not been achieved by any human society to date.  There are, however, some current societies that are notably closer than others.
