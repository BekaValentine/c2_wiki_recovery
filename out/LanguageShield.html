        Language Shield
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="LanguageShield.html">LanguageShield</a> is some feature of a programming language put in to hide what you are doing, to give you protection, something to hide behind to give you room to change your mind, perhaps. As opposed to <a href="DesignShield.html">DesignShield</a>, which serves the same purpose, but is not provided by the language but by program design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could it be that most Language Shields were Design Shields before they migrated into the language? See <a href="DesignShield.html">DesignShield</a> for a discussion.

        Some examples would be helpful. Perhaps ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           automatic register allocation
        </li>
        <li>
           floating point representation
        </li>
        <li>
           parameter binding
        </li>
        <li>
           method dispatch
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In C++,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           private members
        </li>
        <li>
           the mutable keyword (enables ConceptualConstness)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        More?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Deep orthogonality and consistency in the language. For example:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>In </em><a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, everything's a message.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>In the </em><a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, everything's a list or a function.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>When all implementation strategies look the same, you don't need to worry about which one an object uses.</em>
