        Secure By Default
      </h1>
      <p>
        There might be another page on this wiki that describes a similar pattern. SafeByDefault? 
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is to be secure by default - but if in exceptional cases one needs to escape security, there are ways out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples of This Pattern</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="OpenBsd.html">OpenBsd</a> follows a philosophy that aims for an extremely secure OS by default. 
        </li>
        <li>
           if using fpc and qomp, choosing {$GOTO OFF}, {$RANGECHECKS ON}, {$CHECKPOINTER ON} options encourages safer and more secure default code
        </li>
        <li>
           Ada, Spark, and friends are considered more secure and safe by default (<em>but also considered baroque and complex which may cause security issues itself</em>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Programming using contracts may be more secure and safe by default (see also <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Avoiding excessive use of pointers where cleaner alternatives exist may be more secure and safe (reduce chance of overflows, overruns, dangling pointers)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CapabilityUserInterface.html">CapabilityUserInterface</a> demands that security be the <a href="PathOfLeastResistance.html">PathOfLeastResistance</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>People and Personalities</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        People who prefer <a href="SecureByDefault.html">SecureByDefault</a> discourage premature optimization. Optimization freaks worry about speed before security and safety (and sometimes even correctness). For example a speed freak might complain that range checks are too slow, and that his goto statements are faster than structured code.  In fact, often secure code leads to better code - which may even be faster. Code that does not crash or get broken into is also faster in a sense that the system may not break as often (crashes and security breaches can cause a program to slow down.. consider a <a href="DenialOfService.html">DenialOfService</a> Attack).
