        Vb Classic Containment And Delegation
      </h1>
      <p>
        Containment and delegation is what <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> does instead of inheritance. Yeah I know, OO good, <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> bad, but here's my 3-Tier/MTS/ASP/COM/MSMQ/DNA/ADO skilled <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> crew, and there's your OO language <em>waaaaaay ooover theeeerree</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So the problem is <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> doesn't seem to support even C&D very well - your solutions to the following problems much appreciated:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There's no #include statement in <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>. So every <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> "derived" class that you want to have delegate to a "base" class has to duplicate delegation methods. Unless anyone knows a way to do a #include?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           So ... dropping in a preprocessor could plainly fix this, but our IDE-dependent developers don't have any way to add-in a preprocessor ... right?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           So ... the "Visual Basic Extensibility model" looks vaguely like it will generate delegation code, but how much work is this? And if we want to be able to refactor the generated code later?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           So ... there are commercial 3rd-party tools that sort of do this right ... but they're not MS, and if we wanted to do non-MS solutions do you think we'd be using <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any cleverness along these lines in your <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> bag of tricks, please explain below.

        <em>There is no such cleverness. The best you can do is to contain your "base" object and expose it as a property of the "derived" object. If you want to get polymorphic about it, however, you're still going to have to at least implement the _Base interface and write, by hand, a bunch of clunky _Base_method delegation routines. It is amazing that </em><a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> has been rewritten 6 times now, and is still this bad a language. Well, that's not as amazing as the fact that corporates keep on buying into it ...<em> </em>

        What is a 'bad language'? And why is <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> one? How do you define 'bad'? And 'good'? -- Thomas Eyde

        <a href="VisualBasicDotNet.html">VisualBasicDotNet</a> supports inheritance.

        I have found a decent way to do <a href="TemplateMethod.html">TemplateMethod</a> in <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>: You have to think backwards: Create an instance of the general class and feed it with the specialization. Let's say you want to sort collections. The usage would be something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        Dim thePersons As Collection<br/>
        Set thePersons = db.GetPersons()<br/>
        '<br/>
        Dim theSorter As New CSorter<br/>
        Dim theSortedPersons As Collection<br/>
        Set theSortedPersons = theSorter.Sort(thePersons, new CPersonSorter)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The CPersonSorter would implement the ISorter interface. The Sort method would contain the common code and calls the specialized code on the passed ISorter.
