        Of Mice And Methodologies
      </h1>
      <p>
        Those curious about how to actually <em>test</em> which SoftwareEngineeringMethodology is truly better (instead of just fighting about it) should read this survey of reproducable results:	<a href="http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~dalamb/mice.html">http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~dalamb/mice.html</a>

        <em>Hilarious!  I especially liked these two:</em>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Wiki</strong></dt>
        <dd>The mice author a page about the maze and cheese, but an argument makes it rather long. Then a refactor-minded Wikizen splits the page into the Maze page and the Cheese page. Subsequent tweaks accidentally lose the link between the two pages. The mice starve.</dd>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Extreme Mice</strong></dt>
        <dd>The mice all stand up and ask among themselves if any of them is  confident how fast he can find the cheese. No mouse is confident enough  to estimate, not having seen the maze. Two mice are given an hour to do  an experiment to see if they can come to a confident estimate. The  first thing the pair does is thinking that perhaps they aren't going to  need to go through the maze to get cheese. They're not sure. They ask  the customer if he needs the particular cheese that is in the maze. The customer says that any cheese will do. The pair takes some cheese from  the fridge and gives it to the customer.</dd>

        Just in time for Xmas, one AriFeldman has ported this test to the mighty MoPhun cell-phone game platform:
