        Bridging The Gap
      </h1>
      <p>
        Bridging The Gap is a phrase which is used to note that getting from point A to point B requires some kind of shift in pick-one (or more): priority, perspective, location, focus ... language, knowledge model, requirements, representation 
      </p>

        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The facade pattern 
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="WaterfallModel.html">WaterfallModel</a> there is a tendency to find a gap between each phase.  
          <ul>
            <li>
              This seems almost an indicator that there is something wrong with the process.  A good process shouldn't have 'gaps' of this kind.

          </ul>

        Would it be true to say that a really good process doesn't have gaps?

           Or are we simply looking at the philosophical problem that between any two states one can always make a distinction however fine until one gets to the level of the atomic -- is the universe of discourse quantized or a continuum? -- <a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>

      <p>
        The physical world is largely "quantized" yet we perceive much of it to be continuous because the quanta are at such a small scale. I would say that a really good process <em>feels</em> like it has no (maybe few?) gaps. That's why I like the really immediate feedback of fine-grained unit tests.
        It <em>feels</em> like a flow. --<a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>
