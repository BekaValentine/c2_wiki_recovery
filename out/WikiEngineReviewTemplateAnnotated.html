        Wiki Engine Review Template Annotated
      </h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          -12-21: Tentative revision -- added section "Extendability<em> (better word?) -- see </em><a href="WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated.html">WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated</a> (soon)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The <a href="WikiEngineReviewTemplate.html">WikiEngineReviewTemplate</a> is intended to provide a checklist of attributes to consider in evaluating a <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>.  It also discusses <a href="WikiFarms.html">WikiFarms</a> which use that <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This annotated copy is intended to clarify the intent of each attribute to avoid confusion and minimize the need for notes on each individual review.
      </p>
      <p>
        As new attributes are added they should be added in a consistent manner to all current reviews, the <a href="WikiEngineReviewTemplate.html">WikiEngineReviewTemplate</a>, and this <a href="WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated.html">WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        New versions of <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> previously reviewed should trigger the creation of a new review page.
        Reviews of old versions of <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> will be kept because <a href="WikiFarms.html">WikiFarms</a> or public <a href="WikiSite.html">WikiSite</a>s may continue to use old versions of software rather than upgrade.  See <a href="WikiEngineReviewNewRelease.html">WikiEngineReviewNewRelease</a> for the recommended approach to creating a review for a new version of a <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="JuergenHermann.html">JuergenHermann</a> has developed a naming convention to include the version number in a review.  See <a href="WikiMoinMoinReview.html">WikiMoinMoinReview</a> and <a href="WikiMoinMoinReviewZeroFive.html">WikiMoinMoinReviewZeroFive</a>.  The approach is self explanatory.

        <li>
           <em>Review Quality:</em> An assessment by the reviewer of how reliable this review is.  Did the reviewer test every feature, rely on things he read, or make assumptions based on general knowledge of wikis?  Is the reviewer counting on experienced users of the package to find and correct his errors or omissions, or does he believe that he has done enough research and testing to be 99% sure of the facts?

           <em>Required Software:</em> A list of the major software packages required to run this <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>.	If possible to run on more than one operating system and the major software required is different, the requirements for each operating system should be described separately.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Installation Difficulty:</em> Comments about the difficulty of installation.  I thought the assumption should be that the installer can handle a normal installation of the required packages other than the <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>, but I'm not entirely sure?  Is there an installation tool available?  What is entailed in the installation of the Wiki engine?  Untar and compile files?  Is a precompiled RPM available? Must configuration files be created or modified?  Where are the instructions that describe this?  Are the instructions understandable by a newbie?  by an expert?  Must anything be changed in the normal installation of the other required packages (like the database, webserver, etc.)?

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Headings?</em>  Do the text formatting rules provide a means of defining headings of different levels?  (The <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> rules do not, but headings can be simulated by applying varying using italics or bold face type.)

           <em>Max Page Size:</em> I will only specify this if I know something specific.  Otherwise, be aware of the limit on edit box size which is sometimes 32,000 characters.

        <li>
           <em>Tables?</em>  Is there a way to create a table using the text formatting rules?  In wikis that support this feature, a common approach is to insert "|"s at the beginning and end of each line and between the contents of each cell.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Images?</em>  Is there a way to insert an image on a Wiki page so that it is viewable on that page, as opposed to providing a link to an image that can be called up separately via the browser?

           <em>Editing Contention Resolution</em> Is any mechanism provided to prevent or resolve the problems of simultaneous editing?  Even if not, describe how the software reacts, for example, "first to save wins, second to save is warned", "last to save wins", or ?

        <li>
           <em>Diffs:</em> Does the wiki provide a diff to show the changes from the last edit (or perhaps between the current version and any existing previous version, or even between any two previous versions)?  How is the diff displayed.

           <em>Embedded HTML (a risk):</em> Can HTML be embedded in a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>?  Is it limited to a safe subset of HTML tags and attributes?  A safe subset excludes <applet>, <object>, and <script> tags, and the "onClick" <em>et al.</em> attributes. Further, a safe subset protects against the use of javascript: as a protocol in embedded URLs.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Rollback:</em> If the wiki saves old versions of each page, is there a way to restore these old versions if desired?  Who can do so?

        <strong>Extendability</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        General Note:  Several desirable features are often not available.  Depending on how the page content is stored, these features can be provided by "packaged" external programs; for example, htDig to provide extended search capability.  This section is intended to capture appropriate information.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Extensibility not only depends on page storage alone. The source code, and its organisation, also greatly influence how easy it is to add features. I stress this point because lately </em><a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> got changed a lot to enable exactly this (keywords: plug-ins, Wiki API). -- <a href="JuergenHermann.html">JuergenHermann</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Juergen,</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, thanks for your comments!  I understand what you're saying (I think) but I am trying to focus more on what a non-programming user or administrator can do in the way of providing increased functionality by the use of external programs, not integrated into the <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> software.  I probably need to make that more clear.  I am resisting learning enough programming to make my own modified wiki (although I will probably learn that much).  I wonder if everybody else who is considering a wiki would also consider modifying the program to suit their needs?  I guess I don't think so, but I'm not sure.  Maybe we are crossing the divide between Linux gurus and Linux users?  -- <a href="RandyKramer.html">RandyKramer</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Even for you as a non-programmer, such a means to plug in components rather easily has consequences: namely, that (other) people </em>'write<strong> such plug-ins, and you just </strong>use<strong> them. See </strong><a href="http://purl.net/wiki/moin/MacroMarket">http://purl.net/wiki/moin/MacroMarket</a> and <a href="http://purl.net/wiki/moin/ParserMarket">http://purl.net/wiki/moin/ParserMarket</a> for the practical implications. -- <a href="JuergenHermann.html">JuergenHermann</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Page content will be stored in one of five ways (I think):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           a large "hash" file? (dbm?)
        </li>
        <li>
           a large "text file" with a custom organization 
        </li>
        <li>
           in another custom storage mechanism, perhaps intrinsic to the programming environment (like for Squeak Swikis?)
        </li>
        <li>
           small text files, one per page
        </li>
        <li>
           in a database with each page as a record (perhaps with additional information in the same record or in related records)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With at least the last two methods of storage, features not supported directly by the wiki might be obtained easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Even if the <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> provides excellent search, import / export, and global search and replace features, the answers to these questions are still interesting.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Pages stored in individual text files?</em>  Yes or No, plus what directory and extension, if known.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Pages can be added / deleted from directory and wiki will recognize automatically?</em>  If pages are "magically" popped into or deleted from the storage directory, can the wiki automatically recognize and incorporate those pages.  If not, is there some simple method of forcing the wiki to recognize the changes.  It is possible that the answer will be different for added pages vs. deleted pages -- if so, please answer for added and deleted separately.

        <strong>Working Well with Others</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Static or dynamic web pages:</em>  Are the web pages served by the Wiki static or dynamic? (<a href="FilesystemBasedWiki.html">FilesystemBasedWiki</a> discusses serving static web pages, but so far it seems completely hypothetical -- all real wiki serve dynamic pages).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Indexed by search engines?</em> I believe that search engines have a more difficult time indexing dynamic pages.  If the Wiki provides some means to facilitate (or prevent) indexing, mention it or describe it briefly.  (I don't really know what I'm talking about here -- something else to learn (and then refactor the reviews accordingly).)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A user may, for example, have a preferred search engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside: I am still not clear on whether something special must be done to have an internet search engine index dynamically generated pages.  If not, the method of storage is irrelevant to the question of using an auxiliary search engine, but is still relevant to global search and replace and import / export.
