        I started out life in hardware for a drive manufacturer. Transferred to their computer systems division where I 'wrote' h/w diagnostics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then had the opportunity to become involved with embedded systems at a (spinoff) company called ETA Systems. ETA built, for a short (6 years) time both air cooled and liquid nitrogen cooled super computers. We ran the entire fault tolerant system from an embedded system that was operated by a GUI running on an Apollo Computer.

        When that industry died, I tried application programming, then moved on to *nix system administration and finally into systems design. So I'm one of those guys some of you occasionally dislike 'cause you don't agree with the (h/w, os, router, switch, protocol, language, gui, etc. pick one or more) choices I've made.

        I've been in the industry since the late 70's and have tried most everything and even try to keep up with what's current. I currently reside in rural western Wisconsin in a log cabin wired with 100MB ethernet. Well since this was written I've added <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> and <a href="SuseLinux.html">SuseLinux</a>. I've also been playing with an opensourced app I've written that's modeled with M$ Access running with MySQL as the backend.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also been spending time completing my degree, well ok I'm not completing my degree I've started over and moved from EE to BS Business (IT management). I should finish this within the next 6 months or so. After that I'll be aiming for my Masters, Finance? I'm not sure what that'll be but we'll see.
      </p>
      <p>
        UPDATE
        I completed my BS (some would say I haven't) and am almost finished with my MBA. Next up will be my doctorate which I hope will produce something that will be of use to someone, someday.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still run 100MB ethernet & <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> and all of my windows uses are on a VM running inside a mac pro, safe and sound. I've expanded my hobbies to include astronomy, when the sky is clear.
