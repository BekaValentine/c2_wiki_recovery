        Design With Interfaces

      <p>
        This is from <a href="DesignInIdl.html">DesignInIdl</a>, where someone mentions that the point is to <a href="DesignWithInterfaces.html">DesignWithInterfaces</a> without violating <a href="TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign.html">TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign</a>.

        In every (reasonable) programming language I am aware of, it is possible to write code without function/procedure/method/whatever bodies. This is just classical <a href="TopDownDesign.html">TopDownDesign</a>, or perhaps <a href="BottomUpDesign.html">BottomUpDesign</a>, depending on your perspective. (That is part of why the <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> between <a href="TopDownDesign.html">TopDownDesign</a> and <a href="BottomUpDesign.html">BottomUpDesign</a> is so silly.)

        What bugs me is the fact that so few programming environments on linux (read text editors) seem to want to support this. In fact, <a href="ProgramsAreDatabases.html">ProgramsAreDatabases</a>, not text files. Go there and read or write more, please.
