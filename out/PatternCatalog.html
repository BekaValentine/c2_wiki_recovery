        Pattern Catalog
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="PatternCatalog.html">PatternCatalog</a> is a collection of (possibly) related
        patterns.  Patterns in a pattern catalog do not form
        a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>; that is, their contexts do not weave
        them together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, patterns in a <a href="PatternCatalog.html">PatternCatalog</a> are often
        written with consideration to other patterns in the same
        catalogue.
      </p>
      <p>
        One might postulate that a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> generates
        what Parnas called a SoftwareFamily, while a <a href="PatternCatalog.html">PatternCatalog</a>
        does not.  That is, as a whole, a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> is
        generative, while a <a href="PatternCatalog.html">PatternCatalog</a> is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        I view the <a href="DesignPatternsBook.html">DesignPatternsBook</a> as a <a href="PatternCatalog.html">PatternCatalog</a>.
        Its patterns were written with careful attention to their
        interworkings, yet the patterns do not form a
        <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>.

        Consider also <a href="ThePatternAlmanac.html">ThePatternAlmanac</a> book -- a true catalog of lots of patterns.
        It does not even contain the patterns -- just bibliographic references to them.
