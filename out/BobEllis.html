      <p>
        Bob Ellis is a Principal Software Engineer at Digital Appliance Corp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bob has been doing software engineering since 1970 (yup 31+ years).  He was a math major because they hadn't invented computer science curriculums when he was in college.  Since 1984 he has been working in storage, for Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC), Adaptec, Inc., and now Digital Appliance Corp.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also has a business that someday will be the basis for being semi-retired. But for now he is an employee with little time for extra work.
