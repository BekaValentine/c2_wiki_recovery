        Computer User

      <p>
        <strong>One who programs the computer</strong>, i.e. ComputerProgrammer
      </p>
      <p>
        of course, you could argue just how much this is true (e.g. assembly vs. interpreters vs. spreadsheets etc.),
      </p>
      <p>
        for the sake of this argument, I'd say a program is 'adding new processing logic to a computer system'.
        e.g. doing a row summary in a spreadsheet is not programming, but creating a new algorithm for the spreadsheet
        would be.. 
      </p>
      <p>
        which is still not definitive.. chances are most people here will get it though..

        <strong>One who uses software on a computer</strong>, i.e. <a href="SoftwareUser.html">SoftwareUser</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        usually a human, who is engaged in coaxing an unwilling computer into doing what he wants (the human, not the computer). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people are so inapt with regards to computer, that they tend towards ComputerBashing when things don't happen the way they expect them to.

        In the old days, such a person operated through a proxy known as the ComputerOperator, who was also an instance of <a href="SoftwareUser.html">SoftwareUser</a>.

        Obviously both the ComputerProgrammer and <a href="SoftwareUser.html">SoftwareUser</a> are using the computer, just in different (but overlapping) ways.  The ComputerProgrammer also uses software in the course of that programming.  And the <a href="SoftwareUser.html">SoftwareUser</a> necessarily uses the computer in order to use the software.  In some cases, changing options in the software changes the way it operates on the computer and is, therefore, a rudimentary case of programming, just not in a formally defined language.  In other cases, e.g., creating a CAD drawing, the <a href="SoftwareUser.html">SoftwareUser</a> may be writing in a formally defined language (albeit via a graphical interface).  See how <a href="AutoCad.html">AutoCad</a> works.
