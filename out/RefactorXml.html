        Refactor Xml
      </h1>
      <p>
        What's the best way to <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> XML? Are there <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a>s for XML? How are we ever going to reconcile all these competing standards? We need some kind of adequate tools and repositories so we don't keep reinventing the wheel - where are they?

        Not quite the same thing, but in RefactoringClassIntoXml I talk about a recent experience where I converted from a classical C++ class, with data members, accessors, etc., into an XML structure.

        What does it *mean* to refactor XML, in the abstract?  
      </p>
      <p>
        XML is just data, conforming to a schema, which then gets processed by something that understands the schema in order to make something useful happen. If we're talking about refactoring a schema, then maybe we're really talking about something more like <a href="DatabaseNormalization.html">DatabaseNormalization</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Refactoring is not the same as </em><a href="DatabaseNormalization.html">DatabaseNormalization</a>, which is a process applied to a schema.  Refactoring is a process applied to an <em>existing</em> repository of data (be it of code, XML, Prolog facts, or Relational).  Because of this, refactoring always requires a transformation function: it is necessary to transform the existing repository of data into its new form.  <a href="DatabaseNormalization.html">DatabaseNormalization</a> if applied to an existing database will require a refactoring step - the actual task of performing the transformation.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Based upon the original author's focus on </em><a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> and tools, I'm certain that he or she did, indeed, intend transformation - in particular, automated transformation - in order to help unify XML data itself (including the associated schema, I'm sure).  ("The nice thing about standards is that there are so many of them to choose from." - Andrew S. Tanenbaum)<em></em>
