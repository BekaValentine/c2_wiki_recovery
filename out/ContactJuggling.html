        Although this is <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> there are lessons to be learned from <a href="ContactJuggling.html">ContactJuggling</a>. Like ordinary juggling the system is only stable when in motion - you can't do <a href="ContactJuggling.html">ContactJuggling</a> in slow motion. This is an excellent metaphor for some aspects of computing, and even more aspects of life. Let's leave this page a little and see if any connections can be made.

        edit: <a href="ContactJuggling.html">ContactJuggling</a> CAN be done in slow motion. In fact, a very large part of modern <a href="ContactJuggling.html">ContactJuggling</a> is based on a form called Isolations, where the ball is kept as near to still as possible, while the body moves under it. The metaphor for computing, in this case, may be that in order to leave one aspect of a system as it is, without changing it at all (the ball), while completely re-writing the rest of the system (moving the body in various ways), it is very important to be in perfect control of all aspects of the system, and to understand how they integrate. kverens@contactjuggling.org
