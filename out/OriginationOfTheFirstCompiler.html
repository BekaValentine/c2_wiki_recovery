        <em>A1. That would most likely be John Backus' FORTRAN in 1954.</em>

        <em>A2. The A-0 compiler by Grace Hopper, predecessor of COBOL, in 1952.</em>

        I remember reading that the idea evolved gradually. There was kind of an incremental leap from assembler to higher-level languages. <a href="GraceHopper.html">GraceHopper</a> is generally credited with a lot of the work. She wanted to bring programming "to the masses" - more so than most of her colleagues seemed interested in at the time.
