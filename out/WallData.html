        Wall Data
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WallData.html">WallData</a> was a middleware company.  They built a 3270 terminal Emulator for OS/2 and Windows that a lot of clients (GE Capital among them) used instead of IBM's products.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>With annual revenues of $139.4 million in fiscal 1996, Wall Data has 745 employees. The company has worldwide headquarters in Kirkland, Washington, corporate</em>
        headquarters in Palo Alto, California, and 67 offices worldwide.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is that "worldwide" as in "also outside Northern America"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Update</em> <a href="WallData.html">WallData</a> is deceased. Bought out by <a href="NetManage.html">NetManage</a>, which appears to be on the way to being deceased.

        WRQ also did a very nice terminal emulation called Reflection;  I like the interface better. -- <a href="JoeFecarotta.html">JoeFecarotta</a>
