        Index Card
      </h1>
      <p>
        An index card (also called a SystemCard) is a small rectangular piece of thin cardboard or thick paper, suitable for writing on, frequently ruled on one side or both.
        Popular sizes in North America include 3x5" (76x127mm) and 4x6" (102x152mm). In countries where metric paper is used (Germany in this case) probably the most common size is A7 (74x105mm), smaller ones (A8 = 52x74mm) are also used, as are bigger ones like A6 (105x148mm) or A5 (148x210mm).
      </p>

        Index cards can be used for many things:

        Why the XP fascination with index cards? (For <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, I mean.) How are a bunch of pieces of paper scrawled out in my chicken scratch handwriting and susceptible to being misplaced preferable to a legible Word document (or an Access database), checked into <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a>, with a full revision history allowing you to see which requirements have changed and when? <em>Because going to your cube to open up a Word document, or even to kick-start your laptop, is a soul-sucking exercise. At least for some. With a card, I can stay where I am, physically and mentally. Now, once the cards are finalized, that's another matter... but spare the mind from </em>UglySoftware as long as possible.<em></em>

        Hmm. This turned out a bit more rambling than I would ideally like, and speaking for myself only:
      </p>
      <p>
        Word documents (and the like) are insufficiently amenable to informal manipulation and categorizing. You can't pick up a Word document. It's difficult to riffle through them and pick out a few, put them on the table temporarily and have a discussion about them. Index cards are more sharable - passing one to your colleague is easy. Re-ordering a list of Word files isn't as easy as shuffling a few index cards into order. Creating, editing or discarding an index card is lightweight. Exploratory activities ("why don't we try organizing things this way?") are easier - I don't have to check things out, I don't have to release things when it turns out "this way" was a bad idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can *do* all of these with Word documents in a filesystem or requirements management system, or whatever. But not easily enough. In my experience such systems impose more of a fixed process than I want to deal with when handling lots of requirements, requests for change and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The things I find difficult to organism when dealing with requirements are things like the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>, or CRC sessions. They're difficult because they involve dynamic discussions with several people, often with conflicting viewpoints. The informality and ease of use of index cards score in such situations. It's the same reason that (for me at least) when discussing something with others I draw diagrams with a pencil, not with Visio. If the diagram turns out to be worth preserving, it might make it into a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Word documents or requirements management systems or bug tracking /change tracking systems store revision histories and provide protection against loss, access control and so on. I find these valuable between the "people" activities, but not so much that I want to force the people to work with a restricting system.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've used automated systems for this that are pretty good. But when I'm planning the next release, I still start with a pencil and a piece of paper.

        I've been struggling with this lately, and my concern about paper cards is that it's not as easily accessible to the whole team as something electronic. There are also issues around backups, of course.
        Has anyone considered using a <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>-like site for keeping track of stories and tasks? I've already implemented per-project namespaces in my company's <a href="AtisWiki.html">AtisWiki</a>, just for this purpose.

        Earlier this week I was visiting an XP project. We were doing an <a href="IterationPlan.html">IterationPlan</a>, and one of the stories turned out not to be applicable because of a requirements change. The customer grabbed the card, ripped it up, and chortled with the pleasure of how easy and how visceral it was to change the requirements. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        These are both arguments for the tactile feedback that comes from hard-copy, which I don't deny. But neither addresses the original concern, which is with the drawbacks of a hard-copy-only approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's my viewpoint. Parts are tongue-in-cheek in order to emphasize a point. Please take it in the spirit in which it was intended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume three options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           index cards
        </li>
        <li>
           one word document, containing all requirements, separated by page breaks
        </li>
        <li>
           An Access database, with fields for description, importance, risk, etc. and a report that separates one requirement per page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that I don't assume a highly formal system such as Rational's <a href="RequisitePro.html">RequisitePro</a>. I've used it, and found it somewhat constraining.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rank each of the three alternatives according to the following criteria -

           Access wins hands down. You can filter or sort the database any way you want, instantly. Ever tried to sort or filter 135 handwritten cards (the number I've been quoted for the C3 project) manually? I haven't, so I won't comment. Maybe someone who has will let us know how rewarding they found the task to be. <em>{You can't really sort stories in Access. First of all, you don't have them prioritized 1-135, you are lucky if you have them ranked high, medium or low. Second, the order is a moderately complex combination of risk, value, and what seems to make sense. Access is almost entirely useless for this purpose, when you actually try it. -- </em><a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>}<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>

        This is one of the points made in <a href="TheMythOfThePaperlessOffice.html">TheMythOfThePaperlessOffice</a> -- that workplaces often shift from more efficient paper-based technologies to less efficient electronic technologies (electronic technologies can be either more or less efficient, of course) because computers symbolize The Future, Progress, and a New Way Of Doing Things. An office on the move, that's what an office that uses cutting-edge technology is. Not an office that is stuck in the past. And the employees are left to cope with the less productive, but shinier, New Way. -- <a href="ApoorvaMuralidhara.html">ApoorvaMuralidhara</a>

        Now when we don't live in 80's anymore, I believe the printed paper has nowadays a lot higher prestige than anything digital. I've requested people not to send me useless prints. I'd prefer reading basically everything on computer, the very same environment where I produce my own texts. For notes and scheduling I think one A4 should suffice for days. One can't do more, even worse for you if you think you can.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while I found out why I was the only one complaining of paper prints. I seemed to be the only one who read them through. Tons of paper wasted in a university, never read, only to make someone feel or see oneself productive. I think the printers should be ditched, or at least placed in another building or something.
      </p>

      <p>
        My rebuttal (again, for me only): I can't debate at sufficient speed via a computer. Cards and speech are much faster for me. I have held computer mediated meetings, and they just don't work (for me and what I need to get done).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some specific points:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Access does not win at informal manipulation. It might at formal manipulation (I'm often not looking for structured queries like "user stories created Tuesday"). More "this one, and that one". "That pile over there - hang on, I don't think that story belongs there any more".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When idea brainstorming, I've worked with several hundred cards. Cards are good when you're not sure what the categories are yet, and you're exploring. Once you know, some more formal system may work better.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Refining the requirements: I don't see the index card description as a problem. The point is that in this phase the requirements are often pretty fluid anyway
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Review or update: for the processes I'm talking about, we're all in the same room at the same time. "Paul, pass me that card." "Here you are".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Basically, I think you're assuming a level of formality of <a href="RequirementsTracking.html">RequirementsTracking</a> that I feel is not often needed. If it is needed, I'd probably agree with you about the need for a computerized version. But you'll have lost some fluidity in doing that, and sometimes the cure's then worse than the disease.

        A few weeks before the time of my previous story, we all got together, customers and developers. We had one of those cool Elmo projectors that will project a card on the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        We went through the cards one at a time, projecting it, having the customers explain it, asking questions about it, giving it priority. Repeat for risk. Repeat for estimates.

      <p>
        When a story was unclear, we taught them to rip it up and write a new one.

        Just recently a team I was working with got a new Project Manager, new to the company and new to XP. I'd been urging the customer to sign off the story cards as and when they felt they were done. The new PM not only insisted in having them sign off the cards in batches, he also produced this nice form for them. In the middle of the page were the names of the cards, in a few square inches. The rest of the page was covered in fluff: names, dates, various bits of extraneous data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Me:</em> What's the advantage of these forms?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Him:</em> Oh, nothing, they're just more formal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I walked away, but I wanted to say was: what could be more formal than the customer signing off the actual document that they wrote in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
        An analogy from the real world: when someone buys a house (in the UK) they have a bunch of documents to sign--contract, mortgage agreement, life assurance, house and contents insurance and probably some more as well. These are formal documents and you sign each one. You are <em>not</em> presented with a summary document listing all of them, which you then sign.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I like about the cards is that they are highly formal, without being bureaucratic. I've always been a fan of formal approaches to development (for example, <a href="SyntropyMethodology.html">SyntropyMethodology</a> and <a href="CatalysisMethodology.html">CatalysisMethodology</a>) but always struggled with all the paperwork they involved. I like XP because it has all the formalism I need without the paperwork. The cards have a big part to play in that. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

This size also has the beneficial effect of discouraging the practice of writing too much.
