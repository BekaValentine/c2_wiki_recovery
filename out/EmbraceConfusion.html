        <em>Embracing Confusion: What Leaders Do When They Don't Know What to Do</em> at <a href="http://www.pdkmembers.org/CGI-BIN/LANSAWEB?WEBEVENT+L294315134431A52E822444K+PDK+ENG">http://www.pdkmembers.org/CGI-BIN/LANSAWEB?WEBEVENT+L294315134431A52E822444K+PDK+ENG</a> lists an abstract for an article to decision making under confusion, via a method called RIA (Reflective Inquiry And Action).

      <ul>
        <li>
           It was said in a different article, the Jentz and Murphy RIA technique has these five steps
          <ul>
            <li>
               1 - Acknowledge the confusing situation (and the negatives associated with it)
            </li>
            <li>
               2 - Asssert need for reasonable solution (do not fake confidence)
            </li>
            <li>
               3 - Structured interaction with others to achieve a common problem solving process
            </li>
            <li>
               4 - Active listening to input from others
            </li>
            <li>
               5 - "thinking out loud" about the new information gathered from others
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           the authors assert managers will be measured by their behavior towards confusion, more than their knowledge, in an age of uncertainty.
        </li>
      </ul>
