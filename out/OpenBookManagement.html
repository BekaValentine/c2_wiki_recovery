        The correct business context for <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. <a href="OpenBookManagement.html">OpenBookManagement</a> centers on 4 principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Detailed company financials are shared with all employees on an iterative basis - weekly to monthly. All employees are fully informed about all the figures that relate to "the bottom line", and forecasts of its future. With the exception of information concerning salaries, management propagate their reporting information <em>down</em> as well as <em>up</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
           This information is used collaboratively to establish and propagate the calculation of <a href="CriticalNumbers.html">CriticalNumbers</a> that characterize process efficiency. These <a href="CriticalNumbers.html">CriticalNumbers</a> are evaluated and forecast by those directly accountable for the processes they describe. Overall the <a href="CriticalNumbers.html">CriticalNumbers</a> form a cascade from the gross drivers of the company's financials down to each group and individual performance.
        </li>
        <li>
           An employee share ownership plan (ESOP) is established with participation primarily determined, not by employee attendance, seniority, or longevity, but by employees meeting and exceeding targets defined in terms of their <a href="CriticalNumbers.html">CriticalNumbers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Each of the <a href="CriticalNumbers.html">CriticalNumbers</a> is regularly scored, and the results are shared on a scoreboard or intranet visible to all employees. Financial training is available to all employees - and incentivized with a small bonus. To make 'em concrete, <a href="CriticalNumbers.html">CriticalNumbers</a> are each dramatized with a small game. Yes, just like the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>.
