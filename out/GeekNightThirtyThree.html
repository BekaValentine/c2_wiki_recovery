        Yes, there is a 50% tube outage. No, we will not be cancelling. Why?
        Adversity is what rallies us about our grand and noble cause (which is, we know not what)

        Last week, I showed up, buzzed the buzzer, rang the office phone, knocked on the door - place looked dead.  Did <a href="GeekNight.html">GeekNight</a> happen last week, and if so, was it in the usual place? Can someone send me a mobile number to ring tonight when I'm downstairs?  Cheers -- <a href="JimArnold.html">JimArnold</a>

        Jim, 
        Yes, geek night happened. But is was only two people. Sorry about that. If you need to get into the door, call me on my mobile. the number is 07766320712 (and that goes for everybody)

        Anyone who is stuck outside the office should try calling the office number... it's 020 7090 7415.  Keep ringing until someone answers.
