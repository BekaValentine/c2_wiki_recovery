        Steel Thread Is Stupid
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Steel thread" is a term used in BEA circles to mean <a href="DesignPrototype.html">DesignPrototype</a>. Like "bean", it is a stupid, meaningless term (see <a href="BeansConsideredHarmful.html">BeansConsideredHarmful</a>).  -- <a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it's already a useful term with the obvious meaning - for example, see <a href="http://www.compacc.com/moreinfo.cfm?Product_ID=261.">http://www.compacc.com/moreinfo.cfm?Product_ID=261.</a>
      </p>

If we software developers are to understand each other in conversation, then we need to use </em><a href="IntentionRevealingNames.html">IntentionRevealingNames</a>. SteelThread is not intention revealing. <a href="DesignPrototype.html">DesignPrototype</a> is.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Respectfully disagree. Calling the term 'stupid' doesn't gain anything; the simple statement that 'StealThread' = '<a href="DesignPrototype.html">DesignPrototype</a>' + 'BEA version' is sufficient. Otherwise, I'm forced to concede that '<a href="WilliamUnderwood.html">WilliamUnderwood</a>' is stupid, because it doesn't in and of itself mean 'male human'. Could there be value in making a SteelThread page that states that this is a version of a design prototype?
