        In a few months <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> will be celebrating its fourth year of existence. A new version <a href="DotNetFramework.html">DotNetFramework</a>, supported by <a href="VisualStudioWhidbey.html">VisualStudioWhidbey</a> will become a reality.  And major enhancements in <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> and <a href="VbDotNet.html">VbDotNet</a> is expected as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presumably <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> will be "coming of age" soon, now that Whidbey has reached "Released to Manufacturing" RTM status. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the new "Enterprise version" of <a href="VisualStudioWhidbey.html">VisualStudioWhidbey</a> (called Team Foundation server) there are supposed to be two SDLC process templates. These are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "MSF for Agile Software development"
        </li>
        <li>
           "MSF for CMMI Process Improvement"
        </li>
      </ul>

        The above information taken from Jun05 blog at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vstsue/articles/429078.aspx,">http://blogs.msdn.com/vstsue/articles/429078.aspx,</a> and represents what the vendor thinks the users and managers of the <a href="DotNetPlatform.html">DotNetPlatform</a> needed.

        Has the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> community gravitated towards any systematic approach to addressing the <a href="SystemsDevelopmentLifeCycle.html">SystemsDevelopmentLifeCycle</a> yet? I am interested in information on what "system development method(s)" are in use in small to medium inhouse <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> shops. -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>

        I'll offer two nearly insignificant data points from the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> community, whatever that is:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Personally, as an occasional user of <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>, I couldn't care less.
        </li>
        <li>
           I recently discussed development methodologies with a colleague who is a strong proponent of <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>.  His tongue-in-cheek response (slightly paraphrased) to my mention of using XP was, "Huh?  What's wrong with using the 'methodology' called 'just get on with it?'" <em>Answer: I am seeking </em><a href="TheRoadMapToRepeatableSuccess.html">TheRoadMapToRepeatableSuccess</a>. Need a mechanism to apply <a href="ProjectManagement.html">ProjectManagement</a> techniques.<em></em>
