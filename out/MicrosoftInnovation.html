        Microsoft Innovation
      </h1>
      <p>
        When the topic of splitting up near monopolies such as Microsoft comes up, often the issue of Microsoft's innovation comes up. This topic offers the opportunity to demonstrate Microsoft's innovation via examples. It can be argued that Microsoft brings many innovative products "to the masses" by knowing just what to rent, borrow, and/or copy.

            <li>
               The basis of the idea can be traced to AppleHyperCard and Alan Cooper's company "Tripod". Microsoft licensed technology from Tripod. It could be argued that MS did a decent job of integrating visual form design and an app programming language.

It could be argued that MS-Access made better use of the mouse that these other products.
