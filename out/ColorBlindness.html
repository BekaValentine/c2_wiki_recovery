        Color Blindness
      </h1>
      <p>
        On <a href="GriefCertificate.html">GriefCertificate</a>, <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> talks about <a href="ColorBlindness.html">ColorBlindness</a> and a few other people chimed in.  Someone mentioned that 10% of all males are color blind to some degree, but most of them actually have weakness to a colour, not blindness, most common is weakness to green (Deuteranomaly), weakness to red (Protanomaly) being less common.  One thing that I wonder about is correlation with other traits.  It may sound silly, but I often find out that some of the best technical guys I know are <a href="ColorBlind.html">ColorBlind</a>, <a href="LeftHanded.html">LeftHanded</a> or both.  I don't know whether this is just chance or not.

        Isn't <a href="ColorBlindness.html">ColorBlindness</a> one of those male conditions that comes about because men don't have another X chromosome?  Like hemophilia?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, it's recessive.  Women can be red-green color blind/weak too, but they'd have to have the "bad" gene on both X chromosomes, which is extremely unlikely, except in areas where it is ununally common.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And if a woman has the gene for </em><a href="DeuteraNomaly.html">DeuteraNomaly</a> on one X chromosome and that for <a href="ProtaNomaly.html">ProtaNomaly</a> on the other, she can be a <a href="TetraChromat.html">TetraChromat</a> -- one who can distinguish colors of four wavelengths, as opposed to most humans who can only see three (red, green, and blue).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>8 percent of males, 0.5 percent of females - according to </em><a href="http://www.zipmall.com/mpm-art-colorbl.htm">http://www.zipmall.com/mpm-art-colorbl.htm</a> -- <a href="RobertField.html">RobertField</a><em> Most common type is </em><a href="DeuteraNomaly.html">DeuteraNomaly</a> where the perception of green is shifted towards red.

        For the first time, researchers have tracked down the genetic cause of red/green color blindness, a vision defect that affects 1 out of 20 men in the United States. The finding may lead to a blood test for the condition, which is now diagnosed using color charts. --Reuters October 31, 1996.

        Note:  Any color blindness test done through your computer monitor will be unreliable, because computer monitors aren't tuned for precisely correct color rendering.

        My brother is completely <a href="ColorBlind.html">ColorBlind</a> (no colours at all), but he's right-handed.  Last I heard the thinking on handedness was that it was environmental rather than genetic.  Dunno if that's right though.  -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

        Well being DownUnder I am ColourBlind ;) and right handed, one of my brothers is left handed and colour blind, he is a better puzzle solver than me.  -- <a href="AndrewMcMeikan.html">AndrewMcMeikan</a>
