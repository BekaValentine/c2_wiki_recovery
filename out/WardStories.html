        When I joined Tektronix I attended an engineering orientation where the founder of the company, Howard Vollum, spoke. After a few light comments about his long-time rival, Hewlett-Packard, he focused on our real enemy, <a href="CreepingFeaturitis.html">CreepingFeaturitis</a>. I was struck by his intensity. It took me a few years to integrate his comments with the company motto: committed to technical excellence . He was right, of course. You'll never find the exquisite solution to a real problem if you are busy tending little problems of your own making. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        I worked with a fellow once who refused to comment, indent or even carriage return at reasonable places. I made him sit and watch me refactor one particularly crucial piece of code until we had something even <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> would like. I found lots of duplication and irregularities, but nothing fatally wrong with the original, much to my amazement.

        "What do you think?" I asked. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "I think we just wasted an hour," he said, "It still does the same thing." 
      </p>
      <p>
        "You're right" I said as I reverted to his original. If he wasn't going to admit it looked better, I wasn't going to let him enjoy looking at it.

        I ran into him at a conference a few months later. He said he had tried formatting code on his own and kinda liked it. Ahh. Small successes. There is a moral: If you don't like looking at your code you are probably not writing it well. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Ward, I want to be as wise and as patient as you are, and I want it now! -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
