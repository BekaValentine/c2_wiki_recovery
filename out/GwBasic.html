        Gw Basic
      </h1>
      <p>
        GW-BASIC was a version of the <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a> available for early DOS machines. It came with the Dos Operating system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        GW-BASIC was named after Greg Whitten, an early <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> employee. So says <a href="JoelOnSoftware.html">JoelOnSoftware</a> at <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/printerFriendly/articles/TwoStories.html.">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/printerFriendly/articles/TwoStories.html.</a> Other stories say that the GW stands for "Gates, William," "Gee Whiz," and other variants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original IBM PC had BASIC in ROM, supplied by Microsoft. It also came with <a href="PcDos.html">PcDos</a> and a more advanced form of Basic called BASICA, but that worked only if you had the BASIC in ROM. <a href="GwBasic.html">GwBasic</a> was the generic <a href="MsDos.html">MsDos</a> equivalent for non-IBM computers, and would work on almost anything that was BIOS and video memory compatible.

        <strong>Sample GW Basic code</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's some sample GW-BASIC code, which reads a string, then prints it out:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           INPUT A$
        </li>
        <li>
           PRINT "YOU TYPED "; A$
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        [The above is simple enough to work for most implementations of BASIC. The semicolon causes concatenation.]
