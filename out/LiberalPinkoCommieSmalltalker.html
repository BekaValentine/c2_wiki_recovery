        Liberal Pinko Commie Smalltalker
      </h1>
      <p>
        The opposite of a <a href="RedneckSmalltalker.html">RedneckSmalltalker</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        You are a <a href="LiberalPinkoCommieSmalltalker.html">LiberalPinkoCommieSmalltalker</a> if
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You choose to live in countries with comprehensive national health services and do not take out private health insurance even if working (undercover) in a 'city'bank
        </li>
        <li>
           You support gun control
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You travel to work by public transport
        </li>
        <li>
           ... and don't own a car
        </li>
        <li>
           ... and don't know how to drive
        </li>
        <li>
           ... alternatively you may cycle in
        </li>
        <li>
           So that you can keep writing code while commuting
        </li>
        <li>
           ... except when cycling in
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You write class comments
        </li>
        <li>
           ... and sometimes even method comments
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You also write documentation (red cover optional)
        </li>
        <li>
           ... but not too much (save those trees!)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You use a neat testing framework
        </li>
        <li>
           ...religiously (using this word, as always, as a metaphor)
        </li>
        <li>
           ...even if those rednecks wrote it
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Refuse to smalltalk with Austrians (<em>the nationality, or the economic school?</em> ;-)
        </li>
        <li>
           ...unless they commit treason
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You think it's great that Smalltalk treats every object equally to every other object
        </li>
        <li>
           ... in fact, you've redefined Object== to make this the case :-)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You describe refactoring as "class struggle"
        </li>
        <li>
           Every class is a working class
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You dismiss SOAP-based systems, because they are only for the "chattering classes"
        </li>
      </ul>

        I think it must be significant, somehow, that this page is decidedly <strong>not funny</strong>, unlike <a href="RedneckSmalltalker.html">RedneckSmalltalker</a>.
