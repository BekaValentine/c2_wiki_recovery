        Martin Niemoeller

      <p>
        Protestant pastor and Nazi Concentration camp survivor.  Most well known from a student question as reported by his wife: "First they came for the Communists, but I was not a Communist so I did not speak out. Then they came for the Socialists and the Trade Unionists, but I was neither, so I did not speak out. Then they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew so I did not speak out. And when they came for me, there was no one left to speak out for me".
