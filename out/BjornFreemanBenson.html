        I live to fly my airplane (fondly known as Super Boy <a href="http://superboy.org/whysuperboy.htm).">http://superboy.org/whysuperboy.htm).</a> To support this habit, I make a living delivering software products.  I've been proselytizing lately about how software engineering is more and more about the people and not about needlessly complex technology.
