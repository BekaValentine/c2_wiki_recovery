        Modernizing Ex Base
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a> continues to frustrate me for internal batch and ad-hoc data-chomping chores. I miss much of <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> (dBASE derivatives), but realize that its conventions are a bit outdated to be accepted in most organizations. Maybe if us <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> fans can manage to find a way to modernize the good parts of the language and tool conventions, we can resurrect the wounded beast into a new species that is more palatable to modern conventions/fashions. For one, it probably has to better resemble and better integrate with SQL. SQL is the lingua franca of query languages for good or bad (see <a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a>). --top

        Suggestions to ponder:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Replace "FOR" with "WHERE" to fit SQL conventions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Make "memory" variables start with "$" to avoid confusion with column names.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Better management and cleanup of "temp" or intermediate/virtual tables, such as auto-cleanup and user/session-specific temporary tables.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Mousey" wizards for certain kinds of code generation, and/or perhaps a "format" <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a>/<a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a> for column-mapping etc. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Better or more standardized "area" (handle) management.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ability to use multiple RDBMS as its underlying data engine.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Easy "escape" into direct SQL when needed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Review commands that rely on "modey" (global) settings and either remove them, or create non-modal alternatives.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Toss or make optional hard-wired size limits left over from the early micro-computer era. Example: maximum recognized variable name length. (Older dialects ignored characters beyond a certain name length as a compromise between efficiency and name expressiveness.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Table-driven index and auto-join management.
        </li>
      </ul>
