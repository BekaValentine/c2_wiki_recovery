        A line of fat computer books I plan to write...
      </p>
      <p>
        ...with very wide margins and no code examples before page 200.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't forget the screen-dumps of each page of the wizards that are designed for people who don't read books about how to use their software.
      </p>

        <dd><em>but those screen-dump pages are very useful for those who read the books but do not have a computer!</em></dd>

        True! I'm reading an online version of <em>Inside </em><a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a><em> but I haven't gotten around to installing </em><a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> yet. I'm getting a lot out of the screen dumps. But then, <em>Inside C#</em> seems to be a bit better than the average bible. -- <a href="AndrewQueisser.html">AndrewQueisser</a>

        I'm planning to write <em>Enterprise Network Security With C and XML In 30 Seconds for the Brain Dead</em> when I get a chance:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Enterprise Network Security With C and XML in 30 Seconds for the Brain Dead</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Who is this book for?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For almost anyone who is afraid of viruses, trojans, greeks, or lefthanded satanistic poodle pruners who want your data. For those cipherpunks who know that <em>The Man</em> is out to get 'em. For those who realize that masking their identity when they buy dog food online is imperative to democracy and freedom as we know it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, the author recognizes that people vary in skills. Consequently, the steps increase in skill level as they progress. The skill level is neatly placed in the margin next to each step. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[BEGINNER] Step 1. Turn off your computer</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't know how to do this, you can yank out the power plug from the wall. If you don't know how to do this, just stop paying your electric bills. NOTE: If you take this latter approach, this will take longer than 30 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the computer is off, you're 80% of the way there. The computer is secure from all but the most insidious of blackbag attacks. Anything beyond this step requires an advanced knowledge of computers. (And some biceps. Eat your wheaties!)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[ADVANCED] Step 2. Smash monitor, case, hard drive, ethernet cable and (why not?) mouse with C and XML 1000-page doorstops, er, textbooks.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the computer is completely secure from all attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[GURU] Step 3. Go outside, away from computers. Become a lumberjack or something.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why are you still reading this? You're supposed to be outside. Some guru you are. Can't even read.

        <em>I like this long name. It's funny take-off on the names of computer programming books and how the books all blend together in one's mind.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. In this case, the long name is part of the point of the page. Leave it be?

        Foo-oriented programming fell out of style; Bar is the New Thing. But all you have to do substitute "Foo" with "Bar" and pay 3rd-world workers to rewrite the code examples in Bar and put silhouette-leafy intersecting spirals on the cover (or is that so 2011 already?)

        The "Dummies" series spawned a trend in books allegedly catering to the ever stupider. Let's extrapolate to see where the trend is heading:

        I'm writing a book on how to conduct an <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a>. It will be called <strong>"How to Conduct an Official Certified Double-Blind Peer-Reviewed Published Study in Seven Days for Dummies In a Nutshell Super-Bible Unleashed"</strong>. The publisher was happy because they didn't have to find a picture for the front cover because the title took up all the space.
