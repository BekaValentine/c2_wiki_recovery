        <em>Six thirty in the evening.  As the executive staff at some anonymous high-tech company heads out the door, to their luxury cars parked in reserved spaces near the front of the building, to yet another evening of wining and dining clients and/or investors in fancy restaurants--all at company expense, a group of programmers (behind on a management-imposed schedule) sighs and prepares for yet another late evening at their workstations (The preceding image is rendered, of course, in CGI animation).  One of the engineers, who by no strange coincidence looks a lot like the British rock star Sting, climbs up onto his desk and breaks out in song.</em>

        <em>The dramatic tension of the music builds up to a climax--which is then relieved by a wicked guitar lick.  All the other programmers get up on their desk and start dancing to to the beat; one grabs his mouse and holding it like a microphone, begins to sing</em>
