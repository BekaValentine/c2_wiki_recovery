        Canonical Form
      </h1>
      <p>
        The rest of this page discusses a particular <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a> for design patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a>, in general, is really a special member of a set of equivalent elements. For example, disjunctive normal form is a <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a> in the propositional calculus where a proposition is represented as the disjunction (logical 'or') of a set of propositions which are not themselves disjunctions. (Mathematicians please feel free to correct this half-remembered definition!) They are frequently useful in software to speed comparisons and lookups.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        To my knowledge, <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a> is identical to AGCSform and <a href="CoplienForm.html">CoplienForm</a>. See also: <a href="http://www.hillside.net/patterns/writing/writingpatterns.htm">http://www.hillside.net/patterns/writing/writingpatterns.htm</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people use <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a> to refer to <a href="AlexandrianForm.html">AlexandrianForm</a>, but canonical
        form doesn't necessarily mean the original form, it means the simplest, most basic or primordial form. For example a "canonical matrix" is one with 1's along the primary diagonal and zeros everywhere else. A "canonical basis" is a set of vectors basically from a canonical matrix. Canonical SOP and POS forms in digital logic refer to the minimal & basic algebraic sum of products (SOP) or product of sums (POS).
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a> for a pattern is therefore the form that explicitly spells out the most basic elements: name, context, problem, forces, solution, etc. That is also how I most often see it used. The <a href="AlexandrianForm.html">AlexandrianForm</a> is much more advanced than this because it manages to provide "coverage" of these essentials while maintaining the flow of straight prose (which is no mean feat).
      </p>
      <p>
        So the "canonical" form for describing a pattern uses sections with the following headings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Name
        </li>
        <li>
           Alias (optional)
        </li>
        <li>
           Problem
        </li>
        <li>
           Context
        </li>
        <li>
           Forces
        </li>
        <li>
           Solution
        </li>
        <li>
           Example (optional?)
        </li>
        <li>
           Resulting Context
        </li>
        <li>
           Rationale (optional)
        </li>
        <li>
           Known Uses
        </li>
        <li>
           Related Patterns
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most people put the "Problem" section *before* the "Context" section. I have become rather fond of swapping the order of these two, letting the "Context" set the stage for the statement of the "Problem".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why the "optional" after Example? Does it mean that you don't need an example at all, or just that you needn't state it?</em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>It means the example may be optional as a separate section in its own right. In many cases, the Solution and/or Implementation section will implicitly use an example (often one described by the Motivation section if GoF format is used). Also, sometimes Known Uses are used as examples, but still remain in the Known Uses section. That's what I prefer, if possible, so the example shows not just some fictitious toy scenario, but comes from the real world. This cant always be done in the the limited space provided ;-).</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The GoV POSA book uses something very similar to <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a>. Basically it uses the same format but also add a section entitled "Variants" to describe variations of the pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a> maps roughly to <a href="GoFform.html">GoFform</a> in the following manner:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a>       ==>   <a href="GoFform.html">GoFform</a><br/>

        Ive seen some people use a combination of both, where <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a> is used
        at the high-level sections and <a href="GoFform.html">GoFform</a> is used for some of the subsections and
        a select few of the higher-level sections. So it might look like:
      </p>

        One rarely uses <em>all</em> the subsections for every pattern, just when the extra level of detail seems warranted. Personally, I like to see the Context precede the Problem because I think it sets the stage for understanding the problem statement.

        Brad, I like the variation you present above. We started doing them in the <a href="GoFform.html">GoFform</a>, then switched over to something resembling <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a>. We didn't want to keep both, since it might confuse the reader or promote a discrimination between some patterns more at the architecture level and those at the design level. By having subsections like the ones above where warranted, then, elaboration upon more design, consequences, and implementation is done only where it adds value to the reader. -- <a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a>

        And now, based on a form which originated from <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>, and heard of by myself during <a href="PlopConference.html">PlopConference</a> this year, there is a <a href="CompactForm.html">CompactForm</a> that hopes to make pattern languages easier to write, understand, and read. I hope I got it right. ;-) -- <a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a>
