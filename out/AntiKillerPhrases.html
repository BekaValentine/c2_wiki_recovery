        Anti Killer Phrases
      </h1>
      <p>
        These are phrases that stop you from doing something 
        stupid, or at least alert you that there is a problem in a positive way.
        Unlike <a href="KillerPhrases.html">KillerPhrases</a> or <a href="AlarmBellPhrases.html">AlarmBellPhrases</a>, the person uttering them is 
        aware rather than ignorant of the open manhole in front of him.
        Usually they stop work/effort/discussion in it's tracks, but it's a
        good thing because you entered the time-wasting zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        That probably wasn't very clear, how 'bout some samples instead:
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's 2AM"  - implies everyone is in the veggie zone, and it's pointless to continue trying to come up with 'good' ideas, silly is all that's left.
      </p>
      <p>
        "NO KILL I" - points out that the text under scrutiny is too ambiguous 
        for any meaningful interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Where is your test?" - When <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> and about to add functionality.
