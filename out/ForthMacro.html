        Forth Macro
      </h1>
      <p>
        Like <a href="LispMacro.html">LispMacro</a>s, Forth distinguishes compile-time vs. run-time semantics.  Words which are flagged IMMEDIATE run at the time words are compiled, rather than get compiled into the definition themselves.  Forth control structures (IF-THEN, BEGIN-WHILE-REPEAT) are IMMEDATE words which compile branch instructions into the definition, using the stack at compile-time to backpatch the branch addresses.  One can extend the language with additional control structures in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also used by words like <strong>create</strong> and <strong> ." </strong> and <strong>[']</strong> to parse the input stream for strings and symbols, allowing Forth to use syntaxes other than postfix.  This can be handy for creating <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>s (such as infix mathematical expressions or state diagrams).
      </p>
      <p>
        One can execute a fragment of a definition at compile-time by temporarily turning off the compiler.  For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        : slow ( n -- ) prepare  big hairy computation producing another number  compute ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        does the hairy computation each time <em>slow</em> is invoked.  It will run faster if written
      </p>
      <code>
        : fast ( n -- ) prepare [ big hairy computation producing another number ] literal compute ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        where <strong>[</strong> turns the compiler off, executing the hairy computation at compile-time until the matching <strong>]</strong>. The resulting number is compiled inline by <em>literal</em>, which at run-time will be passed to <em>compute</em>.  This is equivalent to setting a <em>const</em> variable to an expression in C vs. embedding the expression directly into the body of a C function.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, one can also write specialized defining words which work like <strong>:</strong>.  One writes the word to be IMMEDIATE, and uses <em>POSTPONE word</em> to compile words into the current definition.  An example of this is on <a href="DotProductInManyProgrammingLanguages.html">DotProductInManyProgrammingLanguages</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Forth variants allow a normally compiled colon definition to be flagged to have its body inserted inline when encountered, rather than to compile a call to the word.  <a href="QuartusForth.html">QuartusForth</a> uses <em>inline</em> after a colon definition, others replace <strong>:</strong> with <strong>macro:</strong>.
