        Trivial Perl Script
      </h1>
      <p>
        Never having come across a scripting task that couldn't be solved quickly and easily with sh/sed/awk/grep etc. the need to learn Perl has never presented itself to me. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who have learned Perl assure me that <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> problems can be resolved in five minutes by a <a href="TrivialPerlScript.html">TrivialPerlScript</a>.

        If by resolved you mean that someone's already written something to do it, well, that's quite possible.  See CPAN [<a href="http://www.cpan.org/].">http://www.cpan.org/].</a>  CPAN is the primary reason why I use Perl.

        I learnt just enough Perl to call awk/grep/etc...  somewhat handy for CGI

        <em>Most "scripting" tasks can indeed be done with sh/sed/awk/grep. They can also be done with Perl. I learned Perl partly to save myself learning umpteen other tools. (Of course I can use sh and grep. I've never needed sed or awk. And you know what they say about sed: Every now and then, a programmer will have a problem and suddenly think "I know, I can use sed!" Then he has two problems.) But then, my language of choice for this sort of task is Python rather than Perl these days, so what do I know? --</em><a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a><em></em>
