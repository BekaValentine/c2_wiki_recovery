        Often ideas and work are separated either by position, power or competence.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are those who
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           have ideas, but do not know how to make them work
        </li>
        <li>
           have ideas, seek others with complimentary competencies, and begin work on implementations, either individually, jointly or severally
        </li>
        <li>
           decide upon which ideas others will work.
        </li>
        <li>
           oppose ideas <a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           propose and seek to implement bad ideas
        </li>
        <li>
           have ideas but do not record them or seek their implementation
        </li>
        <li>
           work without having an idea of what it is they are to accomplish
        </li>
        <li>
           work, always improving, but never finishing a stage, being satisfied with partial functionality with partial dys-functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
           work, the same way, over and over, never seeking a better or easier way.
        </li>
      </ul>

                   The 1921 birth of masking tape. It involves one CharlesRichardDrew, a banjo-playing college dropout and lowly lab technician for 3M (MMM), which was then an unprepossessing maker of sandpaper. While delivering sandpaper to an auto-body shop, Drew observed a worker struggling with glue and butcher paper as he attempted a two-tone paint job. Eureka! Drew envisioned masking tape.

               Unfortunately, 3M would have none of it. But, working in secret, Drew found a way to make the tape.

               The lesson? Observation and imagination - plus insubordination - can be great for innovation.

                   In August of 1993, <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> and <a href="GradyBooch.html">GradyBooch</a> sponsored a mountain retreat in Colorado where a group converged on foundations for software patterns. <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>, <a href="KenAuer.html">KenAuer</a>, <a href="HalHildebrand.html">HalHildebrand</a>, <a href="GradyBooch.html">GradyBooch</a>, <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> and <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> struggled with Alexander's ideas and our own experiences to forge a marriage of objects and patterns. The Group agreed that we were ready to build on <a href="ErichGamma.html">ErichGamma</a>'s foundation work studying object-oriented patterns, to use patterns in a generative way in the sense that <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> uses patterns for urban planning and building architecture. We then used the term <em>generative</em> to mean <em>creational</em> to distinguish them from <em>Gamma patterns</em> that captured observations. The Group was meeting on the side of a hill when all this occurred, hence the name.
