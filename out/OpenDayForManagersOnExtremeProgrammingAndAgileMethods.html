        Open Day For Managers On Extreme Programming And Agile Methods
      </h1>
      <p>
        Update: there were 2 sessions in 2004, one in Sutri (VT) Italy and the other one in Milan Italy. After that some organizers decided that was not worth going on, therefore we stopped. But the 2 sessions that we did were really interesting indeed! :-) --<a href="PiergiulianoBossi.html">PiergiulianoBossi</a>
