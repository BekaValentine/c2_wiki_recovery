        MIDP is a set of Java APIs intended to be implemented in 'mobile information devices' (e.g. mobile phones), providing a limited Java runtime environment in which downloaded applications called 'MIDlets' can run. MIDlets are typically rather small; some devices limit them in size to as little as 30KB. The first MIDlets available are mostly small arcade-style games, but many other types are possible. For a good sample and an idea of what's possible, see <a href="http://www.midlet.org.">http://www.midlet.org.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        MIDP includes APIs for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           UI (based on Screens, of which only one may be visible at a time)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Canvas - draw what you like on it (suitable for games)
            </li>
            <li>
               Form etc. - WAP-like screens with text items, text fields, images, etc...; adapted to device UI style
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Persistent storage (byte-array records with integer keys, stored typically in Flash memory)
        </li>
        <li>
           Networking (at least HTTP client capability, based on CLDC's 'generic connection framework')
          <ul>
            <li>
               Only HTTP client functionality is mandated (i.e. request; response)
            </li>
            <li>
               Mobile network bandwidth & latency is significantly different to fixed networks; beware!
            </li>
            <li>
               Optionally e.g. TCP/IP sockets, UDP datagrams, HTTP servers etc. may be implemented, but that's unlikely if the transport is WAP
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Application model ('MIDlets', quite similar in style to JavaApplets)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Substantial numbers of MIDP-enabled phone models are now appearing on the market (June 2002). Nokia alone targets to sell tens of millions of MIDP-enabled phones in 2002, and still higher numbers in 2003. One list of MIDP-enabled phones can be found from here: <a href="http://wireless.java.sun.com/device/.">http://wireless.java.sun.com/device/.</a>
