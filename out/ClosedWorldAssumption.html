        Closed World Assumption
      </h1>
      <p>
        In a <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> system (or a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>, or a <a href="ConstraintProgramming.html">ConstraintProgramming</a> system, etc); one builds a collection of <em>facts</em> (things held to be true) and <em>axioms</em> (rules for deriving additional facts from the set of base facts).
      </p>
      <p>
        If a theorem can be shown to be true based on the facts and axioms; then it is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you handle a query that <em>cannot</em> be shown from the above (in other words, isn't derivable?)
      </p>
      <p>
        Two possibilities, the <a href="ClosedWorldAssumption.html">ClosedWorldAssumption</a> and the <a href="OpenWorldAssumption.html">OpenWorldAssumption</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ClosedWorldAssumption.html">ClosedWorldAssumption</a> holds that anything that cannot be shown to be true is false; no explicit declaration of falsehood is needed. Consequently, any query (which terminates) will either return true or false; there is no possibility of "unknown".
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Technically, one can ask the system to prove that something is Unknown, or to prove that something is Known, so long as there is a means to represent such a query.  It is not a violation of the <a href="ClosedWorldAssumption.html">ClosedWorldAssumption</a> to have <em>facts</em> of the sort Known(X) and Unknown(Y), or even axioms like Forall X: (SomePredicate(X)-> Unknown(OtherPredicate(X))), Forall X: X<->Known(X), etc.  The <a href="ClosedWorldAssumption.html">ClosedWorldAssumption</a> does not enforce restrictions on the sort of logic used.  However, it cannot answer 'unknown' directly; to make use of such, you'd need to craft your queries correctly -- ask Known(P), or Known(Unknown(P)).
        </li>
        <li>
          The real difficulty with the <a href="ClosedWorldAssumption.html">ClosedWorldAssumption</a> is that you cannot add information.  Everything is known <em>a priori</em>.  One cannot assert "oh, yeah!  X is known!" without creating a new world and adding this fact to that world, along with all the other facts except the one that said: Unknown(X), which would need to be removed.  (If this is done regularly, one would be wise to utilize ModalLogic, where reasoning over worlds can happen).  This is less a problem with the <a href="OpenWorldAssumption.html">OpenWorldAssumption</a>, where 'unknown' isn't expressed as a fact in the database, but rather as the absence of a fact. --db

      </ul>

        Most programming systems which use logic or predicate calculus use the <a href="ClosedWorldAssumption.html">ClosedWorldAssumption</a>, including:

           <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>s (these can be viewed as predicate systems)
