        Laplace Transform
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="LaplaceTransform.html">LaplaceTransform</a> is given by the expression: 
        L{f(t)} = Integral of (f(t).exp(-s.t)) between the limits of 0 and infinity. 
        The <a href="LaplaceTransform.html">LaplaceTransform</a> of f(t) is also denoted by F(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        t = time, s = a + i.w, i = sqrt(-1), w = 2.PI.f, f = frequency and 'a' is the abscissa of convergence which is 0 for engineering problems.

        Neat things about the <a href="LaplaceTransform.html">LaplaceTransform</a> of interest to engineers is that

      <ul>
        <li>
           differentiation in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by s in the S domain.
        </li>
        <li>
           integration in the time domain corresponds to division by s in the S domain.
        </li>
        <li>
           translation in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by an exponential in the s domain.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="LaplaceTransform.html">LaplaceTransform</a> is used heavily in electronics and electrical circuits to simplify analysis. For example, the response of a simple circuit of a resistor, capacitor and inductor in parallel, subjected to a sinusoidal stimulus is described in the time domain by an integrodifferential equation that is tricky to solve. Transforming the problem into the S domain results in a simple algebraic expression that is simple to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        More usefully, to evaluate the overall response of a set of cascaded systems requires convolving the time impulse responses of those systems. In the S domain the overall response can be found by multiplying the transforms of each subsystem - much easier.
