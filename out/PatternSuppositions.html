            Techniques have a tendency to be successful under some defined range of circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
            Noteworthy successful techniques and noteworthy unsuccessful techniques (in a given context) should be identified and named because:
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
           naming successful techniques increases their adoptability (e.g. the techniques are more easily disseminated, and thus propagate, and are easier to discuss and maintain)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           naming unsuccessful techniques indirectly reduces their adoptability (e.g. the "black sheep" label invokes peer pressure against the technique)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Documented, reusable object organizations (e.g. <a href="BridgePattern.html">BridgePattern</a>), not just idioms (e.g. good factoring habits) are both necessary for <a href="DesignPatternEvolution.html">DesignPatternEvolution</a>.

        <em>Techniques are named because it's easier to communicate about something that has a name. Does it have to affect the techniques in themselves?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Naming only increases the attention given to the technique. Could increased attention accelerate evolution of the pattern?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't understand. How would you see the evolution of an "established" pattern? For example, how would you see the evolution of the Singleton. Please note that I don't mean where it came from. I can see how patterns emerge from behaviour.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The text suggests programming practices in the community evolve, not that the pattern changes.
