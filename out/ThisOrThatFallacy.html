        This Or That Fallacy
      </h1>
      <p>
        The fallacy is this. The people who argue this take a true statement: you must choose X or Y [In this case callbacks vs virtual functions ( which as far as I know, are the only two options )] and pervert it into: you must chose Z vs Y where Z is one variant of X. [ In this case message maps vs virtual functions ].
      </p>
      <p>
        You then prove that Y is not a good option and claim Z, ignore the whole range of options that are not Z. In this case justifying the bastardisation of a callback system by heavily abusing macros because virtual functions don't work.

        The fallacy is that you must choose between A and B - the belief that there are no other options.

        Uhm. No. Your approach to problem solving suggests only using known methods, and never inventing new ones. That is not a good approach. -- <a href="ThaddeusOlczyk.html">ThaddeusOlczyk</a>

It is related to the <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a>, which says, roughly, if we give them an inch they'll take a yard. That presents the choice as "nothing" or "a yard" and the middle choice of "an inch" is excluded. -- <a href="DavidSaff.html">DavidSaff</a>

        I use this fallacy with my daughter when I want her to get dressed: "do you want to wear this outfit or that outfit?". I've also heard this called a GrandmaQuestion. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>
