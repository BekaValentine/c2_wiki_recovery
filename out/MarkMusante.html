        Mark Musante
      </h1>
      <p>
        A "Lone Gunman" in the world of interactive fiction, Mark is a master at promotion through obscurity.  Although readily available to the world at "<a href="http://www.ministryofpeace.com/people/mark/if.html">http://www.ministryofpeace.com/people/mark/if.html</a>", Mark's games are rarely played and known to most as being obtusely complex.  He IS listed, however, in the "Who's Who" of IF authors.  As in "Who the hell is he?".
