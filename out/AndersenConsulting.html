      <p>
        Companies can be "saved".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It never needed saving. The split was due to a dispute with the parent Andersen - both sides were doing just fine at the time. Andersen (the audit arm) of course went under as a result of Enron, but that had nothing to do with the split - being some time afterwards</em>
