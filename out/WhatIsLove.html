        What Is Love
      </h1>
      <p>
        As a distinction:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The mutual interrelationship of two or more creatures in order to create a more complex creature. Hence:
          <ul>
            <li>
               two or more soccer hooligans
            </li>
            <li>
               several million slime-mold protozoans
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> and many other intentional systems ...
            </li>
            <li>
               The many kinds of <a href="DefinitionOfLove.html">DefinitionOfLove</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Naturally some loves are greater, deeper, or what have you, than others ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed - wood and glue hardly have a relationship worth noting.  And what about the kind of love between friends, or is that not possible, as far as you are concerned?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Wood and glue being rather simple creatures, their love isn't very complicated. Between friends, sure, what's the problem?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What does it create?  And don't just say a friendly pair - a bitter rivalry is a relationship that creates a more complicated pair than there would otherwise be, but hardly counts as love.

        I'm put in mind of <a href="KurtVonnegut.html">KurtVonnegut</a>'s wonderful plea - "Please, a little less love and a little more common decency". Or again "Love may fail but simple politeness will carry the day."

        <a href="WhatIsLove.html">WhatIsLove</a> is also that song those club-hopping guys from SaturdayNightLive are always jerking rhythmically to.
