        <dd>Now such a man would never get anywhere in this country, I think. It's never been tried, anyway. This is in the attitude of mind of the populace, that they have to have an answer and that a man who gives an answer is better than a man who gives no answer, when the real fact of the matter is, in most cases, it is the other way around.  <em>[...]</em>  And the result of <em>this</em> is that political promises can never be kept. <em>[...]</em>  The result of <em>that</em> is that nobody believes campaign promises. -- The Meaning of It All (ISBN 0738201669) [<a href="http://www.addall.com/New/compare.cgi?dispCurr=US&isbn=0738201669&location=10000&state=OR]">http://www.addall.com/New/compare.cgi?dispCurr=US&isbn=0738201669&location=10000&state=OR]</a></dd>
