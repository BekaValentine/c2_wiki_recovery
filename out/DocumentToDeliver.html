        <strong>Short Wiki version</strong>

      <p>
        Write down (in addition to source code) only what is needed for verifiable <a href="SuccessStatement.html">SuccessStatement</a>'s with customers - to gain the budget and other resources required - and then to deliver the next increment (including tested code plus training) that will be considered a success by customers, in line with one or more <a href="SuccessStatement.html">SuccessStatement</a>.

        How much documentation is in fact needed is of course context dependent, with the most important elements being: the <em>trust</em> between the customers and the design team (programming team) and the current <em>know-how</em> of everyone involved (including knowledge of the business domain and thus tacit knowledge of customer desires by designers), in line with <a href="KnowHowToGrow.html">KnowHowToGrow</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a well conceived and executed evolutionary project, trust and know-how grow from the earliest stages, meaning that documentation of future deliveries can become more and more "informal". (In fact because the few words used convey a more exact understanding of what is required than earlier on, it is arguably wrong to use that term.)  This is <em>steady state</em> development.  Then suddenly on a Monday an idea of great business value occurs to the customers/designers, it can be <a href="ScribbledOnOnePage.html">ScribbledOnOnePage</a> in a few minutes and be working by the Friday.

        All of this implies the same emphasis on verbal communication and elucidation of goals that one picks up in XP <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> - points well summarised by <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> in <a href="RequirementsAndDesign.html">RequirementsAndDesign</a>.

        Note that there's nothing about <a href="IndexCard.html">IndexCard</a>s here, nor how to use Wiki.  Their combination and interaction is very important in the practical outworking of <a href="DocumentToDeliver.html">DocumentToDeliver</a> these days, including <a href="KnowingWhenToStop.html">KnowingWhenToStop</a>.  Thanks again Ward.

        Note also the issues with annual budgeting.  Not always quite so easy.  See <a href="IsEarlierCancellationFailure.html">IsEarlierCancellationFailure</a> and <a href="XpAndAnnualBudgets.html">XpAndAnnualBudgets</a> for some (hopefully) unfinished discussion of these issues.
