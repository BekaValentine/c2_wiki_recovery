        We <a href="WelcomeVisitors.html">WelcomeVisitors</a> with an interest in our work: if you're heading down towards <a href="NewZealand.html">NewZealand</a>, please think about
        dropping in and giving us a call!  Our, you can catch up with us at conferences like OOPSLA, ECOOP, and EuroPLoP.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're officially called "elvis" because an early project was about "Engineering Live Visualisations of Interactive Software"
        and although we now do more stuff we kept the name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then again, the main lab Elvis people use is called "memphis", another lab in the building is called "graceland",
        and there have also been labs called "tupelo" and "vegas" so perhaps that has something to do with it too.
      </p>
      <p>
        We think what we're doing is 'research' because it's stuff people haven't done before;
        'education' because we're part of a university environment in one way or another,
        and 'learning' because we are all part of the group because we want to learn.
