        Alvin Hansen

      <p>
        Hansen did not write the article; he was simply cited in the text as the source for the "TINSTAAFL" version of the saying.  The article is: "Inquest on Nationalization" by E. M. Hugh-Jones in Ethics, Vol. 62, No. 3. (Apr., 1952), pp. 169-183.  The quote is on p. 183.  By the way, Hansen was an economist, not an ethicist.
