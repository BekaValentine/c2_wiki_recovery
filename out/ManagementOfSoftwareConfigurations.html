        Management Of Software Configurations
      </h1>
      <p>
        The genericity of SCM is built upon the simplicity of its model, and the
        universality with which this one applies to virtually anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        The model considers whatever entity of concern as a Software Configuration,
        i.e. a graph of Configuration Items related with (directed) dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any Configuration Item may itself be considered as a Software Configuration
        (possibly trivial when degenerated to the level of an opaque element version).
      </p>
      <p>
        The genericity of dependencies is obtained through producing them by auditing
        an event, and recording enough information to make this one uniquely
        identifiable. Note that the record typically involves a tool interpreting in a
        specific way properties of the configuration items. Nevertheless, the
        dependency is fully generic, so that its management doesn't require any
        knowledge of the tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generic manageability is obtained for the parts of the dependency graph which
        are acyclic, i.e. allow for a decomposition into layers (levelization), and
        thus an serialization of concerns. -- <a href="MarcGirod.html">MarcGirod</a>
