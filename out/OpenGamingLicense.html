        Open Gaming License
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Open Gaming License (OGL) was the brain child of Ryan Dancey, the then D&D (<a href="DungeonsAndDragons.html">DungeonsAndDragons</a>) brand manager at Wizards of the Coast. He saw how successful the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software movement had become and the OGL is his attempt to apply the same principles to game publishing.
