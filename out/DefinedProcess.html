        <strong>Problem</strong> How to do a job:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Determine what needs to be done
        </li>
        <li>
           Decide how to do it
        </li>
        <li>
           Do it

        <li>
           Check to make sure it is correct

        <li>
           Fix any problems

      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When you need to do a job, and  want to improve your working efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
           Demands for accuracy, precision, and completeness exceed informal methods.  
        </li>
        <li>
           A systematic framework is required to insure that all the details are properly handled.
        </li>
        <li>
           You want to balance the legs of the
        </li>
        <li>
           Schedule(Time) - Cost(Resources) - Quality(Features) triangle. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A well-ordered and structured process can greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of purely routine tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
           Order and structure will inhibit the creative process.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use a defined process when you want to improve your work.
        </li>
        <li>
           Treat the creative and routine differently.
        </li>
        <li>
           Break the job up into tasks, and separate the routine tasks from the creative tasks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Rule</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Provide scripts (<a href="ProcessAsPattern.html">ProcessAsPattern</a> ?) to make the job easier to do  by showing what needs to be done and how to do it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Provide forms to gather and retain data in a consistent manner.
        </li>
        <li>
           Provide standards and checklists to guide your work and provide a basis for verifying product and process quality.
        </li>
        <li>
           Provide process improvement provisions to ensure the process will evolve to meet your ever-changing needs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Steps </strong> to define a process:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Determine your needs and priorities.
        </li>
        <li>
           Define the process objectives, goals, and quality criteria
        </li>
        <li>
           Characterize your current process.
        </li>
        <li>
           Characterize your target process.
        </li>
        <li>
           Establish a process development strategy.
        </li>
        <li>
           Define your initial process
        </li>
        <li>
           Validate your initial process
        </li>
        <li>
           Enhance your process.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Reason</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Defining the tasks makes it easier to accomplish a challenging job, adds consistency, and enables you to make meaningful measurements.
        </li>
        <li>
           A defined process allows you to separate the routine work from the creative work.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Once the creative tasks have been separated and bounded, the routine tasks can be made much more accurate and efficient.  	* Reducing the time required for routine tasks gives you more time for creative tasks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Benefits</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It enables effective communication about the process.
        </li>
        <li>
           It enhances understanding, and provides a basis for automation.
        </li>
        <li>
           It supports evolution by providing an effective means for learning and improvement.
        </li>
        <li>
           It aids process management and planning.
        </li>

        I don't understand how the solution balances the forces. I can define a process that offers no insight as to whether I'm doing what needs to be done.  That a process specifies that something be done doesn't mean it needs to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, how is the pattern different from: "how do I solve all my problems" for which the proposed answer is: "use a process"?
      </p>
      <p>
        Last, if Humphrey is the cited example of this pattern, isn't the context limited to academic simulations outside professional practice? -- <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Cope, I'd be very interested in your comments on Humphrey's work and proposals, specifically your thoughts on the extent to which they apply in professional environments.  Thanks - </em><a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a><em></em>

        I can see that this needs some work. Not only must the process be defined, but it must have a special quality that encourages people to apply it.  I don't think I have communicated this yet. I'm more interested in process than in organization. I have little power to change the organization I work in, but I do  have freedom to define and use my own personal software process. -- <a href="KentSchnaith.html">KentSchnaith</a>

      <p>
        How can we keep this pattern from leading to an ever-growing number of unmaintained and ignored lists of how to do things, ala, for example, <a href="IsoNineThousand.html">IsoNineThousand</a>?  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ron, you can't.  The nature of such defined processes is that they cope with change by adding more process.  There's usually not much meta-process there to eliminate wasteful process.  --</em><a href="ChristianEdwardGruber.html">ChristianEdwardGruber</a><em></em>
