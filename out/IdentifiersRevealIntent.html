        Name services after <em>what</em> they do, and postpone the <em>why</em> until the point of usage.  There's a great "a-ha" when you see "collatedCustomers = sortVectorAlphabetically(customers)" in the source;  the "a-ha" is lacking when you see just "collatedCustomers = collateCustomerNames(customers)".  If you want to abstract the "what", you should still have sortVectorAlphabetically for code reuse, and only redefine collateCustomerNames to not use it when change comes. -- <a href="PanuKalliokoski.html">PanuKalliokoski</a>

        The first recants its own internal implementation. Hint: Courageous programmers expect to replace implementation at the drop of a hat. The second advertises why you should call the function, thus promoting reuse.

        See <a href="IntentionRevealingSelector.html">IntentionRevealingSelector</a> for the original name of the pattern. <a href="IntentionRevealingNames.html">IntentionRevealingNames</a> is more general.

        <em>I think the naming above violates </em><a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> unnecessarily.  sortVect(v, cmp) is the model, collateCustomers(cust) is the view.<em> -- </em><a href="PanuKalliokoski.html">PanuKalliokoski</a> 13 May 2004

        <em>Now that I've reflected a little upon this, I've come to the conclusion that not only this violates </em><a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a>, it is also a major hindrance of code reuse.  People seem to confuse the <em>how</em> vs <em>what</em> question with <em>what</em> vs <em>why</em>.  Almost everybody agrees that you should not name things after <em>how</em> they do something.  But the above example does <strong>not</strong> say how the vector is sorted; it is not <em>how</em>, but <em>what</em> it does.  And this is a <strong>good</strong> naming principle.  Naming after the <em>why</em> (as the "good" identifier above) makes the service unusable elsewhere, because customer collating "owns" the name.<em></em>

        Name things after their intent. Do not name them after their 
        implementation. "Ordered_Set" is the intent; "sorted_vector" is the 
        implementation here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Name things with complete words, not ugly acronyms, if they have a scope 
        larger than a small block. Don't worry about typing them, or line length. 
        Learn to copy-n-paste quickly, and I'd keep a right column limit of 130 
        characters these days.
      </p>

        > What if the intent is to be a sorted vector? Is that still also the<br/>

      <p>
        Of course you intend to implement. But you have to defend the name, outside 
        the implementation, against the day when the implementation changes. It 
        could change to a map<>, or a fixed_map<>. If the name reveals the intent 
        (per Kent Beck's Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns) then those reading it 
        know more about how they can use it. "InterfaceOrientedProgramming" again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Telling them the implementation hints at how they can abuse it.

        I worked on a C++ project where another programmer needed a new class to represent an object that had as its principal members a state (enabled or disabled) and an object name (plus a few domain-specific operations on them).  Of all the names one could conceive for this class, I think "BoolStr" is probably the worst, and naturally, what he chose...
