        <strong>Q</strong> What is the name given by <a href="SapCorporation.html">SapCorporation</a> for its <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a> based product that will replace the legacy SAP R3? Is it MySap or NetWeaver? And where is a good weblink to get an overview and commentary made by Industry observers?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A</strong> Supposedly, "SAP <a href="NetWeaver.html">NetWeaver</a> is the technical foundation of mySAP Business Suite solutions, SAP xApps composite applications, partner solutions, and customer custom-built applications. It also enables Enterprise Services Architecture, SAP's blueprint for service-oriented business solutions."

        <strong>SAP R3 and beyond</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        SAP <a href="NetWeaver.html">NetWeaver</a> is actually the technology behind the mySAP ERP offering. SAP R3 itself was driven by "SAP Basis". There was an intermediate offering called "SAP R3 Enterprise" which has a Web application server engine at its heart that replaced the "SAP Basis". See a SAP Q & A at <a href="http://www.sapinsideronline.com/searchspi/search.htm?page=article&key=37900&query_text=mySAP+ERP">http://www.sapinsideronline.com/searchspi/search.htm?page=article&key=37900&query_text=mySAP+ERP</a> for a clarification with diagrams (circa 2004).
