        In the mid-to-late 50's, the Sage systems (AN/FSQ-7/8) had rooms full of real-time, graphic terminals (both vector and storage) with light guns and button panels, but no keyboards. I didn't work close enough with the CPU to know of any access beyond punched cards and register toggle switches. I don't remember any keyboard or tty access in the main computer room, although there were 024 card punches in other rooms that were on-line, in that they had a direct feed to the system. Mainly used as slow card readers, if I remember correctly. If there was something equivalent to a <a href="CommandLineInterface.html">CommandLineInterface</a>, I didn't see it.

        On that basis, could one argue that <a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a>s pre-dated <a href="CommandLineInterface.html">CommandLineInterface</a>s? --<a href="JimRussell.html">JimRussell</a>

        SAGE was part of the Whirlwind project, yes? See:

        From this page: In software, they pioneered use of real-time software; concepts that later evolved into assemblers, compilers, and interpreters; software diagnosis programs; time-shared operating systems; structured program modules; table-driven software; and data description techniques.
