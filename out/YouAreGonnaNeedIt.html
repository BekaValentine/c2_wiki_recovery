        Thanks to the original author! What you say makes perfect sense <em>as long as</em> we all know the meaning of quality. (In your text, you've used several rough synonyms for this as well as the specific term: 'more general', 'better', 'more potentially useful'.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Ahhhh, but there's the rub. Quality is terribly non-obvious. Your best guess at what quality is today is very likely to disagree with your best guess tomorrow, (let alone the difficulty of reaching agreement between two people or god forbid, fifty).
      </p>
      <p>
        We can read the heavy methodology books till the cows come home, and we *still* won't know what quality is. Each of these is chock-a-block with definitions.  I'm sure you can quote yours from your favorite methodology.  Unfortunately, they all have the feeling of the famous supreme court ruling on obscenity: I'm not sure what quality is, but I know it when I see it.
      </p>
      <p>
        XP doesn't per se define quality. Instead, we define a process <em>that we continuously evaluate and improve</em>. That process seems to pretty consistently create something that we agree is quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        YAGNI is a part, one part, of that process. -- <a href="MichaelHill.html">MichaelHill</a>

        Ah, quality. Quality, as Pirsig says, is what you like. To me, actually, quality is what the <em>customer</em> likes. That's why it's very questionable to work on something that isn't what the customer asked for - because your contract is to deliver what the customer likes. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> and <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a> are both predictive in nature.  The hypothetical "YouDoNeedIt" and "YouDontNeedIt" would be easier to sort out, if only a little easier. Quality resists precise definition, but there are acute moments when it or its absence is felt. These are moments of acceptance or rejection by the party whose reaction counts (whoever that is). Because software development takes time, these moments are always in the future, and so prediction cannot be eliminated. The difference between <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> and <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a> reminds me of the difference between speculating on stocks and speculating on their options. When you buy a stock, your loss is limited to your capital investment, while certain options carry unlimited liability. <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a>, unfortunately, is a tech stock option with an observable runaway characteristic. Here is a classic tradeoff between risk and reward. It's not that nobody should trade options. It's just that it's not child's play. One of the things that's truly extreme about our software development industry is the median age and experience metric, and it keeps going lower and lower. The techniques must fit the force using them. Sorry, kiddos.

        Isn't another driving force to purposefully leave functionality that can be documented and stubbed out now for future actual implementation? In other words, I may include in a method which the current scope of the object doesn't require. I do, however, see that for maximum flexibility, I may need that method. I stub it out, comment it for future maintenance, and probably label it non-public (so code doesn't accidently call it, and my public API isn't contaminated). -- <a href="MichaelSuzio.html">MichaelSuzio</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would avoid this practice. These stubs only cause confusion for later maintainers. Why is this stub here? What happens if I take it out? It is usually far easier to add new code than delete old code, so if you don't need it right now, don't spend any effort on it. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the stub can be added without breaking anything, then consider that <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> - you can add it later if you really do. If adding the stub would make a shared library incompatible with the programs that use it, then your customer includes the developers of those programs. Perhaps one <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> says "Updates to libfoo should be binary-compatible unless... [mitigating circumstances]." Then you have a case for adding a stub, but now it's an actual customer requirement, and you can still <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.

        An interesting example came up in an interview the other day. These people had never worked on a switch before. And no customer understood the issue as it's not obvious without experience. The issue is managing a rack of cards. The naive method is to only represent the inserted cards. It's only later that you realize you need to represent the slot and not only the card so it can be preconfigured and have an inserted/failed state, etc. It's only much later that you realize the need for proxies for things that may not exist at all. This is a common mistake. But it's also fundamental, like gravity. If you don't have these concepts in from the start you are sunk because they impact everything. And of course they were late and eventually failed. The head guy argued, "You aren't gonna need it, so why bother?" Under the self-protecting rules of XP I'm sure there is some reason why these people should have known this or reacted better, but it's usually not that

      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know about a pattern per se, but I certainly know about limiting the scope of planning for reuse. Embedded systems is self-limiting in this respect anyway, since one piece of hardware may be wildly different from another one in both operation and substrate. Of course I look for patterns to replicate: user interface, motion/process control, real world feedback, etc. Often, though, the client says, "Look. This thing is going to be a widget. Just a widget, only a widget, always a widget, never anything other than a widget. Build me a widget, and I mean like right now."
      </p>
      <p>
        I have to respect that. Even when the project is to build a (sic) platform for other products there is a limitation on the projected use of the platform. "This new widget is going to be a pump controller. That's all. It might be a syringe pump. It might be a systaltic pump. It might be a high volume pump. It might pump blood. It might pump saline. It might pump plasma. The only thing we know for sure is that it's gonna be a pump."
      </p>
      <p>
        This tells me that I need to plan for reuse of my software system in the context of being a pump, not a general motion controller or a radar direction finder or a navigational aid or a fire control center. The damn thing is a pump. With this limitation in mind I can ask questions about how pumps might be configured, how they might be used, and what kind of flexibility I need to design into my system. But when that's all done I end up with the design for a pump, and that's what I build.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>later...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As an extension to this blather, let me tell you about a little subsystem problem I had with this same pump project. Another engineer -- brilliant guy, designed almost the entire motion system from a clean white sheet of paper -- created a CPU-to-CPU communication subsystem for Master to Safety linkage. [Note: most Class II and above medical systems have <em>at least</em> two processors so that there is independent confirmation that a treatment is being delivered correctly.] He Did The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work, and it did - for about three minutes. His approach (which had to be implemented on both CPUs, of course) involved a round robin, fixed time slot kind of messaging scheme with just a handful of message types being sent back and forth. Rather than deal with complex messages he ignored them. We didn't need them at the time. Rather than deal with outstanding messages awaiting response he ignored them. We didn't need them at the time. Rather than deal with the critical timing and latency issues involving extended message sizes he ignored them. We didn't need them at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we had to add another message type.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole messaging subsystem collapsed because it couldn't handle any of the requirements of handling <strong>one more message type</strong>. I had to ashcan all of his work and start from scratch to get the Master and Safety talking again. I had to create a messaging scheme to handle not only the message types I knew we had but also the ones I could extrapolate from our projected usage. Had this been done originally a whole boatload of code need not have been wiped clean and redesigned from both the Master and Safety devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this was <em>not</em> a case of goal posts shifting. Anybody could have projected the need for complex message types in M-S comm by pretty lightweight analysis of the tasks being coordinated between the two processors. In this case the <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> approach flunked miserably. <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> was a falsehood; we were gonna need it, and did. I suffered the consequences. The Next Time I'll Know Better(tm).

        <em>It reads as though you've misinterpreted what "work" means. Ignoring things that are known to be required is not at all what YAGNI recommends. Furthermore, "I need to add a feature, so I'll ditch all the existing code" misses several quite crucial points about professional software development</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps you didn't see the part where I said the comm system <strong>simply couldn't support</strong> the "additional" functionality required by the continuing development of the device. You are correct in that the statement at the top of this page applies here. The "simplest" comm functionality was only good for the simple testing of subsystems that had been done until I started implementing actual, real, verifiable, FDA-approvable safety processing. <em>That's</em> when the little bugger showed its flaws, and that's when I had to scratch it and start over. And start over I did, because nothing from the original mechanism was salvageable. Believe me, I would have reused the code if I could. That just wasn't possible. -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>

        What if you're integrating a large subsystem which has a huge number of set requirements. For example, say W3C would not allow you to publish a web-browser unless it adhered fully to the CSS2.0 standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        My previous experience with such a system has shown that the entire integration will take at least six months and involve both core functionality integration and a lot of GUI work. In my specific case it's a matter of "implement all this, or you aren't allowed to utilize the subsystem". The rules are set by a third party providing the subsystem services, not by the customer nor the team. The customer wishes for the system to be integrated and in effect we *know* we have to implement support for all the required features, or drop it completely. Would it still be wise to adhere to <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> at all times, when it's quite possible to make decisions that prepares for the known requirements? If the feature is suddenly cut, we'd know we have to rip it all out regardless of how long it took to get as far as we did, so losing time is not really an issue, or?

        Both Marty's and Andreas's examples don't fall under the YAGNI category. Andreas's is easiest: the business W3C requirement calls for full CSS2.0 implementation. Hence it's a requirement, and all features must go in. Now it's just a question of the <a href="ReleasePlan.html">ReleasePlan</a>. Marty's example falls under the case of inadequate analysis of the system. A proper analysis would have discovered the need for complex messages to be sent -- and I see nothing in XP to preclude a proper analysis of the system. -- <a href="AmirKolsky.html">AmirKolsky</a>

        I believe that we may be mixing two different concepts, "delivery of software for use" and "internal builds."  Delivery is usually based on factors outside the developers' control.  For example, a "delivery" may be required for an actual sale, a sales demonstration, a trade show, an internal budget review, or putting the project on hold.  These can be accomplished with working software even if it does not have all of the "requirements."  Each "internal build," however, should have a tightly controlled requirements set.  It is difficult enough to get everything selected done in a 1 - 3 week cycle without adding anything else to the mix.  The cycle is short enough, though, it is not painful to defer an idea to the start of the next cycle.  The new idea can be evaluated on equal footing with all previous unimplemented ideas at that time.  The idea is that it is better to have a small set of fully functional capabilities (nearly at all times) than to have a large set of partially functional capabilities.  The development team needs to stay tightly focused on completing "internal builds" so that when a "delivery" is requested by an external force, the new software is never more than 1 - 3 weeks from being ready and the old software is never more than 1 - 3 weeks out of date.  Anyone who has ever struggled to get broken software working in time for a trade show or key customer demonstration can appreciate working only on the minimal set requirements to get the job done, at any single point in time.  -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

        I think it is a matter of probability and your estimating ability. One has to weigh the pros and cons of adding "future-proofing features" with a business mentality, as one would with any other investment. Will the effort pay off? When will it pay off? How good are you at estimating future payoffs, etc. If you are in uncharted waters, lean toward Yagni. <a href="DecisionMathAndYagni.html">DecisionMathAndYagni</a>

        There's one trap in the case when you're extending code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Say you have a programme that does X,
        Now you want the programme to also be able to do (at least) also Y.
        X and Y both have common functionality f, plus some unique code x or y respectively.
        (ie. it could be implemented as f+x and f+y, so that f+x+y will give you what you want.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Your next step should now be rewrite X as f+x and test. 
        The programme will be more complex , but should do exactly the same as before. 
        Finally, extend the programme to f+x+y and test again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem occurs if your code remains in the f+x state for longer periods of time. This could happen for instance if you are still busy fulfilling some other prerequisites for y, or if you get called away to do something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, someone else might come along and state that YouArentGonnaNeed f to do X properly, and will refactor f+x back to X, leaving you back where you started. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I've experienced a case where someone refactored code back like this very aggressively, basically making it very hard to do any extentions at all. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In a more limited sense, it is useful to write code *slightly* more general than that you're going to need it. Don't overdo it, but a little more generality gives your code a bit of a sticky 'feel' to it, so that it's easier to combine with other bits of code. Overly agressive <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> leaves your code 'feeling' smooth with no easily visible paths to extention or aggregation.

        Kindly don't flame me, I never coded much more than simple basic and only spent about three minutes reading this page, but isn't YAGNI what got us into the y2k mess, people assuming they never needed to scale timeframes beyond 15-20 years? Even if you don't plan for YAGNI to lock you into something, sometimes time has a way of its own. -- anonymous coward

        <em>Nope, we're talking about Yagni as it applies to code design, not to requirements.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, now how do we separate the two? How do you distinguish between them? Where does requirement end and coding "discovery" begin? We can't apply glib answers to complex questions, even with 20/20 hindsight.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do I need a date manager class, should dates be immutable value objects, can I get away with a double?  These are design quesions covered by Yagni.  Do we need to save the space the first two digits of the year uses, do we need to print dates in ISO format?  These are requirements which are specified by the customer (albeit, the space is probably indirectly specified by a customer's cost/hardware requirements).  Yagni doesn't apply to those.  Sorry if I was glib, I was somewhat ticked by by the eraser phrase and the conmplete lack of capitalization in the sentence; I assumed if the person didn't even take the time to write well, he probably didn't think about the question enough to warrant more than a terse answer.</em> .

        Perhaps it is worthwhile saying that with a <a href="BondageAndDisciplineLanguage.html">BondageAndDisciplineLanguage</a>, one does not necessarily have the luxury of being able to refactor easily; with that constraining environment, painting oneself into a corner ends up being <em>very</em> expensive. -- AndreThenot

        How so? Can you name one? What is the definition of now versus later? For example, before/after listing requirements, after release, etc. Please specify.

        <dd>I'll bite. I generally adhere fairly strictly to YAGNI, but one area in which I do not is I18N of display text. I always wrap all display text in I18N functions from the start, regardless of whether there's a defined requirement for multiple languages.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Why? Because this is one of the few things that really does get harder to change as the codebase grows. If I internationalize later, then it's very, very hard to make sure that I haven't missed a string somewhere, and I don't see how to write effective tests to check. Setting up I18N at the beginning, and enforcing the discipline to wrap all strings in appropriate functions, involves a small amount of overhead up front, but in this case, the overhead early in the project is much less than the cost of a later change.</dd>

        <dd>Note that because I tend to write end-user applications, and mostly Web applications at that, I can be almost sure in most cases that I18N will be a worthwhile feature to have, as I hope that people from all over the world will be able to use my software.

        <strong>Tough Decisions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider you are developing a website based on text files. The site will grow with time, but for now it is fairly small.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a> (maybe, maybe).
      </p>
      <p>
        Your gonna need a database, eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question is.. can you develop the site without the database and then merge the text files into the DB later? Or should you go right ahead and do the database from the start?
      </p>
      <p>
        It's always not a clear answer... sometimes <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a> and sometimes <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, but <em>will</em> (possibly, maybe) later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually it is a matter of compromising. If you are familiar with the <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> thing in question, you might start off with it if it doesn't take <em>that much</em> extra time to use the <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> thing. This goes against the <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> philosophy, but it also allows you to learn about the bigger longer term solution right off the bat.. rather than developing two separate solutions.. one dumb simple one first, and a more advanced but separate and incompatible solution later.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the two solutions (<a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a> and <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>) can be merged.. then the final long term solution (compromise) is better off.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, many web startup companies fail.. and buy too much stuff.. three servers, dedicated hosting.. <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> until you get big. Design the first solution in a way that it is merge-able (into the <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a> solution) later. That way, if <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> right away, at least you have a half cooked plan in mind so that if <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a> later, at least there are possibilities of making a big long term solution work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A partner and I are facing this right now. We're developing an online automated vehicle location system that needs to record the movement of a substantial number of vehicles for each user (fleet operator). When we were first talking about it we thought we might whip up something that could operate with flat files or XML records or some such, but it quickly became obvious that if we don't implement some databases </em>right now<em> then we'll be eating a huge quantity of labor later on trying to retrofit it.

        <strong>Decisions Take Too Much Time</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider throw away programs... some of my throw away programs end up being refactored into long term libraries. Instead of throwing away your throw away programs because you think <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, keep them - hard drive space is cheap. When <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a> at least you have it there (and some throw away programs can act as test cases even though you might not have thought they would be useful).
      </p>
      <p>
        It also takes a lot of time you consider whether or not <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a>.. so if it takes less time to just declare that YoureGonnaNeedIt some time.. then keep it: <em>especially if the cost of keeping it is really low</em> and <em>especially if it saves you time just making the decision to keep/do it</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes there is really no way to know if <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a> until you <a href="JustDoIt.html">JustDoIt</a> and feel the situation out.
      </p>
