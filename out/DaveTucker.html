        <em>moved from Goate Man.</em> Don't ask were I got that Nickname.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is there A Question Mark beside Goate Man above?
        I am a newbie. Help is wanted!
        Hi there!

        <em>The question mark link is because you didn't have an "e" in it, and there is no page yet spelt like that.</em>
