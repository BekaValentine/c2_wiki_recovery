        Geodesic Sphere
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="BuckminsterFuller.html">BuckminsterFuller</a> championed the use of spheres and domes for construction of dwellings and other structures.  He said that those shapes have several benefits over the rectangular building shapes commonly in use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The shape of a sphere minimizes the amount of surface area for the enclosed volume.  This minimizes the weight and cost of the materials necessary to construct it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Minimizing surface area also minimizes the amount of heat exchange between the inside and outside.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Construction of a sphere/dome from uniform pieces is simpler and more efficient than constructions that have different kinds of pieces (corners, sides, etc.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A dome is very stable and sturdy.  It handles wind and rain well.  Modern tents are modeled on this principle.  Also Antarctic base stations are geodesic to handle the high winds.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When the sun heats the surface of a dome or sphere, it causes air to rise upward along the surface.  Thus, the sun alone can drive a ventilation system for the inside of the structure, drawing air out from the bottom and in from the top.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Due to all of the above, large spheres are warmer on the inside than on the outside. Since the construction of spheres has no scaling limits, a sphere a half-mile wide is actually lighter than air. So large <a href="GeodesicSphere.html">GeodesicSphere</a>s are the way to build <a href="FloatingCities.html">FloatingCities</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>But:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Most factories/mills that produce "uniform pieces" produce <strong>rectangular</strong> pieces. Cutting them to shape wastes both time and materials.  <em>Could that be solved by retooling?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Geodesic spheres are impossible to expand.  <em>I had an idea for a hemispherical city built like an onion.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No they're not. Build overlapping domes and make clusters:

      </p>
      <p>
        Or try <a href="TruncatedOctahedron.html">TruncatedOctahedron</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or use zomes:

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In small geodesic spheres, the tightly curved walls lead to wasted space. (Think of a rectangular couch against a curved wall.)  <em>Ah, but why is your couch rectangular?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's hard to seal the angled joints, which leads to leaks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The spherical shape distributes sound efficiently. If one person snores, they wake everyone else.  <em>Good for an auditorium then.  And I'd want </em>InternalWalls between bedrooms anyway.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The spherical shape distributes light efficiently. If someone woken by the snorer turns on a reading lamp, the whole dome lights up.  <em>Ever heard of </em>DarkCurtains?<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Put the dome inside your house for its structural strength as a central dining/meeting/observatory/greenhouse/atrium room. Hang the other rooms on it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (Some of these disadvantages come from <a href="StewartBrand.html">StewartBrand</a>'s <em></em><a href="HowBuildingsLearn.html">HowBuildingsLearn</a><em>, others from experience.)</em>
