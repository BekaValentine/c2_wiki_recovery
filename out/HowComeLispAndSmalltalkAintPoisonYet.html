        How Come Lisp And Smalltalk Aint Poison Yet
      </h1>
      <p>
        As lamented on <a href="AllPanaceasBecomePoison.html">AllPanaceasBecomePoison</a>, part of what poisons a language is that if it's got any real power it soon grows <a href="ExtremelyInterstrangled.html">ExtremelyInterstrangled</a>. Well, political woes aside, that doesn't seem to have happened to lisp and smalltalk. How come?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I suggest it has to do with the </em><a href="SymmetryOfLanguage.html">SymmetryOfLanguage</a> of these two.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the <a href="SymmetryOfLanguage.html">SymmetryOfLanguage</a> factor is required, but not sufficient.  There is a another, deeper reason:  Lisp is, at its core, a syntax designed to work with a simple but powerful computational model.  (Smalltalk and Forth seem to be similar in this regard - I know Lisp better, but I know enough of Smalltalk and Forth to see this property).  The fundamental model of Lisp (or its "design center", as referred to on <a href="AllPanaceasBecomePoison.html">AllPanaceasBecomePoison</a>) is right there, in your face, with every single statement/expression you write.  You can't lose sight of it, or drift away from it, and still be able to use the language.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm guessing that everyone who seriously uses Lisp, Smalltalk, and Forth knows how they work, and understands that any significant tinkering with it will result in a very different language.  Therefore, there is and likely always will be a clearly articulated and generally accepted design center for these languages.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding <a href="SymmetryOfLanguage.html">SymmetryOfLanguage</a> to this then allows any programmer to extend these languages' libraries as he sees fit, and to use his extensions just like the stuff that's already built-in.  Therefore, the libraries change and grow, but the language syntax (being just a representation of the underlying computational model) never really has to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is one other language I know of that has this "thin layer of syntax over simple computational model" sort of feel -- <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>.  C has been around a long time, and has not been poisoned as quickly as C++, Perl, etc.  I think this is because C's design center is well known -- portable assembler for a Von Neumann-like architecture.  C's main problems (in this regard) are that it doesn't have good <a href="SymmetryOfLanguage.html">SymmetryOfLanguage</a>, and that its computational model is not fully specified (e.g. different size ints on different computers...).
