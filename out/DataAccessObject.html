        <a href="DataAccessObject.html">DataAccessObject</a> is a native <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> object model shipped with <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been superseded by <a href="ActivexDataObject.html">ActivexDataObject</a>, which is more suited for communicating with server databases.

        It's also a pattern for accessing RDBMS information, expounded on the Sun J2EE website <<a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/DataAccessObject.html">http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/DataAccessObject.html</a>>.

        This page isn't quite right: the MS API is called DataAccessObjects: note the pluralisation. I propose that except for a note redirecting the reader towards the appropriate page, this page concentrate on the pattern rather than the similarly named API. -- KeithGaughan

        Another example of this design pattern is the recommendations in the book 'Hibernate In Action'.
        DAO is certainly not a Microsoft-specific thing.

        Is it wrong to use the term <a href="DataAccessObject.html">DataAccessObject</a> generally for a specific implementation of the <a href="CaretakerPattern.html">CaretakerPattern</a>, where DAO is the object used to hide the concrete implementation of how the data is stored (database, files, cloud, whatever) from the application?
