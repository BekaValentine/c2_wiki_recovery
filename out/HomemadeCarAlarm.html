        Homemade Car Alarm
      </h1>
      <p>
        The car alarm activated all vehicle lights and air horns.  It lasted a few weeks until it spontaneously
        went off in the middle of the night. It was never used
        again. Of course, very sophisticated off-the-shelf car
        alarms are common these days.

        The car never caught fire; that's a different story...
