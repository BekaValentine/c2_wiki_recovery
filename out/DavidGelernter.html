      <p>
        Professor of computer science at Yale. Dr Gelernter's work on parallel programming, artificial intelligence, and information management has heavily influenced many of today's current generation tools; the programming language called "Linda" is used worldwide for parallel programming, and the central idea behind <a href="LindaLanguage.html">LindaLanguage</a> (<a href="TupleSpace.html">TupleSpace</a> or <a href="GenerativeCommunication.html">GenerativeCommunication</a>), now forms the basis of the "<a href="JavaSpaces.html">JavaSpaces</a>" extension to Java being developed by Sun Microsystems.

        <em>Interestingly, his last named means "more learned".</em>
        In what language? 
      </p>
      <p>
        In German, although practical applications of this word (as in "a more learned lesson") have yet to be found. -- KonradAnton (from Germany)
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps a better translation would just be "learned", "skilled" or "educated" rather than "more learned". <em>Er ist gelernter Mechaniker.</em> -- BorisMagocsi (also from Germany)
      </p>

        <em>If reading his books you should be prepared for unexpected, rather jarring side trips into Prof. Gelernter's right-wing political opinions in the middle of technical discussions. It was disconcerting until I got used to skipping over them.</em>
