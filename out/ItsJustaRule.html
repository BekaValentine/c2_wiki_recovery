        Its Justa Rule
      </h1>
      <p>
        The phrase <em>It's Just a A Rule</em> is dismissive and often used as an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> by those who would reject all kinds of rules. <a href="RulesAreMadeToBeBroken.html">RulesAreMadeToBeBroken</a> is a similar kind of notion. That is not to say that we shouldn't break the rules sometimes, maybe even a lot and <a href="ColorOutsideTheLines.html">ColorOutsideTheLines</a>. But before breaking a rule, do two things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Know why the rule is a rule in the first place i.e. <a href="KnowTheRule.html">KnowTheRule</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Make sure that the reason you are <a href="BreakingTheRules.html">BreakingTheRules</a> is justified <a href="ForGoodCause.html">ForGoodCause</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A ball team has plays and patterns that help players know where the other players are and will be. A software team needs to know as well, and rules help with this.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a rule is bad or has exceptions, we come back to the group and get it revised or rescinded [<a href="OldRulesWithOutdatedForces.html">OldRulesWithOutdatedForces</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
        Until then, being sure we know how people will behave is part of what helps us go fast. Rules are meant to be absolute; if a rule blocks progress then the <em>rule</em> needs work. Think about it this way: People have rules; Nature has laws. If there is a rule about wearing a pressure suit before entering the airlock then you can damn well be sure that Nature will enforce that rule sooner or later with a law.
