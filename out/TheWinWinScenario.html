        The Win Win Scenario
      </h1>
      <p>
        Whenever you deal with other people in any way at all, this is the kind of situation you want to have. In the Win-Win scenario, <em>both</em> parties gain <em>more</em> than they would otherwise have gained. It's not a matter of all sides reaching a happy compromise; it's a matter of all sides "winning."
      </p>
      <p>
        You want to benefit from dealing with other people, because otherwise such dealing will bring you only pain and, ultimately, destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also want other people to benefit from dealing with you; this keeps them coming back, so you can benefit from them again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating and maintaining an instance of this scenario is fundamental to all co-operation between people, especially business. If you want to gain people's co-operation, you have to expect them to want to win, and you have to be able to explain to them why their co-operation with you will allow them to win, and indeed win them more than they would win otherwise. Honesty is a <em>must</em> because people can be expected to check this stuff.

        See <a href="PrisonersDilemma.html">PrisonersDilemma</a> and Axelrod's book mentioned therein for a formal treatment of this assertion.

        The Moonies have a similar concept called "The action of giving and receiving" (Korean: soo-soo-ja-gyung), or more simply, <a href="GiveAndTake.html">GiveAndTake</a>. However, this, by itself, isn't quite <a href="WinWin.html">WinWin</a>. <a href="WinWin.html">WinWin</a> requires that both parties get more than they give in the exchange. <a href="WinWin.html">WinWin</a> is only possible in non-zero sum interactions. Fortunately, most real-world interactions are not <a href="ZeroSum.html">ZeroSum</a>.

        Side note: When this was being refactored, the refactorer had surprising difficulty finding terms for the Win-Win scenario that don't assume that some side loses. For example, the term "winning" suggests that somebody loses. This suggests to me that the concept of Win-Lose is deeply ingrained in our thought processes (note the <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>), making Win-Win difficult to penetrate our beliefs.

        One easy to grasp version of this is to remember that different people value different things. I may be discarding an old motorbike with torn seats, rusty metal, and a failing engine. The guy who drives by, sees it on my lawn, and decides it's just the thing for him to fix up for his son to ride, offers me $10 for it. I get $10 for a piece of trash; he gets a functioning motorbike for $10... we both win.

        There must be other non-zero-sum transactions, too. Here are the ones I could think of...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Different people value things differently (from above)
        </li>
        <li>
           Division of labor (you hunt, I gather, and we share)
        </li>
        <li>
           Humans usually Specialize in their Skills and Needs. So: finding out what the other party values is especially important.
        </li>
        <li>
           Contributing to (and drawing from) a common pool of something that does not deplete with use
          <ul>
            <li>
               (e.g. wiki, open-source software, a playground)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        Every uncoerced human interaction is a <a href="WinWin.html">WinWin</a> scenario. Why would someone voluntarily enter into a trade that they didn't get more than they gave up?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ever read Shakespeare? Deception, betrayal, power, folly. Happens all the time.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Deception:</strong> Deception is one way to coerce another person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Betrayal:</strong> Betrayal is just a form of deception and therefore coercive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Power:</strong> If that power is used to force the other person into a trade, then coercion once again... 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Folly:</strong> Just because you think a decision is foolish doesn't mean the either of the two parties to the transaction value it the same way. What makes <em>you</em> right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Your definition of coercion doesn't jive with my expectations. You buy a lemon of a car because the salesman convinced you it was a good buy. Were you coerced? Not by most people's usage of the word. Your boss asks you to work overtime on a project that's doomed to fail. You don't have to but it will look bad if you don't. Are you being coerced?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Agreed that the definition of coercion is slippery. Certainly a gun pointed to your head is coercion. I think it's equally clear that a salesman convincing you to buy a lemon is not coercion so long as he is not lying to you. Between these two poles, there is a gray area that needs to be cleared up. I don't think anybody is going to argue that </em>'any<em>' consequence to an action or inaction consitutes coercion. I personally believe that it's a function of the violence quotient of the consequence and the availability of alternatives. From a legal point of view, one could argue that that determining the level of coercion in a dispute is a function that juries should provide.</em>
