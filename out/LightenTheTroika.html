        Lighten The Troika
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="LightenTheTroika.html">LightenTheTroika</a> is an alias for <a href="ScapeGoat.html">ScapeGoat</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This alias refers to the image of a sled, drawn by three horses (hence, a "troika"), being pursued by wolves. The passengers of the troika elect that one of their number be thrown to the wolves, in hopes that the rest might escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        This alias is useful for two reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It connotes the relative arbitrariness of the election:  the guilt or innocence of the victim does not come into play.
        </li>
        <li>
           It points up the fact that the "solution" is really only a temporizing measure: unless some other factor intervenes, the wolves <em>will</em> be back. 
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>Why don't the stupid bastards sacrifice one of the horses?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You really want to stop the sled to unhitch one of the horses?  <em>(And -- horses can run faster than </em>'you<em>'.)</em>  Any way you look at it, attempting to sacrifice a horse is a sure-fire way to get yourself eaten by the wolves.  -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You kill the horse, of course. Dead horses can't run very fast at all. I presume you haven't sacrificed your sword. Anyway, it wouldn't be such a cool painting if they did it right. Never mind.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Two live horses can't run very fast when they're still harnessed to a dead one.  If they weren't already spooked by the wolves, they're almost certainly going to lose it when you kill one of their number.  Would you be silly enough to attempt to throw the exhaust manifold from your snowmobile to the wolves?

        But seriously - once upon a time, Teamster was a skilled occupation.  Horses, unlike cars, are expert-friendly.  That's why we all drive cars now.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The first cars, like horses and early computers, were temperamental enough that one hired people to take care of them and make them do what was asked.
        </li>
        <li>
           The next generation of cars was meant to be owned by people who would deal with them themselves, but one still had to know things such as the proper way to crankstart the engine, lest one's wrist be broken.
        </li>
        <li>
           The current generation of cars feature "turnkey" operation.  However, YouStillNeedToAddGas.  My <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a> is much like my car in this respect; but the laptop is stuck in the previous generation...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I'm not a Teamster, but my guess would be that you're supposed to cut the dead horse loose and drive on. That's what the Teamsters probably did with Hoffa -</em>

        BlackAdder has nothing to do with Monty Python.  Except of course that they're both excellent British comedy.

        Stein likened "the administration...[to] a Russian family fleeing over the snow in a horse-drawn troika pursued by wolves. Every once in a while they threw a baby out to slow down the wolves, hoping thereby to gain enough time for most of the family to reach safety...."
