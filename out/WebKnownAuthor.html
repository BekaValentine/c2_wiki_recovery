      <p>
        A website provides the opportunity for a person to come into contact with people of various cultures, ethnicities, and other differentiating characteristics, and to learn from the experience. A person gains the most from such a contact if they feel they have "met the mind" of the author in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore: Each page of a website should strongly reflect the author's personality and interests (whether the author is an individual, a company, or an interest group).  It should be immediately clear on each page of a website who the author is, and each page should provide an obvious method for contacting the author. It should not be possible to reach a "dead page" with no apparent author, no personality, and no one to contact.
