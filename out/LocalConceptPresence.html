        Local Concept Presence
      </h1>
      <p>
        ...you are doing the physical design of
        a system and must allocated objects to
        computing contexts.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>There is a tradeoff between redundancy and locality.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Object-oriented design makes it possible to create a single locus for all concerns relating to a single concept. For example, a single phone call has a replicated presence at each endpoint of the call.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could put all of the intelligence and state in a centralized object and use <a href="RemoteProxy.html">RemoteProxy</a> as a kind of facade that hides the centralization. However, that forces every method to use a <a href="RemoteProcedureCall.html">RemoteProcedureCall</a> (except for the original instance), and that is cumbersome and inefficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Create a copy of specific, named object</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>in each context where business rules dictate</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>the object should have a presence.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can do this by cloning an original object and moving it to the context where it is lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in a telephony system you can clone the Call object to represent the interests of the Call in each of the contexts where it is relevant (e.g., different local switching systems).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This use of cloning is an almost naive application of object-oriented principles to the problem of providing local access to an object. I can think of this practice as being little different from instantiating an object where
        it is needed, in the simple sense of straight forward object-based programming. What distinguishes <a href="LocalConceptPresence.html">LocalConceptPresence</a> from simple instantiation is that the two instances represent the same concept by convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach is an alternative to <a href="RemoteProxy.html">RemoteProxy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The configuration results in one interface for each computing context. For more on the management of these interfaces and how they interact with object state, use <a href="AutonomousCopy.html">AutonomousCopy</a> and <a href="SymmetricalReference.html">SymmetricalReference</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> Why wouldn't it be cleaner and easier to understand if you had a </em>CallMaker and CallReceiver object in the correct place? If you cross context boundaries, aren't you generally crossing a logical boundary as well? -- <a href="JeffBay.html">JeffBay</a> <em></em>
      </p>

        [If the data is cloned, then we're talking about caching, so it's odd to me that the word doesn't appear. If it's not cloned, but location is adaptive, then it's DataMigration.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [The Internet itself relies on a fairly complex scheme; the name of convenience is translated via a hierarchy of DNS servers (which are approximately single rooted but with mirrored roots) into a logical address, which is translated piecemeal to a physical address en route in a dynamical adaptive fashion by routing protocols. This is a real tour de force.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [The Internet is in fact an instance of the same topic, but clearly not what you had in mind, so a tighter statement of the domain is in order.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="DistributedTransaction.html">DistributedTransaction</a>s have a bearing on this as well, although the general topic may either cache or migrate depending on business needs -- usually migrate.]
