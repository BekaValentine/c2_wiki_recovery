        Bad News Needs To Travel Faster Than Good News
      </h1>
      <p>
        Common sense if you think about it.  XP appears to support this.  <a href="GoodNews.html">GoodNews</a> needs to be the norm (all the tests passed), rather than <a href="BadNews.html">BadNews</a> (the build is broken).  Unfortunately, many of us have worked in shops where the inverse is true.  --<a href="SalvatoreSferrazza.html">SalvatoreSferrazza</a>

        <em>Doesn't this assume a conservative culture in which no news means no change?  On a high risk project that's frantically searching solution space for something that works, good news needs to travel fast, too.</em>

        I think the travelling at issue is more up the management chain and to other divisions working on related projects, than among teammats working closely together.
