        Tradition Overrides Proof
      </h1>
      <p>
        It is just too hard to produce an <a href="SimpleProof.html">SimpleProof</a> of why a particular approach is better, lets just say it is better because it is what someone alse we trust told us, lets follow tradition, simple proofs are just too hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe we can extract a law from this, something like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As the size of the text describing (or the amount of experience required to understand) the Proof (or ObjectiveEvidence) increases, the likeness of it becoming a Tradition increases too.
        </li>
      </ul>
