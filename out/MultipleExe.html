        Multiple Exe
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MultipleExe.html">MultipleExe</a>'s in a 'stand alone' 
        Its sort of pattern.

           I'm a lone (VB6)programmer, so not a professional like the people who work in a team for a big firm, still it makes sense. 
        </li>

           Problem. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I think up something, start with a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>, next the program grows and grows, <strong>eventually I get lost.</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        This problem is caused mainly by the size of the program combined with lack of good architecture). 
      </p>

           Solution 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Now I found a good solution: <strong>multiple exe's.</strong> 
        E.g. If the program generates a lot of data and you want to show this in some graphics, or you want to analyse a datafile and show it in a grid, you can write a graphicsViewer.exe and a gridAnalyser.exe that are called by the mainApp. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This standalones in themselves are much smaller, so its easy to understand and maintain the code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The only problem now is to make the different exe's communicate in a good way. 
        Probably a lot of smart people have handled this communication among different programs in a real smart way, and you may even find a lot on this subject elsewhere in this wiki. (So If you have any good or bad experiences with multiple exes please add yout tips and comments) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow: I handle all communications among different exe's this way: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Call an addOn with a command$ to pass information. (see <a href="ShellCall.html">ShellCall</a>) 
        I also add a timer to every addOn, to look into a multiple file every second 
      </p>
      <p>
        This mutilple file has a few key.value pairs , I use just two Subs. (You'll have to write the code yourself): 
      </p>
      <code>
        Call writeSettingsTo (key, value, mutualFile) <br/>
        Call readSettingsFrom (key, mutualFile) <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        E.g I can close an addOn by the mainApp 
      </p>
      <code>
        in mainApp: <br/>
        writeSettings ("end", "true", mutualFile) <br/>
        in addOn: <br/>
        If readSettings ("end", mutualFile) = "true" then <br/>
        call writeSettings ("end", "false", mutualFile) <br/>
        end <br/>
        end if <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Other informations can also be passed by this mutiple file, but best you pass as little as possible, as all communications make it harder to understand thew programs.

        <strong>Advantages</strong> 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Missing addOn. If an addOn is missing, then the mainApp will still run. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Bugs. If you do not add code to the main program but to an addOn.exe then a bug in the addOn will not crash the main program. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Complexity. Whenever you try to solve a problem with just try and error writing code, you will not get mixed up, as the code is a separate exe, still you can use it right away as an addOn to the mainApp. Later, if you find a very simple concise solution you can also cut and paste it into the mainApp. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           MultiThreading. They say multiThreading isn't possible in VB6 (well, what's so good about multiThreading on a simple PC is not clear to me anyhow), but every addOn to the mainApp will have a thread of its own. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           I'm not good is abstract thinking, I want to see and know whats going on before I understand, so I think <a href="MultipleExe.html">MultipleExe</a>'s a very clear and easy solution. Other people may be different so they may look upon me as a blacksmith forging iron in the fire. So it may not be a general solution, but it works out fine with me.

        This sounds to me like the philosophy behind the various Unices...
