        Cost Of Change Curve
      </h1>
      <p>
        In normal phased development, the cost to make a change (e.g.
        fix a defect) rises exponentially as the phases progress.
        This is a good argument for doing a lot of work to make sure
        you leave the current phase with a product that's as close
        to perfect as you can make it.
      </p>
      <p>
        XP argues that you can use the advances made in software
        technology to flatten the cost curve, and that this underwrites
        many otherwise risky practices.
