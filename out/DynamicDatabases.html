        Dynamic Databases
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am interested in the idea of dynamic databases. These are databases that tend to be free-form, have dynamically expandable "cells", dynamic schemas, and can represent complex graphs well if need be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Zog database (see <a href="WikiWikiOrigin.html">WikiWikiOrigin</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="MultiParadigmDatabase.html">MultiParadigmDatabase</a> ("dynamic relational" or "predicate database")
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hierarchical file systems with optional cross-links
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I don't know if text indexing systems fully count. A database generally has well-defined "cells" or containers. Text indexing generally focuses on content and proximity rather than deal with well-defined contains outside of "document".
      </p>

        Perhaps a better name for this topic would be DynamicDbms. But, I don't really like it because it is harder to read in wiki form. Vote?
