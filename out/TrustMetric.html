        Trust Metric
      </h1>
      <p>
        The original meaning of "trust metric" is from the <a href="PublicKeyInfrastructure.html">PublicKeyInfrastructure</a> world. The literature is littered with papers proposing one trust metric or another. None of them work very well. In fact, building a <a href="PublicKeyInfrastructure.html">PublicKeyInfrastructure</a> with any kind of robustness or trustworthiness is a very hard problem, perhaps even destined to be a FailedDream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two other concepts related to the classical sense of "trust metric" may be relevant: MattBlaze's PolicyMaker system for evaluating trust assertions in a distributed setting, and the <a href="WebOfTrust.html">WebOfTrust</a> from PrettyGoodPrivacy. The latter is <em>not</em> set up for any kind of automatic evaluation, incidentally, which confuses people, because most everything else is.

        When I created <a href="AdvoGato.html">AdvoGato</a> (in part to test out the spiffy new trust metrics I had designed for my original goal of building a better PKI), I adopted the phrase "trust metric" without modification, even though what it actually measures is quite different. In the case of <a href="AdvoGato.html">AdvoGato</a>, it is used simply to determine membership in a community, in this case the community of <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that I'm seeing it applied to other areas such as <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a>'s moderation is rather interesting from a memetics point of view :)

        <dd>[Marketing tripe follows] Most of this wiki is methodology/software engineering. All of <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> is online culture and community. But the real difference to you would be a larger audience and bigger database here versus a more focused audienced, less entrenched feel there. Also, technically, <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> is setup better for certain kinds of discussion. We have RFC links and Cliff recently added the Advogato "<a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a>" link. Anyway, as always, pick the funnest. -- ss</dd>
