        Migrate Data Forward

        <a href="LegacyCode.html">LegacyCode</a> and Programs written in Legacy Systems exist because they either do something that needs to be done, or have a manipulative access to data that remains important. The complaint that such systems ResistChange, has validity for a number of reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           They were designed to operate on machines and systems which are no longer considered adequate or desirable.
        </li>
        <li>
           They work, but not in a way modern managers and designers would like to work or would like them to work.
        </li>
        <li>
           The source code that makes the system work does not exist or is in a language or format that modern programmers will not find useful.
        </li>
        <li>
           You can not run it on Systems presently used for development.
        </li>
        <li>
           New approaches are perceived as being far better than old ones.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Instead of trying to re-organize and revise or convert the code, why not simply <a href="MigrateDataForward.html">MigrateDataForward</a>? Converting Data into a useable form is far easier than messing with the <a href="LegacyCode.html">LegacyCode</a> that manipulates it. Since you know the data is valuable and you know what you want to do with it, simply <a href="RewriteCodeFromScratch.html">RewriteCodeFromScratch</a> so that it will perform the way you want, in the language you want, on the system you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        When finished doing so, you can replace the obsolete equipment and systems with smaller, modern, capable, operational systems which are suitable in the present environment.

        <em>Many in the database community have been arguing loudly in favour of this for years.  Many in the application development community argue forcibly against it.  It depends, I suppose, on whether you view applications as valuable or not.  Often, they embed functionality that is painfully difficult or expensive to replace.</em>
