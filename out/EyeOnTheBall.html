        Eye On The Ball

      <p>
        This was so obvious and simple, I just couldn't help myself.
        Also, it seemed like the perfect generative pattern. Please
        forgive me.

        <strong>PROBLEM:</strong> You're striking out, booting grounders, dropping pegs, and risking death from fly balls.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CONTEXT:</strong> Baseball, softball, tennis, golf, or any other ball sport
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>FORCES:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You want to be good.
        </li>
        <li>
           You're scared of being hurt.
        </li>
        <li>
           There's so much to remember!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Just keep your eye on the ball. Nothing else. All your conscious attention
        must be brought to bear on this action.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RESULTING CONTEXT:</strong> By focusing completely on the ball, everything will fall into place.
        Your bat is now an extension of your arms and is guided by the wire of your gaze
        to the ball. Grounders no longer seem to erratically skip and leap into your face
        or your groin, but rather you move with them, and your glove is one with whatever
        your eye can follow. Hard throws from teammates, fly balls, all are reduced to the
        concentration of simply watching the ball and letting your body react without
        the conscious interference of your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RATIONALE:</strong> The key to this, of course, is to have practiced the fundamentals of
        baseball (hitting, fielding, throwing) so much that they no longer require
        conscious thought. But when even the best players start slumping and committing
        errors, it may come down to this simple dictum, "Keep your eye on the ball."
        The real idea, of course, is not to keep your eye on the ball, <em>but to keep your head out of the game,</em> so that practice and reflexes can work their magic through
        your body on the field. It also means to keep your eye on the ball all the
        way into your glove, or against your bat, or into the catcher's mitt on that
        third strike that you've thrown when it mattered most. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For those of us who are hackers in the world of sport, this dictum is best at
        reducing the fear that accompanies competition. Start thinking about the
        ball being hit to you and damned if you won't drop it, just like you feared.
        Embarrassment is the great fear, after all, but it requires a "higher"
        consciousness to experience, so reduce your consciousness to only the
        predatory focus on that orb, ready to pounce, eviscerate, and devour.

        Does this relate to software? I think so. In order to be creative, to find that
        "right" solution, quite often one must get one's head out of the game, and
        remember that experience has encoded all the knowledge one needs in one's
        brain. The problem is, on what does one focus? Any suggestions? I tend to
        go walking or fishing or take a shower or just sit quietly letting my
        mind wander anywhere it chooses. This is the part that's got me stumped. Maybe there isn't any relationship to software. 
        Aaaaarrrrgggghhhhh! Help!

        Oh, and don't bring up the problem of hitting the curve ball.

        "Fear of striking out" can indeed be a major problem when 
        developing software under aggressive (or just plain
        nutty) time constraints.  I like the pattern, though
        I think <em>practice</em>
        is rightly a part of the <strong>Solution.</strong>
