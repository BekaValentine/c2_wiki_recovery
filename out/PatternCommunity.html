        Pattern Community
      </h1>
      <p>
        It seems to me that there is a community here that has developed around the notion of patterns. Indeed, this particular <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> serves in no small part in fostering that community.
      </p>
      <p>
        In keeping with the larger hacker community that builds up around the Jargon file (or that it reflects), I've suggested that the editors take a look at the Patterns-discussion FAQ, the Patterns home page, and this forum to get ideas for terms they may want to add to the Jargon file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps others would like to contribute by offering terms and their definitions. Some to consider might be <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a>, <a href="RuleOfThree.html">RuleOfThree</a>, <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, or any of the other many terms defined here (or elsewhere in the <a href="PatternCommunity.html">PatternCommunity</a>) that can be found in common usage among PatternAfficianados. Send your terms and their definitions to <a href="mailto:jargon@thyrsus.com">mailto:jargon@thyrsus.com</a> and maybe we'll be able to spread the good word and help build the <a href="PatternCommunity.html">PatternCommunity</a> at the same time.

        Q: I am a junior developer who has just seen the light on design patterns, can you suggest any suitable pattern community discussion sites where I can ask questions and consume large quantities of pattern-oriented Kool-aid?

        I am a little surprised to see the "Design Patterns Aren't" (<a href="http://perl.plover.com/yak/design/)">http://perl.plover.com/yak/design/)</a> presentation listed in the list above... the presentation seems to be a series of misconceptions about design patterns with an undercurrent of counter-advocacy against C++ and java. Is it offered as an example or as a warning?

        What is with the apparent lack of online pattern communities on the web? My searches yield not only no active online groups, but apparently a load of defunct in-person meeting groups. Is there something about patterns that seems to preclude having an online community, or are they just eluding me? I understand I am in a pattern community right now, but I am reluctant to abuse this space as a newbie's trial and error discussion board.
