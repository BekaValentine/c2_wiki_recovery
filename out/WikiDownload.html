        The software that runs this wiki is <em>not</em> available. You may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use <a href="WikiBase.html">WikiBase</a>, which is a fork of an earlier version of this wiki's engine
        </li>
        <li>
           Use <a href="QuickiWiki.html">QuickiWiki</a>, which comes with the book <em></em><a href="TheWikiWay.html">TheWikiWay</a><em>.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Use one of the many <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a>s (which are more fully featured than <a href="WikiBase.html">WikiBase</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The only person who can tell you why it isn't available is its creator, <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, and he appears unwilling to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Have you asked him to on his page?</em>

        Yes... I just did. Forgot to do it last time. Sorry. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>

        Update: Why still no answer? -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a> [<em>How long was the interval?</em>]

        I wonder why too! -- Anonymous Wikifan 2

        I'd like to know as well. -- <a href="JimmyCerra.html">JimmyCerra</a>

        If it weren't considered <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, he should make a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a> detailing the implementation, complete with source code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably because he does not want to get 1,000,000 emails asking for support! -- jmkeuning

        I stopped wondering long ago. = Bill  we should get in touch with the Congress of New Urbanism

        Ward's code has numerous unfixed bugs (see <a href="WikiWikiBugs.html">WikiWikiBugs</a>), so it's far better that others create their own wiki software, resulting in a wide choice of <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> being available.

        Note that the engine running this wiki is a custom set of scripts which have not been released to the public. The <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> included with <a href="TheWikiWay.html">TheWikiWay</a>'s CD (<a href="QuickiWiki.html">QuickiWiki</a>/<a href="ClusterWiki.html">ClusterWiki</a>) may be similar to the engine running <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, but they are not identical.
