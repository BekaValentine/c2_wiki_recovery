        Why We Get Annoyed By Smalltalk
      </h1>
      <p>
        Lots of folks around here think that <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> is the greatest thing since sliced bread (or since Lisp, at any rate--the <em>other</em> language with a large contingent of SmugWeenies).  This Wiki has a few pages, such as <a href="WhyWeHateLisp.html">WhyWeHateLisp</a>, where the non-Lisp community can fire back.  No such pages seem to exist for Smalltalk (though a few, such as <a href="WhyIsSmalltalkDead.html">WhyIsSmalltalkDead</a>, discuss its failure to gain mind and market share).
      </p>
      <p>
        Smalltalk is great; but it's not perfect.  There are many reasons <a href="WhyWeGetAnnoyedBySmalltalk.html">WhyWeGetAnnoyedBySmalltalk</a>.  (I couldn't bring myself to write WhyWeHateSmalltalk; as I <em>don't</em> hate it, or any programming language.  OK, I do hate <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>--but that's because it's a SteamingTurd which manages to make C/C++ look like, well, Smalltalk.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So... things not to like about Smalltalk.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's a <a href="PinkyAndTheBrainLanguage.html">PinkyAndTheBrainLanguage</a>.  In many ways.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The "image".  Makes it difficult to use Smalltalk in a heterogenous environment.  (The oft-proposed solution of moving the <em>rest</em> of the application to Smalltalk isn't practical, obviously). <em>What??? I don't understand this complaint. Each platform has its own executable, the image is part of it. I load what I want into it. Where's the problem?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Can we have a standard, <em>please?</em>  The <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a>s have a standard.  <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> has <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a> et al defining what Java does and doesn't do.  <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> both have standards--I can write an ANSI compliant C/C++ program and it will fine on most modern compilers, without modification--the places one finds deviations from the standard are at the fringes of these languages.  Smalltalk, OTOH, remains full of trivial, non-portable constructs. <em>Is the complaint that there is no standard or that there is no compliant dialect?  Because there is an ANSI stanard.</em> Which doesn't include any graphics model. OTOH, that's hardly a trivial construct.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           ReturningFromBlocks.  Would be fine, except blocks are first-class objects.  Which can cause rather bizarre things to occur.  See <a href="SmalltalkAndExceptions.html">SmalltalkAndExceptions</a>. <em>Again, what??? Blocks return from the context in which they were created, if possible. This strikes me as consistent, understandable, and reliable. It's been that way for years. What's "bizarre"?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Having a built in IDE is nice.  It is also a severe liability to many of us--who prefer to write code with vi or emacs. <em>Oh, I see, you prefer the "DDE" (Disintegrated Development Environment) offered by whatever shell happens to be running your vi or emacs. "Severe liability"?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Being able to RedefineTheWorld.  A cool feature for prototyping; but much like <a href="OperatorOverloading.html">OperatorOverloading</a> in C++ something that should be seldom done.  <a href="PrincipleOfLeastSurprise.html">PrincipleOfLeastSurprise</a> and all. <em>This </em>'annoys<em>' you? Don't use it then. Seems like a learning curve issue to me.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Irrational hatred, sometimes bordering on paranoia, for C++ and (especially) Java.  C++ bashing is highly understandable, as C++ gets used in many places where it's not appropriate (and with <a href="MooresLaw.html">MooresLaw</a> providing us with FasterCheaperBetter, the economics of software engineering are causing the number of those places to grow by the day) and I predict it will become a <a href="LegacyLanguage.html">LegacyLanguage</a> in some number of years--but why the persistent Java-bashing?  Java's got a clean, sane programming model, and none of the nasty flaws that are fast rendering C++ obsolete.  Smalltalk is more convenient in many respects with <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a>; but listening to many folks in the Smalltalk camp--Java's no better than C++ whatsoever.  Which is just plain silly. <strong>This is a property of Smalltalk <em>programmers</em>, not the language.</strong> True... maybe we need a SocialProblemsOfSmalltalk page?  See <a href="JavaVsSmalltalk.html">JavaVsSmalltalk</a>.  See also <a href="SmalltalkMinusMinus.html">SmalltalkMinusMinus</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've deliberately left <em>off</em> the list the following complaints about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the syntax of Smalltalk
          <ul>
            <li>
               (once you get used to it; it's not hard to understand);
            </li>
            <li>
               (and it's so simple you can learn everything about it in a few minutes, once you grok the keyword messages.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           performance
          <ul>
            <li>
               (see above comment on <a href="MooresLaw.html">MooresLaw</a>);
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="EverythingIsAnObject.html">EverythingIsAnObject</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               (treating conditionals as messages to true or false is a bit contrived; but again something that you can easily get used to). 
            </li>
            <li>
               (one of the common complaints about Java is that everything isn't an object)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There used to be a complaint up there about Smalltalk lacking a "case" statement. In Smalltalk, a case statement is just an ordinary method call. Squeak has one. It's called #caseOf:otherwise:. You can use it like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        suitName := suitNumber caseOf: {<br/>
        [1] -> ['diamonds'].<br/>
        [2] -> ['clubs'].<br/>
        [3] -> ['hearts'].<br/>
        [4] -> ['spades'].<br/>
        } otherwise: ['invalid suit'].<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I don't think I've ever wanted to use it, but it's there. (Or if it isn't, you can define it yourself. :)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Regarding "Smalltalkers are annoying because they bash Java, but C++ bashing makes sense": is this a case of <a href="CompetingWithCousins.html">CompetingWithCousins</a>? I don't think that Java and C++ are the same, but I don't think they're nearly as different as I used to think. -- <a href="AdamSpitz.html">AdamSpitz</a>

        <em>These complaints all seem like learner's curve rants to me. All those braces in C and Java sure do annoy me. Yup.</em>
