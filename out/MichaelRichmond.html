      <p>
        I studied for my PhD at The Institute Formally Known As The Microsoft Research Institute (TIFKATMRI), a research centre previously situated on the campus of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        My PhD research is concerned with extending the <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a> architecture to support the relocation and rebinding of EJBs also known as migration).
      </p>
      <p>
        During my graduate work I was supervised by <a href="JamesNoble.html">JamesNoble</a>. After which, he is planing a career in commercial research. (It's either that or going  back to working as a fish monger.)
