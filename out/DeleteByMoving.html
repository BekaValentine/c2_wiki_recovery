        Delete By Moving

        Wiki Strategy where, instead of deleting something, you create a page with a silly name and move the material there and link to it. It gets it out of the way, and is thus about as good as a deletion. But the material remains available in case someone else wants to make use of it. -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a>

        Actually, it's pretty rude to just move somebody's contributions without leaving a forwarding address. If you are going to refactor some discussion to another place at least leave a note behind explaining what got whacked, why, and where its final resting place is. There is some discussion of this somewhere, but I forget exactly where.

        This is a very useful strategy to restore order when people insist on sidetracking a page which (before their efforts) looked to have a bright future.  Before finding <a href="DeleteByMoving.html">DeleteByMoving</a>, I was about to create a page terming it DisagreeByRefactoring, but perhaps this name is better?

        <em>Man, this title really hits home to me right now.  I'm moving almost everything I own into storage for the next month, until my new house is ready, as my current landlord rented my old place with two weeks notice to me: I tried to send him the message, "I'd like to stay on for another month" but he received "I'm leaving right away".  </em><a href="DeleteByMoving.html">DeleteByMoving</a> isn't a metaphor for me right now, it's real life!<em></em>
