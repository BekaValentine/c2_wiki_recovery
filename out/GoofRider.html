        Greetings - may I direct your attention to <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeff, are you there?  (October 1, 2003 : October 24, 2002)
        Probably going to move his page and update signatures soon anyway.

        Thanks for the heads-up. Whomever it was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           My real name is VERY COMMON.
        </li>
        <li>
           My nickname actually uniquely identify me. (Hint: Try googling my real name, then my nickname, and see what you can find)
        </li>
        <li>
           You know my real name already, didn't you?
        </li>
        <li>
           Why am I being pointed to <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a> by people who doesn't even have names at all???
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>The convention on </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is to use Real Names or not to sign contributions.<em></em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The reason I use my nickname here is simply just that: It uniquely identify me on the net. Using my nickname, anyone can find EVERYTHING I said on the web. My real name is right there. I have nothing to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No one's accusing you of hiding.  Pointing you to </em><a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a> is how the community draws attention to its conventions. You are free to ignore the convention, as you choose.<em></em>
