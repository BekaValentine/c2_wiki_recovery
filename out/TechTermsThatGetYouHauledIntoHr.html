        Tech Terms That Get You Hauled Into Hr

      <p>
        Technical terms or phrases that risk getting you sent to the <a href="HumanResources.html">HumanResources</a> office:

      <ul>
        <li>
           "Fiddle with her front-end"
        </li>
        <li>
           "We'll try it with the master-slave positions reversed"
        </li>
        <li>
           "Mother's died.  Steve's just gone to boot her" <em>I still don't get it.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Interpretation 1: The machine we call Mother has crashed and Steve has gone to restart it.
            </li>
            <li>
               Interpretation 2: My Mother has died, and Steve has gone to kick her when shes lying there dead.
            </li>
            <li>
               This falls into the general set of examples because the first is legitimate technical language, the second is unacceptable to society.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>If Mother was a cantankerous old b*tch it is unlikely that anyone, with even the most delicate of sensibilities, would fault Steve for his actions. Mother, the machine... of course.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Fork the child, let it sleep for a few hours, and then kill it when you're done."
        </li>
        <li>
           "She's got a nice .profile."
        </li>
        <li>
           "I tried finger-ing her, but got no response."
        </li>
        <li>
           "She goes down on me at least once a week."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Some of these don't work very well if you refer to the computer as "it", not "she".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Serial devices under Unix originally interfaced to Teletypes, abbreviated "tty" (e.g. /dev/tty), and once upon a time fairly universally pronounced "Titty" (both within and without the Unix world, I believe).
      </p>
      <p>
        Pseudo-ttys (virtual serial devices) are still an important mechanism, although the physical Teletypes are long gone. Do people still say "Pseudo-Titty", or has everyone carefully shifted to the safer "Pseudo-TEE-TEE-WHY"?

      <p>
        <em>TEE-TEE? WHY?</em>

        Hm.  Never heard it called anything but T-T-Y, personally. -- <a href="MartinZarate.html">MartinZarate</a>

        In the mid-eighties, a woman graduate student who I worked with got very offended by our use of "titty" and asked us, rather angrily, to stop. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
