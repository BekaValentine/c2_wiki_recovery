        Internet signatures in mail and news should begin with the character sequence
      </p>
      <code>
        DASH DASH SPACE EOL<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        For example
      </p>
      <code>
        -- <br/>
        James Hacker <jrh@ge.com>,<br/>
        Electron Polisher, General Eclectic Corporation<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The signature is part of the message, but also less important than the content itself.  It's often the same from one message to another, and deeply-nested messages look ugly when repeated signatures are redundantly quoted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution must work in plain text, and feel natural to people new to email.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Mark the start of the signature as described above, and follow with whatever you like within the <a href="SixLineSigLimit.html">SixLineSigLimit</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Smart user agents (e.g. mutt) can do nice things such as showing signatures in a different color, and more importantly truncating them when replying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution is so small and discreet that many people don't realize there is a convention here at all.
