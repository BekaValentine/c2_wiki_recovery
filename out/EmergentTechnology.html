      <p>
        Emergent Technology is technology  ..."arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems".
      </p>
      <p>
        The common characteristics are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           radical novelty (features not previously observed in systems)
        </li>
        <li>
           coherence or correlation (meaning integrated wholes that maintain themselves over some period of time)
        </li>
        <li>
           A global or macro "level" (i.e. there is some property of "wholeness")
        </li>
        <li>
           it is the product of a dynamical process (it evolves)
        </li>
        <li>
           it is "ostensive" - it can be perceived
        </li>
      </ul>
