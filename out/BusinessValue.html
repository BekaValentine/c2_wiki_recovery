        It deserves reiteration:

        <dd>Programmers are not customers.  Programmers should not make business decisions, such as deciding what has <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a>.</dd>

      <p>
        <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> works by pretending we are all <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> Ferengi, and we are in it for The Profit. The <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a>'s lobes attend to their customer's needs, and they request we add increments of <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a> to the project. We finish them as fast as our clever Ferengi minds can type, but with a simple design and lots of tests so we can do it again. We only invest in the future via <a href="ArchitectTheNegativeSpace.html">ArchitectTheNegativeSpace</a>. The <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> then sells the new feature to the customer, takes the profit and uses that to pay us for the next feature.

        If you program because you love it, it takes discipline to moderate your designs to take <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a> into account.
