        Three Star Programmer
      </h1>
      <p>
        A rating system for C-programmers. The more indirect your pointers are (i.e. the more "*" before your variables), the higher your reputation will be. No-star C-programmers are virtually non-existent, as virtually all non-trivial programs require use of pointers. Most are one-star programmers. In the old times (well, I'm young, so these look like old times to me at least), one would occasionally find a piece of code done by a three-star programmer and shiver with awe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people even claimed they'd seen three-star code with function pointers  involved, on more than one level of indirection. Sounded as real as UFOs to me.
      </p>

        <strong>Just to be clear:  Being called a </strong><a href="ThreeStarProgrammer.html">ThreeStarProgrammer</a> is usually <em>not</em> a compliment.<strong></strong>

        No-star programming is becoming trendy again, because of C++ and templates. The aim here is to avoid indirection completely, inline everything and have it all evaluated at compile-time. None of that "dynamic" nonsense. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        It's gone too far the other way, I think. I've been attempting to recruit C++ programmers. In a dozen interviews, all but one couldn't handle simple pointer manipulation (reverse an integer array in place). The one exception struggled, but got there eventually. I know C++ doesn't need pointers as much as C, but I find it worrying that such people claim C++ competence, and can apparently find jobs programming C++. -- <a href="PaulHudson.html">PaulHudson</a>

        Of course (actually, not of course, since that isn't in place). But that's not the point. I don't want to know if they can reverse an array. I want to know that they understand how C++ and pointers work enough to be able to implement things like "reverse an integer in place". -- <a href="PaulHudson.html">PaulHudson</a>

        <em>I want developers on my team who think about what they are trying to accomplish. One of us has misunderstood the irony of this page. I find myself (here in Cambridge, MA) surrounded by an army of C++ (and now Java) "developers" who salivate at the prospect of showing how much they know about "how C++ and pointers work" -- and who don't have the foggiest idea of why anyone would ever want to reverse an array, never mind in place.</em>

        <em>In a perfect world, I would like to not have to make a choice: I would expect every seasoned professional to know how to accomplish such feats.

      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think that's the point, no. I understand the problems <a href="ThreeStarProgrammer.html">ThreeStarProgrammer</a>s cause. But people incapable of being <a href="OneStarProgrammer.html">OneStarProgrammer</a>s are problematic, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember I was describing an interview. I agree that if they should find themselves writing a program and needing to reverse an array, I'd rather they used a library function than wrote it themselves. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But in our situation, we need programmers who can write code at a similar level to this - reversing an array is just an example for discussion at interview.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't want programmers who know only how to fiddle bits, but not why. I don't want programmers who can only handle connecting previously written functionality, but can't get down to the low level stuff when they need to. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd probably take the good abstractor, too. But I haven't had many good abstractors turn up, either. I've been very disappointed with the level of skill of the people I've been seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in my experience from these interviews (and similar interviews in past lives), the pointer expressions do not <em>work precisely as intended by the developer</em> (I go on in my interviews to ask the candidate how they would satisfy themselves that the code they've produced worked. Most of the code produced fails on boundary cases, and they have no idea how to test it anyway. They don't think about things like boundary cases when producing the code, either. Depressing). -- <a href="PaulHudson.html">PaulHudson</a>

        <em>I've discovered that I find it much easier to teach a naive abstractor how to program than to teach a naive programmer how to abstract.

        <em>Conversely, the teams of more humble craftspeople I've worked with have been compellingly more productive.

        As a minor contribution to this debate, I tried to get clever in implementing the in-place reversal and happened to produce at least three incorrect versions, all failing on boundary cases as a result of using "!=" rather than "<" (don't ask).

        It's been a while now, but I once worked one a program that had at least 4 levels of indirection at one point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program was a screenscraper. Screen data was sent from the server as a series of bytes, which the original author simply dumped into a buffer of memory. He would then proceed to walk over parts of it, casting snippets of it into the particular type that he wanted at a given point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The buffer was a structured blob, and some of the data was offsets to other parts (it was an index of fields). The field data, in turn, had offsets to other parts of the data, to handle things like string literals, formatting code, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to get the screen title (which was just a special field in the screen data), the original author managed to do four or five pointer dereferences within the single statement, including casts and offset adjustments. The statement was spread over four or five lines, at 80 characters to the line (and no indentation... with indentation it grew to about 8 lines).
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, this was easier than another part, where he treated the snippets of data as arrays. Of course, each reference used a different data type for the array, and thus different sizes. And here I was trying to follow what the program was doing, given a printout of the buffer and a lot of highlighters... (he had a <a href="FencePostError.html">FencePostError</a> in one of his loops which was causing the formatting data to be read in incorrectly). -- <a href="RobertWatkins.html">RobertWatkins</a>

        One problem with the notion of <a href="ThreeStarProgrammer.html">ThreeStarProgrammer</a>s is that the term only makes sense in the context of C/C++, where * is the pointer dereference operator.  In other languages with explicit pointer frobbing, replacement of * with the appropriate lexeme is straightforward--you could have <a href="ThreeCircumflexProgrammer.html">ThreeCircumflexProgrammer</a>s in Pascal, for instance. <em>How about </em><a href="ThreeCaratProgrammer.html">ThreeCaratProgrammer</a>s?<em></em>

        But what about other languages, where there are no (explicit) pointers to dereference?

      <p>
        Also, what about nested #if,#else,#endif's? Those can be even harder than pointer dereferencing, especially considering cross-platform, cross-compiler, even cross-language issues.

        The underlying issue here is probably one of not making a new object when one is required. If someone's using three levels of indirection, they probably should have made some sort of a container class instead, with some suitable methods. The three star constructs are then converted into a named object type with some named methods for using it. A big improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three star programmers fail to see how a new object could help, and the three stars happen because some other class is now doing too much.

        I was wrong on two counts. First, my pointer statement only holds for if your pointers are the same type as the thing to which you are pointing. Second, the precondition is not met.

        Three-star code naturally comes up when you need to use an ordered index an array of pointers to strings (in that we ask for a position in the array, not for the string itself).  
        The strings are of type char const *.
        The data block is of type char const *const *const [02].
        The index block is of type char const *const *const *const [02].
        (The innermost indirection does not count because the string type can be made oblique; however, the outermost array makes up for this deficiency.)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        One can easily avoid three-star programming by the judicious use of typedefs:
      </p>

        typedef foo *foo_handle;<br/>
        void andWithOneLeapHeWasFree(foo_handle **bar);<br/>
