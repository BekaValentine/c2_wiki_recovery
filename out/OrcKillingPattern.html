        Orc Killing Pattern

        A minimal example of the use of <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a> for a pattern, based on another (fairly well-known) minimal example.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Name</strong>: Orc Killing Pattern
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>: You're a hungry adventurer and a pie would really hit the spot right about now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>: You are in a 10'x10' room, with your companions. Each of you is armed. The room also contains an orc. The orc has a pie.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The orc is "obviously" an evil creature, by convention.
        </li>
        <li>
           The orc stands between you and the pie, which you would like to have.
        </li>
        <li>
           The orc looks like more than a match for you, but you have the advantage of numbers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>: Draw your weapons and attack the orc physically, in a cooperative effort. Take the pie once the orc is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context</strong>: The party is now in possession of a pie, which tastes good. The pie must be shared among surviving party members, which may lead to intra-party conflict. The pie may be poisoned, requiring saving throws from all who partake of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Known Uses</strong>: Several adventurers have "survived Orc and Pie", and have a T-shirt (size XXL) proclaiming the fact. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Related Patterns</strong>: <a href="BakeryAmbushPattern.html">BakeryAmbushPattern</a>. The source of the pie is probably some sort of Bakery, which might be guarded by more orcs. In the spirit of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, it makes sense to search for the bakery rather than relying on the <a href="DungeonMaster.html">DungeonMaster</a> to find oneself inside more 10'x10' orc-with-pie rooms (something which is difficult to arrange deliberately, especially since the canonical example of such a room has no door or other obvious means of entrance).

        <em>I Just Don't Get ItÂ®. Why is everybody so hot to kill these Orcs? Can't you just make a deal? Buy pies off of them? Maybe make a trade? And who deals with all the Orc corpses left lying around after the slaughter? I certainly don't want to go slogging through Orc guts after eating a nice piece of pie. And what's all this noise about poison? What idiot would want to ruin a perfectly good pie by poisoning it? If Orks are that dorky then they couldn't be capable of making a really good pie, could they?</em>
