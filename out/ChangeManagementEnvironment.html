        Change is part of our life. So is in a development process. Our process should be flexible enough to decide when to accept and how to deal with the change. One should always be anticipate and accept the change in a manner not disturbing the whole process. by 216.54.153.2 in March 03.

        Recently I had an occasion to share a <a href="SuccessStory.html">SuccessStory</a> from a long time ago. Discussions revealed one <a href="CriticalSuccessFactor.html">CriticalSuccessFactor</a> to that story is <a href="CulturalReadiness.html">CulturalReadiness</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The story started when an enthusiatic, a bit naive, team leader from overseas got hired to support an inhouse rostering application. It was a brand new, well designed application that passed all quality tests. Shortly after cutover it created a crisis that affected the reputation of the IT department, because over two-thirds of the machine resources were used up by this new application. All other applications grind to a halt. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately most of the online applications, this one included, were quite critical. For example, a very busy application used in managing shipment of precious cargo into and out of that city was getting unacceptable response times. In those days <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> machine upgrades were very expensive and had a long planning cycle. Worse still, users had so much confidence of this computerization project that key personnel had been redeployed so backing out of the implementation was not an option.
      </p>
      <p>
        The natural team to be called to find a solution was the development team, led by a very bright individual with good project skills. Nothing significant was found and reluctantly the work was given to this new hire without much expectations for success.
      </p>
      <p>
        A turnaround came within a few weeks time and a faulty piece of code was discovered and rectified. This was following by more successes, enough for management to sail over the crisis and claim the experience as a "nation building exercise".
      </p>
      <p>
        In retelling this story it became more apparent that <a href="CulturalChange.html">CulturalChange</a>, made possible during that crisis period, had a great part to do with the outcome. Protocol barriers were broken and the usual rivalry between teams were suspended. Many conditions and steps outlined in <a href="TheHeartOfChange.html">TheHeartOfChange</a> came together, during that short but memorable period.
