        When I was first programming in Smalltalk I mentioned
        to Dave that I was now writing the equivalent of pages
        of FORTRAN in a couple of lines.  He was doing the 
        opposite:  writing pages and pages for the equivalent 
        of a couple of lines
        of FORTRAN.
        Dave was coding for the Cray XMP, the fastest computer
        in the world.  The patterns he used were not unlike
        those used by the best <a href="SmalltalkImplementers.html">SmalltalkImplementers</a>.

        Dave taught me to program in CompassAssembler for the 
        CDC-6000.  His son, <a href="DonDodson.html">DonDodson</a>, has offered his own
        improvements to Dave's <a href="LinearShuffle.html">LinearShuffle</a>.
