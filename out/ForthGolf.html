        Forth Golf
      </h1>
      <p>
        Someone had written this in a presumed attempt to be funny, or perhaps in an attempt to vilify <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>.  It's amusing, however, because this code uses words which simply don't exist in most Forths these days (e.g., ") or at all ever (e.g., >>A).  In fact, looking at this code, it is trivial to see that the program would crash due to data stack overflow.

      <code>
        hex 4666 dup negate do i 4000 dup 2* negate do " *" 0 dup 2dup 1e 0 do<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          swap * e >>a 2* 5 pick + -rot - j + dup dup * e >>a rot dup dup * e >>a 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        rot swap 2dup + 10000 > if 3drop 3drop "  " 0 dup 2dup leave then loop <br/>
      </code>

        <em>As was mentioned, this is </em><a href="OpenFirmware.html">OpenFirmware</a>, a dialect of <a href="AnsForth.html">AnsForth</a> with many extensions. In this example:<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           >>A is arithmetic right shift
        </li>
        <li>
           " is shorthand for S" (string literals)
        </li>
        <li>
           3drop is drop drop drop
        </li>
        <li>
           most significantly, flow control constructs like IF and DO-LOOP are allowed in the interpreter (probably the source of your overflow error)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, it would be interesting to see otherwise legitimate examples of <a href="ForthGolf.html">ForthGolf</a> here.  Any takers?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A prime example is the </em><a href="InternationalObfuscatedCeeCodeContest.html">InternationalObfuscatedCeeCodeContest</a> entry of many years back, which was itself a Forth system in a few K of compressed C code.<em></em>

        <em>Since everything in Forth can be redefined, and no symbols are off limits, a quick golfing method is to redefine common longer words to single characters. </em><a href="FalseLanguage.html">FalseLanguage</a> lies in that direction.<em></em>
