        Plurality Of Worlds
      </h1>
      <p>
        Plurality of worlds was the realization in medieval times that if earth was not the center of the universe, other worlds with intelligent life could exist. People got burned at the stake for this. See <a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/P/pluralism.html">http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/P/pluralism.html</a> -- <em>A plurality of people? Anyone other than Bruno, who probably got on the shitlist more for his other odd beliefs and his bad attitude than for what he thought about extraterrestrials?</em>
