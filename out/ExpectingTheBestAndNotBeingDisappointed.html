        Expecting The Best And Not Being Disappointed
      </h1>
      <p>
        The ultimate in the PowerOfPositiveThinking. To have Expected and to have received is better than to have no expectations and to have that confirmed. It is also a sense of things being right and people being right and the time being right for success to occur. It is what comes about when one has set things up right. This is not an easy thing to do, but certainly is what should be done and isn't.  (Why does this paragraph bring to mind the name of Yogi Berra?)
