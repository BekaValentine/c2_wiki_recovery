        Wiki's simplicity is beautiful, but I wonder if a new feature could handle <a href="HotPotatoes.html">HotPotatoes</a> rather nicely. Suppose I visit <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?page=RecentChanges&ignore_category=CategoryTheology,">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?page=RecentChanges&ignore_category=CategoryTheology,</a> and am presented with a <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> list excluding pages that have a link to that CategoryPage. If I visit a page which isn't marked that way but should be, I simply add the category tag and gleam with pride for having saved the next visitors from reading something they'd sooner avoid.

        But once CategoryTheology is in widespread use, someone (probably me) is bound to apply it to certain views on software method. --<a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

      <p>
        What if <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> instead just listed all categories that each page belongs to? Then you could ignore those marked as just CategoryTheology, but read the ones that are Cagegory{Theology, SoftwardMethod}. -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>

        <em></em>SoftwardMethod???  Yikes!<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Joking apart, I agree that there needs to be some ability to filter <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> at some point in the future.  I'd prefer for Wiki to try this route before more draconian measures to guard against <a href="WikiMindWipe.html">WikiMindWipe</a> are taken (on the basis that effective filtering should help reduce nervous tension for any visitor!). --rd

        See CategoryFilteredRecentChanges, <a href="FoxForumWiki.html">FoxForumWiki</a> (which actually does this, and has the most advanced categorization scheme of any wiki.)
