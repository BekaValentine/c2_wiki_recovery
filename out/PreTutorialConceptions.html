        Pre Tutorial Conceptions
      </h1>
      <p>
        When people are first introduced to Patterns in a more
        formal manner (such as a tutorial or lecture), I wonder
        what preconceptions they arrive with and whether Patterns
        turn out to be much different than what they expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I have asked some PatternNovices what they think about
        Patterns, I get answers like these:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Oh yeah, I saw the GoF book... It's just a way to catalog designs, right?
        </li>
        <li>
           Isn't that a new way of doing Object Oriented Design?
        </li>
        <li>
           Sounds like forcing structure on the way people document stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
           I am thinking about writing a tool to generate code from Patterns...
        </li>
        <li>
           Isn't that the stuff that makes it easier to design _______ ?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Are these people victims of (misleading) <a href="PatternHype.html">PatternHype</a> ?   When will the
        inevitable <a href="PatternBacklash.html">PatternBacklash</a> (and I don't mean <a href="PatternSkepticism.html">PatternSkepticism</a>) begin?
