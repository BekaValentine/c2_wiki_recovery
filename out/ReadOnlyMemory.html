        Read Only Memory
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are various kinds of memory available. Broadly, we can categorize memory in two ways:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Memory which does not have the ability to store the data once the power is OFF (called "volatile memory", also know as "Random Access Memory").
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Memory which does have the ability to store data once power is OFF (called "non-volatile memory", also known as "Read Only Memory (ROM)"). The additional characteristic of ROM is that it can't be modified/changed once manufactured.
      </p>

        Except that non-volatile memory isn't always called read-only memory - NVRAM (non-volatile random access memory) for example. Oh, and a common type of read-only memory is PROM (programmable read-only memory), where programmable means "modifiable by a program", presumably.
      </p>
      <p>
        PROM typically requires that you do something special, like asserting a `programming pin` at an `interesting` voltage in order to write. May or may not be erasable. There are a number of variants on this idea:
      </p>
      <p>
        EPROM (Erasable PROM) typically works via a `window` in the top of the package. Certain wavelengths of light falling on the chip cause it to be erased. These are typically in the UV range.
      </p>
      <p>
        EEPROM (Electrically Erasable PROM) is "modifiable by a program", but functions along the different-voltage lines. You *could* use this like very-slow-to-write RAM, but its endurance isn't typically very good. With *all* these technologies, the act of writing a cell causes a small amount of permanent damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there's modern things,
        Flash - similar to EEPROM, but now bigger, faster, cheaper. Endurance seems better too. If someone wants to fill in how it *actually works*, that would be awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
        FRAM - similar again to EEPROM, except the write speed is almost as fast as reading, and I've never seen any endurance issues. Expensive compared to Flash though!
