        GNU <a href="TeXmacs.html">TeXmacs</a> is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired by TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured documents via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user friendly interface. New styles may be created by the user. The program implements high-quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which help you to produce professionally looking documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically generated formulas, which makes <a href="TeXmacs.html">TeXmacs</a> suitable as an interface for computer algebra systems. <a href="TeXmacs.html">TeXmacs</a> also supports the Guile/Scheme extension language, so that you may customize the interface and write your own extensions to the editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TeXmacs.html">TeXmacs</a> currently runs on PC's and PPC's under Gnu/linux (a >200MHz processor and >32Mb of memory are recommended) and on sun computers. Converters exist for TeX/LaTeX and they are under development for Html/<a href="MathMl.html">MathMl</a>/Xml. In the future, <a href="TeXmacs.html">TeXmacs</a> is planned to evolve towards a complete scientific office suite, with spreadsheet capacities, a technical drawing editor and a presentation mode.
