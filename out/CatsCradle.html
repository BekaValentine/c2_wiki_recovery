        <a href="KurtVonnegut.html">KurtVonnegut</a>'s commentary on science run amok. It centers around the invention of a form of ice, Ice-9, that freezes at room temperature and teaches other water that it comes in contact with to do the same. Ice-9 is invented by a scientist who collects pictures of stacks of cannon balls, on behalf of the Marines, who were tired of always having to crawl through the mud..

        There are eerie parallels between Ice-9 and the recent discovery of prions and their behavior inside of brain tissue. Prions are the culprits behind mad cow, scrapie, vCJD, et cetera. They are allotropes? of a protein, and cause normal proteins to turn into that particular allotrope on contact.

Scientists profited from the icy Cold War, but at the cost of their souls. And their childrens'.</em> --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>
