        Also, no fair commenting on a movie that you haven't actually <strong>seen</strong> (at least a significant part of). If you walked out of the theatre after half an hour because it was so bad, that counts as "seeing" it. If, however, you caught a five minute glimpse of the flick while shopping for TVs at the local Circuit City, that does not. At any rate, no fair piling on widely-acknowledged-as-bad movies unless you have actually made an attempt to watch it yourself. Otherwise, we could ALL trash Plan Nine and such. <em>Hey! I liked Plan Nine. Much better than Soylent Green.</em>

        If you can name a good thing <em>and</em> a bad thing about the movie do you get a RAM chip?

        Probably about $20, if I were placed in that situation. It's pretty hard to imagine that I would be, thankfully. I can always gouge out my eyes if it comes to that.

        <strong>Alexander</strong> - Oliver Stone's take on the life of one of the best military minds of all time.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Agree: <a href="ChrisHines.html">ChrisHines</a> (If you don't know history you have no idea what's going on. Alexander provides us with a lot of interesting stories, and Stone ignored them all in favor of melodrama.) <a href="JoshuaGrosse.html">JoshuaGrosse</a> (This movie wasn't horrible, and I would have preferred it if it were. As it was, it just hinted at what they <em>could</em> have done without doing any of it. And the accents don't help).

        <li>
           Disagree: <a href="JimmyCerra.html">JimmyCerra</a> (I only remembered a general overview of the history - from middle school years ago - yet I understood what was going on.

        <strong>Allan Quartermaine and the Lost City of Gold</strong> - early Sharon Stone flick (before she was known), which is probably why you still see it on TV occasionally. Richard Chamberlain hams it up as usual. Highlights: Cardboard boulders and 24-shot six-shooters (count them bullets!).

        <li>
           Agree: <a href="SteveConover.html">SteveConover</a>, <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a> (Unbelievably bad. Even if I were frozen in a body cast for six months, my time would still be worth too much to watch this mess. In fact, were I healthy enough to chew through my own wrist to escape the manacle tying me to the chair I would give that serious consideration. After listening to Sharon Stone scream her thin little wail for the fourty-umpth time I wanted to gouge my eyes out. Fortunately I found the TV remote control before I found a sharp stick.)

        <strong>Austin Powers 2</strong> (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0145660)">http://us.imdb.com/Title?0145660)</a> - The first one was a really good romp - not the greatest movie of all time, but charming, novel, and very funny. From the reviews I expected less than that - but more of the same. This isn't more of the same. It's just a long, dreary, self-conscious series of coprophiliac jokes. That's right - I am not kidding - the whole thing is about shit. Things go into and out of Mike Myers' anus every five minutes like clockwork. At one point Powers actually drinks feces. The dance sequences are short and pitiful. Heather Graham is very pretty but completely wasted by the horrible, horrible plot. The Fat Bastard character isn't even a rip-off of <a href="AlexeiSayle.html">AlexeiSayle</a>. If you see two movies this summer, make certain neither of them is this unsympathetically vile travesty.

        <strong>Battlefield Earth</strong> - Alien bad guys (who have their own problems) conquer Earth and then, centuries later, have problems with Terrans. Purest drivel. F-18s and Harriers that still fly after having had no maintenance for how many hundreds of years? Aliens with FTL and zap ray gun capabilities who lose to a bunch of scrawny, starving, untrained savages? Oy!

        <strong>Brokeback Mountain</strong> - Mind numbing dialog, dreary plot, boring performances, and not a single sympathetic character. Major character dies because ... well, no reason. No dying speech, no touching message, no irony, no nothing. Typical Annie Proulx-written garbage. The lack of sarcasm is perhaps the worst thing about it - when one of the cowboys said to the other "I ain't queer" it's just fundamentally unfair that the other didn't reply, "Then why weren't you out shagging sheep like the other working stiffs on this hilltop?". Seriously, if you want to see a really heart-warming gay guy flick, go check out <strong>The Sum Of Us</strong> and leave this monotonous claptrap to moulder in its dust jacket.

        <strong>Dark Star</strong> - Aliens that look like beachballs with rubber chicken feet intent on murdering the crew, a planet-destroying bomb that starts waxing philosophic and decides it's God, and special effects which were probably created by literally scratching the negatives, are probably the best parts of this movie. So slow and not funny (though it's billed as a comedy) as to give the viewer a real taste of the space dementia the crew of the eponymous spaceship apparently had.

        <strong>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</strong> - Rivals only <a href="StarshipTroopers.html">StarshipTroopers</a> for being "movie that is the total polar opposite of the book" - although there is an odd reversal in that ST the movie was satire (said satire being arguably the sole redeeming feature of ST), while in LXG it was the source graphic novels that were satire instead of the movie. Worse, the movie became exactly what the book was a satire of - bland pop-stories that ignore just how seedy and nasty we really are. The real LXG was a team of rapists, drug addicts, terrorists, and a suffragette. Mina Harker was the leader, and was most certainly _not_ a vampire.

        <strong>Return of the Jedi</strong> - I bought the <a href="StarWars.html">StarWars</a> DVD box while feeling some nostalgia. I remember when it came out that Return of the Jedi was my least favorite. The Ewoks were overly cute, but I remember thinking that the rest of the movie made up for it. I was wrong: Return of the Jedi is awful. Mark Hamill gets even uglier and still can't manage to act his way out of a paper bag. Carrie Fisher looks desperately like she wants to be somewhere else. My wife (who happens to love things like Spiderman) had never seen it, and a half hour in she gave up on it. I was embarrassed to be watching it. A horrible mess of a movie. I fell asleep 15 minutes after the wife got up, I was so bored with it. <strong>Addendum: I gave the DVD set an additional chance and watched all the movies again. I realized that The Empire Strikes Back is actually pretty good, save the Jonah and the Worm diversion. But Return of the Jedi is still just plain bad, particularly the acting and the dialogue. It's not a question of disbelief. And Luke is never convincing as a serious Jedi.</strong>

At first I thought I was disappointed with the Phantom Menace (and the Clones One) because I was a jaded adult.

        What, is it considered fancy to add here movies just because they didn't fit your mood or what? Snobbish.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some of the reviews explain why these movies must be avoided at all cost. And as for snobbish? Some of us pay good money to view these film things, and feel the need to express how much it annoyed us, or insulted us, or bored us. Can't stomach a critical review? Move along - for you, there's nothing to see here.</em>

        I love the name of this page - moves to avoid at <em>all</em> costs?! If I had to choose between death and watching an Adam Sandler movie, I'd probably watch the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are no Adam Sandler movies listed on this page. If you don't like Adam Sandler, that should say a lot about the movies that </em>are<em> on this page. Then again, as in the case of Lord of the Rings, some movies are here because a few people really didn't like them. However, in the case of Adam Sandler flicks one should probably keep a flame thrower handy to destroy the TV or movie house, should one be forced into a position of watching one of his masterpieces.</em>

        Most of these movies I have never seen - I guess from the sound of it I'm Lucky to have missed them.

        <em>Hmm...I have to agree with this.  I'd </em>'much<strong> rather listen to </strong>VogonPoetry than watch a Sandler flick.  Failing that, sliding down a 10 meter razor blade into a pool of iodine seems much more fun as well.<em></em>

           I concur with many of the opinions expressed by my most esteemed wiki wanderers in the current paragraph. I object, however, to the lack of vehemence in establishing the degree of ill-luck and mind crushing horror it is to be exposed to this nightmarish work. I enjoyed the first movie. When I heard there was to be a sequel, I said to myself, "Bravo!" I had doubts about the wisdom of resurrecting Sean Connery - well, anyhow, one cannot be too choosy. I remember fleeing early from an excruciating class (a class on discrete mathematics - god, how I loathe discrete mathematics - but that is a topic for another page) and queuing up and paying $6.95 for the matinee show. At first, and it is most disconcerting if you have seen the original movie several times (as I had), there's a sense of dislocation and discontinuity, as though you are living in a parallel universe. You start to think to yourself - am I in the right place? why doesn't this movie make sense? did I walk in late by mistake? did I black out and miss something. But then the truth dawns on you - the movie is pastiche of stream of consciousness editing and just the most pathetic writing imaginable. "What happened? Why me?" you cry over and over. I have seen many of the movies mentioned on this page. This movie is not comparable: it lives in a hell of its own. I would rather have my eyes replaced with rectums than to see this "piece of entertainment" again; you must think I exaggerate, but I do not. -- [not signed]
