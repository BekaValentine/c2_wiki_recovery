        I have attended several meetings of <a href="ToastMasters.html">ToastMasters</a> and it is a great tool to improve your communication. XP requires a developer to have a well rounded personality, not a isolated guru / hacker in his/her cube. I wish I could attend more meetings of <a href="ToastMasters.html">ToastMasters</a>.
