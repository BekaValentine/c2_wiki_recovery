        Burnt Out
      </h1>
      <p>
        You know the feeling. Been playing hero for weeks... or months... or <gasp> years! Tackled all the 'impossible' projects, and now they want you to do more (no one else is crazy enough to do it <irony>).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        That's what ya get for being reliable - people rely on you !

        <strong>Cindy tells me</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        by Brian Eno 
      </p>
      <p>
        Cindy tells me the rich girls are weeping
      </p>
      <p>
        Cindy tells me they've given off sleeping alone
      </p>
      <p>
        and now they're so confused by their new freedoms
      </p>
      <p>
        and she tells me they're selling off their maisonettes
      </p>
      <p>
        left the Hotpoints to rust in the kitchenettes
      </p>
      <p>
        and they're saving their labor for insane reading 
      </p>
      <p>
        Chorus:
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of them lose and some of them loose
      </p>
      <p>
        But that's what they want and that's what they choose
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a burden, such a burden
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Oh what a burden to be so relied on </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        [instrumental verse]
      </p>
      <p>
        [repeat chorus]
      </p>
      <p>
        [1/2 instrumental verse]
      </p>
      <p>
        Cindy tell me what will they do with their lives
      </p>
      <p>
        living quietly like laborer's wives
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps they'll reacquire those things they've all disposed of 
      </p>

        Apart from being relied upon, you're always tried upon. Being 'heroic', what a sarcastic word for one who is doomed to fail in death in order to become 'hero', is not the goal. Being stone or harder still is the goal to achieve, to be sintered by total burn out. --<a href="CarstenKlein.html">CarstenKlein</a>
