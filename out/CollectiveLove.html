        Collective Love
      </h1>
      <p>
        ... joyful interaction of intelligent and feeling systems for creating more joy and persistence for all parts and their possible selfsimilar child-processes ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        The main delimiting factor for creating a <a href="WikiWayOfLife.html">WikiWayOfLife</a> may not be the technical infrastructure or the <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a> but the often overlooked <a href="CollectiveLove.html">CollectiveLove</a>.

        Is <em></em><a href="CollectiveLove.html">CollectiveLove</a><em> == </em>Community<em>? </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, let's go on brainstorming:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Community</strong> ::= Collection of subjects with certain practised compatibility rules giving them a chance for persistence and joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>subject</strong> ::= intelligent and feeling (sub-)system
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong>IdealCommunity<strong> ::= Community, where all compatibility rules (the methodes for reducing entropy) are based on </strong><a href="CollectiveLove.html">CollectiveLove</a> + Otherfactors
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How much </em><a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a> and CollectiveInfrastructure in Otherfactors<em> is the question.</em>
      </p>

        Is <a href="CollectiveLove.html">CollectiveLove</a> essential? What about a CollectiveGoal and common circumstance? Do you need a CollectiveGoal? Do you just need communication? What about two people who really hate each other, and whose mutal hatred drives an argument which produces many grand ideas? I'm looking in the direction of <a href="IsaacNewton.html">IsaacNewton</a> and, well, everybody he talked to. He did it for selfish reasons. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Aren't all communities formed by individuals who have selfish reasons to join the community? Even if they aren't conscious. <a href="SelfishGeneTheory.html">SelfishGeneTheory</a> comes to mind. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        IdealCommunity in this context is meant only as a proposed term to be filled with more content (or modified or deleted) in this Wiki Community.
        There seems to be no consens on an ethical axiomatic system (a la Spinoza) to answer your questions in a provable way.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong> perhaps we could further generalize <a href="CollectiveLove.html">CollectiveLove</a> until we have a consensus. So what about taking away the component of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           .. <em>joy</em>? Would you enjoy that?
        </li>
        <li>
           .. <em>persistence</em>? Wouldn't that allow the solution of an IdealCommunity that is 'ideal' because of its short lifespan ;-) We know that there are subjects who enjoy all sorts of destruction, even the destruction of their own habitat (their optimization horizon is limited to their own life-span, perhaps having too little love for other peers remaining joyful and persistent).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>But</strong> let's also consider the traps of <a href="OverGeneralizing.html">OverGeneralizing</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For me joy and persistence could be very well subsumed under the minimal set of CollectiveGoals. Selfishness is controlled to a certain degree in all stable communities. Balancing selflove and love for others is the known 'golden rule'.
        I don't know, what do you mean with 'common circumstance'. Do you refer to 'Gestalt-Theory'.
