        <a href="ActiveTemplateLibrary.html">ActiveTemplateLibrary</a> (ATL) is a <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>-based framework. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was originally designed for developers of <a href="ComComponent.html">ComComponent</a>s (see <a href="ActivexTechnology.html">ActivexTechnology</a>). ActiveX controls had to be small enough to download quickly over a dial-up connection, so that they could be easily embedded in a web page.  The alternative, <a href="MicrosoftFoundationClasses.html">MicrosoftFoundationClasses</a> (MFC), produced much larger executables when linked statically, and required a several-megabyte set of runtime libraries when linked dynamically.  In contrast, ATL-based ActiveX controls were typically much smaller--ATL classes use <a href="UpsideDownInheritance.html">UpsideDownInheritance</a> to allow derivation and polymorphism without vtables, and can often be developed without even linking against the C++ runtime libraries. However, ATL gives the developer a very restricted subset of the features provided by MFC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, the <a href="WindowsTemplateLibrary.html">WindowsTemplateLibrary</a> was based on ATL.  WTL attempts to extend ATL to more MFC-like features, without giving up the small footprint and inheritance model of ATL.
