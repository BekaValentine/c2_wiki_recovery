        Spaghetti Inheritance
      </h1>
      <p>
        Start with a base of <a href="WhatIfInheritance.html">WhatIfInheritance</a> concepts. Now when you mix the pasta in a C++ kitchen, apply the <a href="CuriouslyRecurringTemplate.html">CuriouslyRecurringTemplate</a> pattern:
      </p>
      <code>
        template< class Inheritme, class Payload ><br/>
        struct<br/>
        Spaghetti: public Inheritme<br/>
        {<br/>
        Payload m_aPayload;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When asked <em>why</em> a Spaghetti generic requires two specific inputs, not one, the author will typically refer you to the excuses listed in the page "<a href="WhatIfInheritance.html">WhatIfInheritance</a>".

        <a href="WaterFall.html">WaterFall</a> & <a href="JobSecurity.html">JobSecurity</a> lifecycles inspire this anti-pattern by convincing the "architect" programmer who fills the common code base up with them that only they are smart enough to know <em>how</em> these classes expect to get re-used. And only they understand that systems like these cannot easily be retrofitted into existing code to upgrade it (<a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>), so the expense can only be paid for up front.

        Other languages probably support similar needless complexities in these areas...
