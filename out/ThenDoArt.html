        Then Do Art
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you find that your life is pointless, <a href="ThenDoArt.html">ThenDoArt</a>.  One of the great aspects of allowing your creativity to flourish is that...
      </p>
      <p>
        It gives your life meaning,
      </p>
      <p>
        <add your own stuff here>
      </p>

        This is something that is not stressed enough.  It is the secret of many well-to-do and successful people, especially the well educated and professional.  Since in these later years, so many public schools do not see art as a priority, now we have lesser-successful people.  Most often excuse I hear nowadays is that they think that they will be no good at it, or they say they can't do it, etc., because of never being taught, or not ever having a chance to do it.  That's what is nice about art, all you have to do is to "do it", you do not have to be "good at it".  The magic is in the doing, and then suddenly you like your life again, and yes even that over-stressed and underpaid job is now not so bad.  It's all about doing things with your hands that bring about immediate results (good or bad), and about applying: mind to hands, then hands to medium.  "Doing" art = "magic", magic much greater then very expensive psychotherapy, or drastic life searching changes... Think about it...
