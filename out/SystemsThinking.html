        We cannot understand the nature of a system by analysis of its parts.

        System dynamics is a method for studying the world around us. Unlike other scientists, who study the world by breaking it up into smaller and smaller pieces, system dynamicists look at things as a whole.

        We know about <em>Analysis</em> this has been part of <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a> methodologies for many years.  We are proficient in breaking up a problem into manageable parts.  I also think we like being experts in our fields.

        To achieve <em>Synthesis</em> requires a different level of thinking.  More right brain thinking, creativity, imagination and vision.  Put the analytical left brain on hold for a while.  To do this, I believe we have to step out of our fields of expertise.

        Our inexperience in this (or not being <a href="WillingToChange.html">WillingToChange</a>) could explain why entropy often lead us to <a href="XpCrashAndBurn.html">XpCrashAndBurn</a> and explains some of the <a href="DistributionStories.html">DistributionStories</a>.

        <em>Absolutely. Both could learn from the other, but, especially, I think the Patterns movement could learn a lot from the systems community about how and why patterns work or don't work - </em><a href="SystemsThinking.html">SystemsThinking</a> helps a lot in evaluating the forces, dealing with ambiguity and differing points of view.<em></em>
