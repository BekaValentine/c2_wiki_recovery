        Single Integration Point
      </h1>
      <p>
        Originally called <a href="SingleReleasePoint.html">SingleReleasePoint</a>, but changed to this name because <em>releasing</em> is not the same as <em>integrating</em>. To release is about producing software that is ready for installation at a production machine. To integrate is to do a successful check-in in the shared source repository, in which success means the source fully compiles and all <a href="AutomatedTest.html">AutomatedTest</a>s pass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this one of the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> practices?
      </p>
      <p>
        Using CVS (<a href="ConcurrentVersionsSystem.html">ConcurrentVersionsSystem</a>), a <a href="SingleReleasePoint.html">SingleReleasePoint</a> is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>, but a <a href="SingleIntegrationPoint.html">SingleIntegrationPoint</a> is totally unnecessary. A BuildMachine is usually necessary for <a href="DailyBuild.html">DailyBuild</a> or <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> (shouldn't it be called ContinuousBuild instead?).
      </p>
      <p>
        A BuildMachine should build the software after any check-in. There are many tools to do AutomatedBuilds.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common technique is to number builds incrementally so that any build number is a successful build. I prefer to have good builds and build breaks. BuildNumbers are free.
