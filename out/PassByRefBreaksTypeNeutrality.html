        Pass By Ref Breaks Type Neutrality
      </h1>
      <p>
        Maybe I am looking at this wrong, but there is something that bothers me about pass-by-reference. Ideally a language should be type-neutral or type-blind. It should treat all types or objects the same. However, many popular languages don't because they will pass "primitive" types by value but "complex" ones by reference (as a default). This seems to force a division into "primitive" and "complex", which the compiler/interpreter treats differently. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, if one substitutes a complex type for a simple one, or vise versa, they will get different behavior. For example, suppose it is decided to use a delimited string list ("1,2,3,foo") instead of a vector array. 
      </p>
      <code>
        a = make_a_list({1, 2, 3});<br/>
        doSomethingToA(a);<br/>
        display(a);<br/>
        ...<br/>
        function doSomethingToA(object x) {<br/>
        x = appendElement(x, 4);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When "a" is a vector array, the function changes the original. However, if we use a delimited string instead, the function no longer changes the original.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, it is not practical from a performance perspective to copy every type. Are we thus sacrificing type purity for performance?
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the mental work-around is to assign a property to each type such as "referenceMe". If "referenceMe" is True, then the type is passed by reference. Thus, one could create user-defined types that behave either way.
