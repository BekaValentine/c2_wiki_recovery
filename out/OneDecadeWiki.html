        Hmm. Might be a good premise for a conference. Who would attend?

        <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a> talks about what happened with this particular Wiki.

        This is linked from <a href="OneYearWiki.html">OneYearWiki</a> where the reader was asked to reflect on a year of experience of wiki.

        So here I am thinking to reflect on more than 10 years of wiki. Why am I still coming here? Why do I care enough to do various maintenance chores week by week so that the <a href="ChangesInMonth.html">ChangesInMonth</a> stay in order? What do I get from this? Enough to keep on coming. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
