        Jeff Noon
      </h1>
      <p>
        English <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> author from Manchester.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best known work is his first (the curse of all authors), <em>Vurt</em> from 1993.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeff's writing stands out because he not only experiments with content (like a lot of <a href="SciFiAuthors.html">SciFiAuthors</a> do); he also experiments with form, without making it irritating or obscuring the content. Examples of this can be found in <em>Pixel Juice</em> (1998), where several stories segue into the next one, like one would find in music, and where some stories are remixed as poems; and in <em>Needle in the Groove</em> (2000), which is written as if it were song lyrics.
