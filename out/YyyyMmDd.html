        A precise pattern describing a <a href="DateStamp.html">DateStamp</a> which folks often can quickly grok without language barriers. It also sorts the same as a number or string and as a date type in most RDBMS (if zero-padded). Variations include a space or a dash between elements.

        <dd>  the year CE as a signed integer, ones in this decade have <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> <strong>201[0-9]</strong> -- This format is yNk compliant until y10k, if we want y10k compliance, allow any number of digits in this position. </dd>

        <dt>  <strong>Mm</strong></dt>
        <dd>  month, using leading zero for most of them.  <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>: <strong>0[1-9]|1[0-2]</strong></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>  <strong>Dd</strong></dt>
        <dd> day of month, always with two digits, if we ignore leap years and the <a href="ThirtyDays.html">ThirtyDays</a> litany, the <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> is: <strong>[0-2][1-9]|[123]0|31</strong> LeapYear will require a more specialized object.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        If you want a <a href="PointInTime.html">PointInTime</a>, just add <strong>.</strong><a href="HhMmSs.html">HhMmSs</a><strong> to the date.</strong>

        JuliusCaesar ignored the warning: <strong>Beware TheIdesOfMarch</strong>, and was assassinated on -430315.
        Perhaps it was after 10am and before 8pm: -430315.1

        <em>My personal favorite expression of date is a compressed text string with the three letter abbreviation of the month as the middle portion: 2011Apr25. Only one more character, and kinda hard to "misunderestimate" that one, eh?</em>

           But it doesn't sort correctly alphabetically.

        A different Anon replies, for my own use I've started using 2011_04Apr_25; this way the computer has the number for the month for easier sorting and the human (me) gets the 3 letter text for quicker comprehension.  Also, The way the breakdown is described, the titled version should be <strong>YYYYMMDD</strong> (uppercase = required, lowercase = ignore if zero). 
      </p>

        Also with <strong>[0-2][1-9]|[123]0|31</strong> LeapYear works fine, xxxx0229 is allowed just like xxxx0431.  A more specialized construct is needed if you don't want to ignore the <a href="ThirtyDays.html">ThirtyDays</a> litany, or block LeapDay on non leap years. And feel free to DeleteIfCooked my regex comment when it doesn't say the opposite of what it means.
