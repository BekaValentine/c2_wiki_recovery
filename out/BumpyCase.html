        Bumpy Case
      </h1>
      <p>
        The practice, in naming variables, subroutines and files in computer programming, is to combine words TogetherLikeThis. Capitalization divides words from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           keyboardInterrupt
        </li>
        <li>
           KeyboardHandler
        </li>
        <li>
           MailHeader
        </li>
        <li>
           mailHeader 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The alternatives to <a href="BumpyCase.html">BumpyCase</a> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           connect words with underscores, together_like_this
        </li>
        <li>
           or connect words with dashes, together-like-this
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="BumpyCase.html">BumpyCase</a> seems more amenable to using variations in capitalization to indicate distinctions than the underscore convention  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           For example, MailHeader is clearly a class while mailHeader is clearly an instance
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>clearly? I've seen capped ivars and downcased classes. Like anything, it depends on context.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Whereas file names and procedure names might utilize the dash-separated or underscore_separated type
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you go with <a href="BumpyCase.html">BumpyCase</a>, you have to decide whether to capitalize all the letters in an acronym or just the first one:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           PVCPipeLength
        </li>
        <li>
           or PvcPipeLength
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There is a problem with some languages and compilers in using the dash in naming is because the dash, or minus-sign, is used as an operator.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Underscore convention can be better with non-case-sensitive elements. If you have a PHP function doThis() there's nothing stopping you (or someone else) calling it as dothis(). do_this() enforces consistent separation.</em>
