        Wise And Fresh

      <p>
        Pattern: <em>Wise and Fresh</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ... the software system is complete, it's in production and works well (enough) but we are not satisfied with the way how one of its subsystems works and we want to redesign that part of the system. We need to choose the right people to work out the redesign. 
      </p>
      <code>
        ***<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If we assign the problem of redesign to people who made the working version of the system they will probably be in lack of new ideas because they have already thought a lot about the problem and used their best ideas to create the solution. 
        If we assign the problem of redesign to people who did not work on current version of the system they will probably overlook some important problems and lose a lot of time creating something that won't work.
        We need people with new ideas who won't overlook important parts of system functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore:
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a team, consisting of 1-2 people who did the working version of system and 1-2 people who did not work on current system version, to do the redesign. New developers will do the design and old developers will be there to say: "This won't work because of ..."
        New developers will generate ideas and also inspire the old developers to generate new ideas.
      </p>
