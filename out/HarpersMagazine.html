        Harpers Magazine

      <p>
        It's called reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, like me, you occasionally seek something different to read, then I recommend you give Harpers Magazine a whirl. I haven't missed an issue in over 10 years and it's always refreshing. A feature: most stories are short and can be read while eating a snack, or on the throne, or between snoozes on trains or airplanes.

        If your reading <strong>must</strong> have technical content, then you'll surely enjoy the first two articles of the August 1998 issue.  The first bemoans <a href="VisualProgramming.html">VisualProgramming</a>, and the second is a hilarious report from someone who wants to buy a vanilla PC with no Windows or MS-DOS software whatsoever loaded on the hard drive.
