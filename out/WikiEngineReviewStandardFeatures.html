        Wiki Engine Review Standard Features
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Standard Features of a Wiki</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a core set of features that I think all wikis have.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not the same as a core set of features that characterize a wiki -- see Wiki<something>, this is just the core set that I found in the wikis I have tried so far.  (Based on some comments (deletions) that I think <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a> made, some people would consider only the first three of these as features that characterize a wiki.)
      </p>
      <p>
        These will be mentioned in a review only by exception:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wiki pages can be created or edited by a significant portion of the user audience (often the entire audience).
        </li>
        <li>
           Typing a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> on a page creates an automatic hypertext link to the wiki page with that name.
        </li>
        <li>
           Most pages are named with a distinctive <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> that is typically several capitalized words "scrunched" together (like <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           There is a means to list all the wiki pages.
        </li>
        <li>
           There is a list of the wiki pages which have recently been changed (<a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           There is a  means to find all the pages that link to a wiki page (so you can backtrack).
        </li>
        <li>
           There is a simple text formatting language that is not HTML or any other standard markup language.  It is designed to be easy to use and readable in spite of the markups.  
        </li>
      </ul>
