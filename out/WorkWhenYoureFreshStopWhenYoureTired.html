        Work When Youre Fresh Stop When Youre Tired
      </h1>
      <p>
        When we are too tired to make good decisions, it can be a good decision to decide to stop making decisions for a while. --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> on the <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a>

        This is why even a partner is not enough to help follow this rule effectively, and we fall back on rigid numbers, like <a href="FortyHourWeek.html">FortyHourWeek</a>, as a reminder. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A better way of stating the rule is <a href="WorkWhenYoureFreshStopWhenYoureTired.html">WorkWhenYoureFreshStopWhenYoureTired</a>.

        Here's how I know I'm adhering to the spirit of the rule -- I don't look back often and say, "I knew I was being ineffective, but I was too far into the problem to realize it." --<a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> on <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a>

        I find that there are different kinds of work that I do better at various times of the day.  In the morning I am best at analysis.  In the late morning and early afternoon I'm best at the details of programming.  In the late afternoon I'm best at <a href="RandomActsOfLearning.html">RandomActsOfLearning</a>.

        I think it depends on the person.  Personally I like to enjoy my work and not be forced to do the work.  Usually I like to <a href="FrontLoad.html">FrontLoad</a> my time so I can rest up a bit easier later on in theory.  I sporatically get <a href="RandomActsOfLearning.html">RandomActsOfLearning</a> done duing my <a href="FrontLoad.html">FrontLoad</a> period and have to deal with less people at once to boot.  I still adhere to <a href="WorkWhenYoureFreshStopWhenYoureTired.html">WorkWhenYoureFreshStopWhenYoureTired</a>, I am still young for now and I can have longer runtimes than <a href="FortyHourWeek.html">FortyHourWeek</a>, but having <a href="RandomActsOfLearning.html">RandomActsOfLearning</a> in the middle helps relieve tiredness and makes you go on longer.-- <a href="ArchimedesTrajano.html">ArchimedesTrajano</a>
