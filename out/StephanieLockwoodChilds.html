        I majored in physics and Electrical & Computer Engineering as an undergrad, and tried to stay away from Comp Sci as much as possible -- finding programming a source of frustration rather than a proper Challenge (as opposed to something fun like math). I fell in love with Linux right after I graduated in '95 when I installed it on the first computer that was My Own. Having a system that was completely OPEN instead of being a Black Box, where you could learn by fixing things yourself, really appealed to me, and in the process of trying to understand and tweak my system I found myself enjoying coding. I now do both Linux system administration and coding for a living, and I enjoy learning new things that will help in either of those tasks. I love meeting with other developers who are excited about what they do and willing to share what they know.
