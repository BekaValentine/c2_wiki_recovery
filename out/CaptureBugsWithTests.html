        Capture Bugs With Tests
      </h1>
      <p>
        [From <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a> on the <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        When bugs are noticed he captures them in a test.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This advice is mission-critical, but the XP list implies it, not screams it. We should have a megabuck ad campaign to tell everyone to do this.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> works by only changing the code if you can write such a test as forces the change. If you have a bug, write a new case in your <a href="ProgrammerTest.html">ProgrammerTest</a>s that reproduces the bug, and fails because of it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure the test is as narrow as possible. Don't call the function 10 layers up from the function where the bug begins. Call that function itself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When the test fails due to the bug, squash it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Observe that writing the test should characterize the bug so thoroughly that squashing it becomes a mere formality. Expect instant success when you squash. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If not, hit Undo until the code's just like it was before the squash attempt, and review your situation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is: <strong>One test fails - Squash - All tests pass.</strong> Any other sequence isn't narrow and incremental enough.
