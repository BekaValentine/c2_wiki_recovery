        <a href="AlanRobertson.html">AlanRobertson</a> worked for Bell Laboratories for over 21 years. When I left in 2000, I was a distinguished member of technical staff. I went to work for SuSE - the German Linux distributor. When the IPO market soured, SuSE did a bunch of downsizing in the US, so I went to work for IBM's Linux Technology Center in March 2001. I've been working for the IBM since then.  In 2006 I moved out of the
        LTC into other activities in IBM.
