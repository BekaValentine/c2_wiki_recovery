        <a href="ExtremeMarketing.html">ExtremeMarketing</a> is an integrative part of <a href="ExtremeOpenBusiness.html">ExtremeOpenBusiness</a>, which is characterized by extreme openness in developing products/services, negotiating all financial aspects of contracts, ownership and transactions. Making all these normally hidden processes transparent to the public, supports Marketing by building trust. It's attractive like an interactive reality show.

        <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> has to translate to <a href="MarketingMessage.html">MarketingMessage</a> and vice-versa.
        The user drives usage, long-term adoption, and new requirements.
        It is the user, not the <a href="DecisionMaker.html">DecisionMaker</a>, <a href="PurchasingAgent.html">PurchasingAgent</a>, or TechnologyExecutive that makes for success.
        It's the humble user and its their true and proper <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> that has to be the foundation of the product.
        Whatever <a href="MarketingMessage.html">MarketingMessage</a> is being created must reflect the <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> at some level of abstraction (distortion) depending on how far from the real user the target of the message is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="HumanBehavioralPatterns.html">HumanBehavioralPatterns</a> type remark made by another contributor -> Unfortunately, the business needs of the business and the personal self-interests of the decision makers come before the desires of the users. If a company hired you to create a customer information tracking database. Would you still build this application even if the sales people, the ultimate end users, didn't want to share such information.<em> </em>

        At a very important level, <a href="ExtremeMarketing.html">ExtremeMarketing</a> is as badly needed as <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.
        It demands marketing (and sales) people teach higher-level people in customer organizations how to demand software that answers the real needs of their workers.
        If a <a href="MarketingMessage.html">MarketingMessage</a> can't be directly tied to a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> in one or two sentences, it's selling a different product. -- <a href="MartyHeyman.html">MartyHeyman</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="SpinBaller.html">SpinBaller</a>s to note -> In SPIN Selling, the seller does not "teach the customer", the seller is taught by the customer. This distinction is important because the buyer (or customer) has business domain knowledge that the seller doesn't have, the buyer has access to decision makers the seller doesn't have access to, and even if the seller knew for a moment what he was talking about, the buyer simply couldn't repeat to his colleagues the same words of the seller with the same kind of details and sincerity.<em> </em>

      </p>
      <p>
        In the 1990s, I was introduced to a procedure known as "Concept Engineering" which arose from a project at MIT. To gather requirements, this procedure specifies customer interviews with 2 man teams. One person is responsible for interacting with the interviewee while the second is responsible for writing down the points raised.

        There is now a book by Chuck Fresh, <em>Extreme Marketing and Promotion: Promoting and Protecting Your Small Business</em>, [[ISBN 1929554095]]. However, although it uses the same buzzwords, "Extreme" and "Marketing", is it really related to Extreme Programming?
