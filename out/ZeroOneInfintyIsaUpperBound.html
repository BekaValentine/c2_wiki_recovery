        Zero One Infinty Isa Upper Bound
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ZeroOneInfinity.html">ZeroOneInfinity</a> refers to your UPPER BOUND of how many.  To rephrase, given any resource which you may have UPTO n of, n ∈ {0, 1, ∞}.
        Again:
      </p>
      <code>
        let <em>R</em> = number of given resource you are actually using.<br/>
        At any time, 0 ≤ <em>R</em> ≤ <em>n</em><br/>
        where <em>n</em> ∈ {0, 1, ∞}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Not to say that the <a href="ZeroOneInfinityRule.html">ZeroOneInfinityRule</a> ONLY applies to this sort of situation, but I defy people to challenge when it DOESN'T apply to this situation.
        Actually, the other example might be SupportOneOrWhateverConfigurations.
        Or maybe this could all just be refactored into subtypes of EasilyExpansibleCodeBase--the counterpart (but not the enemy) to <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a>, combined to say YamNil, which expands to YaMightNeedItLater, which expands further to EncapsulateAndModularizeYourCodeSoYouCanAddStuffLaterWithMinimalPain, but that one's just too long for a good <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How much RAM should I support--or your OS will soon be left in the dust, or (if you somehow get a monopoly) people will sue for making RAM expansions worthless.
        </li>
        <li>
          IP addresses:  There WILL be more internet connections later, no matter what.
        </li>
        <li>
          Screen size:  Hardware limits don't apply to <a href="ZeroOneInfinity.html">ZeroOneInfinity</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Really, the upper bound is for how much you can <em>support,</em> not how much is <em>practical.</em>  Just because I CAN install 16GB of RAM on my system and have it be recognized, doesn't mean I WANT to.  However, now that I have said that, by Moore's law combined with the Law of Technological Obsolescence, in ten years (or less!) I'll look back at this page and think <em>Really?  Huh!  Nowadays, you can't even boot Linux without a good 50GB, and a TB or two for games.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        NOT examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bicycle wheels:  I need TWO wheels on my bicycle.  My upper bound is two <em>and my lower bound is two.</em>  In this case, it makes sense to hard-code two wheels.  (There are also other points against this one.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Tricycle wheels: I need THREE wheels on my tricycle...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="ZeroOneInfinity.html">ZeroOneInfinity</a> is hyperbole. The estimated number of protons in the universe is only on the order of 10^80. If we had 256-bit IP addresses (~10^77), running out simply won't be a problem... and, though we couldn't quite give an IP address to every proton, we could quite possibly have one for every OO-level object. When developing communications protocols, cryptography, filesystems, etc., knowing about real, physical upper-bounds can be quite useful.
