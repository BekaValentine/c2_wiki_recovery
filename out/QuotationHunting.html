        Quotation Hunting

        I remember reading a quotation from an ancient Greek, perhaps philosopher, who said something like "I have never regretted saying nothing."  Any takers?  I've been Googling for over 30 minutes, so obviously I've got something wrong.  Suggestions, hints and stray thoughts welcome.

        Shortly before 1905 someone announced that everything there was to learn about physics had been learned, and all that was left was to make more and more precise measurements.  Then Einstein published his theory of relativity.

        Can anyone place the quotation for me? I've been hunting on Google and <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, but nothing seems to be turning up.  I've obviously not got the key word(s).

        Thanks.

        I have also head this in the context of a recommendation to the young Einstein to avoid physics because there were nothing new to find. But this my be a popular myth or a misattribution of the quote.
