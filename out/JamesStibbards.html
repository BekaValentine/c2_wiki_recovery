        I'm currently working for Cloakware, doing technical pre-sales in software security and obfuscation technology.

        In another lifetime, I worked on Multics for Honeywell (see <a href="http://www.multicians.org/thvv/),">http://www.multicians.org/thvv/),</a> and in a more recent life, was an Consulting Analyst for Tandem Computers (now Compaq...er... HP... whatever)

        My interests include security, knowledge management, searching and linking technologies, and visualization, and 
        oh - model aircraft design.  I can be reached by <a href="mailto:stibb@ai.mit.edu.">mailto:stibb@ai.mit.edu.</a>
