        Knowledge Management Argue
      </h1>
      <p>
        I engaged my brain.  The discussion about how we should organise this page 
        belongs on a discussion about how we organise pages, so I've moved it again, to
        <a href="ArgueAgreeIdiomArgue.html">ArgueAgreeIdiomArgue</a>.  I hope that seems logical.  I think this page is a good
        place to argue points about <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a>, leaving that (KM) page as a
        place for a free-for-all.  But enough meta-discussion ! <a href="EdwardWelbourne.html">EdwardWelbourne</a>

        There follows the state of <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a> as at this date, in its original 
        Argue (ie threaded or diary) mode:

        [1 Feb, 1998; <a href="YeshaSivan.html">YeshaSivan</a>]:
        Knowledge Management is a new front for management.  It is the practice
        that deals with the many aspects of Knowledge.  Wiki seems to be some kind of a cool system to manage knowledge.  And since a friend said it is cool thing I'm testing it -- to see if it can serve in part in system that manage knowledge.
      </p>

        [July 20, 1998; <a href="YeshaSivan.html">YeshaSivan</a>]:
        Ok, few months have passed since I have created this page.  A friend, <a href="YonatSharon.html">YonatSharon</a>, has just told me, that few people have actually looked at this and have added some value.  I see that this may go somewhere.
        So here are few additions to the concepts, all taken from the work we do here
        in Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not going to define the term <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a>; this was done in other places; and I hope the <a href="BooksAboutKnowledgeManagement.html">BooksAboutKnowledgeManagement</a> will tell you all about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A related term to KM is <a href="KnowledgeInfrastructure.html">KnowledgeInfrastructure</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually when you start to think about how to do <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a> (as a person or as an organization) you can follow three steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Plan how to do KM.
        </li>
        <li>
           Implement the KM plan.
        </li>
        <li>
           Evaluate your implementation (and therefore update the implmenetation or the plan as needed).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This is what I call the <a href="PieModel.html">PieModel</a> (in this case of knowledge management).

        Yesha, I am interested to explore how Wiki could be used to advance the creation and sharing of knowledge.  Perhaps we should construct some sort of experiment here ?
      </p>

      <p>
        [July 18, 1998; <a href="DenhamGrey.html">DenhamGrey</a>]:
        I'm keen to experiment here as well. There seem to be interesting aspects of Wiki for <a href="KnowledgeAnnealing.html">KnowledgeAnnealing</a>, for CoAuthorship of documents, for JointWebsiteDevelopment, for studying EmerGence and for compiling a  <a href="DisTinctionary.html">DisTinctionary</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an interesting alternative conversational medium.

        [July 20, 1998; <a href="DenhamGrey.html">DenhamGrey</a>]:
        I have this feeling that there is a close link between patterns as a representation and process and knowledge. Here is a theory of knowledge presented in the form of a pattern <a href="KnowledgePattern.html">KnowledgePattern</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps we can explore this further at this site where both knowledge management and pattern folks have collected?

      <hr/>
      <p>
        [July 23, 1998; <a href="YeshaSivan.html">YeshaSivan</a>] again, I edited the top of the page to crate a clear distinction between the ropic -- KM -- and the discussion about the format.  Which led me to the follwing point:
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do I say that knowledge is linked with people and time?  Well, because i feel that knowledge without context is of lesser value.  There is an old saying "it is not what you know, but who you know" there is a lot hidden in this simple sentence.

        [July 25, 1998; <a href="RafaelTeixeira.html">RafaelTeixeira</a>] I can't understand what you're triyng to mesure..
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        [July 25, 1998; <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>] I've also been thinking about patterns and knowledge and computation. Patterns are powerful partly because they are generative grammars. Generative grammars are powerful. I'm groping towards some insight involving the <a href="ChomskyHierarchy.html">ChomskyHierarchy</a>, where simple languages are recognised by finite state machines, more complex ones by push-down automata, and the most complex need full Turing machines. There's some connection between the language we use for talking (and thinking), and the computational power of a Turing machine. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect this is utterly trivial stuff that I knew 15 years ago and I am just rediscovering :-(

      <hr/>
      <p>
        [July 25, 1998; <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>] On "Who you know" - provenance of ideas is important. If I know who wrote a page, I can discount for known stupidity, or pay more attention to known experts. This is important on the WWW because anyone can put up a web site containing any kind of rotten information. Schoolchildren need to be taught how to discriminate between web sources, and provenance is one of the tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a> is that because anyone can edit anything, the pages reflect, more or less, the consensus of the community. Bad stuff gets deleted, or at least annotated with an explanation of why it is bad. This means the provenance of individual paragraphs is less important for signalling quality. Rather then, "I'm not going to believe anything unless it has Ward's name on it", it's kinda enough to know Ward read it and didn't delete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This strikes me as rather radical and unlike the rest of the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        [August 4, 1998; <a href="ChristopheVermeulen.html">ChristopheVermeulen</a>] On "enough to know Ward read it"
        But again, how are you going to know that Ward read the page you 
        are referring to ? (and didn't delete it). Maybe the change is very recent,
        or re-posted regularly...
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, I wonder what happen when people would edit the same page at
        the same time. In other words, what about WikiSecurity, WikiFileLocking and
        the like ...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        [August 4; <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>] There are technical issues with this Wiki. They're solvable. It's possible to keep track of who read what and when, and who the author was, etc. Also to detect edit conflicts, to recover accidental or malicious deletions, and the like. You can't reason from the limitations of this Wiki to the limitations of all Wiki-like environments.

        [4Aug <a href="AustinDavid.html">AustinDavid</a>] In the sense of "manging useful information" all the above is great, and proven.  Has anyone actually listened to, or read, the real KM-speak?  It's either TheNextGreatThing (to save the world) or TheNextSnakeOil.  Patterns had this sort of effect on me, but they've always (mostly) been grounded in models, diagrams, and code.  <em></em><a href="RealKnowledgeManagement.html">RealKnowledgeManagement</a><em> (at least to the extent that I've been exposed) is more about buzzwords and doublespeak.  Anyone?  (no, I'm not bitter)</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        [7th August; <a href="DenhamGrey.html">DenhamGrey</a>] I agree there is much hype in the air around KM. The comments in this community on the superiority of patterns is an interesting case I think of <a href="GroupThink.html">GroupThink</a>. I have seen references and appeals to the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> and to logic, but patterns like process, carry a certain type of 'blindness', they too are social artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many who come to KM will depart with a sense of shallowness and may feel some snake oil but there is an interesting and lasting quality to working with knowledge that parallels the TQM movement. Those who wish to get something of lasting value from KM should look to the social aspects of collaboration, communion and critique, seek opportunity in new perspectives of work practice, learning, innovation and knowledge sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interesting connection between KM and patterns is the <a href="DataMining.html">DataMining</a> movement who seek to discover patterns in data streams. Data mining uses algorithms to serach for possible patterns and relies on people to interpret the significance and meaning of the 'discoveries'.

      <p>
        Wow.  I find myself somewhat bewildered by the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my own little world, KM is applied to storehouses of relevant data whose usefulness is directly a function of how it is interrelated, queried, and retrieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The business of <a href="DataMining.html">DataMining</a> is much more mechanical and more related to StatisticalAnalysis from a <a href="DataWarehouse.html">DataWarehouse</a> or similar construct.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main purpose (again, in my world) of KM is to shorten the learning and discovery paths for development, debugging, comparative evaluation, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this light, it is of primary importance that the knowledge be organized, indexed, and stored in ways optimized for human consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        A really good example of this is the program "HELP.EXE" from the DOS days.  It was eventually turned into a general purpose help engine with a database compiler that would take a body of marked up text and turn it into a searchable <a href="HyperText.html">HyperText</a> arrangement.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were HELP datbases for DOS BIOS functions, DOS commands, and so on.  You could search for key words or partial words, and relevant terms on the current page were linked to pages that explained them, with unlimited backward traversal.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are certainly more sophisticated ways of relating data, but this is one area where ease of use and essentially natural access aren't just "nice to have" but quite necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        A wiki might serve for such a repository, but note that this particular wiki doesn't seem to support general term searches.
