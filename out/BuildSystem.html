        Build System

      <p>
        I was surprised that I couldn't find a page describing what (I at least) would call a <a href="BuildSystem.html">BuildSystem</a>.  Maybe they're something that's only required by people doing largish scale <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> projects?  Or maybe I just failed to search effectively.  Anyway, here goes my definition - if I'm wrong then please feel free to delete this page and point me to the correct one. --<a href="DamyanPepper.html">DamyanPepper</a>

        A <a href="BuildSystem.html">BuildSystem</a> is the tool used as part of the <a href="BuildProcess.html">BuildProcess</a> to generate executable code from source code.  It is used day-by-day by developers to compile their code (and hence are generally the first thing for people to complain about.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="BuildSystem.html">BuildSystem</a>s generally have the following features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           ability to build different configurations (debug, release etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
           ability to support CrossCompiling to multiple platforms
        </li>
        <li>
           some concept of modules and their dependencies (library A is needed by executable B, so build A before B)
        </li>
        <li>
           ability to build a single module
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="BuildSystem.html">BuildSystem</a>s are usually built on top of an existing tool in such a way that users of the <a href="BuildSystem.html">BuildSystem</a> can do general tasks (like adding new source files or new modules) without posessing intimate knowledge of how the tool it is built upon works.  Examples of tools a <a href="BuildSystem.html">BuildSystem</a> may be built on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="MakeProgram.html">MakeProgram</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PerforceJam.html">PerforceJam</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="SconsBuildTool.html">SconsBuildTool</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="MozillaTinderbox.html">MozillaTinderbox</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CruiseControl.html">CruiseControl</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, tools like <a href="VisualStudioDotNet.html">VisualStudioDotNet</a> may also be considered to be a build system even though they are pretty self contained.  It is also rumoured to be possible to build a build system that generates <a href="VisualStudioDotNet.html">VisualStudioDotNet</a> vcproj files.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="BuildSystem.html">BuildSystem</a> may also have a built-in <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>/<a href="SmokeTest.html">SmokeTest</a> routine that runs on a regular basis, generating <a href="GreenBar.html">GreenBar</a>s (or not).
