        I am currently the Chief Information Officer at Inland Truck Parts Company. I worked as a coder from 1980 - 1994 myself and have always been interested in the development process. Specifically I am searching for better ways to make the interaction between business people and developers more meaningful to each group and more productive overall. I have pointed my staff at these pages for education and inspiration. My favorite gleaning from <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> so far is <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>'s "Requirements is a dialog, not a document." Now if I can just get all sides to understand this!
