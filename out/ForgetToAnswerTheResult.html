        Forget To Answer The Result
      </h1>
      <p>
        My single most common error in Smalltalk is to forget to answer the result of a method.  This was a very common error I used to make in C/C++ as well.  In those languages I solved it by never using them again.
      </p>

        In Smalltalk, I changed the method template to include ^result at the end.  Then I disciplined myself always to <strong>edit</strong> the template, not just replace the whole thing.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        I'm surprised you had that problem in C/C++. Modern compilers will warn you if you don't return the value that was declared, or if you try to use a result that wasn't declared. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        Perl uses the results of the last expression evaluated as the return
        value of a subroutine/method.
        But often the return value returns on the context (scalar or list) in which the
        subroutine/method is invoked.  Every so often...  <em>Oops.</em> --<a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>

        <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s tend to have well-defined return statements and in good style, they are quite vital and thus hardly missable. The common thing to return in a block is the last statement's return code. This was probably where it was copied to Perl from.
