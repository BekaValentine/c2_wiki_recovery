        Star Unit Auto Suite
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are two kinds of <a href="StarUnit.html">StarUnit</a>s in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first type, you must "register" every test_* method with its <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>, register every <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> with a <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>, and drop the root of this tree into a Run method.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the second type, the test runner scans the current folder for modules with _test on the end of their base name, scans each module for classes with _test on their end, and scans each class for methods that start with test_. Then the <a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a> builds the cases and suites needed, dyna-links to them, and runs them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Auto-suites for languages without copious reflection (such as C++) may use 'grep' and a sternly worded style guide.
