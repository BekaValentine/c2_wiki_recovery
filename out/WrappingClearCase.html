        Wrapping Clear Case
      </h1>
      <p>
        Big sophisticated users (Sun, HP, SGI, IBM,...) always wrap <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> to ensure their developers follow their defined <a href="SoftwareMethodology.html">SoftwareMethodology</a>.  As delivered <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> is a bit like a Swiss Army knife.

        Sometimes it really is wrapping "over" or around. But more often it is the case that instead of wrapping, triggers are used (so the existing interface doesnt have to be modified so heavily) and some extension commands are provided. That said, I currently work in a shop that "wraps" <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> ;-) -- <a href="BradAppleton.html">BradAppleton</a>

        Every kind of versioned object type may be customized in an O-O fashion if desired. There are binary "type managers" for plaintext, and binary files (and a few others), but you can easily inherit from an existing type to create your own type manager for language-specific files, or application-specific files (so, for example, I can teach it how to do "deltas" and comparisons/merges of MS-Word files if I like).

        Base <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> has no convenient "out-of-the-box" deployment process model. You have to roll your own, incrementally, rather than start with an existing thing and tweak it to your tastes. <strong>However</strong> - you get the latter with UCM <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> (which comes for free when you purchase <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a>), as well as a the ability to configure it extensively if so desired -- <a href="BradAppleton.html">BradAppleton</a>

        UCM is an acronym for UnifiedChangeManagement. UCM is meant to work in conjunction with ClearQuest, but you can use UCM with just <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a>.
