      <p>
        <a href="ZzoWiki.html">ZzoWiki</a> *was* a <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> program that uses PHP and does not use database created by vallab. <a href="http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/wiki/">http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/wiki/</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Different formatting codes than other wikis (In my opinion, better than other wikis)
        </li>
        <li>
           No image support (this is so others won't place pornography in your article)
        </li>
        <li>
           No list of changes to pages (you will have to make local copies of pages you want)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> words will not automatically convert to links (I find <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> words always converting into links is annoying, anyway)
        </li>
        <li>
           The main page cannot be edited, but other pages can
        </li>
        <li>
           You can use subdirectory page-names, such as: /<a href="DungeonsAndDragons.html">DungeonsAndDragons</a>/Healer
        </li>
        <li>
           It has a directory listing (which will list all pages in 1 directory, and list directories inside that directory, so you can go through it)
        </li>
        <li>
           The source-code is short
        </li>
        <li>
           Min. 15 characters and Max.1024000 characters (so that you do not have too much vandalism on the pages)
        </li>
        <li>
           Requires Apache web-server, it uses .htaccess file
        </li>
        <li>
           Open for suggestions
        </li>
        <li>
           Has script-commands, to almost make a programming language
        </li>
        <li>
           Edit requires you to put $ at the end of URL, which helps prevent vandalism
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>You need to fix your spelling. I was going to do it for you, but I examined your site, and you really need to take responsibility. Maybe you're just playing a joke.</em> Actually, this is not a joke. [I've fixed some of the spelling errors - please fix similarly in your initial page, and use a dictionary!] OK now I fixed the initial page. [It looks the same to me - for example, the first line is "Enybudy can edit the pages uv this wikiweb, you just hav to ad a doler-sine to the end uv the URL.", which contains seven spelling errors.] I just changed the links to point to the new file-names and deleted the old file-names.
