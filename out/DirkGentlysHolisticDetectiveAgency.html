        [ISBN 0671746723] Dirk Gently is a private detective who is more interested in telekinesis, quantum mechanics and lunch than fiddling around with fingerprint powder, so his investigations tend to produce startling and unexpected results. A simple search for a missing cat uncovers a bewildered ghost, a secret time-traveller, and the devastating secret that lies behind the whole human history and threatens to bring it to a premature end. Sadly the cat dies.

        More recently the <a href="SalmonOfDoubt.html">SalmonOfDoubt</a> has been published, which contains what seems to be what would have been the third <a href="DirkGently.html">DirkGently</a> story.  Had it been finished.  Or maybe not.  There was some discussion of using it to complete the Trilogy.  -- <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>
