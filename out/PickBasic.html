        Pick Basic
      </h1>
      <p>
        It is odd how little is known of <a href="PickBasic.html">PickBasic</a>. There is a lot of mythology surrounding it. It is true that it is a very dangerous tool to give to a disparate programming team. When you consider that this language goes back to the 60's, there have been many such programming teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dangerous languages are ones which allow the less well-directed programmer to succeed without really trying. At least if the solution to the real-world problem is the only measure of success. I love dangerous languages.

        Things I like about <a href="PickBasic.html">PickBasic</a> are -
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Abstraction - a variable is a variable. An address with a length. No more, no less. The name you choose for it is the variable.
        </li>
        <li>
           Abstraction - a variable is singular or plural (<a href="MultiValue.html">MultiValue</a>).
          <ul>
            <li>
               The value of "Variable.Name" is the same as "Variable.Name<1>" if "Variable.Name" is singular. "Variable.Name" is just a reference to an address, it could contain the values of many individual items.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Abstraction - a variable has no data type.
        </li>
        <li>
           Scope - A variable has scope within the source row. This is <a href="WysiwygScope.html">WysiwygScope</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Completeness - the database is integrated into the language.
        </li>
        <li>
           The database - despite the mythology, encourages design closer to the application domain.
        </li>
      </ul>

        My favourite flavour of Pick Basic is called Basic+ (DEC's BasicPlus is the next best basic) in OpenInsight <a href="http://www.revelation.com.">http://www.revelation.com.</a> Another flavour I like is Jbase <a href="http://www.jbase.com.">http://www.jbase.com.</a>
