        Pattern Specializes
      </h1>
      <p>
        A more specific pattern <em>specializes</em> a more general pattern if
        the specific pattern's full description is a direct extension of the
        more general pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, the specific pattern must deal with a
        specialisation of the problem the general pattern addresses, must have
        a similar (but more specialised) solution structure, and must address
        the same forces as the more general pattern, but may also address
        additional forces.  To make an analogy with object-oriented
        programming, the <a href="PatternUses.html">PatternUses</a>  relationship is similar to composition, while
        the <a href="PatternSpecializes.html">PatternSpecializes</a> relationship is similar to inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the GOFBook  <a href="FactoryMethod.html">FactoryMethod</a> specializes <a href="TemplateMethod.html">TemplateMethod</a>, because Factory
        Methods are effectively Hook Methods which are used by subclasses to
        specify the class of an object the Template Method in the superclass
        will create. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Specializes relationship can be used to identify abstract patterns by generalisation --- similar to the way inheritance can be used to identify
        abstract classes. For example, in 
        the <a href="DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion.html">DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion</a>, <a href="PatternSpecializes.html">PatternSpecializes</a> is used to introduce various Smalltalk versions of patterns. So <a href="ChainOfResponsibility.html">ChainOfResponsibility</a> specializes OoRecursion, <a href="PluggableAdaptor.html">PluggableAdaptor</a> specialises Adaptor, Bridge specializes CollaboratingHierarchies, Flyweight specialises Sharable.
