        Casting Anonymous Asparagus
      </h1>
      <p>
        Casting asparagus, anonymously or otherwise, is preferable to casting aspersions, and much tastier.

        <em>I personally like pickled asparagus.  It's damn fine eatin'.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe some anonymous asparagus (asparagi?) were cast in the video production <em></em>VeggieTales<em>.  Does that count?</em>

        <em>Yep!  Ma and Pa Asparagus, Junior Aspargus (a major character, no less), and that guy with the monocle who plays Alfred in the Larry-Boy series.</em>
