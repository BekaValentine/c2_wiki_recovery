        Biota Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TomRay.html">TomRay</a>'s success at evolving computer programs inspired the creation of Biota, a language and interpreter with a two-dimensional memory model and adjacency as its only addressing mode. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a sample Biota program, called flagellum, which incrementally rotates a series of digits, 1 to 5, such that the 5 remains connected to the 1 by the intervening digits and travels around the 5 in an approximation of a circle that completes after 1688 instructions:
      </p>
      <code>
        . . c .<br/>
        . . s . .      initial program counter<br/>
        t   g         /   (facing right)<br/>
        t   t        /                     initial data counter<br/>
        t   . t . . d                     /   (facing right)<br/>
        t   s   .     .                  /<br/>
        b   .   b . s s .               1 2 3 4 5<br/>
        . s s . b   .   b<br/>
        .     .   s   t<br/>
        u d t t t   t<br/>
        t   t<br/>
        g   t<br/>
        . . s . .<br/>
        . c . .<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Many instructions just move the data counter (DC)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>s</strong> -- straight: move DC in the current direction. Fail if that cell is empty.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>b</strong> -- backup: move DC opposite the current direction. Fail if that cell is empty.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>t</strong> -- turn DC right 45 degrees
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>u</strong> -- unturn: turn DC left 45 degrees
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>g</strong> -- go to a non-empty character ahead (tries to move DC straight ahead, then right and left 45 degrees, then 90, then 135, then back).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other instructons write to the memory at or near the data counter
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>c</strong> -- clear character at DC.  Fails if already empty.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>d</strong> -- duplicate the current data into the cell left of the DC.  Fails if source cell is empty or target cell is non-empty.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One instruction exists only to connect instructions into loops that the program counter follows
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>.</strong> -- no-op, a non-empty do nothing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Biota evaluator maintains program and data counters, both of which reference a character in the two-dimensional space and maintain a direction, up, down, left or right, which determines how they will advance. An instruction can turn the data counter, as with <a href="TurtleGraphics.html">TurtleGraphics</a>. The program counter turns when it finds an empty location or a failing instruction. Therefore, any instruction that can fail can be used as a conditional by simply placing an alternate sequence beside it. The dot (.) is a non-empty non-operation often used to complete loops. Complex programs are assembled by duplication and modification of functional domains. The flagellum program is a triply-nested loop where the midlevel loop is repeated twice. Biota includes a visualization module. Both single stepping and high speed execution are a joy to watch.

        Biota was packaged and sold publicly online in 1991. This disclosure predates <a href="BefungeLanguage.html">BefungeLanguage</a> by several years. The Smalltalk source code for Biota has been located along with the release notes for the package. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        I've had success with an implementation of <a href="SnuspLanguage.html">SnuspLanguage</a> in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> on a web page.  I think I've got a working implementation (a rotating flagella) on <a href="http://www.quirkster.com/js/biota.html.">http://www.quirkster.com/js/biota.html.</a> Tested on Safari and IE. A more object-oriented implementation in on biota-proto.html. -- <a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a>

        Yes, this is a faithful reimplementation of Biota.  What a thrill it was to see flagellum run again. I hope you felt some of the excitement I did when I got such a small and unusual program to do such an unusual activity as rotating a string of characters in place. I encourage others to give it a try. (Try reloading the page if you think initial conditions might not be right.) -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Regarding <a href="ArtificialLife.html">ArtificialLife</a>, I agree with Tom that the removal of embedded addresses in the instruction stream is the primary means to improve robustness under mutation. I disagree that a single dimension is the natural environment for evolving programs. I take my inspiration from membranes. I must admit, however, that I have yet to construct or evolve a self-duplicating program in Biota, so I am in no position to criticise his work. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
