        Vim Sucks Even Better
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ViSucks.html">ViSucks</a> but <a href="VimSucksEvenBetter.html">VimSucksEvenBetter</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But seriously, let's break it down. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There are CUA [<a href="CommonUserAccess.html">CommonUserAccess</a>?] editors like <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> and <a href="ExCode.html">ExCode</a> which we all know suck but sometimes there's nothing else handy ...
        </li>
        <li>
           There's pretty nifty shit like <a href="TextMate.html">TextMate</a> - but you have to pay someone and it's only on one platform. Hands up all professional programmers who want to be restricted to work on only one platform? 
        </li>
        <li>
           There's <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a>. Now we could get into a <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> but we all know that goes nowhere. I'll even agree that emacs <strong>was</strong> easier to script than <a href="BillJoy.html">BillJoy</a>'s original <a href="ViEditor.html">ViEditor</a>. But nowadays, what, you'd rather hack in <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> than in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>? <em>Hell yes!</em> Don't let the door hit you in the butt. <em>It's okay, it's slow enough to easily dodge.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               That raises the question: For those who <em>might</em>, myself included, wouldn't that mean the <a href="ViperSucksEvenBetterThanVim.html">ViperSucksEvenBetterThanVim</a>?
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Um, </em><a href="NonSequitur.html">NonSequitur</a>?<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               What? Where? I'll kill every <a href="NonSequitur.html">NonSequitur</a> I see.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Let me try again. I don't see how that follows. Can you please explain your thinking on this?</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               If I <em>would</em> rather program in <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> than in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, <em>and yet have a Vi-like editor</em>, then I would want Viper, the Vi emulation mode for Emacs. <a href="ViperSucksEvenBetterThanVim.html">ViperSucksEvenBetterThanVim</a>. --<a href="JesseMillikan.html">JesseMillikan</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           There's <a href="VimTextEditor.html">VimTextEditor</a>. Beautiful, open, all the bells and whistles either already baked in or easy enough to bolt on. It benefits strongly from having little old <a href="ViEditor.html">ViEditor</a> sitting inside it wheezing away so we <a href="OldFart.html">OldFart</a>s can feel at home. But even for newbies it just sucks the best, no question, no contest. It'll lift the polish from your toenails if you let it.
        </li>
      </ul>
