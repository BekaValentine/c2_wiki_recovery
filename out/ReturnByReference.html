        Return By Reference

        Were we talking about the C++ idiom...

      <code>
        const std::string & T<strong>'hisHereFunction();</strong><br/>
      </code>

        I am interested in the implications of using it or not using it in the context of some C++ code which is going to be called from a "soft" layer such as <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a> (Tcl). -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        In my opinion, you are better off returning a reference counted object by value. This makes it easier to manage the storage associated. Of course, something like std::basic_string< CharT > is already reference counted, so this doesn't apply here. Also note that if you are programming with <a href="ConstCorrectness.html">ConstCorrectness</a>, you should have no problems with mutability when returning a constant reference object by value. For an example implementation, check out <a href="CppCountedPointerImplementation.html">CppCountedPointerImplementation</a>. There are many others, this one strives to be similar to std::auto_ptr<T> except for its exclusive, as opposed to shared, owner semantics. -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        Actually, the C++ standard does not require std::string to be reference counted. The strings are mutable, so it is jolly difficult to make a reference counted implementation be both correct and efficient, especially in a multi-threaded environment.

        I thought about this problem a while back when SGI first introduced its <em>rope</em> classes based on just this argument. I decided there are a number of compromises that make this a workable situation. One does not have to abandon the performance provided by referenced counted, copy on write, strings. Of course, there is also the operator[] problem, but that can also be worked around. YMMV. -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        I think of this idiom as a performance optimization.
        IE: Client code should think of this function as if it were defined...
      </p>
      <code>
        std::string T<strong>'hisHereFunction();</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That is, a client can do this...
      </p>
      <code>
        std::string mystring = T<strong>'hisHereFunction();</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        but should never do this...
      </p>
      <code>
        const std::string & mystring = T<strong>'hisHereFunction();</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        By returning a const reference
        <em>(and telling clients they should act as if you're just returning the string),</em>
        you avoid the construction and destruction of one temporary object.
