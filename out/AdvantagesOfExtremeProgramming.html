      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The dangers of concentration on the abstract at the requirements/design stage of the software development cycle.</em>

        <li>
           <em>The necessity of reiteration in the cycle and in parts of the cycle.</em>

           <em>The loneliness the programmer and the stress caused by code reviews.</em>

        <li>
           <em>The difficulty in tracking true progress.</em>

           I'm <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a>. All I want to do in life is code, eat, have relations, and sleep. Each following <a href="BestPractice.html">BestPractice</a>s.

        <li>
           Without a team practicing XP, or similar <a href="BestPractice.html">BestPractice</a>s, I can't just code.
        </li>

           The team enforces worst practices that cause "<a href="ProcessWaste.html">ProcessWaste</a>", then they enforce other worst practices to clean up.

        Observed bottlenecks to productivity:

           My colleague 
          <ul>
            <li>
               wrote a class I can't fix
            </li>
            <li>
               delayed integration, causing bugs
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           My team 
          <ul>
            <li>
               does not run <a href="DailyBuild.html">DailyBuild</a>s
            </li>
            <li>
               does not maintain <a href="CommonBuildEnvironment.html">CommonBuildEnvironment</a>s
            </li>
            <li>
               does not run my tests every 10 edits
            </li>
            <li>
               treats test failures as bugs I caused by testing too much
            </li>
            <li>
               insists on using languages like <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> that resist flow; by locking up the editor each time you run the <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               insists on using languages like <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> that resist refactoring
            </li>
            <li>
               culture equates "<a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a>ing" with "rework" and "adding bugs", despite overwhelming evidence that fewer code lines makes for less bugs and easier upgrades
            </li>
            <li>
               strictly limits my ability to converse with a real "customer", because I might freak them out
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Code without tests derails my code (with tests), so I must run the debugger I was trying to avoid
        </li>
        <li>
           Other team members (and management) don't agree that running the automated tests is a requirement for checking in the code.  So they regularly change the code "away" from the tests, breaking them.  And I don't have the time to do "the other half" of their jobs.
        </li>
        <li>
           My boss 
          <ul>
            <li>
               ordered my colleague not to sit next to me and help
            </li>
            <li>
               ordered me not to check my tests into the house version control system, because "we already have too many modules in it" (mostly <a href="CodeFork.html">CodeFork</a>s)  [<a href="FearOfAddingClasses.html">FearOfAddingClasses</a>]
            </li>
            <li>
               tells me my time estimates instead of the other way around
            </li>
            <li>
               refuses to prioritize features in business order, "because you might get the architecture wrong"
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Our customers refuse to accept frequent releases because they are familiar with vendors using them as their free Quality Control teams
        </li>
      </ul>
