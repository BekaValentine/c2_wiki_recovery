           Collaborative Filtering for Weblogs - It occurred to me the other day that one could discover communitites of related weblogs by analyzing commonalities in the pages they hyperlink to.  Using this information, a weblog aggregator could recommend articles from different weblogs by observing the types of articles a particular user typically reads.  Commonalities between usage information can subsequently be used as feedback to strengthen the collaborative filtering effect.  I'm currently implementing this as the next version of <a href="http://www.motherlog.com/">http://www.motherlog.com/</a>

           Uber - Fantasy programming language/thought exercise based on the premise that the internet has been grossly underutilized in support of software reuse.  This project is rambunctiously unencumbered by the requirement to ever be implemented.
