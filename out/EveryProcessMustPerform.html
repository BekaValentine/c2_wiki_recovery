        Every Process Must Perform

      <p>
        Borrowed from JamesGoebel's post on the <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a> (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/43372):">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/43372):</a>

        If you push XP you will receive resistance. Instead I would suggest that
        you start documenting key metrics that every process must perform. If you
        can get everyone to agree to those, then you will be in a better position to
        argue that XP is appropriate later.

        For example...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All production code must have unit tests.
        </li>
        <li>
           All developers must run the entire suite of unit tests every day.
        </li>
        <li>
           All unit tests must pass before and after code integration.
        </li>
        <li>
           All production code must be signed off by one peer. That peer is signing up to have that code be part of their annual performance review.
        </li>
        <li>
           All project plans must be broken into tasks of no longer than 2 weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
           An updated project plan must be submitted to management every 2 weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
           Task completion is reported on a 0% or 100% done, never 90%.
        </li>
        <li>
           Key parts of the system must have multiple resources familiar with the code.
        </li>
        <li>
           There is a single individual responsible for scope change sign off.
        </li>
        <li>
           Teams must demonstrate the software to management every two months, even if the early demos are boring UML diagrams.
        </li>
        <li>
           All teams must report status to the project manager daily, either through a written report or verbally.
        </li>
        <li>
           Projects that must produce documentation must have a business analyst skilled in writing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Don't argue about the quality of your horse. Instead focus on setting up
        the obstacle course in a way will appeal to management, and yet be easy for
        you to clear most of the obstacles.

        I like this concept a lot. It appeals to the scientist in me. Who cares how it works as long as it works? A lot of the problem of <a href="AdoptingXp.html">AdoptingXp</a> is communicating the need for it (see <a href="FirstCreateTheMailbox.html">FirstCreateTheMailbox</a>).
