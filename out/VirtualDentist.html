        Virtual Dentist
      </h1>
      <p>
        A most interesting application of Virtual Reality simulation environments is in the dentist's chair:  ...to keep the patient distracted while the dentist drills out your teeth.
        If your dentist doesn't offer a VR headset for long procedures like fillings and root canals, <strong>get a new dentist.</strong>
      </p>

        Equipment:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>VCR</strong> - to play tapes.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Visor with "TV" screen</strong> - for viewing.  (OK if screen is small and seen by one eye.)
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>earphones</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Less stress for patient:  A good film can be pleasantly distracting.
        </li>
        <li>
           Patient moves less, making it easier for the dentist to operate.
        </li>
        <li>
           Procedures typically take less time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Selection of tapes, for your viewing pleasure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           cartoons for the kids
        </li>
        <li>
           music video for the older kids
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Drilling is noisy; avoid films with important dialog, as the patient will miss much of it.  Prefer films that are highly visual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid mystery and suspense films, unless the patient can take the tape home to see how it ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid extremely funny movies; it's hard to work on a patent who's laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recommended films:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Jesus Christ, Superstar"
        </li>
      </ul>
