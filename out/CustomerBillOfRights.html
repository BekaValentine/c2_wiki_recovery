        <strong>Customer Bill of Rights</strong>

      <p>
        <strong>You have the right to:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Declare the business priority of every <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Have an overall plan, to know what can be accomplished, when, and at what cost.
        </li>
        <li>
           Get the most possible value out of every programming week.
        </li>
        <li>
           See progress in a running system, proven to work by passing repeatable tests that you specify.
        </li>
        <li>
           Advise developers of changes in the requirements
        </li>
        <li>
           Be informed of schedule changes, in time to choose how to reduce scope to restore the original date.
        </li>
        <li>
           Cancel project at any time and be left with a useful working system reflecting investment to date.
        </li>

        An alternative to
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Advise developers of changes in the requirements
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        has been suggested:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           change your mind, to substitute functionality, and to change priorities without paying exorbitant costs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that the first version might more properly be considered a responsibility, while the latter is clearly a right.

        An Agile project can ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           implement features in any order
        </li>
        <li>
           release any integration
        </li>
        <li>
           minimize the average time between specifying and profiting from a feature
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So you achieve item 1 when the developers don't mind if you change the priority of userstories in the project backlog.
      </p>
      <p>
        You achieve item 2, short term, when you and the team learn how to estimate many small bite-sized stories, and you get good long-term estimates by comparing past rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        You achieve item 3 by actually putting the system into production (or a simulation), early and often. You never need to endure long blackouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers deliver 4 by giving you StoryTests that reflect your own verbiage back as passing tests, using <a href="BehaviorDrivenDevelopment.html">BehaviorDrivenDevelopment</a>. These tests allow developers to release any integration - even one just after you changed your mind!
      </p>
      <p>
        Because developers write several layers of automated tests, you can generally change requirements early and often. The cost of a given feature does not go way up as the system builds beyond it. So item 5 doesn't mean programmers are not allowed to grumble (or are required to work for free) if you change your mind - or if reality changes it for you. Programmers are expected to create a system that's easy to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get item 6, your developers expect to use DailyDeployment - even if just to a simulation. If they can't, for any reason, their system has spontaneously raised a red flag. The best possible way to respond is renegotiate scope. The developers should _never_ cut quality, just to make a deadline, because the average time for each feature will then inevitably go up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Item 7 means programmers decrease the odds of a canceled project simply by always striving to behave as if their current week were going to be their last. They always make sure they have created something of value - not just a bunch of build scripts, database tables, diagrams, and disconnected functions - each week. They make sure they only add code that supports live, useful features.
