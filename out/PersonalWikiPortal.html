        Personal Wiki Portal
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is plenty of discussion about a <a href="WikiPortal.html">WikiPortal</a> as a way to "join" views across multiple Wiki's. My thought is that the value of a <a href="WikiPortal.html">WikiPortal</a> is as a personalisable view into a single Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to set up a <a href="MyWiki.html">MyWiki</a> view into <strong>this</strong> wiki. It would allow me several panes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Customised recent changes (how old, what fields to show)
        </li>
        <li>
           Content filters (what pages have content related to which subjects)
        </li>
        <li>
           Category filters (what pages have which categories)
        </li>
        <li>
           Author filters (what pages have significant contribution/were started by which authors)
        </li>
        <li>
           What else?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I suppose this wouldn't even have to be implemented on the "base" c2.com servers. I would think that it could be cobbled together from a commercial portal package fairly easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Would this be useful to anyone else? What other "views" would be valuable? How easy would this be to actually implement? -- <a href="BillBarnett.html">BillBarnett</a>

        What if you were able to register your interest in specific pages so that Wiki would notify you when they changed? Forward you either a link to the page, or a diff showing what changed?
      </p>
      <p>
        That would be wonderful!  Let me choose link, diff, or <em>copy</em> of the page!

        This would feel nice as a redirect service, i.e: I can create a service that I point at c2.com that filters the recent_changes, or looks for changes on topics. -- <a href="PaulSimmons.html">PaulSimmons</a>

        See <a href="http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?UnifiedRecentChanges">http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?UnifiedRecentChanges</a> to see how this is already possible. See how DaveJacoby already has a "personal wiki portal" to <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> at least at <a href="http://csociety.ecn.purdue.edu/~jacoby/Portal.">http://csociety.ecn.purdue.edu/~jacoby/Portal.</a> Not difficult. Use <a href="http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RichSiteSummary.">http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RichSiteSummary.</a> Also see <a href="http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CategorySyndication">http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CategorySyndication</a> for ideas on copying content, and <a href="http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?DailyMe">http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?DailyMe</a> for another similar idea.

        Also sounds like great features for a <a href="WikiBrowser.html">WikiBrowser</a>.
