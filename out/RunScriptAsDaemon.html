        Run Script As Daemon
      </h1>
      <p>
        Separate the script from the web server process and thus rid ourselves of the overhead of reading in the db/index(es) every time a page is loaded.  (mod_perl is another way to do this)

      <p>
        Does this mean using <a href="FastCgi.html">FastCgi</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        No, mod_perl and <a href="FastCgi.html">FastCgi</a> are two different ways of avoiding creating a process for each hit. mod_perl works by basically loading your Perl program into the Apache process that serves the pages, while <a href="FastCgi.html">FastCgi</a> is a way to have an external process serve more than a single page, so that you amortize the cost of the process creation over a bunch of pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The anecdotal evidence I've heard about <a href="FastCgi.html">FastCgi</a> is that it's pretty complex and decreases robustness.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you really want robustness, try rewriting Wiki as an Apache C module. That's what I did for Advogato, and the scalability is just delicious - it gets <a href="SlashDotted.html">SlashDotted</a> on a regular basis without seriously affecting the load on the server, and all the content on the site is dynamically rendered from an <a href="XmlDatabase.html">XmlDatabase</a>. -- <a href="RaphLevien.html">RaphLevien</a>  <em>[On the other hand, </em><a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> itself is written using mod_perl. --anon]<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do you just have a large XML file, or are you actually using one of the new </em><a href="XmlDatabaseServers.html">XmlDatabaseServers</a> that are out?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It lives in the filesystem, but as a bunch of smaller files, not as one big one. From a programming point of view, there is an abstraction layer that hides the implementation. I thought about using BerkeleyDb, but for now am more than happy with the performance of the filesystem-based approach. And, it's simple! -- <a href="RaphLevien.html">RaphLevien</a>

        The current <a href="WikiWikiGoesPublic.html">WikiWikiGoesPublic</a> version of Wiki is not terribly mod_perl-friendly, since it is largely perl4ish, and uses a <em>lot</em> of global variables, which generally translate to problems in fcgi or mod_perl. I am looking at doing a mod_perl-friendly version of <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>, FWIW, although mainly because it might be fun, rather than for any (other) good reason! -- <a href="HowardJones.html">HowardJones</a>

        <dd>If you're looking to write a mod_perl friendly wiki, you might want to check out <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a>.  It also has lots of global variables, but they are <em>all</em> pre-declared, and most of them are initialized on every request.</dd>

        I strongly recommend mod_perl. The whole <a href="http://virtualschool.edu/98c">http://virtualschool.edu/98c</a> website is based on it. I've only good things to say about mod_perl (for perl) and jserv (for java).

        ... or mod_python for the enlightened ;-).   <a href="http://www.modpython.org/.">http://www.modpython.org/.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If your script is written in python, you can try mod_python for simple stuff, or <a href="WebwareForPython.html">WebwareForPython</a> or <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> for more complex stuff. If you use either of these last two, you will certainly want to investigate <a href="PoundReverseProxy.html">PoundReverseProxy</a>.
