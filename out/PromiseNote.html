        Hopefully this does/will not violate any DigiCash patents by David Chaum or Stefan Brands , I *think* any patents are on the mathematical process for a small (dozen byte) certificates and that any patently obvious <a href="PlainText.html">PlainText</a> IOU should be safe...
      </p>
      <p>
        Would it be better to have a key ID rather than a FingerPrint ?  Is the date of issue redundant since that information is in the signature, or is it a convienient back up?
      </p>
      <p>
        The void if prohibited by law seemed a reasonable thing at the time, but is that just begging a law to prohibit it?
      </p>
      <p>
        did I speak to soon? Below is from a report (the CMC one[1]) to the Australian Tax Office
      </p>
      <p>
        "There have been suggestions for both forms of regulation. The Working Group on European Union Payment Systems has recommended that only 'credit institutions' be permitted to issue smart cards.  This requires the issuing institution to conform with the prudential requirements of the central bank or other supervising authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regulation of transactions has also been suggested. So, for example, it has been suggested that fully anonymous payment systems be prohibited, that smart cards be regulated to contain, or not to contain, certain information and be restricted to values below some ceiling."
      </p>

        <em>Tax offices hate anonymous money. They'd ban all convertible instruments if they could.</em>
