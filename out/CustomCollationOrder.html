        From discussion on <a href="EvidenceDiscussion.html">EvidenceDiscussion</a> about <a href="FunctorVsClosure.html">FunctorVsClosure</a> and the use of <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s and <a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a>s in general, the following challenge is set:

      <p>
        "Given a list of SKUs, sort them so that those starting with letters are sorted alphabetically, the numeric ones have to be sorted numerically (and appear strictly after all the alphabetic ones) including the ones with a dash in column six but they have to appear just before the 'P'-coded SKUs (i.e., those that start with a 'P')."

        Constructing a string on which to sort -- which is the usual way to handle this sort of problem in SQL -- seems a bit dirty, but it's simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What's this demonstrating exactly?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You proposed SQL and other approaches as alternatives to HOFs on <a href="SummaryOfHofExamples.html">SummaryOfHofExamples</a>. On <a href="EvidenceDiscussion.html">EvidenceDiscussion</a>, you wrote, "[a]nyhow, without exploring a specific specification and written pattern, it's difficult to say which is the ideal here. There are many ways to skin a cat with two birds." 
      </p>
      <p>
        So, here's a specific specification of an example of a typical problem encountered in custom business application development. I've solved it using a Java 8 <a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a> passed to the built-in Collections.sort <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>. Perhaps you can show how some of the alternatives to HOFs that you've suggested compare to it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What does the HOF get you? It's looks like a one-off kind of problem. (Note that if you have several millions of these, then doing it in RAM may cause problems, but I'll ignore that issue for time being.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The HOF enables you to inject the specification of the custom collation order into the general-purpose sort algorithm implementation, which makes it a practical demonstration of the <a href="HofPattern.html">HofPattern</a>.  It means handling a "one-off kind of problem" like this doesn't require writing a new one-off 'sort' algorithm implementation or altering an existing one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, RAM is a limitation in this particular example.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm sorry, I'm not seeing what the HOF is getting one. Your explanation is not clear to me in terms of practical issues. I don' know what you are comparing it to in your mind that is worse in production. And I don't want to make an SQL version because we'd be comparing SQL to Java, which creates other language-related comparison issues besides HOF's</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What the HOF is "getting one" is the ability to inject a customisation (a custom collation order) into a generic algorithm (sort).  See <a href="HofPattern.html">HofPattern</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        What I'm <strong>hoping</strong> to compare this to is your list at the bottom of <a href="SummaryOfHofExamples.html">SummaryOfHofExamples</a>, where you suggest a number of alternatives to HOFs but don't explain how they're alternatives.  I've compared <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s with <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s/<a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a>s on <a href="FunctorVsClosure.html">FunctorVsClosure</a>, which presumably covers your "objects" alternative, but what about the rest?

The reason a "tri-flux capacitor", er, <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>/<a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a> approach is "better than other cars" is because, as I pointed out above, "it means handling a 'one-off kind of problem' like [a <a href="CustomCollationOrder.html">CustomCollationOrder</a>] doesn't require writing a new one-off 'sort' algorithm implementation or altering an existing one."<em></em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           Why would we have to alter the sort algorithm if HOF's never existed? A <strong>method could be used to define a compare operation</strong> for a given array/list instance, if the API's and/or language is so designed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>In other words, you're talking about an alternative where 'sort' is defined as a base class, and its 'compare' method is defined as an override-able method?  Levering inheritance to implement a customisation of a base class </em>'is<strong> a form of altering an existing implementation.  For one-off </strong><a href="CustomCollationOrder.html">CustomCollationOrder</a>s like that shown here, it would generally be fine.  However, as a general strategy, the <a href="DependencyInversionPrinciple.html">DependencyInversionPrinciple</a> suggests that <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> (such as via HOFs or <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s) is preferable.<em></em>

           <a href="DependencyInversionPrinciple.html">DependencyInversionPrinciple</a> is a weak principle, in my opinion. It's a "rule of thumb" to keep an eye out for, but should be weighed against other issues. And I would not expect custom software to have gazillion nor often-changing comparing strategies for reasons covered at <a href="EvidenceDiscussion.html">EvidenceDiscussion</a>. -t
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>There's no mention of a "gazillion nor often-changing comparing strategies", so I'm not sure why that's an issue.  One custom strategy -- like that shown here -- is sufficient.

        <li>
           I'm not even sure it violates DIP. But rather than get into a likely vocab fight, how about you demonstrate a practical and relatively likely "problem" caused by the overriding technique mentioned?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>There's no overt problem, but as a general strategy there's a limitation:  You can only create customisations statically, via inheritance.  In languages that support dynamic classes or prototypes this is less of an issue, but it means customisations can not be generated programmatically.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           OOP can be as static or as dynamic as a language/API want's to make it. But more important, I don't see a common need to programmatically generate program-defined custom collation orders. As mentioned in <a href="EvidenceDiscussion.html">EvidenceDiscussion</a>, if we wanted to make collations power-user-configurable, then we can study various UI's for that, perhaps similar to email filter UI's, or something else as found in <a href="BusinessRulesMetabase.html">BusinessRulesMetabase</a>. I imagine it would have (optional) groupings, priority levels, comparison types, standard collating sequences (EBIDIC, ASCII, etc.), case control, trimming, and probably something similar to Regex's. In general, it appears to me you are getting "meta-happy", trying to find uses for meta-ness where none really exist, or at least the benefits are relatively small compared to <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>/staffing issues such that <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>/staffing issues either over-power parsimony/symbolic-elegance, or make it difficult to get a clear evaluation. Back to the good ol' <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Indeed, program-defined custom collation orders are relatively rare.  Situations like the so-called "Brady Bunch Intro" example at </em><a href="http://shark.armchair.mb.ca/~dave/hofajax/">http://shark.armchair.mb.ca/~dave/hofajax/</a> or the code simplification at <a href="http://blueskyworkshop.com/topics/Java-Pages/lambda-predicate/">http://blueskyworkshop.com/topics/Java-Pages/lambda-predicate/</a> are more common examples of the application of HOFs/lambdas that don't have simple alternatives.<em></em>

        <li>
           I disagree, but I'll leave the "Brady Bunch" dispute at <a href="NodeJsAndHofDiscussionTwo.html">NodeJsAndHofDiscussionTwo</a> rather than reinvent it here.

           "Simplification" is in the eye of the beholder. I place grokkability and good modularization over code size at times. Anyhow, let's not reinvent the usual debates here.

           Are you introducing a new example, or is this intended to be related to collating? If it's new and you wish to discuss it, a new topic may be in order. My initial survey is that it's proving <a href="GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a> and is unknowingly making a case for TOP and TOP-friendly languages (<a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>). -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I'm not introducing anything new, merely continuing the thread.  To recap:  I asked you about the code simplification example.  You responded with "'simplification' is in the eye of the beholder" and said you value "grokkability and good modularization over code size".

      <ul>
        <li>
           If you mean the "blueskyworkshop" link, the first one is the most grokkable and strait-forward. I suppose if one is not allowed to use a RDBMS, or SQL on collections (some languages or std. libraries allow SQL or at least WHERE-clause-like string queries on RAM collections), and one really does need to create a query-like interface, then the final example shown is consolation prize. An OOP "override" interface is probably also possible for that. Please don't ask me to make an example, I don't want to at the moment. (An Eval can also be used process a query-like expression.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Imagine that a user employs Eval in a language with </em><a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a>s and <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s without knowing how either are implemented or what <a href="LanguageParadigm.html">LanguageParadigm</a> may have inspired them.  From that user's point of view, Eval performs exactly same operation as a <a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a> passed to a <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>, except that instead of specifying it in native syntax it has to be constructed as a string with appropriate delimiters and escape characters, it usually can't reference variables directly (because it doesn't implement closure), any external data must be filtered or avoided in order to prevent code injection, it has to be explicitly passed to an Eval() function instead of being invoked like a function, and it inevitably runs slower.  Why would that user (or any user, for that matter) choose Eval over <a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a>s/<a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s?<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Eval may be better suited for a hobby project than production. But it does have the ability to be supplied or <strong>stored externally</strong> from the EXE or script (in files, DB tables, URL parameters, etc.) such that one doesn't have to change the EXE or script to change a query. Note that it is possible to "capture" pre-passed scope by appending/inserting a current value: "a + b + " & c & " + d"; where "c" is a current-scoped variable, and "&" is for concatenation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What, in this circumstance, makes Eval better for </em>anything<em> let alone a hobby project?  An equivalent lambda expression could be specified as a + b + c + d with no labour over delimiters or dereferencing variable 'c', which I hope doesn't contain external data or you're inviting code injection.  Why would you risk a plethora of security, performance and reliability problems caused by storing native application code in a table and executing it in the same space as the application -- which I presume is intended to allow </em><a href="PowerUser.html">PowerUser</a>s to edit formulae and the like -- rather than safely embedding one of the various interpreters (usually implementing a dialect of Lua, Python or Javascript) made for that purpose?<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What if we <em>want</em> to store expressions and formulas in a database table so that power-users can edit and manage them? I realize there are parsing libraries available for some languages, but not all. Or use the Eval approach for <strong>prototyping</strong>, and then hard-wire the formulas later for production (or refine parametric interfaces using them).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Storing expressions and formulae in a database table so </em><a href="PowerUser.html">PowerUser</a>s can edit them is fine.  The secure and safe way to permit that is to embed a scripting language or expression parser.  Letting the code in your database table have unrestricted access to your application's address space is a recipe for disaster.  I can imagine using the Eval approach <strong>briefly</strong> for prototyping, but given that embedding a scripting language or expression parser is straightforward, I can't imagine leaving it in place for more than a minute or two.  It might be left in place for a while if the project was waiting for some other developer to deliver the scripting language, but even then I'd rather print the language statements to a debugging console than execute them.<em> </em>

           The trade-off decisions for risk versus time versus resources etc. is ultimately with the manager/owner. In practice they often want to skip security safeguards to "get it out" and/or save money. Beyond making recommendations, it's usually not the developer's call. If the owner of a company wants to knowingly gamble with security, that's his/her prerogative; it's their money, not yours. (Practice prudent CYA, such as documenting your recommendations against risky practices.) Some owners will indeed suggest that they'd accept say a 1/3 chance of being hacked to be first-to-market with Widget X.

           ["Technically, there is almost never a reason to prefer Eval over an embedded… language" means "there is almost never a technical reason to prefer Eval over an embedded… language", which is an eminently reasonable assertion. These have been covered already, but for completeness: Eval approaches demand a more elaborate parser and hence reduce performance, the ability to eval at all is typically restricted to interpreted languages or alternatively demands that a compiled binary also include a copy of the compiler itself, and there're myriad security concerns arising from the approach -- there are no technical benefits of Eval over a simplified, scope-restricted, secure expression parser, and many technical downsides. Thus, as claimed, there's no technical reason to prefer Eval over embedded scripting or expression-evaluation languages. There might however be project-management reasons to select Eval over alternative approaches, such as wildly restrictive time constraints. -DavidMcLean]

           "Technically" doesn't technically meany anything sufficiently clear. Tools are evaluated based on weighing tradeoffs. The importance of the factors being weighed per tool feature is up to the customer/buyer. If they intentionally value quick-and-cheap over other factors, that's their prerogative. "Technically" means nothing in that context. Optimize choices for stated goals. Machines don't invent the goals and thus no "technical" automaton is involved in setting the goals (at least in this decade). It's a human selecting the goals, not <strong>technical</strong> equipment. We build rockets because we want to go to the stars. No machine told us to go the stars; <strong>machines and math don't give a shit</strong> either way.

When I do sort arrays, the built-in collation is usually plenty fine.

Perhaps an OOP-ish technique can do the job in this case. What technique? How? How does it differ from the higher-order-function technique? Incidentally, is a higher-order function <em>really</em> a fundamentally distinct and unfamiliar language idiom? A call to a higher-order function is not particularly different from any other function call, after all -- it runs some code, using its arguments to customise the code that's run, and returns a value -- with essentially the only distinction being in the expected argument types. Is "function" really such an esoteric, unfamiliar type to be passed around? It's standard practice in OO to pass around objects, and it's quite common to pass an object to inject a certain method implementation into some code (i.e., <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>), so OO devs will already be fairly familiar with the concepts and implications behind the ability to pass functions around.

Thus, OO devs are already entirely familiar with first-class and higher-order functions in most respects; for most cases, all that needs to be picked up is the new syntax, and learning syntax alone is easy.
