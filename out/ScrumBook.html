        I was quite impressed by this book. I rank it on par with <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExplained.html">ExtremeProgrammingExplained</a>. In my view, what XP has done for software engineering, Scrum will do for software project management. After reading this book, and then <a href="AgileSoftwareDevelopmentEcosystems.html">AgileSoftwareDevelopmentEcosystems</a>, I found a renewed understanding of the underpinnings of <a href="AgileMethodologies.html">AgileMethodologies</a>. I believe these three are the triple-crown of the agile books out there, and I've read a lot of them. The stuff that was missing or vague from my studies of XP have been answered by Scrum, and vice-versa. Interestingly, <a href="MikeBeedle.html">MikeBeedle</a> promotes his own marriage of the two as 'XBreed'. Personally, I think XBreed is a bit weak in the XP area, but it is interesting nonetheless.
