        Logical Indexing
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="LogicalIndexing.html">LogicalIndexing</a> is a language construct in <a href="MatLab.html">MatLab</a> that creates a view into a matrix, which can be extracted or modified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
      </p>
      <p>
        A(A == 3) = 5;
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement has the following effect: The inner part, A == 3, is evaluated like any normal matrix expression, resulting in a matrix containing logical values whose element is true if the corresponding element in A equals 3, false otherwise. When this expression is used to index A, namely A(logical_expr), it becomes a view into the matrix selecting the elements for which the corresponding logical element is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        data = ... % some data source resulting in a cell array
        rowMatches = strcmp(data(:, colName), nameToFind); % a column vector of logical values, true if matching nameToFind
        data(rowMatches, colTelephone) = phoneToReplace; % for rows that match, replace the row's value in the telephone column.
      </p>
