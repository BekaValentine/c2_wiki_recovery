        Relational Variable
      </h1>
      <p>
        A variable of type "relation", where a "relation" is as defined in the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>.  Relations can be "base relations" (a set of records), or "views" (relations computed based on other relations/<a href="RelationalVariable.html">RelationalVariable</a>s via the <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a> or <a href="RelationalCalculus.html">RelationalCalculus</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Relations themselves are immutable.  A <a href="RelationalVariable.html">RelationalVariable</a>, on the other hand, is mutable, and can refer to one relation at one particular instance in time, then another relation at a later time; much as an integer variable can assume different integer values at different moments in time.  (The integer "5" is immutable; a variable "x" that refers to 5 now and 3 later, is not.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Often called <em>relvar</em> for short.
