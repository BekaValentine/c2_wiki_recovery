        Design Up Front But Extreme Implementation
      </h1>
      <p>
        Somewhere on Wiki, <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> mentioned that 
        <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is suitable for non-theory-heavy 
        small-team projects. Where a project is theory heavy,
        that is, you don't understand your problem, or know that
        specs make sense without thinking them through, I have
        tended to use the approach mentioned in the title.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is that even if you figure out what seems like
        a good general
        design, you will still have a lot to learn about the
        problem.  
        So don't start by implementing "generic libraries" or
        other grandiose constructs. 
        Start with something that is useful today, and use the
        general design (or theory, if you prefer) as a target.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these projects, I have never been able to capture 
        the design in the source code in any meaningful way.
        I try to get as close as possible, but beyond that,
        the sheer complexity of the data structures and
        dependencies means that a specification is far simpler
        to understand than code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, "design up front" means "a reasonable
        amount of design up front", not the situation described in
        <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>.

      <p>
        With all due respect, when is this situation a recommendation for the use of "specification", and when does it argue for increased simplicity in data structures and dependencies?  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

      <p>
        In some cases, you just cannot simplify further. Consider the internals
        of an OS: simplicity will often conflict with optimization.
        At that point, you do a specification, then say how the optimized code
        was derived from it, and why were the convolutions needed.
        You say this in a refinement. --<a href="AamodSane.html">AamodSane</a>
