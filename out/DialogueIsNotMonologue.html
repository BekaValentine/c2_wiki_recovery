        Dialogue Is Not Monologue
      </p>
      <p>
        Dialogue on Wiki is not just one person expressing something to another, but is really a discussion carried on between the writer and other members of the community. As each new participant writes, they become involved in the "flow of meaning" and contribute expressions which are supportive of this.

        Originally, dialogue was not to be the preferred method for exchange and development of ideas. However, Ward has made this wiki a big enough place for differing approaches and presentations to co-exist and still allow the purpose of this wiki to continue.

        Many people participate within this site; their interactions will result in agreement and disagreement. It can be used to best advantage and with most success when each contribution presents positive, beneficial, and professional content. It is important that those intending to be successful in dialogue keep this in mind.
