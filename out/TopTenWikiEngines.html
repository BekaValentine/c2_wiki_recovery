        For <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> I don't know, but it's probably not all that widely used as all the news it gets might suggest.

        I am currently wrestling with the decision of which software to choose as an upgrade for one of the wiki communities that my company sponsors.  This page seems to present all of the 'top' contenders, however, having spent several days reviewing quite a few of them, I find I am having a lot of trouble comparing their features.  It sure would be helpfull to have a short list of the attributes that were considered when the engines listed here were posted. Anyone care to suggest their criteria for including the software listed on this page? -- <a href="HansWobbe.html">HansWobbe</a>.

        On my quest for a corporate wiki, I encountered other products not mentioned here that offer a kind of  'Wiki engine', such as Daisy and <a href="AtlassianConfluence.html">AtlassianConfluence</a>, to just pick some examples.  Are they considered also  as <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> or is there a more appropriate category for these 'not just a Wiki' products, please? -- <a href="BenVerberck.html">BenVerberck</a>.

        <a href="TiddlyWiki.html">TiddlyWiki</a> is an interesting case.  It's a stand-alone "Wiki" implemented in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> as a single web page, with the ability to edit and save copies of it.  This explanation may seem a little unclear; if so, see the web page for a better explanation.  It's a little hard to say if this is a Wiki in the usual sense or not, but it would probably work as a personal Wiki page.

        The best opensource wiki out there is Dekiwiki. It has an awesom wysiwyg editor and its user friendly and easy to setup. They have a step by step manual! If you tired of looking for options then try <a href="DekiWiki.html">DekiWiki</a>. Get the opensource release from sourceforge. Dont get it confused with the commerical release of this product. <a href="http://opengarden.org/dekiwiki">http://opengarden.org/dekiwiki</a> A really really great wiki. I wish I had found it sooner. I tried at least 30 wiki's and this on pwns all. Its Derived from one of the greatest wiki's, mediawiki, but it is an enhanced user friendly version. It runs on Windows XP and a few other OS operating systems aswell Enjoy ;)

        <a href="TracWiki.html">TracWiki</a> is probably a contender in terms of user base.  While it's more than "just" a wiki, is becoming a defacto standard for open source project management. The extra-wiki features are probably boosting its wiki "market" share more than its wiki features, though, and new competition from projects like <a href="RedMine.html">RedMine</a> may threaten its continued growth.

        We were using PBwiki but its too expensive. Then we tried FOSwiki. It seems to do everything (Chinese didn't work though), but its just way too complicated. Now we are looking at XWiki. Our main concerns are...
      </p>
      <p>
        - Free or cheap
        - access control by group or user
        - support chinese

        I vote for Confluence. I haven't seen an opensource wiki that comes anywhere near it in terms of features and functionality. I also agree with removing the engines that aren't being actively maintained (no updates in over 12 months?)
      </p>
      <p>
        BH - Confluence is very feature rich but also expensive. Plugins that were free are not priced, which drove our annual maintenance up 4x from last year.
      </p>
      <p>
        OTC,  Confluence is arguably no longer a wiki at all since the internal representation switched to XHTML -- they no longer do wiki syntax.

        <li>
           JAN 2014:   I too think that TWiki should be on the list. I do believe that the TWiki.org project pushes much faster ahead than its fork, FosWiki, which seems kinda deadish with only minor maintenance releases coming out with LONG periods of silence in-between. TWiki on the other hand seems very alive and for all I know has a large installed base in corporate intranets. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <ol>
        <li>
           MAR 2014: Regarding TWiki promotion, may I suggest you actually look at the SVN logs?  Most checkins are 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        minor documentation, spelling, or whitespace adjustments: two users dominate, and it has all the appearances of
        manufacturing activity.  Foswiki development has slowed since the fork but still substantially exceeds that of
        TWiki in actual content-ful checkins.  That's perhaps why the flow of patches is primarily one-way, from Foswiki
        to TWiki (e.g. their mining of several years of TinyMCE patches recently after long ignoring the input 
        interface).

        <a href="DokuWiki.html">DokuWiki</a> has the best combination of easy-to-installness, extensibility and ease of use. It should be your first install and only investigate the others if <a href="DokuWiki.html">DokuWiki</a> can't do it. Much of this list has the feeling of MaintenanceMode about it.
