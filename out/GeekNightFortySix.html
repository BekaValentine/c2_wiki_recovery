        Geek Night Forty Six
      </h1>
      <p>
        Greetings all, tonight is the night is the night of love. Together forever is never enough...
      </p>
      <p>
        It's <a href="GeekNight.html">GeekNight</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        Tonight, it seems that our schedule is jam packed. When <a href="OwenRogers.html">OwenRogers</a> and I were at XP2003 in Genoa, 
        we met <a href="RickMugridge.html">RickMugridge</a> from New Zealand. He has quite a bit of experience with <a href="NakedObjects.html">NakedObjects</a> 
        (both the idea, and the implementation), and has authored some extensions. He'll be along to 
        discuss it and show how <a href="NakedObjects.html">NakedObjects</a> allow for emergent UI design and different viewers. Like them or hate them, you have to admit, it's an exciting idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, DanGoodwin, the loveable <a href="ThoughtWorks.html">ThoughtWorks</a> attorney, may drop in to discuss various <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>
        licences. If you've got questions about this (and I know you do), come on by to get them 
        answered.
      </p>
      <p>
        As usual, the fun starts at 7pm, so be there sharp. Please sign up for pizza, and topping 
        preference *beforehand* so that I can have the pizzas there at the stroke of 7
