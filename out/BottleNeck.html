        Bottle Neck

      <p>
        Peanut butter and pickles come in jars; their contents can (in principle, at least) get out at 32'/sec^2. Soda and wine come in bottles whose necks slow their contents' flow.

        <a href="EliyahuGoldratt.html">EliyahuGoldratt</a> argues (persuasively, I think) that every process is constrained by a (single!) bottleneck at a particular time. The one stage in the process that has less capacity than any other is its bottleneck. "Bottleneck" and "constraint" are synonyms in his <a href="TheoryOfConstraints.html">TheoryOfConstraints</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Manufacturing, project, and other managers can avoid spreading themselves too thin (peanut butter again!) by focusing on the bottleneck in each of their processes.
      </p>

        Goldratt's business novels are readable if not literary. <a href="TheGoal.html">TheGoal</a> has the basics with a generic manufacturing example, <a href="ItsNotLuck.html">ItsNotLuck</a> looks at marketing (cosmetics, printing, and backup generators), <a href="CriticalChain.html">CriticalChain</a> does <a href="ProjectManagement.html">ProjectManagement</a>, and NecessaryButNotSufficient considers broader business issues. His technical books are difficult, though.

        H. William Dettmer's analytic books are well done. <em>Breaking the Constraints to World-Class Performance</em> is a textbook (user's guide) and <em>Goldratt's Theory of Constraints: A Systems Approach to Continuous Improvement</em> is an encyclopedia (reference manual). Both are from ASQ's Quality Press (qualitypress.asq.org).

        <em>Some sources criticise Goldratt for being excessively simplistic. See </em><a href="TheGoal.html">TheGoal</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No doubt. Any first shot at explaining something is likely to suffer from excessive simplicity. Imagine how hard it must be for a physicist to explain himself in a novel! His nonfiction goes way the other way -- it's just plain dense! <em>The Goal</em> is a good introduction for people with manufacturing backgrounds, but after that there's better stuff. His other novels are good if you want a quick view but Dettmer's books, especially <em>Breaking the Constraints,</em> are both thorough and at least as clear as any other User's Guide -- Reference Manual pair. I just hope people don't blow off his ideas because he's not an artistic novelist. --<a href="GeorgeBrower.html">GeorgeBrower</a>

        This seems like one of those "obvious in hindsight" things that may have been obvious all along.  Of course a process is limited by its earliest slowest step.  It always will be.  There is only a problem when that speed is below the desired speed.
