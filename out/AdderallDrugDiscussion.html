        This is a new wiki page for information about Adderall, which is prescribed for <a href="AttentionDeficitDisorder.html">AttentionDeficitDisorder</a> and narcolepsy, since wiki has <a href="RitalinDrug.html">RitalinDrug</a>. Feel free to add and edit to improve it.

        Courtesy of the US Government, here is a little information on Adderall:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a601234.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a601234.html</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Believe what the US Government says at your own risk.
      </p>

        Courtesy of the manufacturer, here is the full sheet on Adderall, the one doctors receive and patients seldom see (check all the tabs across the top):
      </p>

        Here is a separate sheet for Adderall XR (extended release):
      </p>

        On February 9, 2005, Health Canada instructed the manufacturer (Shire) to withdraw Adderall XR from the Canadian market:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2005/2005_01.html">http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2005/2005_01.html</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The US FDA then issued a public health advisory:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/adderall.htm">http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/adderall.htm</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

        I took ADDerall for a few months when I lived in Seattle. I liked the longer-lasting effect, but I didn't like some of the side-effects, dry mouth, minor muscle spasms. On the other hand, I would sometimes forget to take Ritalin, so ADDerall definitely had benefits. Given the choice between the two right now, I'd take ADDerall if I don't have a 'coach' around to remind me when I forget, and Ritalin if I did have a coach. -- <a href="ShaeErisson.html">ShaeErisson</a>

        <em>This is probably a better place to discuss Adderall than the </em><a href="AdderallDrug.html">AdderallDrug</a> page because some number of people seem to be restoring the <a href="AdderallDrug.html">AdderallDrug</a> page from their own personal copies whenever it gets spammed. So therefore, I'd expect any new content posted there would probably get lost. (And the "Viagra/Levitra/Cialis spammers" don't seem to be able to figure out how Wikis really work, so this page seems to be safe - at least for now! ;-)<em></em>
