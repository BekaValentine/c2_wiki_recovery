        Thoughts Weaver Additions

      <p>
        Oct. 25, 1995:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ThoughtsWeaver.html">ThoughtsWeaver</a> (q.v.) is an extension of the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>,
        which is used inside AT&T.
        This page describes some of the differences between
        <a href="ThoughtsWeaver.html">ThoughtsWeaver</a> and the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Line Escape</strong>:  Sometimes, we want bullet lists
        to continue through several lines of output. <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>
        currently requires all of a bullet list item to be on a
        single line.  That makes the source difficult to edit.
        Therefore:  Allow escaped newlines in the UN*X tradition.
        A backslash at the end of the line causes the next line
        to be joined to the end of the current line, separated by
        whitespace.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>HTML Escape</strong>:  Sometimes, you'd like to use an
        HTML feature in <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> <em>just this once</em>.
        You don't want to institutionalize every HTML facility
        in a high-level <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> equivalent.
        On the other hand, you like to have an escape hatch
        when you really, really need it.
        One major addition to <a href="ThoughtsWeaver.html">ThoughtsWeaver</a> is an "expert user feature" that allows
        the author to insert raw text--including HTML--that makes
        it all the way to the renderer.  Therefore:
        Individual text lines (lines as they appear in the <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a>
        form) can be designated as <em>literal lines</em>.
        An escape character (currently a vertical bar) must
        appear at the beginning of a literal line.
        I find that I use the feature rarely, but it's nice to have it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Read-Only Flag</strong>:  Inexpert users get in trouble when editing literal lines.
        There are also some pages that contain information on which
        all users depend, and many of these pages contain policy
        information which users should not want or need to change.
        However, some of these pages--like <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>--are updated
        by "magic tools" on a periodic basis.
        These pages could be protected using UN*X file system modes,
        but that would make the automatic updates clumsy.
        Therefore:  the database contains flags for each page
        that control whether the page can be edited.  The flag
        is part of the page itself, whose rendering
        is controlled by the Translator
        (see <a href="MoreAboutTheTranslator.html">MoreAboutTheTranslator</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens when there are errors on read-only pages?  How do users know who to contact to change them?  Also, who have permissions to set read-only flags?  -- <a href="ChuckSmith.html">ChuckSmith</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Read-Only Info Link</strong>:  Users shouldn't worry about the flags for a page unless
        they want to do something to the page that relates to the
        flags.  We could slap the user every time the user selected
        <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> for a Readonly page, but that would rightly frustrate
        the user.
        We could add a "Readonly" annotation, but that would confuse
        the semantics of the <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> button.
        Therefore:  replace the <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> line with a ProtectedPage
        line which, when selected, describes protected pages.
        Users will find out about protected pages when they
        take actions analogous to editing.
      </p>

        <strong>Cross-Instances References:</strong> We have several <a href="ThoughtsWeaver.html">ThoughtsWeaver</a>
        instances running. One can cross-reference between these instances
        (or between <a href="ThoughtsWeaver.html">ThoughtsWeaver</a> and <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>) using a time-honored
        notation:  this page might be <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>!<a href="ThoughtsWeaverAdditions.html">ThoughtsWeaverAdditions</a>,
        while I could as well refer to <a href="OrgPatterns.html">OrgPatterns</a>!<a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> as
        distinct from <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>!<a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> or <a href="NatureOfOrder.html">NatureOfOrder</a>!<a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.

        <strong></strong><a href="PageChangeNotification.html">PageChangeNotification</a>:<strong></strong>
        Some users are particularly interested in following threads
        that are anchored on TopicalStartingPoint pages within the
        <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> instance.  There are many such pages in a single
        instance. <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> flags modifications to these pages,
        but it's sometimes awkward to rely on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> to
        keep up-to-date.  You need to poll <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> as often
        as you want to keep up with the most pressing issues;
        that can add up to a lot of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page visits per
        day.  Also, you may be interested in changes on several
        different <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> instances (we have about a half dozen
        active instances here at Bell Labs), and that's a lot of
        pages to search.  And it's hard to pick out your favorite
        pages from the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> list.
        Therefore:  provide for centralized and/or asynchronous
        notification.  Each user can RegisterInterest in one or
        more pages.  You can tell <a href="ThoughtsWeaver.html">ThoughtsWeaver</a> to post the change
        at the bottom of another page, or you can tell it to send
        mail to a specific recipient.  When the page changes,
        <a href="ThoughtsWeaver.html">ThoughtsWeaver</a> honors the notification request, either appending
        a notification message at the bottom of the indicated page,
        or sending mail to the notifiant, or both, as requested.
        As a result, you can set up topical <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> pages
        that mirror TopicalStartingPoint pages.
        Both these pages are
        owned by the community as a whole, but take on de facto
        shepherds.

        This sounds really cool. Is there someone that I could take a look at it in action, or pull down a copy to run?
