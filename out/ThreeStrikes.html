        What is the difference between <a href="ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate.html">ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate</a> and <a href="ThreeStrikesAndYouRefactor.html">ThreeStrikesAndYouRefactor</a>?

        <em></em><a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a> makes this interesting distinction between the two:<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's the difference between Space and Time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If duplication occurs in Space (at whatever scale), you have a <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> violation and you ambitiously fix it. <em>(</em><a href="ThreeStrikesAndYouRefactor.html">ThreeStrikesAndYouRefactor</a>, or refactor before you get to <a href="ThreeStrikes.html">ThreeStrikes</a>.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If duplication occurs in Time, then you the programmer have done the same thing twice. That's okay - that's what muscle memory is for. If, however, you do it three times, then you know enough to automate your activity. <em>(</em><a href="ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate.html">ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate</a>)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the third time you copy your source to a remote, backed-up location into a folder named after the current date & time, you should install CVS & automate this behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Duplication in Time occurring only twice may not be enough to automate. You might not know yet if the odds you'll do it again are > 50% (with large margins of error), or maybe you haven't done it enough yet to know how to automate it right.
