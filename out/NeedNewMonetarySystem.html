        Need New Monetary System
      </h1>
      <p>
        We need a new monetary system (USA). In my opinion, the USA dollar is in the ICU, and may die. Since our money has no real value, that made the current money crisis possible. What is worse yet, is that it also affects other countries drastically.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need a new money, or monetary system, that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Has real value (not just what people want to believe it has).
        </li>
        <li>
           Is a true representation of a days work (your labor holds its value).
        </li>
        <li>
           Allows for taxes, but still holds its original value over time (it earns enough interest to pay its taxes).
        </li>
        <li>
           Can't just be created at a whim whenever government leaders run into money trouble (it has to be earned for real).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If I work for a day and build a fence, I still have my day's labor and its result no matter what the economy does or does not do. Our money should be the same way. At present, it makes much more sense to barter for what a person needs, then it does to exchange cash. I need my car fixed, so Joe does it for me in exchange for my labor or goods. Right now our government has no way of tracking bartering, no matter how many laws there are concerning this. If I trade you for something, the government does not get a piece of that exchange, unless I tell them about it. The government loses revenues, but it is the only "safe" source of trade at the moment. We need a new "real" money, as a better way to trade and barter.
