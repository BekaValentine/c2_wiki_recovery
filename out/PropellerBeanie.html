        Propeller Beanie

        Members of the C3 team award a lovely FAO Schwartz <a href="PropellerBeanie.html">PropellerBeanie</a> to a developer who digs <a href="TooDeepIntoTheBagOfTricks.html">TooDeepIntoTheBagOfTricks</a> to implement something. 
      </p>

        The beanie is a friendly way of saying "isn't that a bit overly complex?" The Beanie doesn't have a look on its face, or a tone of voice. As such, it is a reminder without aggression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course you and I always strive to write the simplest code that makes sense. I've noticed, though, that sometimes I get carried away with my own cleverness. And sometimes I just don't think of as simple a solution as was possible. It's good that my partners have a friendly way to bring me back to earth. The Beanie is just that friendly way.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is often the case that a <a href="PropellerBeanie.html">PropellerBeanie</a> award should be made when you hear a developer say, "Look, look, look, this is cool."
      </p>
      <p>
        If no one on your team ever errs on the side of complexity, you don't need a <a href="PropellerBeanie.html">PropellerBeanie</a>. Please send it to us: sometimes we need more than one.

        A <a href="PropellerBeanie.html">PropellerBeanie</a> (see <a href="http://www.magicmakers.com/retail/Hats/propbean.html)">http://www.magicmakers.com/retail/Hats/propbean.html)</a> is a kid's hat with a propeller on top. When you run (or the wind blows), the prop turns. Associated in some strange way with being a geek. I don't know why, I think mine is kind of neat...

        C'mon. What about <em>Beany and Cecil</em>?

        <dd><em>"Beany caps were hugely popular starting around 1952 due in large to the popularity of Beany and Cecil, the animated cartoon about Capt'n Huffenpuff and his nephew, Beany Boy.  Beanie caps became de rigour with fraternities in college and even Beaver Cleaver wore one.  Beanie caps are still immediately recognized and are making a come-back."</em> -- <a href="http://www.oldetimecooking.com/Fads/beanie_caps.htm">http://www.oldetimecooking.com/Fads/beanie_caps.htm</a></dd>
