        <strong>John Powell: Communication works for those who work at it</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        He also said
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>"The genius of communication is the ability to be both totally honest and totally kind at the same time."</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The best criticism is something that clicks with the target but does not come across as criticism. One approach is to use their own logic to guide them to your desired goal without packaging it in spiteful language. The "Socratic method" provides some of this.
