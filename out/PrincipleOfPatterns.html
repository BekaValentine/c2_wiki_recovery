        Principle Of Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        Patterns can be preconceived notions derived from past experience and then applied to future solutions as our experience deems appropriate. As conceived experience is applied to future solutions, we further our experience through trial and error, thereby creating additional patterns which can be applied to the solution.
