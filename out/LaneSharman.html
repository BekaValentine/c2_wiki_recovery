        I am the principal engineer associated with <a href="http://opendoors.com.">http://opendoors.com.</a> I just love wiki for its inherent ability to accrete knowledge and trivia and nonsense at the same time. This page is most of the latter.At <a href="http://opendoors.com">http://opendoors.com</a> you can find Conga which is a very neat GUI Builder.

        I helped develop <a href="WebMacroWiki.html">WebMacroWiki</a> and you can download this the code from <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>. I did some work with Ant to make creating your own look and feel a little easier when building your own wiki. Also, the backing store for this wiki uses my infamous <a href="VeryLargeHashtable.html">VeryLargeHashtable</a>. You might want to check this out as well at <a href="http://opendoors.com/vlh.">http://opendoors.com/vlh.</a> Not much there but the distro and a short example of how easy it is to make a Hashtable persist :(.
