           "It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything."
        </li>
        <li>
           "I say never be complete, I say stop being perfect, I say let's evolve, and let the chips fall where they may"

           "The things you own, they end up owning you."

        squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising <br/>
        has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of <br/>
        history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our <br/>
        Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, <br/>
        and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off."<br/>
