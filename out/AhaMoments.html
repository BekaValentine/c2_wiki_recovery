        Aha Moments
      </h1>
      <p>
        Not sure if there is a page on this wiki that describes this pattern.. but..
      </p>
      <p>
        An <a href="AhaMoment.html">AhaMoment</a> is a "Eureka" feeling you have when you discover something important or enlightening. It's almost euphoric. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Aha! there is a page already.. it's above, found by accident </strong>SmashingWordsTogether<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        So this page could be deleted and merged, or it could be kept as the plural of <a href="AhaMoment.html">AhaMoment</a> with the "S" on the end.  Not sure what is considered best practice on wiki.
