        Notes from today's brainstorming hangout of <a href="GlobalRoots.html">GlobalRoots</a>

      <p>
        Classroom teaching scenario - what to do with it, benefits the wider community
        Make word's stick
        Words you can chew on
      </p>
      <p>
        Kids get chewing gum as reward for doing things they normally wouldn't do - like creating poetry. Envision a bunch of happy bubblegum chewing kid poets
      </p>
      <p>
        Cristo - the building wrapping person but using gum instead of wrapping plastic
      </p>
      <p>
        Turning gum into medicine
      </p>
      <p>
        Chewing gum makes my lock jaw - make a seedball using gum - do the birds then get stuck beeks like how dogs are affected by getting peanut butter.

It is for just such things as you want to make note of and want to share with others publicly. This wiki has a very narrow focus as was intended when it was set up.
