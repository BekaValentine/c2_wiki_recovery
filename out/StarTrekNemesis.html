        Star Trek Nemesis

      <p>
        A stinkeroo. Totally devoid of science fiction. Plot did not rise above the level of a Dragonball-Z episode. Spoilers follow after some whitespace.

        How truly dreadful is it? This is how dreadful:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The retrofitted "Remans" are entirely forgettable Nosferatu-clones with neither physical nor verbal prowess. Heck they're not even as ugly as the forgettable nasty persons of ST9.
        </li>
        <li>
           The FX scenes have no plot significance at all. I mean, Picard, slayer of races, grand master of intergalactic diplomacy, commander of the starfleet flagship, just really wants to drive a convertible dune buggy ...
        </li>
        <li>
           The villain (this is supposed to be <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> - why do we need a villain anyway?) lisps, wears a skirt, and is sexually repressed. This is fearsome? I was more scared of the usher than that twerp.
        </li>
        <li>
           How many star trek villains get called "Shinzon"? Is "Shinzon" just how the universal translator translates "I have no comprehensible motivation for my actions, so you better watch out"?
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The Weapon</em> is less frightening, less powerful, and much less interesting than the old Genesis effect from ST 2. We're forced to endure minutes and minutes of super-extra-pointy-things deploying ... and then it never goes off. Although RonCo could have made a potato slicer out if it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Despite having this devastating super duper mega ultra gun, the villain spends all his time playing with little knives. Obvious case of light-saber envy.
        </li>
        <li>
           How lucky Picard just intuitively figured out that the pointy object behind him that he couldn't even see would pivot in such a way that the villain could impale himself.
        </li>
        <li>
           Janeway <neigh!/>. Forty foot tall Janeway <neigh!/>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Janeway <neigh!/> says Enterprise just happened to be closest to the Romulans. Well ... what if the Enterprise's aft dorsal spitroppit needed realignment at starbase 67? Say they'd sent Sisko in the Defiant instead? Here's what: Shinzon wipes out Earth and the federation fleet before kidnapping Picard with the ultra-cloak and curing his space-herpes. No muss, no fuss, no stunningly predictable count-down-last-10-seconds-to-save-Enterprise. And no movie. Which would have been preferable.
        </li>
        <li>
           What happened to the really cool 29th century shielding and weapons Janeway <neigh!/> brought back with her from the Gamma quadrant? Enterprise should have flown loop-de-loops around the Reman ship ... instead, Enterprise doesn't even fire quantum torpedoes any more - it's back to photons!
        </li>
        <li>
           During said boring countdown to certain activation of definite-kill cannon, Picard just stands there. Why? Well, he's waiting for Shinzon to finish emoting so Data can turn up unexpectedly to save the day.
        </li>
        <li>
           When Data does self-sacrifice it's completely stupid. He has plenty of time to both disrupt <em>The Weapon</em> and instruct Geordie to beam him out at the last moment. Just set a phaser to self-destruct. Instead he says "goodbye," and stands there emoting nothing in particular while the BFG counts down: 5...4...3....

        Face it, guys. There is no more <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a>. It's over, done, kaput. The only thing that will convince me to plunk down good money for another ST movie is a tall blonde girl in a really tight corset.

        Someone liked it: a good movie but not a great one. cutting scenes from the finished article made it feel incomplete. felt rushed and very choppy. still, one of the best space battles in history and could teach star wars a thing or two. the starship crash was perfection. data's death was heart-wrenching. overall, left me wanting more. bring on the big finale for next gen. i have a few ideas paramount...

        Note to the clue-impaired: <em>All</em> <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> movies sucked big-time.

        Hey, thanks for the spoilers! I watched this movie on rented DVD and was so unimpressed that I actually forgot about Data biting the big one! Oh, well. I'll probably rent the next one, too, and by then I'll have again forgotten that Data was supposed to be croaked. Well, if I'm <em>that</em> stupid then I deserve what I get for renting a Star Trek movie. Oy.
