        Real Knowledge Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sorting the wheat from the chaff with respect to <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a> is best done, imo, but starting with the distinctions between <a href="InformationManagement.html">InformationManagement</a> and <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a>, and more generically, between <a href="KnowledgeAndInformation.html">KnowledgeAndInformation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best starting point for me is my understanding that knowledge only resides in our minds.  Whenever we seek to share or transfer knowledge, we create information as the means of sharing it, and often store the information in some other medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this starting point, it is much easier to make some clear distinctions as to whether the claims being made about <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a> are in fact about <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a>, or would more appropriately be named <a href="InformationManagement.html">InformationManagement</a>.

        Far too many of  vendors do not believe there is a difference between 
        knowledge management and information management.  They recognize only 
        that market hype has shifted public opinion, so they are morphing to catch 
        up and reposition their products. Can you blame them? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of what purports to be knowledge management is in reality information 
        management.  Just the other day  I heard a rep selling scanners as a core 
        KM technology, "essential for knowledge sharing,"  without which the 
        organization was doomed to be bypassed by every other firm going down the 
        knowledge track. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction I like to make, is working with objects (data or 
        information), is IM and working with people which is KM. Information 
        Management is about documents, CAD drawings, spreadsheets, program 
        code. IM means ensuring access, security, delivery, and storage. It deals 
        exclusively with explicit representations. Creation, use, learning, meaning, 
        understanding, and negotiation are NOT core issues but efficiency, 
        timeliness, accuracy, veracity, speed, cost, storage space and retrieval 
        ARE central concerns in IM. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowledge management recognizes value in originality, innovation, 
        agility, adaptability, intelligence and learning. It seeks to leverage 
        the capacity of the organization in these areas. KM is concerned with 
        critical thinking, innovation, relationships, exposure to ideas, patterns, 
        competencies, and collaboration. It supports communities and individual 
        and group learning.  KM strengthens alignment and encourages the sharing 
        of experiences, failures, and best practices. KM may use technology to 
        foster dialog, increase communication, share context or negotiate 
        meaning but this is not the core focus. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A people focus in KM extends to recruitment, rewards, retention, 
        recognition and reification. KM is about intangibles, intellectual 
        capital, competitive advantage and innovation-- NOT objects. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The division between information and knowledge management is not 
        clear cut, take knowledge artifacts with their grounding in information 
        systems but their value depending on alignment, belief and negotiated 
        meaning. The role and representation of concepts often tend to blur the 
        distinction between inference and intuition. Meta-data plays an 
        increasing a part in supplying context,  while subtle differences 
        between data translations and information transformations often help to 
        keep us guessing. Negotiation and social conventions around boundary 
        objects then carry and convey meaning between communities helping 
        learning and understanding. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowledge management operates at a more abstract level than IM. This 
        often makes the causal links with benefits and tangible assets difficult to 
        grasp and explain but that does not render them less real or lower the 
        strategic importance of KM.  <a href="DenhamGrey.html">DenhamGrey</a>
