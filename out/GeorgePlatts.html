        George Platts
      </h1>
      <p>
        George is an art therapist who earlier in his career became expert at running sessions of non-competitive games.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <a href="BruceAnderson.html">BruceAnderson</a> was looking for a games person for the <a href="ThornwoodWorkshop.html">ThornwoodWorkshop</a>, George was recommended, came, and did a great job.  He has also been part of the team at the second PLoP (PLoP95) and at the first EuroPLoP (EuroPLoP96?).

      <p>
        Games are useful in a workshop as they can be used to change the energy and engage different parts of the intelligence.
