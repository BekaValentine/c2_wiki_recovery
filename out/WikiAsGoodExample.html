        I suppose most people build sites that emphasize what they consider important.  That said, I will nominate pages I have prepared as an example of a good web site.  This site is a database, groupware of sorts, used by researchers interested in a unique style of software documentation called "patterns".
      </p>

        The site has grown to over 700 pages.  Most of these, including many higher level organizational pages, have been contributed by visitors.  Good starting points for browsing include:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors</a><br/>
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StartingPoints">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StartingPoints</a><br/>
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The pages are delivered by a cgi script called <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> or just wiki for short.  Wiki wiki means quick in Hawai'ian.  Wiki is a quick way to make a web.  Details for authoring, and some history appear in:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MoreAboutMechanics">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MoreAboutMechanics</a><br/>
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiHyperCard">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiHyperCard</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The site is a year and a half old.  (That would be 7-1/2 "Internet Years".)  It receives a steady flow of 100 visitors a day.  Many visitors retrieve only a handful of pages, others retrieve 25 to 50 at a time.  New or changed pages are automatically recorded in:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        as a convenience for regular visitors.  This gives the site a "temporal" feel.  Pages can become "threads" where wiki convention is to drop a horizontal rule between postings.  But most readers find this form less than ideal.  A more innovative style of discourse involves the prompting statement:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PromptingStatement">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PromptingStatement</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        With it one asks a question by making a place for the answer.  This leads authors to seek agreement rather than counter point as is the usual case with net-news.  A dialog conducted with prompting statements also makes much more informative reading for the transient visitor.
      </p>

        I have collected unsolicited kudos offered by my readers:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiKudos">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiKudos</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Although the authors tend to gush (possibly as payment for my volunteer effort) their comments point at issues I really did intentionally address.  I've been influenced by Roger Blumberg's WWW '94 paper that asks if there isn't a better metaphor for the web than a super highway. I'll close this note with one more citation:
      </p>

      </code>
      <p>
        In this short essay I use Roger's metaphor of public space to categorize the services I offer on c2.com.  I have one of each: a billboard, a museum and open space.  Wiki is the open space. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
