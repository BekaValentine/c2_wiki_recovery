      <p>
        A really insane person who occasionally pretends to be able to write software.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        And he actually writes software, too.  He lives in <a href="AucklandCity.html">AucklandCity</a>, <a href="NewZealand.html">NewZealand</a>, and recently completed a degree at <a href="MasseyUniversityAlbany.html">MasseyUniversityAlbany</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He's also a big fan of the <a href="BastardOperatorFromHell.html">BastardOperatorFromHell</a>, written by <a href="SimonTravaglia.html">SimonTravaglia</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He's just started learning <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> (though he's done bits of it before), and he's starting to like it :)
      </p>
      <p>
        Without question, his favourite TV series is <a href="BabylonFive.html">BabylonFive</a>, followed by <a href="ReBoot.html">ReBoot</a> :)
        His favourite movie at the moment is <a href="TheMatrix.html">TheMatrix</a>.  And he really enjoyed <a href="ThePrincessBride.html">ThePrincessBride</a>.

        He's also getting dangerously addicted to <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/quickChanges?days=1">http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/quickChanges?days=1</a>
        Also just discovered <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/wantedWikiPages,">http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/wantedWikiPages,</a> but hasn't decided if he's going to do anything about it yet :)

        Here's a good quote he found on <a href="CreepingFeaturitis.html">CreepingFeaturitis</a>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>"Engineers are people who love to solve problems. They love solving problems so much, that, given</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>no problems at all, they will invent some to solve." -- </em><a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a><em> (don't know if that's his quote or if he was merely the one who put in on the page...)</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        And here's something else he found lying around... he's not sure if he agrees with it (lacking sufficient information), but it sounded cool:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Java. The elegant simplicity of C++. The blazing speed of Smalltalk. Nothing that achieves this level of insult to three sets of language zealots in eleven words should ever be removed entirely from Wiki.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        And another one :)
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Programming is </em>'hard<em>' because its closest two traditional jobs would be mathematics and philosophy - except that unlike philosophers programmers need to produce something, and unlike mathematicians programmers have no proof of anything.</em></dd>
      </dl>
