        Just saw <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>. Would like to say that I agree with the reasons for the policy. I also understand it is not an ironclad rule. I am Slackananda, and I am not ashamed of who I am. I have kept a web site at slackananda.com for almost four years. I have been, am, and will continue to be Slackananda. If my real name is of importance, <a href="WhoIs.html">WhoIs</a> has it ready at hand....

        Interesting Coincidence with my recent obsession with Powermarks URL managing software. I "invented" <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s on my own about a week ago!
