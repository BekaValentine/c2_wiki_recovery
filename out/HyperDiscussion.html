        Hyper Discussion

      <p>
        Could Facebook and Twitter qualify?
      </p>
      <p>
        How about <em>this page</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Perhaps the <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> qualifies.  What else?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What is a "hyper discussion"? A discussion amongst hyperactive people?  A discussion about hyperactivity, hyperlinks, or hypervisors?</em>

      <p>
        A discussion amongst hyperactive people?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           as in someone feverishly two-thumbing a little hand held device for who knows who or who knows what or let's see what else is in this thing, while nearly oblivious to those about or watching, while moving somewhere else where little attention is paid to the physical environment?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A discussion about hyperactivity?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This is one of many topics about which a <a href="HyperDiscussion.html">HyperDiscussion</a> might include
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A discussion about hyperlinks?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           perhaps
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A discussion about hypervisors?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           that would be a device one openly discuss in order to determine present value and practical uses
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Or as described in the Urban Dictionary
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           hyperdiscussion
          <ul>
            <li>
               using more words than necessary to explain something
            </li>
            <li>
               constantly straying from the point of a story to discuss small, unnecessary details
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        this morning, at about 9:00, well 9:04, i went into the store, and a bum, he was wearing this ugly faded green jacket and his shoes were all tore up, he followed me in and right next to the produce aisle, where they used to have the canned vegetables, but now they have canned fruit...
