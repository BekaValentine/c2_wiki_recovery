        When the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> consistently reverts <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>'s edits, sometimes <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> reacts by deleting <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s.  That's a <a href="DeleteTantrum.html">DeleteTantrum</a>.  Of course, it's immature and unprofessional behaviour, but it's hardly surprising given all the evidence we have of <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>'s inability to function appropriately in a collaborative environment.

        <em>Why does GV have so many IP addresses/identifiers? I thought he/she/it was relatively poor. Thus, GV must be hacking since GV cannot afford that many machines. If that's the case, let's collect evidence and bust GV's ass and send it to jail or the rubber room where he/she/it can line the dust up all strait and neat on the cell floor. Perhaps GV visits multiple libraries to cover its tracks.</em>

        <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> tends to use a mix of open Web proxy servers and anonymising services.  These require no hacking; changing the proxy settings in a Web browser is sufficient.  Lists of open proxies are freely available, e.g., <a href="http://www.xroxy.com/proxylist.htm">http://www.xroxy.com/proxylist.htm</a>

        <em>I wonder if there's a way to limit or flag changes or deletions based on that list. I'm not a networking expert. I just play one on cheap TV's. And thanks for the background info.</em>
