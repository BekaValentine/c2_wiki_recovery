        Boost Lambda Library

        The Lambda Library (LL) adds a form of lambda abstraction to <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>. The LL is implemented as a template library using standard C++; thus no language extensions or preprocessing is required. The LL consists of a rich set of tools for defining unnamed functions. Particularly, these unnamed functions work seamlessly with the <a href="StandardTemplateLibrary.html">StandardTemplateLibrary</a> algorithms. The LL offers significant improvements, in terms of generality and ease of use, compared to the binders and functors in the C++ standard library.

        The LL is implemented in standard C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>VC++ 7.1 is pretty close to fully standard-compliant, and all of boost's unit tests are reported to work with it as of at least February 2004. Also, Comeau C++ was available earlier than VC++ 7.1, and very likely could compile LL applications also.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        True. Microsoft replaced their pre-standard Dinkumware STL with a recent one. This went a long way toward making MS C++ compliant (not quite there yet, but who is?).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Comeau is arguably the most compliant compiler as it supports exporting templates.</em>

        Example:
      </p>
      <code>
        for_each( vec.start(), vec.end(), cout << _1 << ' ' );<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        to print each element in the vector 'vec', separated by a space. It does a lot of other cool things too.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The Lambda Library has been added to the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a> as of release 1.28.0 (May 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lambda Library inspired <a href="BoostTupleLibrary.html">BoostTupleLibrary</a> was added to Boost in an earlier release.
