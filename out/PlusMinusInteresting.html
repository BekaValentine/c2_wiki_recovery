        An <a href="EdwardDeBono.html">EdwardDeBono</a> thinking method. Also, a member of the <a href="VotingPatterns.html">VotingPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider all the pluses of choosing one candidate, then all the minus of choosing that candidate, then all the interesting side effects of choosing that candidate. Repeat for the other candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's essential in <a href="EdwardDeBono.html">EdwardDeBono</a>'s methodology that you do these one at a time, though most people muddy them up. Also, <a href="EdwardDeBono.html">EdwardDeBono</a> wants you to write them down, although you probably won't.

        An example from an election not so long ago:
      </p>
      <p>
        If I vote for JeanCharest he will
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Plus</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Lower tuition
        </li>
        <li>
           Give me a free computer
        </li>
        <li>
           Lower taxes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Minus</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Instigate WorkFare that requires all people under 25 to either work or starve (no welfare). This is called slavery in most countries.
        </li>
        <li>
           Lower payments to universities.
        </li>
        <li>
           Polarize the <a href="HouseOfCommons.html">HouseOfCommons</a> along the unity debate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Interesting</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           He's probably going to stampede around Quebec for half his term, then stampede around Canada trying to build his party. (NOTE: I don't consider this negative nor positive)
        </li>
        <li>
           He has really good sound bites.
        </li>
        <li>
           He used to be the Minister for Youth back in the 80's; but I'm not sure if that had a lasting effect on him.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anyway, some people keep this kind of pros vs. cons debate raging in their heads when they choose to vote. This is generally a good way to vote, in my opinion. Unfortunately, I can never make a decision using this alone because many of the candidates are equally good or bad. However, I can certainly eliminate some candidates this way. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
