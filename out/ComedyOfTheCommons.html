        Comedy Of The Commons
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a> assumes a <a href="ZeroSumGame.html">ZeroSumGame</a>. Physical commons are like that. But virtual commons, like this here wiki, are inexhaustible. Therefore what results is a <a href="ComedyOfTheCommons.html">ComedyOfTheCommons</a>. You may <a href="LaughOutLoud.html">LaughOutLoud</a> now. Yes!
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The time a person has to make use of the virtual commons is not inexhaustible. So that wiki-vandalism becomes an attack on the person's time.

        There is nothing comical about a ranting lunatic prancing <br/>
        through the meeting hall where several hundred people are<br/>
        trying to hear each other in discussions of issues toward<br/>
        enlightenment, said rant generating so much noise, confusion, <br/>
        and distraction that the people who gather there can no longer<br/>
        conduct meaningful congress with one another.<br/>
        The assertion that "virtual commons ... are inexhaustible" is<br/>
        false.  Radio waves take up no space, but if you jam them their<br/>
        usefulness is ruined.  The disk may be so large that you can<br/>
        never use all of it, but if I can inject enough noise that you<br/>
        can't store or retrieve anything with it, a denial of service<br/>
        is accomplished that renders the <em>extent</em> of the resource<br/>
        irrelevant.<br/>

        <em>You missed the point. My ears and my attention are limited resources; radio frequencies are a limited resource; bandwidth, whether network or disk IO is a limited resource. The essential feature of the common referred to in "the tragedy of the commons" is limited resources. A better rebuttal of this page's proposal is that there is no such thing as a "virtual common"; if the resources are inexhaustible, it ain't no common. --mt</em>

        Yes even though the the virtual commons are seemingly vast limitless endless, people, as is our wont to do so, will still erect our maypoles to dance around, replete with fancy ribbons to attract each other. Only now we call them things like Blogothingeys, Podomajigs, etc. So even though all bandwidth starts out at equal value we insist on creating real estate culture in a world that started out with such promise of freedom of a few short years ago.
