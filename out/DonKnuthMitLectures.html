        Since the first announcement of this lecture series there were so
        many inquiries that I decided to send this e-mail to everyone
        with answers to the most frequent questions.

      <p>
        PUBLICITY:
      </p>
      <p>
        The lectures and the panel discussion will be webcasted -
        thanks to Dr. Dobb's Journal! The website will be announced
        shortly before the first lecture. Don Knuth's presentations will
        also be distributed on MIT cable and to the Draper Lab.
        Professional videos of the series may be purchased after the
        lecture series is over.

      <p>
        Don Knuth does not have e-mail! I have given him all e-mails I
        have received but please direct questions or inquiries to my
        assistant Jean Hwang (jhwang@ai.mit.edu, 617-452-2832). I would
        especially like to ask people from the Media to set up interviews
        with Don through her.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADMISSION:
      </p>
      <p>
        The lectures are free and open for the public. Everyone is
        welcome! They will be held at MIT 34-101 (50 Vassar ST) on
        Wednesdays. We will start at 4:15 pm with refreshments, the talks
        and discussions begin at 4:30 pm until about 5:45 pm. After 4 pm
        parking in restricted areas is acceptable but I would recommend
        people to take public transportation (Red Line "Kendall", Bus
        "MIT, Mass Ave").

        I am still collecting the papers from the first two years but am positive to edit the volume soon; for now, only the abstracts of previous talks are available.

        QUESTIONS ON ROBOT SOULS AND CONSCIOUSNESS
      </p>
      <p>
        I got wonderful messages with very interesting and challenging
        questions but find myself unable to answer them all in
        person. Some food for thought you may find at my homepage (see
        below). I would especially recommend to follow the link to the
        MSNBC homepage and Margie Wylie's article "What robots can teach
        about souls". For questions on the difference between us and
        machines, you might want to read my paper on Cog and the "Image
        of God" symbol.
