      <p>
        I am a Computer Scientist. I work for a large aerospace company that shall remain nameless, largely at their preference. I am fluent in C, Java, and Scheme. Recently I have been impressed with the clarity of Python and have been working on becoming fluent in it. I do NOT like Perl because, as I have recently discovered, it is not very pythonic :-).

        I live in south central Tennessee and work in Huntsville, AL. I'm married, have two grown daughters, three cats, and a dog (but don't tell the dog that, she thinks she's human). I play guitar reasonably well, fiddle passably well and I'm learning to play Celtic harp.

        <em>Hi, Kellie. Is that you on the </em><a href="QuotePageOne.html">QuotePageOne</a> page??? -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a> (<a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> rules, as far as I'm concerned.)<em></em>

        Yep, that's me. The quote is thanks to my friend Bob Crispen (<a href="http://blog.crispen.org/)">http://blog.crispen.org/)</a> with whom I was discussing the psychological principles leading to the phenomenon of flaming on the Internet. I have since lost the reference to that discussion online but the quote survives as my Warholian 15 minutes of fame.
