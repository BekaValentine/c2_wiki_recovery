        I find it interesting to visualize what a <a href="ModelControllerSurface.html">ModelControllerSurface</a> would look like (here I am thinking of airfoils on a radio-controlled airplane or hydrofoils on a toy submarine). In engineering it is common knowledge that equations for different fields are analogous to each other example electrical and mechanical quantities behave the same way - a mass-spring-damper and IRC circuit which in fact is the basis of the AnalogComputer. But what are the analogs between these and information - obviously memory is a stock, information is a flow. But is there a way to more broadly apply geometric and physical metaphors to programming constructs to make them easier to understand beyond the abstract GraphTheoretic notations of UML?
