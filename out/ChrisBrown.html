      <p>
        Chris Brown works as an IT&Business Architect (eghads) for First Union's Capital Management Group. I have been doing OO since 1992 (Smalltalk almost exclusively) for 8 years until I was morphed into an architect. My main goal an architect is to work with various projects to help them understand the tradeoff inevitable during the project away from architectural purity, and the short and long term impact that these tradeoffs have on the system. I have delivered several enterprise target architectures that I use as my lens for evaluating projects. I rely extensively upon patterns as an approach for developing architectures for projects. I really like XP and have historiacllay used pair programming (since 92) as a means to accomplish greater good.
