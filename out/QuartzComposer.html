        Quartz Composer
      </h1>
      <p>
        Quartz Composer is a tool included with <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a>'s <a href="ExCode.html">ExCode</a> development tools. It is a <a href="VisualProgramming.html">VisualProgramming</a> system (familiar to users of <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a>) for exploring the Quartz graphics technologies and building prototypes that combine these technologies in various ways. The resulting .qtz programs can be dropped directly into the "Library/Screen Savers/" or used as a sound visualization in iTunes, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every project has a workspace for laying out and connecting objects, and a live Viewer for showing the results of the current program as an animation or graphical result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Available objects (or "patches") are categorized:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Controllers: mouse and keyboard input, MIDI, random numbers, interpolation, etc. for time-varying data
        </li>
        <li>
           Environment: environmental effects, such as fog and lighting
        </li>
        <li>
           Generator and Source: data sources for colors, gradients, images, movies, audio, text, RSS feeds, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Modifier: text filters, color conversion, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Numeric: math expressions, conditionals, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Renderer: <a href="OpenGl.html">OpenGl</a> objects like the teapot, spheres, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Tool: wrappers for various technologies, such as CoreImage filters, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, environment queries, timers, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are also CoreImage filters for operating on image data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Blur: various types of blurs
        </li>
        <li>
           Color Adjust: gamma correction, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Color Effect: posterize, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Composite Operator: blend images in various ways
        </li>
        <li>
           Distortion Effect: bump, lenses, vortex, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Generator: programmatically defined image data, such as solid fills, halos and stripes
        </li>
        <li>
           Geometry adjustment: affine transform, crop, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Gradients
        </li>
        <li>
           Halftone effect: dot screen, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Sharpen
        </li>
        <li>
           Stylize: artistic effects, like blend with mask, pixellate, pointillize, spotlight, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Tile Effect: tile an image onto another image
        </li>
        <li>
           Transition: time-based effect, like dissolve, swipe, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each object can have input and output parameters which can be either set to constants or connected to other objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can organize subsystems into "macro patches". The workspace includes a browser which shows the hierarchy of macros, a palette of predefined patches (each with full documentation) and a workspace showing the structure of the current macro or root application.
