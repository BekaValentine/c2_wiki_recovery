        Okay, so <a href="GodwinsLaw.html">GodwinsLaw</a> says all threads that mention hitler or nazis are worthless. But then, all threads that discuss Israel do that. And all threads that discuss America touch on Israel, and ... well, you can see that <a href="KevinBacon.html">KevinBacon</a> is almost immediately going to become not worth discussing. And the <a href="EndOfWiki.html">EndOfWiki</a> will occur soon after.
