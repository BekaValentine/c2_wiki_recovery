        Sturgeons Law Disproved
      </h1>
      <p>
        [Note to <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s: the usage of 'crud' below is actually the correct one. <a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a> is often misquoted as using the word 'crap' instead of 'crud': <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/s/SturgeonsLaw.html]">http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/s/SturgeonsLaw.html]</a>

        <a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a> leads to a contradiction, and is thus false:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Assume that NinetyPercent of everything is crud.
        </li>
        <li>
           Gather up all of the stuff that you can find, and separate it into the 90% which is crud, and the 10% which is not crud.
        </li>
        <li>
           Now, examine the 10% which is not crud:
          <ul>
            <li>
               According to <a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a>, NinetyPercent of this remaining 10% is crud. However, we have established that this particular sample is crud-free. Hence, we have a contradiction.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A similar argument applies for the 90% of the stuff which is previously identified as crud.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        QED.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the fallacy of subpopulations, and is equivalent to saying "Statistics show that 90% of the population speaks Swahili. Now examine the 10% that do not speak Swahili. By the Swahili Law, 90% of that population should speak Swahili. But we've already established that they don't. Thus, contradiction."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is this a workable example? In the Swahili example "the population" can reasonably be assumed to apply to one particular set, where in </em><a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a> "everything" is sufficiently vague to cause the recursion.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, all that this demonstrates is that, to be accurate, any law of this sort can't be a recursive law, that's all. It applies to some universe of discourse (assuming one can be defined), not to subsets thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, what if </em><a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a> said 100% of everything is crud? It would recurse fine, though then it would be reduced to some sort of set-equivalence theorem of cruddiness. And don't forget that a subset can be the same as the original set. -- francis<em> </em>'If so, would that make <a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a> crud or not?<strong> Sure, why not? But just because something is crud doesn't necessarily imply that it's false.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Awww, you're no fun, Doug!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        [More simply: 90% of everything is crud. 10% of everything is not everything.]
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        True statistical representations include an additional dimension: the confidence factor. Recasting <a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a> with true statistics would be something like <em></em>NinetyPercent of everything is crud with NinetyPercent confidence<em> That means that 90% of the time that you take a random sample of anything, 90% of it will be crud. This allows for recursively applying the rule to subsets without a problem, so long as the subset is a random sample. ;)</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>It is surprising how often exactly this sort of fallacious reasoning turns up in 'real work', and how often it is accepted. People are not, in general, very logical.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Someone is confusing "everything" with "anything". If Sturgeon had said that 10% of anything was crud, then the law could be applied to the 10% that wasn't crud. But he didn't so it can't.]
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A couple things may save <a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If we redefine it to only cover statistically valid samples; then it need not apply to datasets that are already segregated by cruddiness.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It may be metaphysically impossible to segregate crud from non-crud; for any sample we could choose, there exists a universe in which ninety percent of it is crud.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Alternatively, the act of segregation violates Heisenberg, and will cause 90% of the non-crud sample to spontaneously turn into crud (and likewise, 10% of the crud sample will become non-crud). <em>We don't need to invoke non-applicable quantum mechanics concepts for this to work. All we need to do is reformulate </em><a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a> to something closer to the <a href="ParetoPrinciple.html">ParetoPrinciple</a>: "In any naturally-occurring sample, 90% of the items are significantly more cruddy than the rest.")<em> [Of course, that's a tautology: "90% of the sample is below the ninetieth percentile in some measurable parameter".] </em>Not really. The supposition is that there is a discontinuity. It might be more clear to invert it: 10% of the sample comprise, say, 90% of the total quality of the set; 90% of the sample comprise the remaining 10%, and are therefore, crud.<em> [Unless you live in </em>LakeWobegon, where all the children are above average...] <em>:-)</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Crud may be in the eye of the beholder; for any sample we could choose there will be an observer who claims ninety percent of it is crud.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cruddiness may be sample-relative (in which case <a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a> is a tautology; stating that for any given sample, 10% of it will be better than the other 90%).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As we approach the speed of light, the amount of crud in any given sample will approach unity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>at least</strong> 90% of everything is crud, because <strong>everything is crud</strong>. Though in this case the 90% figure is rather arbitrary.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>What about saying that if you take the 10% which is not crud, you can't apply </em><a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a> to that, because that isn't <em>everything</em> anymore?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [That would fall under the statistically valid sample clause.]
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless, even crud can be usable. I'm typing this on Windows after all. . .
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Damn! My crudometer broke. Made of cruddy parts I bet.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There is a 90% chance that the main argument of this page is crud.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This is just Zeno's Paradox all over again. Then again, perhaps my "incrudulity" has been compromised. Hah hah.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        When after the first iteration you take the 10% that you declared "not crud", and consider them a whole, your definition of "crud" changes so that the law still holds.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Does this mean that 90% of Sturgeon's Law is itself crud?
      </p>
      <p>
        yes Sturgeon's L is crud
      </p>
      <p>
        So, aw isn't crud?
      </p>
      <p>
        No, but AWT (<a href="JavaAwt.html">JavaAwt</a>) is crud. Use <a href="JavaSwt.html">JavaSwt</a> instead.
