        Murphy was a real guy. According to legend, the prototype of Murphy's Law was used in his performance review: "If there is a wrong way to do something, Murphy will find it." Actually, according to the <a href="JargonFile.html">JargonFile</a>, Murphy was not the one who made the mistake that inspired his law (a technician methodically connected 16 electrodes to a test subject backwards in a rocket-sled test), but rather the guy responsible for finding out what went wrong.  His original formulation was apparently "If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways results in  catastrophe, then someone will do it that way."

        <em>The guy in the sled, who took all that punishment for nothing, was Col. John Stapp (</em><a href="http://www.ejectionsite.com/stapp.htm).">http://www.ejectionsite.com/stapp.htm).</a>  He's pretty famous among aerospace engineers. You can also thank him for seat belts and crash-testing of automobiles. If you've seen the stock black and white film clip of the guy in the sled with his face all pushed around, that's him. The connectors weren't keyed, so it's not clear whether we should blame the technician or the guy who designed the harness.<em></em>
