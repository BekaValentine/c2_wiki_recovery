        Envy Developer
      </h1>
      <p>
        ENVY/Developer is a source code and configuration
        management system for <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, offered by IBM, and integrated into their <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> family of products. It is also supports whoever now owns the companies formerly known as <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a> and Digitalk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Envy/Developer was originally created by Object Technology International, Inc., before they were acquired by IBM. See OTI's Web page (<a href="http://www.oti.com/)">http://www.oti.com/)</a> for details.

        IBM replaced <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> with the <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> -- effectively killing Envy/Developer, in favor of file-based configuration managers such as CVS and SVN.
      </p>
      <p>
        However third parties support Envy/Developer.  Therefore JpMorgan continues to use it through 2009 for its Kapital application (as discussed in <a href="IfSmalltalkIsSoGoodWhyDoesNobodyUseIt.html">IfSmalltalkIsSoGoodWhyDoesNobodyUseIt</a> )
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently it was once in a suite called Envy/Manager.
