        Frequent Visitors and Contributing Members often create for themselves a <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>. It is the one page on wiki where the content and maintenance of the page is mainly the responsibility of its namesake. Most <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> respect it as a sort of PrivateProperty where one is allowed to create a page which is about their interests, associations and work. It can also serve as a place where others can leave short communications for its owner, who when seeing it in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> will check to see what someone has left there.
