        MCI has used the EOF framework for many of its backoffice functions over the years. The United States Postal Service's call center runs on it too. For something that has had so many important (and large) deployments, its funny how little attention it gets. (Oh wait, there's <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> and <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> in that boat too. :)

        What I find interesting about this product was how ahead of its time it was. They released this thing back around 1994, I believe, before application servers were even a twinkle in the GartnerGroup's eye. It has very mature tools and very well designed object oriented frameworks. The EOModeler application, which does object-to-relational mapping, is one of the best available. It gives the programmer some excellent frameworks for eliminating <a href="TooMuchGuiCode.html">TooMuchGuiCode</a> and <a href="SqlMyopia.html">SqlMyopia</a>.

        "actually, SOPE isn't an implementation of <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a>, but is based on an implementation of <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> called NGObjWeb. NGObjWeb and GNUstepWeb are quite compatible now. NGObjWeb seems more mature than GNUstepWeb, but I think there is still a few problems to use NGObjWeb with GDL2 -- the GNUstep Database layer, compatible with EOF 4.5. A few commercial sites use GNUstepWeb."

        I just learned WO, and I have to say that this is by far the most powerful and productive development tool I have come across!

        Working with HTML? You include "dynamic elements" in the page, which translate to standard HTML at runtime. These dynamic elements have properties that bind to your objects' attributes and methods, also at runtime, totally separating presentation from the business model. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Working with relational databases? You graphically model the object-relational mapping, either for an existing database, or you let the modeling tool create a database for you. Foreign keys or join tables don't even show up in your object model, the objects simply have the necessary associations, resolved at runtime only when necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plus: The libraries are beautifully designed, the whole thing is fun to learn.

        YUP.  Been using it for years. But as the market side of software development is much like <a href="HerdingCats.html">HerdingCats</a> and J2EE has gained ascendency, there aren't as many active WO projects. Sadly.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest version (5.1) is not only pure Java but easily co-exists with J2EE. There's a servlet that plugs into any J2EE container and serves the web (interface) layer and the rest of <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> (know as EOF) is the most robust RDMS<-->O-O framework and toolset around.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only does it correctly (and transparently) handle relationships (via a very clever implementation of FaultObjects) it handles inheritance, joins, uniquing, object-rendezvous...
      </p>
      <p>
        Check it out.

        I wonder... did 5.1 ever fix the problem where updating a one-to-many relationship requires a "fault firing", i.e. performing a potentially large SQL select when all I needed was an update or insert? I know there was a "SmartFaults" package available somewhere, but IIRC it was for <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> only. -- <a href="StuCharlton.html">StuCharlton</a>

        For those who work with standard server-side Java these days, but miss WebObject's EOF, <a href="CayenneFramework.html">CayenneFramework</a> might be just the thing for you. It's an open source ORM framework for Java that has taken its structure an patterns from EOF. I have just checked out the documentation so far, but I can say I like what I see, and it's very very very similar to EOF. I'm definitely going to try it out in depth. -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>

        Or maybe, the best way to get something like <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a>... it is to combine JavaPersistencyApi with the <a href="SeamFramework.html">SeamFramework</a> to get <a href="ObjectRelationalIntegrationWithModelViewController.html">ObjectRelationalIntegrationWithModelViewController</a> as we had in <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> ---<a href="LuxSpes.html">LuxSpes</a>
