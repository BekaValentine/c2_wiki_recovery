        Sometimes a bit of text would be happier in a new home but you don't know where to put it, or haven't completed it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="ExtractMe.html">ExtractMe</a>] is a way of tagging such text so that you or someone else can see it is not in its permanent home and will be moved later to a place which is named appropriately. 
      </p>

        Useful when composing a new page and the temporary residence is your own home page, where you construct and complete it over a period of a few days to a few weeks. This is particularly helpful for incompletely developed and unlinked documents. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way you signify that the page is incomplete and not ready for submission for wiki review and comment.
