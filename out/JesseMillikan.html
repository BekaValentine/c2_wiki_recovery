        Young, professional programmer without a college degree, from central Indiana. I ran into the wiki a few times over the last few years, and finally settled down and read a bunch of it. I contribute when I have something semi-relevant to add, which is almost never.If I've wondered into totally irrelevant territory, feel free to delete it...

        Any jugglers on the wiki? I'm working on a little open pattern animator. Passing patterns (and the list of jugglers doing them) can be built as Scheme lists using some very high-level functions provided. It's beginning to be more of a pitiful animator with lots of juggling primitives than anything else.

        I juggle on Sundays and Thursdays with the Circle City Jugglers (<a href="http://www.circlecityjugglers.com)">http://www.circlecityjugglers.com)</a> if you ever want to hunt me down IRL. You may be forced to ride a RollaBolla before challenging me to mortal combat.

        I'm sort of an entrepreneur now! (<a href="http://www.weddingmusicproject.com">http://www.weddingmusicproject.com</a> not much there yet) Little 3-man thing that probably won't make money. Using NearlyFreeSpeech for hosting, trying to find a blog platform that supports Sqlite (any suggestions?) and we're basically just obsessing over SEO while my dad makes music. Also, I'm a really questionable designer :) See above. Getting better fast. My colors of choice in web design are black, red and white, same as for juggling clubs, shirts, food packaging, and everything else. I'm such a great artist! As long as you don't want me to use blue because I will say <strong>no</strong> and find an adult.

               Thanks! I've already got two Befunge examples that, as you've said, don't have '@' :). The trouble is that I really wanted to have build/run instructions for each; non-working examples drive me nuts. I'll pull these in as soon as I get them to build or get over my anal-retentiveness.

        I've started viewing at 5 inches wide with .2 inch margins for easier reading. I use the "Stylish" <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a> plugin with this CSS:

      <code>
        @-moz-document url-prefix(<a href="http://c2.com)">http://c2.com)</a> {<br/>
        div#wiki { max-width: 5in }<br/>
        body { padding: .2in }<br/>
        }<br/>
        @-moz-document url-prefix(<a href="http://www.c2.com)">http://www.c2.com)</a> {<br/>
        div#wiki { max-width: 5in }<br/>
        body { padding: .2in }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>

          em is exactly what I tried first! I decided that I wanted it to stay the same across font sizes and faces, for some reason, so I went with inches instead. Same result, since I never change font sizes.
