        Tabbed Browsing
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 6, you had the option to open a URL in a new window. A new browser window opens and it appears in the TaskBar. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 7+ (it sucks though), <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a>, <a href="OperaBrowser.html">OperaBrowser</a>, <a href="GoogleChrome.html">GoogleChrome</a> and <a href="SafariBrowser.html">SafariBrowser</a> you have the option of opening a URL in a new browser window, or as a tab in an existing browser window. Each Web page appears as a tab near the top of the browser window. You click in the tab to view that Web page. The result is that all the open pages are maintained in a single browser instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        My new favorite feature in <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a> and <a href="OperaBrowser.html">OperaBrowser</a> is the "Bookmark this group of tabs..." or "Open all folder items" command. Choose one bookmark and all your "Morning Paper" URLs load as tabs in a single window. Makes surfing your regular sites a breeze...

        Did you ever visit a WarezSite or PornSite? You'll have noticed how many windows open. With <a href="TabbedBrowsing.html">TabbedBrowsing</a> you just kill the one and only browser instance and don't have to close your browser windows one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In </em><a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a>, you can turn off the <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> that "Opens unrequested Windows" in the Preferences->Advanced->Scripts & Plugins panel. Say goodbye to the "window opening orgy" once and for all.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Opera even has a shortcut for this. Hit F12, set 'Accept pop-up windows' or 'Refuse pop-up windows' and voila. Need it for a particular site -> 2 seconds to change.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, but the <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a> approach is even better - it takes 0 seconds to change. The reason is that the behavior is not to block pop-up windows, but <em>unrequested</em> pop-up windows. If the window is created by javascript run by a user event (eg: I clicked on something) then it gets created, for any other reason (eg: this site wants to open a new window whenever I leave their site), then it doesn't. That's the behavior that most users want ALL THE TIME.
        And available in Opera (7 only, possibly) as well.

      <p>
        Did you ever go to a site that resizes your window with its dozen tabs? And you automatically kill the entire window because you think it's a popup? And you're unable to find any of the pages in the history because the last time you let opera fetch them over your slow modem connection was three weeks ago?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In Mozilla, you can simply not allow javascript to do this: Edit > Preferences > Advanced > Scripts & Plug-Ins > take your pick.</em>

        You can do <a href="ConcurrentReading.html">ConcurrentReading</a> of the web much more easily with this, but that is not necessarily a good thing!

        There is a crucial semantic difference between Opera and Mozilla tabs: Z-order. Here's a test: open ten tabs; bring up the leftmost, then the second leftmost, and then the rightmost. Now close the current (rightmost) tab. In Mozilla, you now see the second-rightmost tab; in Opera, you see the second-leftmost again. Opera's tabs behave like windows, in that they have a Z-order (changing to a tab just brings it to the front; when you close it, you see what was previously at the front). Mozilla's don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is another effect, connected to how the browser cycles through tabs; Mozilla just goes from left to right (and back round at the end), whereas Opera uses the Z-order, sending the current tab to the back.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Personally, I find Opera's Z-orderful tabs much easier to use, but I prefer Mozilla's cycling behaviour. I think this is because I tend to have more tabs than I do space in my own Z-order buffer; I know what the top three or so tabs are, so with Opera I get what I expect if I close or minimize one), but not all of them, so I'm surprised when cycling jumps around the open tabs at random. Perhaps we need some kind of decaying Z-order, so tabs right at the back silently assume left-to-right order. Or maybe we should fix Z-order and left-to-right order to be the same, so changing to a tab moves it to the left end of the bar (note - this is a terrible idea). Anyway, either way beats the hell out of having a window per page. -- </em><a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a><em></em>

        <a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a> has an extension <strong></strong>TabbrowserExtensions<strong> that allows grouped tabs. I haven't used that feature much, but it appears to allow setting the tab to return to upon a CloseTab action. -- </strong><a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

      <p>
        <em>Some guy wrote an extension called </em>FocusLastSelectedTab that uses a Z-order when deciding what tab to show when the current tab is closed. Cycling is not affected; ctrl-tab still goes through the list from left to right. The extension is at <a href="http://gorgias.de/mfe/''">http://gorgias.de/mfe/''</a>

        <a href="TabbedBrowsing.html">TabbedBrowsing</a> allowed me to develop a bad technique/habit. I use it when trying to learn a subject, or looking for recipes (especially on opinionated food, like dough). It's a simple principle, which works like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           You Google for a general term, and open the first 10-15 links in new tabs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           You read the pages quickly, skipping parts which aren't going well.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           You open any interesting link in the pages as you go along, creating a queue of tabs (got enough RAM?)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Once you notice that the rate at which you close the tabs is higher than the one you're opening them, you're probably done.
        </li>
      </ol>

      </p>
      <p>
        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a> as well, very much so. Not just with Google, but with this Wiki and browsing in general as well. Whenever I come across something interesting, I open it in a new tab (Opera even lets you use a background tab). That way, the flow of what I'm reading is not interrupted, but at the same time I make sure that I won't forget that interesting link I saw. -- <a href="AalbertTorsius.html">AalbertTorsius</a>, a TabaholicAnonymous

        <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> based <a href="MaxthonBrowser.html">MaxthonBrowser</a> has a Group feature that will reload all tabs that are grouped together in a future visit. It is sort of like <a href="LiveBookmarks.html">LiveBookmarks</a>, but better in the sense that the user makes the decision which sites to group together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Aren't </em><a href="LiveBookmarks.html">LiveBookmarks</a> more like <a href="RssFeeds.html">RssFeeds</a> readers? -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a><em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, they are RSS feed readers. And, of course, which pages you load up together is user-selectable in mozilla too, as you can open a directory of bookmarks in separate tabs (or the sidebar), or start up with different pages on different tabs.

      <p>
        Some Pop-up calendars don't work right in Netscape 8.1 because of tabbed browsing and I could not find a way to turn it off. The closest thing is an XUL pluggin that allegedly disables tabs forever, but I would rather temporarily turn it off rather than outright kill it.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It is difficult to implement an <strong>MDI-style</strong> interface if tabbed browsing is activated. Small pop-up dialogs cannot be built the standard HTML way. This is another reason why we need a new kind of "GUI browser" that has real widgets and a desktop-like feel.
