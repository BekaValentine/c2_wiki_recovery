        Here are some statements to consider:

        Quoted From "<a href="SuccessOrientedApproach.html">SuccessOrientedApproach</a>"
      </p>
      <p>
        The orientation toward success is different from that of mere involvement in a project. All projects have people involved who are there because of inducements. The orientation toward success is not and will never be found in all members. All projects have those whose motivation is not project success, but employment. They may fear the successful outcome and the release from the project of its membership which will occur when the project comes to a successful conclusion, and who will not view as desirable a success prior to their being induced or employed elsewhere. This is particularly true for those who have been burnt in the past by not being sufficiently concerned with what is to happen in their own employment when success or cancelation brought a previous endeavour to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        The engendering of an orientation of success must include the continuing success of those who contribute to a project successfully completed.
