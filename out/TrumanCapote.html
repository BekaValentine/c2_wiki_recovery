        Truman Capote
      </h1>
      <p>
        Writer. Most famous for the novella <em></em>BreakfastAtTiffanys<em> (ISBN 0679745653), though my favorite work of his is </em>InColdBlood<em> (ISBN 0679745580); the prototypical </em>TrueCrime novel, and more importantly, the first major piece of journalism with a novelistic narrative. Capote spent six years in and around Garden City, KS interviewing townspeople, detectives, and the perpetrators themselves researching for this book, which covers the Clutter case, a shockingly brutal and motiveless multiple homocide in a sleepy town in rural Holcomb Kansas. <em>Definitely. I had no idea who TC was (still don't), but </em>InColdBlood made my blood run cold at the end when the actual killer turned out to be the one most similar to my roommate. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a><em></em>
