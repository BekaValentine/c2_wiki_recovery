        Broken Hungarian Notation
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is something rather insane that I use.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have rather adapted an unusual naming convention based on <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a>. More specific entries are further down, pick last matching rule.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Private (and sometimes protected) member variables start with _.
        </li>
        <li>
           Stack references get prefix o: oRow, oFactory, oConnection, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Handles to objects (or objects that wrap such handles) get single letter prefixes:
          <ul>
            <li>
               f for file objects
            </li>
            <li>
               s for sockets
            </li>
            <li>
               h for other random objects (including nonspecific IO handles)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Handles to GUI objects get a three letter type identifier: txt, cmb, cmd, tv, frm, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           pointers (except object pointers) usually start with p.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Looping pointers are ptr or derived from ptr.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Trivially named objects get single or two letter starting with certain letters:
          <ul>
            <li>
               i, j, k: unspecified integer, often loop counter or index
            </li>
            <li>
               h: handle that is operated on
            </li>
            <li>
               n, m: size, count (number of things to operate on)
            </li>
            <li>
               s, t: strings (if two strings, s is the target, t is the source)
            </li>
            <li>
               r: return value of function when it needs to be a local variable
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The only really strange thing here is that opened files get called fWhatever, but are passed to IO routines receiving h as the argument. The o as member reference is derived from the use of o as Object. _o strikes me as too ugly to be useful.
