        Private Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="PrivateLanguage.html">PrivateLanguage</a> is a language (particularly a natural language), that is spoken by no one except its inventor. Many people seem to enjoy <a href="PrivateLanguage.html">PrivateLanguage</a>s as a hobby. Sometimes these languages escape (e.g., Tolkien's languages).
      </p>
      <p>
        But as long as a language is private it is not really a language, because language is inherently about communication and lives from the exchange of ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Untrue, one may use a private language to communicate with one's self. Whether it's in code or notes, it's still a language, even if never shared.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A private language has the danger of expressing ideas in such a way that their inventor thinks they make sense, but this cannot be verified and can easily lead to self-delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this is still the case if you communicate with yourself. You can see how strong this is, if you try to read your own notes a long time later. Many of them can no longer be deciphered (and I don't mean because of illegibility), simply because you lost all the required context to understand them.

        This is precisely why ideas expressed in a social network are valuable in the process of notion condensing : clarified  when the participant decides to venture into the paradigm of <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a>. When this is done, the act of writing down the idea or thought leads first of all to clarification in the mind, not only of the thinker-writer, but also in the minds of those who find and read them. In social-networking, one apparatus for clarifying and elaborating ideas is a process called <a href="PositiveDialogue.html">PositiveDialogue</a>. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.20100114 20140223

        A private language could also be a programming language designed and used by only one programmer. I've used a couple of job-specific jury-rigged TLIs for proof-of-concept prototypes which were later officially coded in assembler (one of them controlled a product that demo'd at Comdex before being properly engineered). I don't think that was unique. -- <a href="MarcThibault.html">MarcThibault</a>

        One example where I did this and I am not sure how it will be taken by other developers is to create a "cell" call to format web reports but also optionally format it as spreadsheet output using the same API. It looked something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        cell(value, columnSpan, options)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The options used parenthesized strings as a work-around to lack of named parameters in the language. A typical call set looked something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
        newRow();<br/>
        cell("Total", 2, "(bold)(rightpad)");<br/>
        cell(totalAmt, 1, "(bold)(border)(left)(num)");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I had to match a fairly complex format when converting from a legacy system and this is what I came up with. "rightpad" was basically the same as right-aligned, but with a bit of a space on the right side, probably for esthetic purposes. There was also a "leftpad". Most people just used HTML for this kind of thing, and MS-Excel generally translated HTML okay, but one did not have a lot of control over certain aspects. Thus, I created this sub-language to gain control, but another developer may grumble about having to learn and reverse engineer it. I thought it is generally self-explanatory, but one does not know until another developer has to modify something in it. Sometimes I think I went too far overboard to match the formatting style of the legacy version. -- top

        In the context of programming languages, could this be considered one of the <a href="LevelsOfGreenspunning.html">LevelsOfGreenspunning</a>?
