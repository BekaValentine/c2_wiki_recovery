        Christine The Law Student
      </h1>
      <code>
        An intelligent law student Christine<br/>
        While studying high on caffeine<br/>
        Hunched like a toad<br/>
        with the Criminal Code<br/>
        Which was rife with injustice obscene<br/>
        She was working upon its rewrite<br/>
        But it put up a good legal fight<br/>
        With words some arcane<br/>
        Others merely mundane<br/>
        But words unlike lawyers<br/>
        don't bite.<br/>

      <p>
        Speaking of biting lawyers, a guy walks into a bar with an alligator on a leash and says to the bartender, 'You serve lawyers in this bar?'
      </p>
      <p>
        The bartender looks nervously at the alligator, and says 'Um, yessir, we certainly do.'
      </p>
      <p>
        'Good', says the guy. 'I'll have a beer, and I'll have a lawyer for my alligator.'
