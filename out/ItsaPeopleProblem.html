        <strong>The biggest challenge of </strong><a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a> is getting people working together as a team on things that add value. None of the technical challenges your project might face will be harder or more important than this.<strong> from </strong>ItsaPeopleBusiness

        I think part of the fault is the education system. It tends to give nerds more nerd courses and "people-people" more social-oriented education. It should be the <strong>reverse</strong> in my opinion. Education seems geared to emphasize our strengths instead of building up our weaknesses. This kind of specialization does not work anymore. Anti-social techy jobs are now too easy to export to low-wage countries. from ItsaPeopleBusiness by 67.73.12.40
