        Complexity Of Outputting Duplicate Tuples In Tutorial Dee
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>From a discussion on </em><a href="BagAtational.html">BagAtational</a>...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's define a complexity metric that will be used to judge a new feature.  Our metric will be based on assigning a count of 1 to each new issue a user needs to learn in order to know the feature.  We'll total up the counts to determine the feature's overall complexity.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Call the metric C, such that C(0) means using the feature raises no issues and therefore requires no new learning. C(1) means 1 issue, C(3) means 3 issues, and so on.  C(n) is lower complexity than C(n+1).  
      </p>
      <p>
        The new feature, in this case, will be providing a means to emit duplicate rows/tuples in <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> and <em>Rel</em> (see <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, the projection or "give me just these columns in the output" operator is represented by {a, b, ... z} where a, b through z are column aka attribute names.  See <a href="QueryLanguageComparison.html">QueryLanguageComparison</a> for some examples.  Projection eliminates duplicates.  
      </p>
      <p>
        To make projection emit duplicates, we'll add a hypothetical optional keyword called "DUPLICATES".  A projection of {a, b} will remove duplicates but {DUPLICATES a, b} will emit them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The keyword itself is given a count of 1.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a DUPLICATES projection within a subquery is invalid, because relations are, by definition, free of duplicates.  So, {DUPLICATES a, b} in a subquery should throw an error.  
      </p>
      <p>
        That's another count of 1.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Using {DUPLICATES a, b} where a and/or b is a key is meaningless, and should at least throw a warning.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Another count of 1, that.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, modifying projection to support duplicates has a total complexity count of 3.  It is complexity C(3).  
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's assume we wish to emit duplicates to a file to meet a user's requirements.  <em>Rel</em> can use FOR and WRITELN to emit tuples to some external file like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        FOR myRelvar {a, b} ORDER(ASC a);<br/>
        WRITELN a || " " || b;<br/>
        END FOR;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        FOR iterates over the tuples in the relation returned by the expression 'myRelvar {a, b}', sorted in ascending order on attribute 'a'.  FOR will not iterate over duplicate tuples because the projection {a, b} returns no duplicate tuples.
      </p>
      <p>
        WRITELN emits the values of a and b for each tuple.  I've omitted the file handling bits for the sake of simplicity.  It would be the same regardless how we emit duplicates, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's compare how we output duplicates.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume we're using the following <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>:
      </p>
      <code>
        VAR myRelvar REAL RELATION {k CHAR, a CHAR, b CHAR} KEY {k};<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Assume we wish to emit all values of a and b including duplicates, but not the key k.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way is this:
      </p>
      <code>
        FOR myRelvar {DUPLICATES a, b} ORDER(ASC a);<br/>
        WRITELN a || " " || b;<br/>
        END FOR;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        We're using our modified projection operator, which has a complexity of C(3).
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way is this:
      </p>
      <code>
        FOR myRelvar {k, a, b} ORDER(ASC a);<br/>
        WRITELN a || " " || b;<br/>
        END FOR;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        No special mechanisms are required.  We merely do not include k in the WRITELN statement, which is precisely the same WRITELN statement we'd use in the first example!
      </p>
      <p>
        Total complexity of the second method is, therefore, C(0).
      </p>
      <p>
        C(0) < C(3).  The second approach is less complex than the first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, modifying projection to emit duplicates is more complex than <em>not</em> modifying projection to emit duplicates.
      </p>

        <em>There are several flaws in your counting, but I'll focus on the biggest first. Your FOR-ENDFOR should be dinged for many points because it's not declarative; some shops may disable imperative statements because of security risks, optimization risks, and so forth. It's extra complexity. Other query languages can do it within the *query* language (declarative) and don't require imperative statements. Your argument could be reduced to, "Since this ugly thing already exists in the language, we might as well use it to do more ugly things." </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And WRITELINE doesn't output to standard tables, but a string. If you output to standard tables, such as ODBC results, then usually there's a way to export to CSV, XML, spreadsheets, etc. Custom strings don't do that unless you manually add delimiters etc. (including dealing with delimiter and quote escaping). It's outside of both "table land" and declarative land, and is therefore butt-ugly.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        --top
      </p>
      <p>
        I think you're not seeing the forest for the trees.  Use of FOR is not the issue here.  The FOR construct was merely selected as an example, one that implies arbitrary manipulation of "duplicate" tuples, including emitting duplicates.  As I've written elsewhere, <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, and hence <em>Rel</em>, is intended to be a general-purpose imperative programming language with built-in database capabilities.  It is more than just a query language.  Imperative capabilities are not deprecated, but promoted along with functional aspects like explicit <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a> operators.  In that respect, it's like <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>.  I could equally have chosen to illustrate this with Rel's EXPORT statement, but as it's still a work in progress (whereas FOR is complete) I chose to demonstrate something that interested readers can execute for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shops that disable imperative statements?  I presume that means no PL/SQL, no Transact-SQL, and so on?  I've not seen it, but I can't say I'm surprised.  Such shops will not be happy with <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> or <em>Rel</em>.  Fair enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outputting to standard tables, by the way, is done by linking to the external DBMS tables or JDBC datasources as <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>s and simply using them in the same manner as native <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>s.  INSERT works on them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        BTW, I believe my counting is accurate.  The total of three ones is... Three.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not needing a stupid loop is worth 20 points. You are pushing the issue onto the app language side, not getting rid of it. That's NOT where I'd prefer it be. It's like saying, "My leaky septic tank killing the grass is </em>not<em> a plumbing issue, it's a gardening issue: get a grass species that is shit-tolerant."</em>

           [{DUPLICATES a,b} within a query was blocked. That's C(1). What <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> promotes, however, is keeping duplicates within the queries. That means learning how duplicates are handled for every operator. What do duplicates mean on insert? on delete? on union? on intersect? on joins? How do you tell a duplicate entry error from a valid 'new' insert? How many 'points' are these issues worth? In any case, the silly crank seems to be substituting rants for reason.]
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>As far as the INSERT situation, if you have primary keys defined, then the DBMS will not allow such. Again, bags are an option, not a universal decree. As far as how it's dealt with, you can study existing RDBMS as working specimens.</em> -t
        </li>
        <li>
           [Sure. But that does not eliminate any complexity. Extra choice means <em>extra</em> complexity, unless the choice is meaningless. Of course, adding uniqueness constraints to a data model costs a similar amount whether that data model is implemented is implemented by bags, trees, object graphs, relations, or whatever. (Uniqueness constraints can spend a little complexity in the data model to reduce it in the applications (updates, queries, etc.). If data model is much smaller than application - or is used by <em>many</em> applications - the complexity savings may be multiplied by orders-of-magnitude. <a href="WaterbedTheory.html">WaterbedTheory</a> only applies in a closed system.]
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>I believe you are exaggerating the alleged net savings. You've failed to produce a practical demonstration/explanation involving common and realistic scenarios and data.

            </li>
            <li>
               [Your 'belief' is acknowledged. I shall not attempt to correct it, as you are never willing to acknowledge or comprehend anything that conflicts with your beliefs. Instead, I shall ask you to evaluate whether your beliefs are <em>consistent</em>. Standardization, for example, <strong>is</strong> reduction of choice - to better support extensible systems. If your belief about exaggeration is consistent, you must believe complexity in an open system <em>cannot</em> be significantly diminished by standardization. This means, for example, you do not believe that organizing data into a standard format, as per <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>, will reduce complexity. Similarly, it means that you do not believe that a <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> will do anyone any good with regards to saving work or complexity. Now, clearly there is a contradiction here relative to your arguments on TOP and GML, so ReductioAdAbsurdum: one of my premises must be wrong. I suspect the wrong premise is that you are a person who has consistent beliefs. (But I may be wrong. Perhaps you do believe that standards like TOP and GML offer you little more than a hand-waving and unquantifiable advantage in 'psychology'.) Perhaps your ego is too fragile for you to admit to being 'wrong' in any field where you think yourself competent (this is hardly unusual). Or perhaps you like being the underdog more than you favor pursuit of truth. You'd probably be that guy promoting types if you had 'discovered' them on your own, but instead you see types as encroaching on your comfort area and so you resist. Rationality is always the first casualty in any discussion you join, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>.]

            <li>
               It's simply that you have not shown that the downsides of some bag-friendly features outweigh the upsides. Your argument resembles a religious belief, not weighing practical costs and benefits. This applies to your no-null arguments also. They fit the same pattern.
            </li>
            <li>
               [You have not demonstrated any 'upsides' of the bag-friendly "features". A few of your arguments suggest that you're simply in the habit of using SQL tools a specific way, regardless of whether you might be better accommodated by integration of other tools and languages. Most of your arguments - e.g. that bags 'better fit the messy world' - seem to be fundamentally unjustifiable... i.e. you express a belief that cannot be argued from any set of facts. I do not <em>see</em> any upsides <em>intrinsic</em> to the bag-friendly "features" to weigh against. However, I do see plenty of downsides <em>intrinsic</em> to the bag-friendly features, and I see plenty intrinsic to introducing unnecessary 'choice'. If you want me to start weighing the alleged upsides of bag-like features, first you must get me to acknowledge the upsides are <em>a consequence</em> of the bag-like features.]
            </li>
            <li>
               The benefits are pretty clear to me. I'm not sure how to better communicate them beyond what I've already said. As far as the output side, it requires more tools, more typing, more syntax/commands to learn, and a more complex query language (such as needing imperative loops and a WRITE statement). As far as the read-only event log, you haven't given enough details about how it works in your fav query language, especially if the table is too large to completely copy to the client or local DBMS. After you've supplied those details, then we can dissect the pros/cons.

               <em>*Sigh* It's been pointed out again and again and again that there was nothing "needing imperative loops and a WRITE statement".  It was intended only as an illustration.</em>

               Well, I need something concrete to compare (unless you want me to make up some "ideal" Rel of my own). If you are dropping that example, then please present a replacement.

      <p>
        Nice rant.  Read my response above, again.  Pay particular attention to the part where I "could equally have chosen to illustrate this with Rel's EXPORT statement".  No loops.  The loop was deliberately chosen to illustrate arbitrary processing of duplicates.  In other words, you can do <em>anything</em> you like with duplicates <strong>in a pure relational environment.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For one, it creates a violation of </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> because one has to <strong>duplicate the SELECT list</strong> in the formatting side (minus the keys). That's more typing, more code, and more places to make mistakes. With "traditional" query languages, one does not have to write loops and formatting statements to remove the key(s). If that doesn't personally bother you, fine. I just don't want it as part of my tools. I believe most real-world developers will agree with me. The 10% of the population that is anal or purity-obsessed can use yours.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        EXPORT, for example, doesn't "duplicate the SELECT list".  WRITELN is an arbitrary statement.  It could be <strong>any code at all</strong> including something to export data.  That was the point.  It was meant to be illustrative rather than definitive.  But, as usual, you're merely being pointlessly argumentative.  
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, I've already got real-world developers using <em>Rel</em>.  How many real-world developers are using SmeQL?  Why don't you implement it and then we'll see which is more popular.  I'd welcome the competition and the opportunity to kick your sorry butt, market share-wise of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Let's compare the total code change and effort required to remove the key and create a CSV file using a "bag" query language:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Before:
      </p>
      <code>
        SELECT a, b<strong>, k</strong> FROM myTable<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Select "run" icon in Toad, right click on result window, and choose Save As, select CSV
      </p>
      <p>
        After:
      </p>
      <code>
        SELECT a, b FROM myTable<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Select "run" icon in Toad, right click on result window, and choose Save As, select CSV (same) [1].
      </p>
      <p>
        --top
      </p>
      <p>
        You're kidding, right?  Ok, what <strong>language statement</strong> implements the export to CSV?  Are you expecting me to incorporate Toad into my automated toolchain and run it on my unattended headless UNIX box?
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and here's <em>Rel's</em> work-in-progress EXPORT statement:
      </p>
      <p>
        No duplicates:
      </p>
      <code>
        EXPORT myRelvar {k, a, b} ORDER(ASC a) FORMAT CSV TO "myfile.csv"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Duplicates:
      </p>
      <code>
        EXPORT myRelvar {k, a, b} ORDER(ASC a) EXCLUDE k FORMAT CSV TO "myfile.csv"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        No Toad required.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So you add a new command and EXCLUDE keyword to "solve" it. That can't look well on the complexity scale. (It looks more and more like </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>'s ugly sister, too.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [You think a toad is prettier?]

        <li>
           <em>Us trolls love toads: dark, damp, and squatty. You might as well put a GUI into Rel, everything else is there. Why have a </em>KingLanguage when you can have a <a href="GodLanguage.html">GodLanguage</a>? Note that while an <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> replacement might be a good idea, we still need a "base" query language that improves upon SQL. When that's established, then we can work on app-language-like extensions.  You gotta walk before you run.<em> -t</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           The notion of a division between a query language on its own, and an application language with an interface to that query language, is increasingly deprecated.  As for a GUI, future versions of <em>Rel</em> will introduce a closely-coupled GUI (running over Rel-JDBC or some equivalent), that has been started as a student project.  This kind of coupling has been shown historically to be highly successful in products like <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, BorlandParadox, <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a>, and so on. However, <em>Rel</em> is also usable as a conventional stand-alone DBMS with imperative language capabilities in the same vein as PL/SQL, Transact-SQL and the like.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>It's also one of the reasons for the down-fall of </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> and Paradox: they didn't integrate so well with SQL-based RDBMS because of their monolithic integration. Even MS-Access has lack-luster integration with non-MS RDBMS. If you break things into components, then the components can mature and change semi-independently, allowing flexible evolution. God-tools are great when released, but unexpected changes in technology and practices tend to byte them in the arse, and <strong>their weakest point drags them down</strong>. They are shooting stars. Anyhow, for now I'm competing with SQL, not MS-Access.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Eh? How, exactly, are <em>you</em> "competing with" anything?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And what command, with keywords or not, do you use to create a CSV file?  Without Toad.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is ridiculous, of course.  You can imagine anything you like and paste it into one of your SmeQL pages.  I present a <strong>working language</strong> that <strong>people are downloading and using</strong>.  What have you created except hot air?  You are a festering blight on the IT landscape, and a vast sinkhole into which productivity pours.  The sad thing is that it happens voluntarily.  You have a unique talent for making it appear, briefly, like your ignorance might be addressable with education.  I don't blame you, of course, because you're deluded enough to think you're actually doing something useful.  For me, however, I <em>could</em> have written some code -- perhaps fulfilling one of my appreciative users' requests -- in the time it took to write this.  I should know better.  You, sir, are a troll, but it is I who suck for allowing myself to once again be trolled.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Red Herring. A poorly-designed language is still poorly designed even if it runs. I suggest you get the detectable kinks out BEFORE coding. You didn't do your homework. Sure, I could add linguistic bells and whistles to </em><a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> for the hell of it, but if I can keep most of it simple, I will. Otherwise, you are just reinventing the mistakes of SQL, but with a purist twist. -t <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I presume SmeQL will export to CSV files using Toad too, yes?  Troll.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I would note that an EXPORT operation can be added without adding new syntax, just a library entry. This is because it doesn't rely on hard-wired keywords. I think it's a good thing.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But that's all in theory, because you haven't implemented anything.  Isn't it you who always advocates "race the damn car" or some such?  When's the SmeQL car going to be more than a teenage sketch on the back of your schoolbooks? 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's legitimate criticism, but it </em>'doesn't change<em>' any flaws in T.D./Rel. We BOTH have areas to work on, okay?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What you consider flaws might actually be features.  
      </p>
      <p>
        But, admittedly, vice versa (in all possible permutations)...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        (On a side note, in this day and age, hard-wired key-word-heavy languages are kind of a smell. Why not use some kind of <a href="UniversalStatement.html">UniversalStatement</a> (including XML or <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a>) so that the syntax tree itself doesn't start to look like SQL's and COBOL's. I've considered a <a href="UniversalStatement.html">UniversalStatement</a> for <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a>, but so far it doesn't need enough optional keywords to justify going away from positional parameters. But since positional is a subset of U.S., it can be added later without breaking existing code.)

        <em>You've used Algol, have you?  Troll.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's what they generally call languages that look like C, Pascal, Ada, etc. They can trace their style back to Algol more or less.

           I don't understand your point with the toaster and hammer example. If you rarely use them together, then don't couple them. If you use them together often, then it may make sense to couple them. For example, suppose your toaster tended to freeze up often, locking your toast in, and you've found that a hammer hit on the left side is the only known way to unfreeze it. So, you keep a hammer next to it. However, family members keep walking off with the hammer, making you late for work or hungry. Thus, you get some metal wire and nails and connect the two together via a tether. You've coupled them because they are often used together in your house. Maybe there is a "tool theory" where the optimum partitioning and coupling of features can be found by the usage relationship (weight) between features. -t

           As far as relational algebra versus "formatting", you seem to be wrapped up in "perfect classification". Feature sets will tend to bleed into each other's territories at the edges. Cup holders seem strange in cars because cars are not kitchens. However, if you live in big California cities you will soon find that cars end up being de-facto kitchens because people spend so much time stuck in traffic. It's a marriage of practicality, not of ideal classifications. I believe you have an overly-idealistic personality such that grey areas irritate you. Relational algebra transforms tables, or at least "grid-like things". Managing the inclusion and order of rows and columns is also a form of "<strong>grid transformation</strong>". Thus, they <strong>are</strong> related, you just have to widen your classification groups more: things that manipulate grids. Relational is a sub-set of grid manipulation (or at least could be viewed that way). In this view they are not too different after all. -t

           How tool functionality is partitioned generally depends on which features are most likely to be used together. Hammers have nail removers built-in because the need for nail removing is statistically high when hammers (the blunt end) are used. I do know that when I am doing internal ad-hoc queries, I need to look at the output either as a preview, or because I'm studying something, such as looking for particular records or data patterns. Color and cell boarders are not really important for that. If those are needed, then usually they are needed together with many OTHER formatting features such as for presentation purposes, such as fonts, page numbers, titles, paper margin control, etc. At that point I get a report writer or export to a spreadsheet to pretty it up. But for my use, internal use, those don't matter much. However, the existence and ordering of rows and columns do matter. I cannot see the "grid" I want to see without them. They are features that are commonly needed in association with the rest of the query language; at least for my usage patterns. As long as a given shop, machine, or tool has SQL, I have at least the ability to get the grid I want. Those machines don't have to have installed formatters also along with the baggage formatters bring with them.

For example, I suspect some debugging facilities and a <a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a> (which can order-by columns, and hide them, among other typical features) could achieve the same goals you are aiming for, do a higher quality job, and do so without requiring any compromises of language that might hinder optimizations or semantics.

How is that different from sticking a second tool on the end of the stack? <strong>Something</strong> is going to have to do the chopping anyhow.

           [Sure, it's easier. <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> will need to include some extra facilities for hooking up to SQL DBMSs, such as auto-numbering tables that potentially possess duplicates.

If 'easy implementation' is a priority, you should probably stick with <a href="SqLite.html">SqLite</a> or <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a> or Oracle... because the 'easiest' implementation solution is to use an existing implementation.]

        I believe this debate comes down to whether mixed bags+sets or just sets are the best structural fit for business applications. I lean toward mixed because I believe the real world is "too messy" to fit closely to a set-only tool-set, as described above. One is modeling business and political rules created by irrational or poorly-informed managers and users, not PhD's, and bags can better fit this environment. Sets-only are just too idealistic. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As has been explained repeatedly, in a true relational system (typically a DBMS) it is trivial to (a) eliminate duplicates on import/link and (b) trivial to produce duplicates on output for those exceedingly rare cases where users require duplicates.</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In other words, bags are only (slightly) relevant at the boundaries of the relational system.  Within the relational system, bags are not needed at all.  Supporting them only adds complexity and potentially diminishes optimisation.  Therefore, there is no reason to support bags outside of import/link (i.e., input) and output, as described above.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I have, by the way, </em>'never<em>' seen a business case for maintaining duplicate rows in a table in a database.  I have seen it done, obviously, but never with sound justification.  In most cases, it's been done purely out of carelessness or ignorance.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The scenarios in <a href="BagNeedScenarios.html">BagNeedScenarios</a> are not that rare in my experience, but we can <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> those frequency issues rather than continue bickering over that point. As far as optimization, it would only be an issue if there was a bag in a resource-critical portion of a given query. Again, I'm for having choice. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do you expect users to know what the "resource-critical portion of a given query" happens to be?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As I mentioned before somewhere, a poorly-skilled query writer will often make many other mistakes. Duplicate-management being just one. Plus, if the option of bags is removed for them, they may make other messes to compensate, ie, force a bag. <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a> often just works better in the real world. Idealism often proves uneconomical. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why would anyone "force a bag"?  Anyway, at worst that would mean a table with an auto-generated primary key.  Your comment that "idealism often proves uneconomical" is based on what?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Auto-generated keys can be unwanted overhead, and may not solve the "bag problem" anyhow, simply putting lipstick on a pig. They may remove "technical duplicates" but not necessarily "logical" or "domain" duplicates. As far as the economics of idealism, I'll refer you to <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a>.

           Why can't you just polity ask for clarification instead of turning it into a personal dig? Does everything have to be a personal dig? It gets old. It really seems to me that you wear sinister-colored glasses when you read my writing and view every action of mine with the most negative possible interpretation of motives possible. Now, back to the topic. I generally meant unique keys that are part of the domain and not created just to have a unique key for some temporary or internal process. For example, in the "logger" scenario from <a href="BagNeedScenarios.html">BagNeedScenarios</a>, one could add their own Auto-Number type to the extracted data set(s) just to have a reference number for internal processing. But, it's not part of the domain and is not guaranteed to reference the same "record" the next time around. It's only put there to have a temporary internal reference ID, not to make a one-to-one correspondence with anything real in the real world (or domain). If you can suggest a better name for it, I'd be happy to consider it and re-write the above. -t

        <li>
           [This is a good example why I stopped asking for clarifications a long time ago. That's not a domain "duplicate", it's a domain key -- and if they're duplicates, they're by definition not keys. You do such violence to terminology by using established terms inaccurately, or by making up subtle distinctions that only you understand, that half your arguments are inscrutable, and there's not enough time in a day to waste it asking for clarification at every turn.]

           [As for a logging application, one needs to <em>find</em> the true domain keys if they haven't been handed to you on a platter. Duplicate log messages that can't be distinguished are useless noise, and that's true of most duplicate rows in general. If all you want is a count of how many times a log message occurs, then for god's sake count them. A more likely domain key would be e.g. time of arrival at sufficient resolution to order the messages, or by source, or a combination of several such things.]

           It either has perfect identifiers or it's useless? That's not the world I live in. Your excess idealism is showing again. Wear a longer dress. (Those things are already addressed in the write-up.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [It has nothing whatsoever to do with idealism. That's another typical Top distraction/cop-out/obfuscation and a reason that discussions with you run around in circles forever filling the wiki with pointless words. "Key" <strong>means</strong> unique identifier when you're talking about data in a database. A "key" that is not a unique identifier <em>is not a key</em>. See what an utter waste of time it is when you don't know and use common terminology correctly?]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your statement, "Duplicate log messages that can't be distinguished are useless noise" is rather extreme. Suppose the log record indicated that something unusual happened, but we can't tell, due to a misconfiguration of logger identifier info, whether it happened at location A or location B. We still know that something unusual happened at the location of at least one of the loggers. Further analysis of the data patterns may improve the guess.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        [This is a really bizarre discussion. In a decade of working on accounting systems, I have also never seen a legitimate use of duplicate rows within a system of queries, and none of Top's "reasons" for offering it as an "option" make the least bit of sense to me. When duplicates occur in systems of SQL queries, it's almost always a mistake, or, when deliberate, leads to later mistakes when the output of such a query is used in another context. The cases where an artificial key has been needed in an intermediate query result have been very, very few. It makes tremendous sense to be able to generate non-relational outputs with duplicate rows, and almost none to incorporate them within a relational system. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a> ]
      </p>
      <p>
        Accounting is probably a domain where one is <em>least</em> likely to encounter such a need because it's unforgiving and requires careful schema design and query writing. I gave some non-accounting scenarios in <a href="BagNeedScenarios.html">BagNeedScenarios</a>. If by chance you disagree that those are likely, just say so and we'll move on. No reason to make it a personal conspiracy to mislead. <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> if a given scenario is likely in their <strong>own</strong> domain/experience. Removing the unique customer identifier for privacy reasons was something I did fairly often in one shop, by the way (<a href="BagNeedScenarios.html">BagNeedScenarios</a> scenario 3). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also note that a "forced" temporary artificial key can create the risk that somebody will use it as an (assumed) permanent identifier. -t

        [Labeling my field of experience as unrepresentative is a completely evasive cop-out, and completely untrue. Applications where errors are tolerable in the manipulation of data that's worth storing in a database are certainly in the minority.]
      </p>

        <li>
           I have to disagree with that assessment. But again, in the end we'll have to <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> whether the stated scenarios are likely or not and/or reflective of their own domains or experience.

      <p>
        [I skimmed most of the <a href="BagNeedScenarios.html">BagNeedScenarios</a> page, and others have already critiqued the applicability of the scenarios to your argument. They either describe scenarios at the boundaries of a relation system (and thus don't indicate anything close to a need for discarding relational algebra), or they are the result of inadequate analysis of the domain, or they accommodate mistakes made in legacy or external systems that can be relatively easily fixed or addressed at the system boundaries. No show-stoppers in there at all.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [If removing a customer identifier results in duplicates, replace it with a count and eliminate the duplicates. Even in a report (which is outside the boundaries of the relational system), a count is more informative to a human reader than having to visually identify duplicates, and is obviously more useful to other software. I go so far as to argue against duplicates even in user interfaces and reports in almost every case where someone suggests them, because the plain fact is that <em>something</em> distinguishes duplicates, even for human readers - if nothing else, there's implicit information in a position in a list.]
      </p>
      <p>
        That's already addressed in the write-up. If the contract specifies columns A, B, and C, you don't give them D out of some purity religion. I've been chewed out multiple times for giving extra info that I felt would be useful to the customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        [<strong>Stop ignoring half of what everyone says.</strong> This statement ignores the fact that you can give someone output with duplicates at the boundaries of the system. This adds nothing but bulk.]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Please clarify. It's an extra step to run it through yet another filter. Calling it a "boundary" doesn't change the fact it's an extra step. Boundaries are relative. I'll agree with a warning from the query language or whatever about the results not having a unique key, but it shouldn't prevent me from chopping out columns I don't want. I want to be the "god" over the tool, not the other way around.

        Again, you guys seem detached from typical workings and dealings of the business world, thinking you will be allowed to play Techy-God and/or be given infinite resources to fix all the clunky systems in a typical business network. I used to be kind of like that out of school, wanting everybody to make cleaner data with more validation and more research into hiccups and oddities from other department systems, etc. After a while I learned to hard way to shut up and work within what's given me.

        <li>
           I never called it "right". You are putting words in my mouth and I am offended. It's a matter of working in the environment given to you without becoming an aspergerian whiner. If adding an auto-key helps things on the side I can control, I will add them. Sometimes it doesn't, especially if refreshed data would get all new auto-keys anyhow.

        [1] I'd like to clear up the <strong>Toad</strong> example. Often query-related tools will take the result sets and produce CSV etc. as needed. The SQL just produces the "result set" (a table) and the tool does the rest. It's not meant to promote or assume Toad itself, but rather uses Toad as a stand-in for a <em>typical</em> "query tool" or <a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a>-like tool. Ideally the tool wouldn't care if the result set was generated by a SELECT statement or the proposed EXPORT statement. -t

      <p>
        I'm not sure what you mean. Toad is only an example. Note that most RDBMS have "export" related commands, but they run at the server and are thus usually of little help to the query user on the client side. Sometimes a shared file area is setup on the server, but this is a shop-specific decision.
