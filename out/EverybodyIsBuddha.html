        Everybody Is Buddha
      </h1>
      <p>
        This describes a view in buddism that everybody you meet is a Buddha or has a buddha inside yourself. So at least some people teach you tolerance or can give you something to learn. This view teaches you not to quickly put people into drawers. But this can also mean that you sometimes have to learn to stop some people (that's what they teach you). Children are very good in teaching parents. ;)
