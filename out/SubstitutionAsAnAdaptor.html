        While working on <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> in the development of ArtifactOrientedProgramming, I considered the notion that while ArtifactNaming in the system was such that the names were not interpreted as single LinkingPatterns by this wiki. The use of the underscore as a separator prevented this. So I am trying to use substituted words which will make them fit this Wiki's conventions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus the Artifact: DonaldNoyes_Project_ArtifactOrientedProgramming_ToDo could be made to fit by creating an alias by substitution of words for the underscores:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           DonaldNoyesOnProjectArtifactOrientedProgrammingToDoList
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This can also be reversed to make a <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> Page fit the usage pattern of ArtifactOrientedProgramming by an alias name
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           WardsWiki_ArtifactOrientedProgramming 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Another of the characters useful for separation and distinction in ArtifactNaming are those used for enclosure:  (enclosed item) [enclosed item] {enclosed item} <enclosed item> "enclosed item" 'enclosed item' `enclosed item` (etc)
      </p>
      <p>
        Note the use on the first line of this page of ArtifactNaming of a type Date_Place_Sequence (It is enclosed for illustrative purposes)
        The words suggesting a summary phrase on the line are also enclosed, in this case by formatting option italics.
