      <p>
        Why are you signing your name here? It only makes you a target and gives nitwits a chance to vilify you and autodelete you. If you want to sign, go some place with security. There ain't none here and complaining about it just makes more noise.

        I agree completely, using a name just makes you a target for rebuttals! -- <a href="LayneThomas.html">LayneThomas</a> (IronyOnPurpose)

        On the other hand, nobody cares or believes what an anonymous person says. -- <a href="AnonymousOnPurpose.html">AnonymousOnPurpose</a>

        Nonsense. This page is redundant, the issues were already beaten to death and that's why we have <a href="WikiSignature.html">WikiSignature</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspite the wiki insecurity we still know each other by writing style (or lack thereof) and IP addresses. In particular I am thankful to people who collaborated with me on technical content and signed their name on their contributions, please continue to do it as it greatly helps our interaction. --<a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        True. . . it probably isn't hard to recognize me by my excessive use of trailing periods (and things in parenthesis). . . or my IP address. . . Or when I fix my typos from before. . .
