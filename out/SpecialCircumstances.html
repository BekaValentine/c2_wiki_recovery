        <em>The Culture has very inflexible moral guidelines for the treatment of sentients. When the sentients in question do not share those same high moral values it behoves the Culture to treat them with a certain degree of moral ambiguity. In order that the vast majority of Humans, Drones and Minds not get their fields dirty with such compromises the Culture has a specific section detailed to interaction with outside powers that it dubs Contact. Contact, whilst more morally flexible, has a degree of oversight by the Culture proper - necessary for Contact to carry out its role as ambassadors and diplomats. Contact therefore uses </em><a href="SpecialCircumstances.html">SpecialCircumstances</a> as a combination think tank, intelligence gathering organ and dirty tricks department. <a href="SpecialCircumstances.html">SpecialCircumstances</a> is the most morally ambiguous of the Cultures various appendages - in fact it is hard to tell when a Mind has become Eccentric or is just involved in a particularly odd mission for <a href="SpecialCircumstances.html">SpecialCircumstances</a> - <a href="IainHowe.html">IainHowe</a><em></em>
