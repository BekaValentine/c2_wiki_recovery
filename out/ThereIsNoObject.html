        There Is No Object

        <a href="ThereIsNoStasis.html">ThereIsNoStasis</a> points out that reality is really about processes, not objects. Objects are our concretization of processes in stable states (if I get it right from there).
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus we could say, that <a href="ThereIsNoObject.html">ThereIsNoObject</a> in the sense of <a href="ThereIsNoSpoon.html">ThereIsNoSpoon</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is an object anyway? I'd like to give this definition (not intended to be meant for objects in general, but for the scope of this page, to avoid <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a>):
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>An object is a group of bytes with meaning.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The locations of the bytes of an individual object way vary over time, but identity is not part of the definition (at least for now).
      </p>
      <p>
        The meaning of the bytes is established ultimately by the programmer (with a couple of transformations in between).
      </p>
      <p>
        And if we deliberately ignore the object we start to see lots of bytes and a cpu that operates on them. For the <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> programmer, this is the usual view. For him, objects are just certain structures of bytes that come and go.

        Who are you? If you say you are something, you are attached to form, and I will hit you thirty times with this stick.  If you say you are nothing, you are attached to emptiness, and I will hit you thirty times with this stick.  What can you do?
