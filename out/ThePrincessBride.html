        A really fun movie -- one which "takes the Mickey" on itself as well as the various subjects presented.

        It's uproariously funny, and chock-full of quotable lines. The cast is superb.  Mandy Patinkin was a riot, and this movie <em>created</em> the persona that Cary Elwes has played in EVERY movie he's made since then.
      </p>

        I thank this movie for making it possible to be sitting in a crowded room of programmers listening to some windbag B.S. for way too long on a subject he doesn't really understand and then hear someone quietly say "inconceivable!"  Either they blithely bluster about their way (which makes it even funnier for the rest of us) or it <em>quickly</em> takes the wind out of their sails.

        I watched this film, and just didn't find it very funny. Somewhat funny, but not very. It's clear which bits of it are meant to be funny, so I was able to enjoy it in a theoretical sort of way. But I wasn't rolling around, and have nil incentive to quote any line from it at all. I'm even prepared to don my asbestos pants and say: leave Pythonesque to the Pythons (unless you can do it better than them, which would have to be way, way better than this).

        <em>Alas, you are completely wrong.  There is less room for divergent opinion on this matter than on whether the sky is blue.  Either you must be inconceivably humourless and unpoetic, or I must be too stupid to recognize the irony of your analysis.</em>

        [Uh, oh. I hope we don't make this guy think we're all a bunch of loons just because we find this film funny beyond measurement. And watch out for the R.O.U.S.es(1) !]

        The great thing is that <a href="WilliamGoldman.html">WilliamGoldman</a> actually wrote the screenplay. That's why it's so good. (Actually, the movie might even be better. He tightened up the dialogue in a bunch of places).

        <em>I just wish the screenplay had kept the betrothal scene.  Prince: I said nothing about love.  Buttercup: Then by all means, let us marry.</em>

        One of my daughters and mine favorites. I had run a stunt group which performed at Renaissance Festivals for a few years at that time. When <a href="ThePrincessBride.html">ThePrincessBride</a> came to Kansas City, promoters gave away tickets to the premier at Renfest like water. The result is that the auditorium was packed with 300+ Festers. It's hard to imagine how in-sync with the movie this group was. And when the words "I want my father back, you ....." were uttered.........  -- CHergerThomann

        <em>No! A remake is a terrible idea! Don't let them do it! Nobody could be better than Mandy Patinkin. Or Wallace Shawn. Or, let's face it, the late, great Andre the Giant.</em>

        <em>Perhaps the remake of Johnny Lingo should be taken as a warning.  The original shares almost cult status with The Princess Bride at my university, but the remake was universally deplored.</em>

        If you're ever in need of some quick cheering up, one watch of the <a href="BattleOfWits.html">BattleOfWits</a> scene should take care of the problem. Just remember, never start a land war in Asia.

        A favorite quote when playing Civilization, Risk, or some other such game. <em>You've fallen victim to one of the classic blunders!

        I have to admit that I find it more than a little disturbing (in a <a href="CognitiveDissonance.html">CognitiveDissonance</a> sense) that the same author who wrote the absolutely hideous torture scene in Marathon Man (dental drill and clove oil - <a href="NuffSaid.html">NuffSaid</a>...) could also write this.

        Sitting through a developers' meeting, with the CIO outlining the direction of the next several months, it soon became apparent that the oft-occurring word "refactor" was being used as a synonym for "change". Cue faux Spanish accent...
