        Wiki Vagrant
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="WikiVagrant.html">WikiVagrant</a> is a casual surfer of Wiki sites with no necessary agenda and having an overabundance of discretionary time. This person may be (rightly or wrongly) described as having no life. This is not to be confused with the <a href="WikiNomad.html">WikiNomad</a> who, though having some similarity, has a specific agenda of traveling through sites for the sake of traveling. In other words, the <a href="WikiNomad.html">WikiNomad</a>, chooses to devote his or her abundance of discretionary time by being here now, and enjoying the voyage from Point A to Point B, whether this be on the planet or in Cyberspace. The <a href="WikiNomad.html">WikiNomad</a>, may or may not be searching for anything in particular and is content in enjoying the process of being. Yours truly, Hal
