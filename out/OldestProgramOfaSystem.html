        <strong>Prologue</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been said that the future is the vision at the base of today's technology development. <em>What does this vision look like?</em> As we all experience desires, including the moral desire to <a href="DoTheRightThing.html">DoTheRightThing</a>, and given that our actions (I'm an engineer) change (and sometimes reconstitute) TheWorld, I expect many people are sometimes interested in Hegel's question: <em>"How does a world have to be created to suit a moral being?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea would seem to have a place near the top of the <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a>, because it is an old idea about programming (building a system) which still seems to run through current thinking, such as <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a>, and can shed some light on statements such as <a href="TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign.html">TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign</a> [See Note 1].
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems nutritious because programming often seems to be about building a SystemOfMachinery, without first (in the <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a> sense) building a SystemOfIdeas, such that TheMachineSignifiesTheIdea. This can result in HasteNotSpeed, and is ameliorated by ideas such as <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>.

        SeparateIntentionFromRealisation now presents itself as imperative!

        <strong>The Machine Is Not The Idea</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"I want to show that there is no idea of the state, because the state is something mechanical, just like there is no idea of a machine. Only that which is an object of freedom is called idea. Therefore we also have to transcend the state! For every state must treat free human beings like mechanical cogwheels; and it should not; therefore it has to cease to exist."</em>

        <strong>A Mythology Of Reason</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"First I will here speak of an idea, which, as far as I know, has not occurred to anyone - we must have a new mythology, but this mythology has to serve ideas, it has to become a mythology of reason."</em>
