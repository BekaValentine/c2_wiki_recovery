        Six Line Ant Program
      </h1>
      <p>
        A program that does the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        while <strong>true</strong>:<br/>
        move forward<br/>
        toggle pixel<br/>
        if pixel black, turn left  90 degrees<br/>
        if pixel white, turn right 90 degrees<br/>
        wend<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        has surprisingly complex behaviour: it looks random to the human eye for a long time, and then ... something really cool emerges.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        This generalizes: you can have more possible colours of pixels,
        with turnings specified for each. See, for instance,
        <a href="http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~scott/ants/">http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~scott/ants/</a> and
        <a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/sw/LangtonsAnt/antlinks.html">http://www.tiac.net/users/sw/LangtonsAnt/antlinks.html</a> .

      <p>
        The original 2-state ant is called "Langton's ant", after its inventor
        Chris Langton.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ant is deterministic but chaotic, meaning it has sensitive dependence on initial conditions: there is no way to predict a future state of the grid without explicitly running the simulation. Note that this is different than random. On the other hand, non-chaotic diagonal "highways" reliably emerge from the chaos (although exactly when and where they emerge is still chaotic, not predictable). This is not uncommon for chaotic systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        LangtonsAnt is a kind of <a href="CellularAutomaton.html">CellularAutomaton</a>.
        (<a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: perhaps some of the discussion below about the difference between "random", "chaotic", "deterministic", etc., that applies to all <a href="CellularAutomata.html">CellularAutomata</a>, not just this one, should be moved to the <a href="CellularAutomaton.html">CellularAutomaton</a> page).

      <p>
        Here's a <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> program that implements Langton's ant:
      </p>
      <code>
        turnings = [1,3]<br/>
        while 1:<br/>
        position += displacement<br/>
        screen[position] = (screen[position]+1) % len(turnings)<br/>
        displacement *= 1j**turnings[screen[position]]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Just add more elements to <em>turnings</em> to get the generalized version.
        You also need a suitable class for the screen object, of course. This
        program uses the insight that <a href="ComplexNumbersArePoints.html">ComplexNumbersArePoints</a>.

        <strong>Random? Chaotic?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The early behaviour of the ant was described as appearing "random", which it does, but it isn't technically random.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Chaotic" is not the same as "random", nor is it the same as "unpredictable".
        Consider, for instance, the LogisticEquation <em>x</em> := <em>kx</em>(1-<em>x</em>);
        I believe (but haven't proved) that there are rational values of <em>k</em>
        for which the dynamics for rational <em>x</em> are chaotic. For all that,
        the iterated values can be calculated exactly as far out as you like,
        given only sufficient computer power.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's not the point. It is "unpredictable" in the sense that there is no short cut to predicting it other than running the simulation, unlike other non-random but non-chaotic systems. Physics is a successful science largely because it has been able to predict without simulation. The newer branches of computational physics that depend on simulation are a sharp change.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here, for reference, is the usual definition of chaos for a (continuous)
        dynamical system. A system is chaotic if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It has <em>sensitive dependence on initial conditions</em>: there's some fixed distance such that given any point you can find arbitrarily close points whose iterates get at least that far away from those of the original point.
        </li>
        <li>
           It is <em>topologically transitive</em>: there's some point whose iterates get arbitrarily close to all points.
        </li>
        <li>
           This is ergodicity, and absolutely is not characteristic of chaotic systems in general.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (A third condition ("periodic points are dense") is sometimes added.)
      </p>
      <p>
        For cellular automata like Langton's ant, so far as I know no one has
        ever given a precise definition of "chaotic", though the term gets
        bandied about quite a bit in the literature.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Sure they have. The first condition above works just fine with only a slightly modified interpretation of "sensitive dependence on initial conditions": Two arbitrarily-similar (but not identical) starting states can lead to arbitrarily-distant future states.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Incomprehensible?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It appears that whatever the initial configuration, the ant always ends up with the same sort of behaviour: "building a highway". (Run it and see.) So far as anyone on Wiki knows, there is no known proof that this always happens. Perhaps there <em>is</em> no proof? Perhaps it isn't even really true? It is alleged that <a href="PaulErdos.html">PaulErdos</a> tried to prove it and failed.
      </p>

        Write a program that does the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        while(true) <br/>
        move forward<br/>
        toggle pixel<br/>
        if pixel black, turn left  90 degrees<br/>

        wend<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        For any initial configuration, this program does seemingly random behavior for a long time before something (the <em>same</em> thing regardless of the initial configuration) really cool emerges. It's conjectured to be chaotic, but this hasn't been proven yet. (cf. <a href="ChaosTheory.html">ChaosTheory</a>)

        rotate color<br/>

        Actually, if I recall correctly from a <a href="ScientificAmerican.html">ScientificAmerican</a> article from several years ago, the above algorithm is only one special case of a generalized class of state machine-based matrix traversal algorithms called LangtonsAnt (actually Langton's Ant). I used to have a program lying around that would implement randomly-generated LangtonsAnt machines; I'll have to look around for it.  -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        Python has <a href="ComplexNumbers.html">ComplexNumbers</a> support, and this program assumes <a href="ComplexNumbersArePoints.html">ComplexNumbersArePoints</a>. All it needs is a proper class for the screen object.

        Here is a program that dus that on QBASIC, on a finite grid insted uv infinite (so it dus stuf with the borders!):

      <code>
        SCREEN 2<br/>
        DO WHILE INKEY$ = ""<br/>
        DRAW "a" + STR$(a) + "bu1"<br/>
        x = POINT(POINT(0), POINT(1))<br/>
        PSET STEP(0, 0), 1 - x<br/>
        a = (a + 4 + x + (x = 0)) MOD 4<br/>

        <a href="PaulErdos.html">PaulErdos</a> tried and failed (<em>Mathematics isn't ready for this yet.</em>), but that doesn't mean anything. Langton's ant is merely conjectured to be chaotic, but not proven so. This is meant in a formal way, in the particular formal meanings of <em>conjecture</em> and <em>prove</em>.

        I would like to suggest that in fact "Predicting the outcome by running the simulation" is <em>not</em> a prediction at all -- because it's <em>not</em> actually a "simulation", it's the entire universe of the domain. To predict it, you'd need a statistical measure based on observed characteristics. Kind of a <a href="PermutationCity.html">PermutationCity</a> sort of problem.
