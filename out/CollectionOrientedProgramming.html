      <p>
        Several noticeable subcategories of <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ArrayOrientedLanguage.html">ArrayOrientedLanguage</a>--wherein arrays (or other linear sequences; both 1-dimensional and <em>n</em>-dimensional) are given full <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> treatment; and many operations are done on arrays. The first widespread example language is probably <a href="AplLanguage.html">AplLanguage</a>. It eventually spawned other array-oriented languages.
          <ul>
            <li>
               In languages with <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> (especially fold/foldr/foldl, mapcar, and filter--or whatever they're called), this can often be simulated with minimal <a href="SyntacticSugar.html">SyntacticSugar</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           DatabaseOrientedProgramming--wherein <a href="DataBase.html">DataBase</a>s (in particular <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>s) are given such treatment; and programmers can work in the <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a> or <a href="RelationalCalculus.html">RelationalCalculus</a>. <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> is a semi-relational tool.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> appears to be an example; however not every code using <a href="SqlLanguage.html">SqlLanguage</a> is using TOP.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Many languages have a good set of built-in list operations and list iteration short-cut syntax. This is a mild form of <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a>. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Often times, in a collection-oriented language, the collection (of whatever shape) is <em>superior</em> to the scalar.  (In <a href="AplLanguage.html">AplLanguage</a> and <a href="JayLanguage.html">JayLanguage</a>, a scalar is viewed as a zero-dimensional collection).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, here is some pseudo-code to get the average of column 3 in a 2D array:
      </p>
      <code>
        x = average(myArray, column=3)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If we wanted to get the average from a rectangular section of an array, we may have something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        x = average(myArray, columns=3:8, rows=2:5)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The "traditional" way to do this would resemble:
      </p>
      <code>
        sum = 0<br/>
        count = 0<br/>
        for column = 3 to 8<br/>
        ...for row = 2 to 5 <br/>
        ......sum = sum + myArray[row, column] <br/>
        ......count = count + 1<br/>
        ...end for<br/>
        end for<br/>
        average = sum / count<br/>
      </code>

        (Dots added to prevent <a href="TabMunging.html">TabMunging</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        An optimizer would know that it could take an array-oriented language version and assign different rows or columns to multiple processors to divide up the workload. With the "traditional" approach, the optimizer may have a harder time because it does not know whether the order of the calculation makes a difference or not without complex analysis. Our "average" function knows this by definition.

        Typical features found in <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a> languages or APIs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Aggregation and statistical operations (sum, average, median, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Set-based operations (union, difference, etc. See <a href="SetTheory.html">SetTheory</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Implicit looping (commands often operate on multiple cells, nodes, or records)

        </li>
        <li>
           Operations that work on entire collections as a unit (in addition to doing stuff on individual cells)
        </li>
        <li>
           On the higher end, it may take on characteristics listed under <a href="DatabaseDefinition.html">DatabaseDefinition</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As an example of the difference between treating an array as a single object, and coding or generating loop logic, consider the <a href="AplLanguage.html">AplLanguage</a> statement
      </p>
      <code>
        A <- A + A[2,3]  <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In <a href="PliLanguage.html">PliLanguage</a>, the equivalent statement would be executed one element at a time, with the rightmost dimension cycling the most rapidly. So the sequence will be A[1,1], A[1,2], ..., A[1,n], A[2,1], A[2,2], ..., and so on. When these additions hit A[2,3], all "later" elements (those following A[2,3]) will have the new (doubled) value added to them, rather than the original one. APL broke new ground (and simplified things considerably) by treating arrays as single objects. -- <a href="PaulMorrison.html">PaulMorrison</a>

               Whether or not <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> is <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> depends on what code is allowed to be dispatched by the tables.

                   No, that would make whatever language was in there <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>.

               I just mean that, e.g., <a href="SqlLanguage.html">SqlLanguage</a> is not <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a> all by itself. There are any number of simple ways to change that. Perhaps the simplest is to just put SQL statements inside an <a href="InfiniteLoop.html">InfiniteLoop</a> in an embedding language; it's not hard at all to simulate a <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>, or indeed even a regular CPU, by such means.

               <em>It is an open question about whether it would be prudent to make SQL </em><a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>. It is almost like suggesting that <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s be made TC.<em></em>

        </li>

           More similarly to what you said, if you add an extension to execute code retrieved via queries, that is potentially <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a> as well, even if the retrieved code is still just SQL.

        Aficionados of languages like <a href="JayLanguage.html">JayLanguage</a>, <a href="KayLanguage.html">KayLanguage</a> and <a href="AplLanguage.html">AplLanguage</a> prefer to think of them as array-based or <a href="VectorProcessing.html">VectorProcessing</a> languages.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Yes, they do. And vectors and arrays are types of collections. So?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        -----<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Well for a start is this a new concept or a novel and relatively unknown name for an old concept? Also arrays and vectors are homogeneous do you claim that   <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a> is a generalization of this concept to cells of arbitrary complexity? What does it mean to process implicitly over a tree of trees of type < real , int, string>?  How do you handle the case of <int, real, string> ,< real,int, string> < null, null,real> for example?  Do you intend to constrain  the collection types at all. 
        If so how, if not how do you plan to define correct semantics? Vectors and Arrays  answer to the linear algebra -- do you or anyone else have a programing model in mind. 
        I have no issue with implicit looping and lang based on them. Awk is a good thing. And APL does a very good job at being APL. I like functional languages as well, But I do not see how this can be generalized to the extent this comment  seems to imply.   -ANNON

      <p>
        And the comments above seem terribly confused about TuringEquivalence. If a language is only <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a> when you add <em>another</em> <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a> language on top then, it's not really <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Obviously. As I said in the first place.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So Perl 5 <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s aren't <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a> just because you can plug in arbitrary bits of <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> code into them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           By themselves, no, of course not. But clearly when you include the arbitrary Perl, the combination is.
        </li>
        <li>
           I don't think there's a need for your attempted critique if you re-read the original comments a little slower and assume good faith.
        </li>
        <li>
           As a side issue that has not directly been discussed on this page, but has been on other pages, there is some disagreement as to whether something needs to be <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a> to be considered a "paradigm" (I'm in the camp that says it need not be, FWIW).

        You don't need a special language or significant pre-built library to do <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a>.  By simply employing collection-oriented thinking, I've improved the expressive power, compactness, and maintainability of my code significantly, and that's just using what I can easily do in <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>.  The big part of the trick is to just stop worrying about optimal processing of loops or doing more than one thing inside a single loop until there's a measurable performance issue that would be addressed (and there usually isn't).  Pretend it's a <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> paradigm, and just don't worry about the fact that evaluation is not lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:  I want a comma-delimited list of the values from a field in a DAO recordset.  The obvious thing to do is loop through the records until EOF is reached, and within that loop, concatenate the field's value to a string, inserting a delimiter.  Thinking collection-oriented, though, I write a function to get values from a column of a recordset as a VBA.Collection, then a function to return a delimited list from a collection's items.  Now, with 2 lines of code, I can get my delimited list by calling these 2 very reusable functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example: In <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a>, I want a comma-delimited list of the names of fields bound to any controls on a form that follow a particular control naming pattern.  I write one function to get a filtered subset of a collection of controls (or any other class that has a Properties collection) based on one of its properties matching a text pattern.  I write another function to get a collection of values of a named property from the objects in a collection.  As in the example above, another function gets a delimited string from a collection's items.  Now, we can get the controls with Name properties matching my pattern, get a collection of the ControlSource property values from those items, then get a comma delimited list of those values.  That's 3 lines of code to get my comma-delimited list of field names that can be used in, say, a SQL INSERT statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make this more <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> (still in <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> without inheritance), I could create a wrapper class for a collection, and employ methods of the wrapper instead of passing collections to functions.  I just haven't gotten around to that yet.

        <em>I've done similar stuff in webby scripty languages, but I feel that a table would be better than lists of lists. For example, often one wants to use the same field list, but with a few modifications for stuff not used in another set, and extra info such as type (string, number, date) to know if to reformat for dates or put quotes around strings.  And maximum allowed length is needed for validation. And a title for report columns or error messages is often needed. Without a table, this results in 3 to 6 different lists or maps.

        Anybody know much about the <a href="LuaLanguage.html">LuaLanguage</a>? Is it table-oriented or array-oriented, or a little of both?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Lua doesn't seem to be table- or array-oriented, as far as I can tell.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Lua tables are associative arrays (like Python dicts or <a href="AwkLanguage.html">AwkLanguage</a>'s arrays, and you can nest them), but with an optimization for the common case of tables indexed by consecutive integers: a table with cells indexed at 1, 2, ... N is actually implemented as an array, and has O(1) access. Each table has an array part and a key/value part. In practice, Lua tables are sufficiently expressive to implement almost all other collection ADTs (particularly when combined with metatables), though there is a bit more overhead than using struct pointers or ML-style variant types. Lua is not bulk vector-oriented in the same sense as (say) <a href="KayLanguage.html">KayLanguage</a>, though. --<a href="ScottVokes.html">ScottVokes</a>
