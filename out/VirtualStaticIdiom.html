        Virtual Static Idiom
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Virtual Static Idiom is a very simple technique used in C++ to make static methods virtual. This way, static methods can be overridden by subclasses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, it just binds a static (class) method to an instance by explicitly passing the this pointer. This is more powerful than allowing polymorphic static methods because it makes the static method really a part of an instance. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Note how because the static method is part of the class Foo, it has access to all parts of Foo.
      </p>
      <p>
        The example below is particularly useful when you have to pass a callback function into a system call, typical practice in Windows. You get one thunk that takes one void * as its parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can also be useful to explicitly type the incoming this pointer to a Foo *.
      </p>
      <code>
        class Foo<br/>
        {<br/>
        public:<br/>
        Foo();<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        protected:<br/>
        // Virtual static idiom <-- StaticCallback()<br/>
        virtual bool Callback();<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        private:<br/>
        // Virtual static idiom --> Callback()<br/>
        static bool StaticCallback( void *pThis )<br/>
        {<br/>
        assert( pThis );<br/>
        return ((Foo *)pThis)->Callback();<br/>
        }<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Popular uses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           To get a newly created thread to run a method of an object.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After meditating on this pattern for about 20 minutes, I just cannot see how this can be useful, in any way, at all.  Can a real-world example of its utility be demonstrated, perhaps written in <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a> style?  --SamuelFalvo

        You may wish to meditate a bit more upon: <em>"when you have to pass a callback function into a system call, typical practice in Windows"</em>.  Standard 'C'-style callbacks are done with (void(*)(void*)).  Essentially this is acting as a wrapper for a C callback.  This follows the principle: every problem in programming can be solved by an extra layer of indirection... except for the problem of too much indirection.  In a language designed for <a href="EventDrivenProgramming.html">EventDrivenProgramming</a> and providing real 'thunks' this wouldn't be an issue.  And it is subject to all sorts of problems in C/C++, such as figuring out when it is appropriate to delete the 'Foo' after using it in this manner.

        I think this is not a pattern but an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, and the solution is the <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>
