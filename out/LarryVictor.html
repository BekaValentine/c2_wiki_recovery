        A new explorer into this system. Not a programmer, but have been using computers since the early 80s, starting with an Apple II and the first IBM. I am interested in this system as a tool for collaborative composition in hypertext.

        I am a little frustrated by the spellchecker.  I like to "coin" new words, but this system, flags me to not use words not in the existing vocabulary - even in text such as this, as well as for links.  I can't even refer to <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to use the term "cyweb" - but it was flagged.

        You can consider the spellchecker nothing more than an ignoramus with a big dictionary who makes suggestions.  (That's what it is, of course.)  Your judgement can always override the spellchecker.  --<a href="BenKovitz.html">BenKovitz</a> (who prefers the 'e' after the 'g' in 'judgement')

        Thanks Ben, and the other commentor. Such quick response! So quick that I have been unable to edit "my own" page, as the above edits came in after me and I was attempting to edit a prior version.  How do people get alerted to a new entry so quickly?  Do some people watch the recent edits and jump in with help? <em>My visits to Wiki always begin with </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. --bk<em></em>

        Does this mean I can ignore the messages from the <a href="SpellingChecker.html">SpellingChecker</a>?  It says that the add to dictionary is not now functional. -<a href="LarryVictor.html">LarryVictor</a>

        Treat the words listed as advice only. If you want the best presentation, cut and paste your text from a word-processor where you can spell-check and syntax-check it properly. See <a href="StartingPoints.html">StartingPoints</a> for links you might like as bookmarks. -- vk

        Relying on spellcheckers can cause many typos to remain.  Another option is to pretend the spellchecker doesn't exist and reread what you just wrote. -- OneOfThoseSpellingBeeWinnersYouAlwaysHated

        These two words were once merely friends, content to live alongside each other separated by a space.  Recently they have become fond of each other and share a beautiful little hyphen as a sign of their mutual esteem.  While they have not yet joined together in matrimony, they do seem to be coming together more and more often.  I'm sure they blush a little when they are caught together without their hyphen.
