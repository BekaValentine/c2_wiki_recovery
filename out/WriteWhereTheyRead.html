        <a href="WriteWhereTheyRead.html">WriteWhereTheyRead</a> is a technique taken from <a href="TipsFromWardCunningham.html">TipsFromWardCunningham</a> to facilitate communication on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.

        I suggest persons who adopt this approach cleanup (or better, improve) the page where they have started this kind of dialog.

        <em>If you're still talking about the dialogs people have held on your homepages, don't forget that that's a little bit of a special case, and there typically isn't any harm in your just deleting any such clutter on your homepages.</em>

           you have not discovered my tactic of moving house, once it get cluttered by other <a href="IpUsername.html">IpUsername</a>s. I do not often read my homepage and did you see clutter? I missed them dearly :( :)
