        Thelop Word Class
      </h1>
      <p>
        Any word from the <a href="ThelopLanguage.html">ThelopLanguage</a> works in one or more <a href="ThelopWordClass.html">ThelopWordClass</a>es. Currently, there are four words classes: <strong>Objects</strong>, <strong>Actions</strong>, <strong>Properties</strong> and <strong>Modifiers</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Objects (O)</strong> are the main building blocks of the <a href="ThelopLanguage.html">ThelopLanguage</a>. Examples are "File", "Text", "Window" or "Rect". Any <a href="ThelopName.html">ThelopName</a> must start with an object word (e.g. FileOpen or WindowSetTitel). Usually, English nouns are used as object words, sometimes in an abbreviated form (e.g. "Rect" instead of "Rectangle"). It is common that objects are parts (properties) of other objects, so many object words work also as properties (e.g. WindowGetRect). Sometimes, they even work as modifiers (e.g. "File" in "TextFileOpen").
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Actions (A)</strong> tell us about the operations that are performed on the objects. Examples are: "Create", "Clear", "Cpy" or "Get". Any THELOP function name must contain at least one action words (e.g. WindowOpenTitleRect or RectGetWidthHeight). Usually, English verbs are used as action words. Action words never work in other <a href="ThelopWordClass.html">ThelopWordClass</a>es.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Properties (P)</strong> are considered parts of objects. Examples are: "Color", "Width" or "Size". They are accessed by the special words "Get, "Set" or "Ret" (e.g. FileRetSize, WindowGetClientRect or RectGetWidthHeight). Properties sometimes work as modifiers (e.g. "Width" in WindowGetBorderWidth) but only rarely as objects (e.g. "Color" in ColorSetSaturation).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Modifiers (M)</strong> change the meaning of words or names. They are perhaps the most interesting words in the <a href="ThelopLanguage.html">ThelopLanguage</a>. They may change the meaning of actions (e.g. "Last" in StrFindChrLast), they may eliminate the need for an explicit object reference (e.g. compare WindowClose(w) and WindowCloseAll()) or indicate the data type or unit used (e.g. StrRetDouble or RectSetWidthInch). There are even global modifiers that influence the meaning of the function as a whole. A modifier is always appended to the object, property or name it influences (e.g. "Cm" in CarRetHeightCm() and not CarRetCmHeight()).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        THELOP function names are built from <a href="ThelopWord.html">ThelopWord</a>s according to <a href="ThelopNamePattern.html">ThelopNamePattern</a>s. These patterns are written using the single character abbreviations of the <a href="ThelopWordClass.html">ThelopWordClass</a>es (e.g. the pattern "OAO" correspond to FileCpyString(filename,string), image=ImageCreateFile(filename) or PrinterDrawImage(x,y,image)).
