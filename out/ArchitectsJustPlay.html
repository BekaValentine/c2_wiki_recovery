        Outsiders often think <a href="ArchitectsJustPlay.html">ArchitectsJustPlay</a>. This is similar to a programmer in my team who remarked "the higher level managers seem to have lots of time to dabble around."

        And the worse thing is not that <a href="ArchitectsDontCreateArchitectures.html">ArchitectsDontCreateArchitectures</a>, it is this <a href="ArchitectReviewsEverything.html">ArchitectReviewsEverything</a> bit.

        <strong>Playing with ideas</strong> is very important if you do Town Planning. Particularly more so if you have a slum intermingled with modern architectures. The slums, and the HumanSewage that inhabits it are an eyesore. There are constant demands for demolition, particularly from the Tourist Industry. Unfortunately, not every more city has visits by TheTsunamiKatrina style. Only New Orleans offers Town Planning people to redraw landscapes.

           People often forget the slums provide alternatives to the <a href="OffShoreIncomeHeatSink.html">OffShoreIncomeHeatSink</a> for people needing all the cheap services they get locally. That is another story.
