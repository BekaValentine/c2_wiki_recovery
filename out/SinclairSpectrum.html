        Sinclair Spectrum
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Sinclair ZX Spectrum is a Z80-based home computer from the early 80s, produced by Sir Clive Sinclair. The most recognizable feature was the 'rubber' keyboard.

        The original machine came in 16k and 48k memory varieties - both having 16k of ROM sitting in the bottom area of the total 64k addressable by the Z80 processor. The ROM contained a BASIC variant which the machine would load on reset. Sinclair BASIC was notable for the fact that all keywords were tokenized. For example, you would just type
      </p>
      <code>
        P<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        to get 
      </p>
      <code>
        PRINT<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        rather than the entire sequence. Helpfully, the key combinations for the tokens were printed on the keyboard.
