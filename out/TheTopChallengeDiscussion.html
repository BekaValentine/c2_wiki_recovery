        Someone asked: <em>Is reduced code the main selling point of OO?</em> I don't know. I've never really thought of it, to tell you the truth. What I do know is the topic has been discussed here and on Usenet exhaustively. Therefore, I feel doing some kind of size metric would add value. I'm also thinking of tracking my time on this page, or a related page, so that we have another dimension to compare and contrast. -- <a href="JeffPanici.html">JeffPanici</a>

        This challenge is good, one key point is one point 1:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> selects a business domain: banking, insurance, trading, transport, manufacturing, etc. <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        IMO, this is one key to all the wasted time and endless debate.  <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> insisted on talking about "custom biz apps", but even after debating with him for weeks, I failed to see that <strong>there is no custom biz apps!</strong>  Any business application has a domain and a purpose, you can have payroll system, inventory system, reservation system, CRM system, etc.  Whenever anyone use any concrete system as example of OOP, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> can simply say that is an XXX system and not really a "custom biz app".  Trying to pinpoint what is a "custom biz app" is just chasing unicorns.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see the some problem with the <a href="CampusExample.html">CampusExample</a>, namely, <strong>it has no concrete requirements other than data storage</strong>!  There is no workflow for enrollment, no student grade entry and dissemination requirement, no grade summary reporting and mailing, nothing except storing stuff!  Of course a data centric approach is good for a data storage problem!
      </p>
      <p>
        If <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> decides to face this challenge, let him pick a concrete domain with concrete requirements.

        <em>I'm inclined to agree with you.  However, as I stated above in point 8, I don't want to get into a protracted discussion w.r.t. requirements.  I'd never get anything built.  Rather, I'd like him to point me in a general direction -- an enrollment system is fine, if this is what he wishes -- and I'll take it from there. After I put up my efforts I would, of course, love community feedback and I'm not against refactoring to get things even better.  I will have to track such refactorings, however, to get fair metrics throughout the process.  One of the key things, to me, is that we </em>get to the code<em>.

        <strong>Scope Borders</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are features that perhaps we should explicitly omit in the first round. Suggestions include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Security - Logins and "levels" of access
        </li>
        <li>
           Workflow - Review and approval process
        </li>
        <li>
           Enrollment, or just grade tracking?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These can perhaps be added later. The way in which they are added might be telling in itself.

      <p>
        <em>Agreed.</em>

      <p>
        I'm still waiting to see some requirement for behavior here.  If this is just CRUD screens for the schema on <a href="CampusExample.html">CampusExample</a>, that can be auto generated by a blind monkey.  Until there are some requirements for behavior, you have nothing to do that can further the TopMindChallenge since this is the crux of the disagreement, behavior.  If all you have is CRUD requirements, OO doesn't have much to offer and actually looks more complex than procedural solutions.  It's only when complex behavioral requirements come into play that OO becomes simpler than procedural solutions.

        <em>Quite true; however, instead of eliciting requirements from this forum, I've found an on-site customer that's a domain expert in school enrollment systems.  I'm having him guide me in the modeling of the problem domain.  Our efforts to this point show there is some interesting functionality present in this domain.  However, comparing it to, say, insurance or trading, it's quite simple.  I believe there will be value in the outcome, regardless of the domain.  Finally, I didn't set out to </em>find<em> an example that would prove the value of OOP.  The finished product will have to speak for itself. -- </em><a href="JeffPanici.html">JeffPanici</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure there's plenty of interesting behavior in the domain, but the <a href="TheTopChallenge.html">TheTopChallenge</a> is to prove the value of OOP to <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>.  That's the whole point of the page, so if the finished product can't show the value of OOP, then it isn't accomplishing it's number one goal.  And if you don't get some buy in from Top on the requirements, then he'll just deny their need when the time comes to review the application.  He'll say those change metrics aren't typical, or he'll disagree with the changes.  If the goal is challengeing Top to get OO, then you've got to get him to at least agree on the behavior of the sample system.  I think you even need to get him to agree to do a version of the code himself in his style so there's something to compare to.  If you have nothing to compare the OO code too, then he can resume trolling by simply disagreeing with your sample and denying it's value.  He's done it many many times before, and he'll likely do it again.  So, are you doing this for your own fun, or are you doing this for the <a href="TheTopChallenge.html">TheTopChallenge</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You've misunderstood the goal.  All I have set out to accomplish is the implementation of a business problem domain, that </em><a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> himself has selected, using a popular OOP language and Matisse.  What these efforts prove or disprove is up to each individual examining them.  My efforts will be Open Sourced when complete and, perhaps, others can make use of this as a canonical OOP implementation of a business problem domain.  -- <a href="JeffPanici.html">JeffPanici</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, if that's your goal.  Best of luck to you, I'll keep my eyes on this to see if it goes anywhere.

        Well then, we are already done, as the demonstration of benefits has already been accepted to a greater or lesser degree by the greater part of the software development community.

        Re: <em>Until there are some requirements for behavior, you have nothing to do that can further the </em>TopMindChallenge? since this is the crux of the disagreement, behavior.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How about you propose a behavior-centric portion of the example. Remember, I tend to treat behavior as fairly isolated tasks or subsystems that feed off of the DB. Thus, I can show implementation of a specific behavior without having to define a bunch of other stuff (besides the DB schema). I see this behavioral isolation is a selling point of TOP, by the way. A new developer does not have to understand a bajillion classes, only the schema and maybe a few standard library subroutine signatures. OO is a <a href="BigSoupOfClasses.html">BigSoupOfClasses</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, most complex biz domain behaivor will likely end up involving some kind of taxonomy or classification system. I feel that TOP will shine here also because hardwiring a big complex graph of classes into code is not going to beat a DB-based classification system with regard to dynamicness, searchability, and reportability. If users can't know the classifications because it is hidden in hard-wired classes, then it is of no use to anybody unless the "programmers" want to be taxonomy maintainers, which is poor division-of-labor in my book. Programmers should not be taxonomists, other than initial setup.

        Re: <em>And if you don't get some buy in from Top on the requirements, then he'll just deny their need when the time comes to review the application. He'll say those change metrics aren't typical, or he'll disagree with the changes.</em>

        If I am outvoted on feature or change need, I will accept it. If I have reason to protest, such as suspecting paradigm-favoring rigging, then just put a footnote on that requirement. I will propose changes of my own choosing also. I fully expect differences in <a href="PerceptionOfChange.html">PerceptionOfChange</a>. OO proponents definitely "see" more trees and subtyping in the real world than I do. I see sets. I feel they are deceived by pro-tree/type propoganda, but in the end we will let the reader decide. If the reader of the example agrees with a tree/type view of the world, then so be it as long as they have acces to counter-arguments. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is quite possible that the reader has been bamboozled by the tree/type view of the world also. This is why OO gets a lot of lip service. It is a catchy lie. In the end there is a good chance that which is judged "better" will depend on how people view change patterns. But at least we would know what the differences are and have an example to explore it.
      </p>

        Re: <em>If you have nothing to compare the OO code too, then he can resume trolling by simply disagreeing with your sample and denying it's value.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, the final judge is the reader of the examples. If I have no counter example, then it would be hard for me to make a case. It is meant to be a <strong>public demonstration of OO's alleged power</strong> in the biz domain (or something close). Convincing me is secondary.
