        <em>Microsoft's Techniques for Developing Bug-Free C Programs</em> A short book then? <em>No - there's a different technique for each bug</em>

        Don't let the subtitle put you off. There's a great deal of good advice given here, mostly practical, some less so. It makes you wonder how many of the techniques are actually practiced at <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>. It probably should also be added that most techniques for writing good code require good programmers.

        Not to be confused with <a href="SteveMcConnell.html">SteveMcConnell</a>, author of <a href="CodeComplete.html">CodeComplete</a> and another former Microsoft developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few examples of the advice are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Enable all the diagnostics of your development tools -- <em>I totally agree with this one.  When I do C, I always use -Wall -ansi -pedantic, and I make sure to actually *fix* the stuff it warns me about.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Use debugging aids like assert()
        </li>
        <li>
           Write error detection into wrappers for your subsystems
        </li>
        <li>
           Step through your code in a symbolic debugger, watching the data flow
        </li>
        <li>
           Design functions that are hard to misuse
        </li>
        <li>
           Design subsystems for testability
        </li>
        <li>
           Know the common pitfalls of your language and resist the urge to write "clever" code
        </li>
        <li>
           Have the right attitude: don't think of a bug as something that "just happens".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some of the advice in this book is dated (for example, his admonishment against "cleaning up code" was written before disciplined refactoring became well known), and much is C-specific.  Some of the ideas can be applied to more modern environments, but it would be nice to see a more updated version.

        All new hires at <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> are given both <a href="WritingSolidCode.html">WritingSolidCode</a> and <a href="CodeComplete.html">CodeComplete</a> so that they get deep into <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> coding culture fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I do not understand about <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> is how they totally obviate <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. They prefer to have a human tester verify everything you write. That's the opposite of <a href="RapidFeedback.html">RapidFeedback</a>, no matter how fast the tester is.
