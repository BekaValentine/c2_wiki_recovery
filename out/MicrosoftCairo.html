        Microsoft Cairo
      </h1>
      <p>
        A project, or set of projects, at <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a>, with varying scope at varying times; never shipped.  At various times, Cairo has been billed as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A "next-generation" version of Windows.  When Cairo was being hyped in the mid-90s, many assumed that NT 4.0 would be Cairo.  When NT 4.0 shipped and it amounted to little more than the <a href="WindowsNinetyFive.html">WindowsNinetyFive</a> UI on top of the NT 3.5 core, people started speculating that NT 5.0 would be Cairo.  NT 5 shipped, though renamed <a href="WindowsTwoThousand.html">WindowsTwoThousand</a>, and that <em>still</em> wasn't Cairo.  Nor was <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a>, <a href="WindowsTwoThousandAndThree.html">WindowsTwoThousandAndThree</a>.  Maybe <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a>?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A long-running "technology development" project, which prototypes and develops new technologies that are subsequently incorporated into products, but which is never shipped itself.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An attempt by <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> to develop an object based file system. (note that it was long-rumored that <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a> will have similar technology, though as of late 2004 it's been dropped from there as well; see 
          <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
