        Wiki Doesnt Need Security
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's funny how people think lack of security on Wiki is a bug and then erase pages to make a point.  Essentially its the same as bursting into someones house with a gun, shooting the place up, and then remarking "see what can happen if you leave the front door unlocked."  "yah, some LOONEY might come in and shoot the place up!!!"

        [No, its like fixing windows broken by vandals, and painting over their graffiti, and then making remarks about how their vandalism is a problem]

However I cannot help wondering whether we have people with <a href="ObsessiveCompulsiveDisorder.html">ObsessiveCompulsiveDisorder</a>, or other abnormal behavior around who repeatedly defaced pages, knowing these changes will be reversed.

        Unfortunately there is a cost to their behaviour beyond the time it takes to detect and repair pages. The last change date (indicator of refactoring activity) gets distorted and there is a <a href="DenialOfService.html">DenialOfService</a> to people interested in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> -- dl
