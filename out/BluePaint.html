        Blue Paint

      <p>
        A <a href="BluePaint.html">BluePaint</a> algorithm is one that marks off each record as it processes it. In most cases, a cleanup routine removes the <a href="BluePaint.html">BluePaint</a> afterwords. This is a good case for using try/finally.

        I usually note which records have been processed in a separate list.  This requires no modification to the visited nodes, allows multiple concurrent visitors (assuming they coordinate otherwise on changes), and eliminates the need for a cleanup routine.  Is such an approach an alternative way to implement <a href="BluePaint.html">BluePaint</a> or is it a different algorithm altogether? -- <a href="CraigPutnam.html">CraigPutnam</a>

           <a href="BluePaint.html">BluePaint</a> is not thread safe. That is the alternate algorithm for when thread safety is required. Consider that <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a>s cannot use that mechanism.

          [I'm guessing that it is a metaphor based on the bluing used in metalworking.  That bluing is used to make designs, or can be applied and then designs are etched into it, etc.]
        </li>
        <li>
          Considering the age of <a href="BluePaint.html">BluePaint</a> as an algorithm description (1960's at least) that sounds like a good guess.
