        Dont Name Pages Thoughts Issues Ideas Or Opinions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Try not to use the words "Thoughts", "Issues", "Ideas", or "Opinions" in the name of a Wiki page. Such words are almost always redundant. Are there really pages on this Wiki where ideas are off-topic?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two notable exceptions, however:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When you're engaging in meta-discussion, it's often useful to use one of these words in the title. (This page uses all four.)
        </li>
        <li>
           The use of a Discussion page, when people would choose to leave the original page alone for various reasons. (Usually to keep the first page clear, for aesthetic reasons, or to help newbies.)
        </li>
      </ul>
