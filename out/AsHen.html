        As Hen
      </h1>
      <p>
        Greetings from Ashen. (here referred to as <a href="AsHen.html">AsHen</a> due to <a href="WikiCase.html">WikiCase</a> requirements / <a href="CapitalizationRules.html">CapitalizationRules</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an 18 year old philosophy student about to go to a academic university in the UK, however I also have a strong interest in computing, in particular software programming, that I sustain as a hobby. I program mostly in <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, and plan to run a service of paid for shell accounts soon. I use the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> Linux operating system, (SuSE of <a href="http://www.suse.de)">http://www.suse.de)</a> and I also write poetry.
      </p>
      <p>
        For an explanation as to why I use the name 'Ashen' and not my 'legal name' as would conform to the <a href="WikiSocialNorms.html">WikiSocialNorms</a>, please see my entry on the <a href="RealNamesPleaseDiscussion.html">RealNamesPleaseDiscussion</a>. 'Ashen' is NOT a <a href="NickName.html">NickName</a>, it is in fact my real name, however not my legal real name.
      </p>

        I am at present only new on Wiki, however I join in the spirit with gusto, enjoying watching the collective trust and shared attempts of the community to increase the <a href="SignalToNoise.html">SignalToNoise</a> ratio of Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some pages I very much enjoy for no apparent reason, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="LordOfTheFlies.html">LordOfTheFlies</a> - amusing
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a> - interesting, as I also enjoy reading about Taoist philosophy :-)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Might I suggest </em>AshenWolf instead?  It indicates the name of a person instead of a nickname or a page talking about some aesopian fable about hens.<em></em>
