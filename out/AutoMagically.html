        Auto Magically

      <p>
        Like automatically, except that it doesn't have to be set up, never fails, and generally works well.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it often does these things in some odd, often obscure way that isn't necessarily apparent the first time.

        Usage of '<a href="AutoMagically.html">AutoMagically</a>' indicates that the person does not, in fact, know how it works...

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>That's simply not true. I use it when I do know how things work, but also know that the people to whom I'm speaking really don't care, and don't want to be told.</em>

        <a href="AutoMagical.html">AutoMagical</a> systems tend to <a href="AutoMagically.html">AutoMagically</a> fail too.

           <em>You got that right.</em>

      <p>
        This conflation (auto and magical) is irritatingly overused on the web. See [[AOL Leetspeak]]

        We have forgotten how things usually work. They work auto-magically. Else what all can you plan in this world. Our management gurus would never leave anything to chance.
