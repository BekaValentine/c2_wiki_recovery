        London Town
      </h1>
      <p>
        A hokey way of referring to London but also the most obvious <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> for it. Note that this nomenclature is never, <em>ever</em> used in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- Except, well, we use that nomenclature every day here in London, and always have. Nice try though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Only about six or seven years after writing the above I've realised that the most obvious </em><a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> would actually be "LondonEngland". Oh well.<em></em>

        London is the capital city of England and of the <a href="UnitedKingdom.html">UnitedKingdom</a>, and home to a population of about 7.5 million. The wider metropolitan area has an approximate population of 12 million people (out of 60 million in the entire country). It's the former capital of the BritishEmpire, and thus the former <a href="CapitalOfTheWorld.html">CapitalOfTheWorld</a>. Of course, non-Londoners believe that native Londoners still believe it <em>is</em> the <a href="CapitalOfTheWorld.html">CapitalOfTheWorld</a>; this is the <a href="LondonCulturalAssumption.html">LondonCulturalAssumption</a>.

        Referred to as LondonVillage by popular (Mancunian) radio DJs Mark and Lard, and their adherents, as a reaction to <a href="LondonCulturalAssumption.html">LondonCulturalAssumption</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CityOfLondon.html">CityOfLondon</a> is, of course, not the same. It is the original London approximately defined by the Roman WallOfLondon. This contains the TowerOfLondon and nearby is TowerBridge over the RiverThames. TowerBridge is often confused with LondonBridge, which does not have towers. Near to TowerBridge is HmsBelfast.

        On the other hand, home to an astonishingly large number of good Indian restaurants. Also home to a huge number of museums featuring very obscure but fascinating things (for instance, the Worshipful Guild of Clockmakers - which has a phenomenal display of rare and historically significant clocks and watches and not one but TWO museums entirely devoted to tea.) Also home to one of the best public transportation systems in the world (and you have to travel the rest of the world to appreciate this).

        Maybe so. Maybe not. When I was working in Manhattan a number of locals favourably compared the London Underground to the New York subway. I couldn't imagine what they were talking about, as I found the Subway throughout Manhattan and the Bronx much faster, cleaner more convenient and reliable than the Tube anywhere. And I'd much rather travel on a tram in almost any major European city that has them (maybe not Brussels) than a London Transport bus. Let's compare like with like: do the majority of large, rich, "western" cities have much worse public transport than London? Los Angeles is probably one, from what's said, but which others?

        Nice place. I've been working on and off there for the past few months. What really strikes me is how different the people are there. Differences between British and American culture are endlessly fascinating to me. <em>(See also the </em><a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>, <a href="BritishCulturalAssumption.html">BritishCulturalAssumption</a>, <a href="LondonCulturalAssumption.html">LondonCulturalAssumption</a>.)<em></em>

        <a href="LondonTown.html">LondonTown</a> is an archaic expression - it immediately conjures up in the mind images of bad Victorian melodrama (and for me an early Judas Priest song about Jack the Ripper which I suspect SpinalTap had previously rejected as too embarrassingly stupid.). <a href="LondonTown.html">LondonTown</a> was also mentioned in the ridiculously cool Dire Straights song, Sultans of Swing and is no doubt a hang over from the many towns that were consumed by London as is sprawled into the home counties (Canning Town, Acton Town, Camden Town to name but a few).

        Doesn't so much inspire Spinal Tap as Dire Straits, actually.
