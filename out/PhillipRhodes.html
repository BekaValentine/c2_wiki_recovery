        <em>Hi, Phillip. Did you attend </em><a href="TriangleXpMeetingOne.html">TriangleXpMeetingOne</a>, Monday October 28th, 2002?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yep, sure did.  That was the only meeting I've made it to so far though.

        <em>Okay. That explains your sudden appearance on the </em><a href="TriangleXpMeetingOne.html">TriangleXpMeetingOne</a> page a couple years after the fact. :-) -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a><em></em>

        Yeah, I had kinda forgotten about it, and just happened to stumble across the wiki entry, and thought I might as
        well add myself, even though it has been a couple of years.  I need to start attending the meetings again,
        if I can ever find time. -- Phil
