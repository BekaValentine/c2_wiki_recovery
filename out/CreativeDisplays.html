        This is not a new concept and how one might configure and display an Artifact, perhaps as a <a href="DocumentRepresentative.html">DocumentRepresentative</a>, and to use the Displayed Point as a NavigateToLocale MouseClick operation.

        The point will most probably be displayed in 2D, whereas accommodations may be made in representing in 2D the multiple dimensional characteristic of the Artifact or its Representative. Relationships between Artifacts (including links and associations, but not limiting the Relationships to linear point to point connection representations (such a straight or curved line) like DisplayingArtifactsAsLines.)

        What brought this to mind is my present Desktop Background Image, which is a point and line representation of the Internet, in various colors.
