        ... more properly, Purdue University Computing Center or PUCC.

        PUCC collected IBM 7094s which most companies were
        glad to give away.  JohnSteele kept them running and 
        made them into terminal concentrators.  The 7090 series
        had a great big SwitchRegister that looked like
        a piano keyboard.  It even had an electric motor to 
        reset the switches after each operation.

        PUCC started running CDC6000 equipment in the late 60s.
        By the mid 70s they had several of these which VicAbell
        had bridged together with a system he called <a href="DualMace.html">DualMace</a>.
        <a href="GeorgeGoble.html">GeorgeGoble</a> did the same thing for the 
        EngineeringComputerNetwork by slapping a couple VAX780s
        together to make a <a href="DualProcessorVax.html">DualProcessorVax</a>.
        <a href="BillCroft.html">BillCroft</a> wrote some good networking software for PUCC.
        Later, he wrote great networking software for George's
        engineering network.  It must have been JohnSteele that 
        suggested Bill monitor his link protocol with a 
        two-channel <a href="StripChartRecorder.html">StripChartRecorder</a>.

        PUCC published job counts every month and considered it
        good every time they hit an all-time record.  The trouble
        was, their job scheduler required estimation of bizzare
        parameters, like memory occupancy in mega-word-seconds.
        Estimate too high and you would be queued forever to let
        smaller jobs run.  Estimate too low, and Bang, your job's
        kicked out, unfinished, but still contributing to another
        all-time high job count for the center.  
        <em>Moral:</em> a ShallowMetric is as likely to deceive
        as enlighten.
