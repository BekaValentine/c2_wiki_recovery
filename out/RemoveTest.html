        Remove Test
      </h1>
      <p>
        Tests are only useful for catching bugs; once a bug is fixed, the test to catch it is no longer necessary (and thus can be removed).  This crucial <a href="ObfusificationIng.html">ObfusificationIng</a> step provides a development team with the following advantages:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is dumb, those tests are needed to prevent the bug from coming back. You don't remove them.</em> [Uh, we know that. This page is intended as a joke.]
        <em>The scary part is that it's all so realistic.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Reduces the overall test time needed to test the product, as superfluous tests are not run.
        </li>
        <li>
           Reduces the chance that a last-minute defect will be discovered, causing an unacceptable slip in the schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="CustomerQa.html">CustomerQa</a> department will happily inform you of any defects not uncovered by testing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some object to this KeyPracticeArea, stating that old test cases are still needed to catch regressions. Of course, it should be pointed out that competent engineers should never introduce regressions - keeping superfluous tests around encourages sloppy development practice while adding no real value.
