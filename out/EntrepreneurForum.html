        I am new to wikis, and the purpose of the swiki is to apply the wiki concept to the ongoing discussion of entrepreneurship (etp) basics and new approaches. I teach etp at the college level, and have to try new approaches to stay ahead of some pretty savvy young adults. I am very interested in success stories related to the use of blogs and wikis.
