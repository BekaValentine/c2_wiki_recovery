        Beep Speek
      </h1>
      <p>
        Are beeps annoying you more and more these days? They are me. A beep is a machine's way of saying "Hey!". When beeping machines were rare, a simple Hey could carry meaning. No more. Today I'm surrounded by machines, each one wanting my attention for who knows what.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hey!", one says, then "Hey!" again.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hey what?" I'd like to say, but, I know it's not listening.

      <p>
        I would buy an Alarm Clock if the alarm made a sound like a dog getting ready to throw up. This sound ALWAYS wakes me up instantly!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Other sounds instantly wake other folk. For me, it would be the sound of a bicycle freewheeling. How about an alarm clock that you feed from your computer with a .WAV or .AU file?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think some alarm-clocks will turn on an audio-tape player when the alarm rings, which is a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Or even better, in the space age we live in, you can have it play a CD. Some will even let you program what track! (This sounds sarcastic, and it is, but aimed at CD alarm clock manufacturers - I've seen those without this (to me) very obvious function).</em> I recommend "Tommy's Holiday Camp" at full volume!.

        At a <a href="HumanComputerInteraction.html">HumanComputerInteraction</a> conference some years ago, someone mentioned adding sound; a person from the audience said, "I don't like all those extra noises coming from my neighbors machine"; then someone piped in with...
      </p>
      <p>
        "You want something really subtle. You don't pay attention to the sounds of people walking down the corridor, until you hear the unmistakable shuffle of your boss. You notice it right away, and nobody else does. That's the kind of sound effect you want."
      </p>
      <p>
        Which reminds me of a generalization that I noticed a few years ago - computer programmers operate in saturated colors and sounds. The world operates in pastels and very unsaturated colors and sounds. Watching an artist arrange colors on the screen was instructive - the artist chose proximate, faded colors, where most computer people choose varied, saturated colors. The same thing is operating here with sounds.

        That's right, computer programmers choose contrasted colors, but so do typographers, etc. We have to have contrast in order to read easily, distinguish between screens (I always use dialogs of different colors).
      </p>
      <p>
        And yes, the sounds should be different depending on the situation. Most of the time, I use 5 or more different sounds in my programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I think that often "multimedia" is not necessary. Why have a big WAV when you can have a simply-generated sound?
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes a sharp, clear text-mode interface is exactly what is needed. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Well, sharp contrasts have their place, but obviously work only insofar as the environment allows the contrast to be meaningful. I know I spent some time reconfiguring my Win desktop themes so that I got a more subdued working environment (I would like to do more, but the mechanics of it all tend to be very time-consuming and often a bit frustrating). Sometimes I have had occasion to work in an office in a corridor filled with offices, and have been quite concentrated on some aspect of writing or whatever, only to be rudely jolted by a loud defaulted <em>TADAAA</em> as someone down the hall reboots.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Not to mention some themes people program their cellular ring signals as these days...)
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the note above by <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> about sounds that are <em>personally meaningful</em> and so are filtered out as random background by others. This would work fine for personalized systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also reminded of the <em>contrast</em> between what we see in films (various control/command centers blaring and flashing with alarms) and the reality of often very quite and subdued emergency centers where the only sound is people talking to resolve whatever crisis is current. (Think emergency switchboards, military command centers, etc., where the designers have really bothered to study and implement workable solutions to this.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer technology to have the attitude of <em>real world</em> control centers, not the film versions... -- <a href="BoLeuf.html">BoLeuf</a>

        I agree about electric lights but I find the most annoying sound is actually the cooling fan in the PC case. I'm seriously considering buying a laptop for the single reason that it's a damn sight (er... sound) nearer to silent.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>There are PC cooling fans specifically designed to be low-noise. I suggest looking at </em><a href="http://www.quietpc.com">http://www.quietpc.com</a> for them.<em></em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        But as for the noises the computer itself makes, I wouldn't be without them. Used sparingly, and with unique sounds for different events - no generic "TADA!" - I hate that. The sounds let me monitor what's going on. For example, "build completed successfully" and "build failed" sounds let me run a build in the background, which may take quite a few minutes. I can spend those minutes reading or editing <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> instead of staring at filenames scrolling through the build progress window - but still know the minute that the build is done or needs fixin'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simple solution to the "I don't want to be bothered by the sound of my neighbour's computer" is headphones, which if you both have them, both stops your computers' sounds interfering with each other, and also blocks out other ambient sounds (see Alistair's comment on ear protectors).
      </p>
      <p>
        And there's another advantage with that: If you're trying to concentrate on a task and <a href="BeepSpeek.html">BeepSpeek</a> is distracting you, you can just take the 'phones off and throw them onto the desk in disgust, and continue uninterrupted. :)
      </p>
      <p>
        Incidentally, despite being a coder, when I customize my colours, I prefer proximate and subtle colours to saturated primaries. But that could be because I spent three years studying design (graphic / multimedia, rather than software). -- Canis.

      <ul>
        <li>
           the extremely noisy rattle in the air conditioning unit over my neighbor's cube
        </li>
        <li>
           the cell phone three cubes away that plays "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" for about fifteen seconds because its owner left it on his desk in noisy mode while he went to a meeting <em>Send the person whose fault that is to: </em><a href="http://2lmc.org/phone/''">http://2lmc.org/phone/''</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           the programmer two cubes away who talks loudly on the phone all day
        </li>
        <li>
           the constant interruptions from other people in other departments of the company asking me how something works because it's faster to ask me than to <a href="ReadTheFineManual.html">ReadTheFineManual</a> or possibly expend a brain cell or two figuring it out
        </li>
        <li>
           the impromptu design meetings (I am guilty of this as well) in people's cubes because there's no other place to go
        </li>
        <li>
           the music coming out of my headphones as I try to drown out all of the above
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Headphones are not conducive to collaboration; however, the extremely noisy cube environment is not conducive to concentration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer a silent computer anyway.

        I'm an amateur musician, and sometimes use a PC to do MIDI sequencing in my home studio. But I'm moving away from that precisely because of the noise of the PC's fans (mine has THREE fans, or is it FOUR?!). (Of course there are other reasons to avoid PCs with music, such as the tendency to "fall into the interface" rather than stay focused on the music here and now; very easy to let our fancy tools get in the way...)
      </p>
      <p>
        On a separate point, I have my Palm alarm 5 or 10 minutes before a meeting, which works nicely. But then I'm sitting in the meeting room and it reminds me again, and I always say "Yeah, yeah!" under my breath as I pull it out and tap to acknowledge the alarm. Sometimes I fantasize about a smart PDA with GPS that could tell when I had actually gone to the meeting and therefore not *bug* me about it... We're definitely developing relationships with our smart tools, but they aren't smart enough yet, and so they whine and cry like toddlers (I have one of these, too...).

        <em>It's amazing: Whenever I return from a meeting, the first thing </em><a href="MicrosoftOutlook.html">MicrosoftOutlook</a> does is pop up an <strong>urgent reminder</strong> (after a rather significant "thinking" delay) to say "you need to go to this meeting!!!" Of course, by that time the meeting is over. It's even past the scheduled end time. But I still get the urgent "reminder". -- jtg<em></em>

        In his story "Harrison Bergeron", <a href="KurtVonnegut.html">KurtVonnegut</a> has a near-future world where the government enforces equality among people by artificially handicapping the gifted.

        They force smart people to wear headsets that generate beeping and buzzing sounds at random intervals. This disrupts concentration, preventing smart people from thinking too clearly.

        I do the "personalized audio environment" thing. A script keeps a registry of sounds and purpose-oriented nicknames ('transfer completed' is currently mapped to a chord, and 'transfer aborted' to a broken chord) and plays the appropriate thing when invoked. Since incoming email, instant messages, etc., all route their sound-playing through the script, I can create a "do not disturb" (or "do not disturb unless it's the important message I'm waiting for") mode without reconfiguring each program individually. Now I just need something worth concentrating on, to justify all this effort. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>
