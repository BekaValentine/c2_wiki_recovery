        Lisp Hippie
      </h1>
      <p>
        The flower children of the computer science world.  Peace, love, and <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>.  Whether 'tis a life free of <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s that one finds with the world's first <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>, or a life free of the oppressive straightjacket of <a href="StaticallyTyped.html">StaticallyTyped</a>Languages (<a href="ThereAreNoTypes.html">ThereAreNoTypes</a>), or both; the <a href="LispHippie.html">LispHippie</a> finds bliss in his (or her) favorite programming language.

        Some <a href="LispHippie.html">LispHippie</a>s even think that <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a> is a good idea..
      </p>
      <p>
        Most <a href="LispHippie.html">LispHippie</a>s are pretty cool; and I'm sure will realize that this <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> is all in fun and not delete it.  :) (Or if this page does push the envelope of the spirit of Wiki; be gentle to me at least...)

        <a href="LispHippie.html">LispHippie</a>s differ from <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a>s because they are willing to live and let live, even if they don't understand why you make so much trouble for yourself be programming in a LanguageOtherThanLisp.

        <em>Long live Lisp Hippies! Welcome to Wiki, and offer some of your bud to your rather uptight </em><a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a> brethren, eh?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a>s can't smoke bud.

      <p>
        <em>Why?--</em>StraightMan<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it has <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s!!!!!!

        They also tend to treat their environment with <em>cons</em>ideration, recycle their garbage, have a fondness for trees, learned from their parens to strive for balance, and wear their lists long.  Tower power!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And their </em>car<em>s are all Volkswagens.  Don't know about their cdr's</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        By inductive reasoning, their cdr's are also lists (<em>garages?</em>) of zero or more Volkswagens.  Although that is rather materialistic for a <a href="LispHippie.html">LispHippie</a> if you ask me.  I guess they know the value of everything and the cost of nothing...

        Some might have Winnebegos. On that fateful day, sipping a Bud, under the stars;
        watching a portable VHF TV, one could could have wrote in their EtchASketch:
