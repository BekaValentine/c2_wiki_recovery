        The bad guys are primarily <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> and the Romulans.  Relations with the Klingons were generally good, although there was a Klingon civil war that gave the Enterprise crew some opportunities to fight Klingons.  The Cardassians were introduced in TNG, but did not really amount to much.  The Ferengi were introduced as well, but were never more than a nuisance.

        An incredibly powerful being known as "Q" occasionally showed up and raised havoc, supposedly to study and test humans.  "Q" played pivotal roles both in the first episode and the last episode.
