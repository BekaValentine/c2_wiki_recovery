        Sea Forth Architecture
      </h1>
      <p>
        The IntellaSys SEAforth architecture consists of a collection of microcontroller groups on a single chip.  Each group consists of four C18 cores.  The earliest chip, the SEAforth-24, contained four groups, while the latest chip, called 40C18, contains ten.  Each core, in turn, maintains 64 18-bit words of RAM, and a similar amount of ROM.  A single 18-bit word may contain up to <em>four</em> C18 instructions, allowing adequate room for most tasks.

      <p>
        Each processor communicates with its neighbor via I/O ports which implement the semantics for <a href="CommunicatingSequentialProcesses.html">CommunicatingSequentialProcesses</a> in hardware.  Therefore, despite the relative, even abject, simplicity of the <a href="MachineForth.html">MachineForth</a> language used to program the cores, writing and exploiting fully parallel applications becomes routine.

        For an example of a moderately complex program for the chip, refer to the source code found here: <a href="http://www.falvotech.com/content/publications/software-defined-video/s24-video-clock.tar.gz">http://www.falvotech.com/content/publications/software-defined-video/s24-video-clock.tar.gz</a> .  The source file <strong>clock.vf</strong> contains the top-most level of code.
