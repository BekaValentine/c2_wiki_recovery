        And I just moved to India to start an XP development center.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are located in Raipur. Internet access is very good here
        and improving monthly. By June we expect to have access as good
        as any city on the Indian Internet Backbone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our specialty here will be Java and XML. Our hope is to do 
        product development rather than outsourcing/contracting.
      </p>

        I got my BS in Computer Science back in '71 at PSU, so you could
        say I've been programming professionally for 3 decades. My
        first programming language was Fortran II.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been following XP practices for a long time, but I was always
        shy about it. It is very helpful to have something to point to
        to explain why I work the way I do. I love XP and pair programming
        and all of it. I started refactoring back in 1980--which was the
        first time I had access to an editor. (Before that it was 
        punched cards and then patching source files on disk.)
      </p>
      <p>
        My big interest is in data centric programming. Which is to
        emphasize the compositional aspect of component-based programming
        and the movement of meta-data from code to XML documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our latest project is <a href="JxUnit.html">JxUnit</a>.
        The idea is to move test data out of the code (a la JUnit) and
        into ascii files (using XML), where it is easy to add new test cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my big concerns in putting together an XP development center
        is the time it takes to build a functioning team. Refactoring, for example
        is not a common skill here and takes time to learn. And from what I've
        read, it takes two or more years to build up to a group of 40.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been thinking that there may be a way to make XP more scalable and still be 100% XP. For want of a better name, I'm calling it <a href="ExtremeDevelopment.html">ExtremeDevelopment</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        No, we are not starting off with a team of 40 lost souls. We're up
        to 3 at this point. But we've got to grow fairly fast to keep ahead of
        the technology curve.
