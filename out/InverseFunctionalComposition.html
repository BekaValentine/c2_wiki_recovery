        Some people define <a href="InverseFunctionalComposition.html">InverseFunctionalComposition</a> to avoid these read-last-to-first definitions, e.g.

      <code>
        f >>> g = \x -> g (f x) -- in Haskell's Control.Category<br/>

        Thank you. I had not thought of that and I cannot find it in <a href="RealWorldHaskell.html">RealWorldHaskell</a>. I have implemented it in <a href="FunctoidsInCpp.html">FunctoidsInCpp</a> which has not been much work at all given that <strong>compose</strong> already existed there. I have had a look around to find some academic discussion of this and so far drawn a blank.  Can anyone help? Thanks -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
