        Ready For The Desktop

        As of late 2013, Linux still isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, Windows never was.
      </p>
      <p>
        And don't get me started on OS X...

        {Ironically, just in time to watch the desktop's decline. Web/XML-style UI's are the trending direction, even though the current <a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a> sucks.}

        My <a href="ScreenFull.html">ScreenFull</a> looks nothing like my <a href="DeskTop.html">DeskTop</a> -- why are we still clinging to the metaphor of a computer screen performing as the top of a desk.  
        Have you ever seen a mouse on your <a href="ScreenFull.html">ScreenFull</a>, it's almost certainly on your desk, usually (unless you're left handed) just to the right of your keyboard.
        Neither mouse nor keyboard are visible on most computer DeskTops -- except that recently I have seen keyboards on iPads.
        My real <a href="DeskTop.html">DeskTop</a> has a coffee cup, a pen, some envelopes, a telephone, a stapler, a beer, a box for trash, an iMac, a bunch of cables to connect other devices -- (headset, iPod, backup disk, lamp), some prospecti, a keyboard, a mouse, etc. -- (other things I don't wish to disclose) 
        There are no icons on my real <a href="DeskTop.html">DeskTop</a>.some 
        The mouse manifests itself as an arrow on screen, and the keyboard is allowed to put characters into some panels where the mouse's arrow may have clicked.
        <a href="ScreenFull.html">ScreenFull</a>, ScreenFace, etc... let's come up with a better name for what ComputerGeeks have been calling the <a href="DeskTop.html">DeskTop</a>.
        -- <a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a>  if this seems a rant, please move it to those nether places.  Maybe these are just AmericanCulturalAssumptions
      </p>
      <p>
        We need a better word or paradigm for the <a href="DeskTop.html">DeskTop</a>
