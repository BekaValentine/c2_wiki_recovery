        I'm CTO of Kizoom (<a href="http://www.kizoom.com)">http://www.kizoom.com)</a> a newish London based company trying to build novel applications to deliver information about public transport in the UK.  The theory is that we combine journey planning, real-time running, disruption and personalisation information into easy to use services and deliver them to lots of lost, late people over WAP, SMS and wireless PDA. The practice entails making a slow picaresque voyage of shocking discovery round the cracked rails of the oldest mass transit systems in the world -- while  riding in the  flaky, unfinished waggons of the new mobile data industries' half-built technology.  To try and cope with the mess, we have used XP since we started Kizoom in 2000, along with Java, Junit and VA/Eclipse. My workmates at Kizoom include <a href="MikeStorey.html">MikeStorey</a> & <a href="TomWhite.html">TomWhite</a>.

        Most of my professional life however, I've worked in the more beautiful world of software tools.

      <p>
        Past instantiations have included being founder and CTO of a software tools company, Synon, which did some interesting new things with model drive design and object based program generation in the 80's, and  running a London Lab  for <a href="ObjectTechnologyInternational.html">ObjectTechnologyInternational</a>, working on modelling tools in Smalltalk and Java, during which I had the pleasure of working and skiing variously with <a href="DaveThomas.html">DaveThomas</a>, <a href="ErichGamma.html">ErichGamma</a>, <a href="TimMackinnon.html">TimMackinnon</a>, and other great Objectfolk at OTI, as well as lots more others outside of it.

        And I'm a pukka Wiki <a href="AlHaj.html">AlHaj</a>, having made a pilgrimage to Portland Oregon to just to pair with the great <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, thereby claiming a <a href="WardNumber.html">WardNumber</a> of one.
