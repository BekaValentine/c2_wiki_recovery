        Bill Gates was in the right place in the right time and he had the great chance to meet a hugely talented marketing man called <a href="SteveBallmer.html">SteveBallmer</a>, a tough marketing whiz who originally worked for Procter and Gamble. Without <a href="SteveBallmer.html">SteveBallmer</a>, Bill Gates would have never built such a huge empire. He'd own a small software company.

        In my view, Microsoft is 95% Ballmer and 5% Gates. Gates was the image. Ballmer is the one who has always held the strings where it counted the most: marketing.
