        I worked with <a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a> on <a href="UsingPatterns.html">UsingPatterns</a>. I'm also a long time member of the New York <a href="DesignPatternsStudyGroup.html">DesignPatternsStudyGroup</a>  (<a href="NewYorkStudyGroup.html">NewYorkStudyGroup</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoyed <a href="UsingPatterns.html">UsingPatterns</a> very much.  I feel it was very successful.

        I'm the conference chair for UsingPatterns98.  Some feedback:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I think UP98 will be larger than UP97.  That is, patterns will reach a milestone of interest over the next twelve months so that there will be many more people who will want to attend.
        </li>
        <li>
           UP98 days could end a little earlier so attendees don't die of exhaustion.
        </li>
      </ul>
