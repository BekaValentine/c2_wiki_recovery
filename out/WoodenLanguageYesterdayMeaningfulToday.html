        Wooden Language Yesterday Meaningful Today

        Because something may be proposed or put forth as possible or workable, yet not yet implemented, tagging it as "<a href="WoodenLanguage.html">WoodenLanguage</a>" may not really apply when time has passed. Many times it may become <a href="WhatItWantsToBe.html">WhatItWantsToBe</a> by hard-work and by persistence, thereby solid, workable and useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because one can not at a moment of time put forth a finished blueprint or model as to how or what something may be or become, does not remove it from consideration, given enough time and work! This is true of much so-called <a href="VaporWare.html">VaporWare</a> things. Sometimes another may see a way to do it and they pick up the idea or notion, and <em></em>'<a href="MakeItSo.html">MakeItSo</a><em></em>'.

        <em>Speculation about the future can be marvellously well-written and clear, and documentation of </em><a href="RunningSixYearsBehind.html">RunningSixYearsBehind</a> can suffer from <a href="WoodenLanguage.html">WoodenLanguage</a>.  <a href="WoodenLanguage.html">WoodenLanguage</a> is simply a colourful synonym for "bad writing", particularly bad writing that's overly verbose, opaque, bureaucratic, or vague.  It has nothing to do with whether we're speculating about the future or documenting the past.<em></em>

        It is encouraging to use this term in a critical observation, when it is meant to bring about good effects.  The writing about something using words familiar to the writer and containing words which may have been poorly put together and not finalized, should not detract from the fact that a new writer has attempted expression in an open and freely editable space. It is important that a critic has taken time to notice and comment about it. Perhaps the critic could also make comments leading towards dialogue about the subject.

      <p>
        It is possible that what an expert has thought to be wooden language expressed by a novice in times past that has included insight, however poorly expressed, as to what something may become or may happen, and when it does, gives one pause to think about it.

        For some reason, I am thinking about a talented, and even gifted individual who spends hours launching angry birds at structures in an attempt to bring them down upon their inhabitants, using a smart-socially-capable-device, as being ironic.
