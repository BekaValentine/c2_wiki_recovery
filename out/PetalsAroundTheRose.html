        Petals Around The Rose
      </h1>
      <p>
        A fascinating game ( actually it's more of a puzzle or a brain teaser).
      </p>
      <p>
        The name of the game is Petals Around the Rose, and that name is <strong>significant</strong>. Newcomers to the game can be told that much. They can also be told that <strong>every answer is zero or an even number</strong>. They can also be told <strong>the answer for every throw of the dice that are used in the game</strong>. And that's all the information they get :D
      </p>
      <p>
        The person who has the dice and knows the game, rolls five dice and remarks almost instantly on the answer. For example: in Roll #1 the answer is two.
      </p>
      <code>
        Roll #1: 4 1 6 3 6<br/>
        : Answer is 2<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Roll #2: 5 6 5 4 4 <br/>
        : Answer is 8<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Roll #3: 3 5 5 5 6<br/>
        : Answer is 14<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The answer doesn't depend on previous rolls; for any given roll resulting in the same numbers showing on the dice, the answer is the same each time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three example rolls presented above don't provide enough information for most people to solve the puzzle.

        A remark on the above site that "the smarter you were, the longer it took to figure it out" gave it away for me straight away. -- vk

        Well, when the answer's in the name, doesn't take but a second to see the solution.

        Same here. I started out frustrated that I couldn't figure it out from <strong>this</strong> page. But I can't figure out how to improve this page without giving it away. Spoiler indeed! -- dm

        Another "me, too". That page was a lock... between the hints above, and that page, it took me 5 throws until I saw the "pattern". Given an "in person" version as described, I probably would have been scratching my head for a while. -- <a href="TimLesher.html">TimLesher</a>

        Given the hint below, I came up with an <em>almost</em>-correct answer, which I quickly refined after going to the interactive page. I can see how it could take a year of stewing over to figure out, though. -- <a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>

        I did not read the hint below but I supposed I found an answer. Reading the hint was a confirmation for my theory. Great game -- <a href="GabrieleRenzi.html">GabrieleRenzi</a>

        I suspect a graph of how long it takes would have a double hump; as with editing tech_docs, once you miss something it's not likely to "pop-up" and so it's likely to take some sort of brute strength approach. My first try (at another site, a pretty Java applet) was a failure ... and I couldn't convince myself this was proof of my genius. -- <a href="BenTremblay.html">BenTremblay</a>

        Right, but a single throw of the (simulated) dice and the answer jumped out at me. There is a great deal of cognitive noise in the presentation of the problem above. What exactly did the poser of the problem as stated above think was <em>the problem</em> that they were inviting people to solve, I wonder?
      </p>
      <p>
        It used to be that, in England and Wales, public (that is, publicly funded) secondary education was in two tiers: Secondary Modern and Grammar School. To get into the more academically focussed Grammar a child had to score highly on a test called the 11-plus. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Post WWII this system fell into disrepute and was disbanded (although some Grammar schools still exist, and selection is being reintroduced more widely). My school was a Grammar that became a non-selective "Comprehensive" by absorbing the local Secondary Modern a few years before I went there. One of the ex-Grammar teachers told us stories about exactly how degenerate the 11-plus became towards the end of its widespread use. For example, what is the next term in this number series:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          /4 1/2 1 3 ...
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        answer to follow after a few days (today is 10 June 04)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>and today is 12 april 05</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I assume no one tried to answer the sequence because there are too many reasonable answers -- yet he's clearly saying that if we answer wrong, we're degenerates! :-).  <em>Not degenerates; just doomed to mop floors for a living.  (Or become President...)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, if you get it <em>right</em>, you're degenerate. The answer that the examiners were looking for, by the way, was 6.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I thought it took three such digits to completely degenerate. :-)</em>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          !
        </li>
      </ol>
