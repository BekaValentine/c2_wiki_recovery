        Centipede As Beginner Project
      </h1>

        Language junkies like me often face a dilemma: when learning a new programming language for one's own amusement, what's a good first individual project?  It's not as if you're going to make up requirements for a payroll application or anything.  So why not make a game?  You can go with the old standbys, like <a href="TicTacToe.html">TicTacToe</a> or a guess-the-number variant, but those are too simple.  You can try making the <a href="GameOfChess.html">GameOfChess</a>, but making the computer play isn't something everyone knows how to do <em>(and it gets tiring after the third time)</em>.  Ideally, you want a one-player game that has reasonably mindless opponents, but is still fun to play when done right, and can be programmed a piece at a time.

        It is my belief that <a href="CentipedeGame.html">CentipedeGame</a> provides just the right balance for this purpose.

        My first games (for microcomputers running BASIC) were always on the "Dodge the Meteors" theme. Pretty simple: you print random numbers of spaces followed by an asterisk, repeat this, and the screen scrolls as a result. Then you use POKE and PEEK into video memory to put a block at the top of the screen. Use INKEY$ to let the player move left and right. If PEEK shows that the player hit an asterisk, the player dies.

        Later I wrote a Turbo Pascal program which I called "Invasion of the Killer Pound Signs." It looked a bit like Space Invaders, but it ran on the DOS text screen, and it had a couple of interesting twists. But it is unplayable on fast CPUs. I still wonder from time to time if I should try to rewrite it for the Win32 console or something.

        Today's modern GUI systems seem to encourage you to write dialog-box programs, and you can't do stuff like this anymore. -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a>

        Today's modern GUI systems seem also to discourage character-mapped and bit-mapped graphics as well, so the race-car game probably isn't a good idea, either.  And too bad about bitmapped graphics, since LittleSimulations would probably make good first projects as well.  --<a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        I would recommend (<a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>, natch) a VirtualPet. Less synchronization issues during the animation. --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        A friend of mine who is both a game coder and who has experience in teaching people to write code recommends the game of Simon as a good first project.  Apparently, people have problems even trying to write a clone of Pong in his experience.  I'm not sure that <strong>I</strong> believe that, but he swears by it.  --SamuelFalvo
