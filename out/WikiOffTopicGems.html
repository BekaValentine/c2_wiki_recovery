        Wiki Off Topic Gems
      </h1>
      <p>
        While <a href="WiseWordsWrittenOnThisWiki.html">WiseWordsWrittenOnThisWiki</a> is mostly <a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a>, this is a page on <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> pages that are like hidden gems that turn up during house cleaning. They sparkle and catch the corner of your eye, often when you get just too tired through concentrating on serious work too long. And would go away unnoticed for years, if you did not reclaim them when rediscovered.
