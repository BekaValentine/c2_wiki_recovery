        Par Object Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Like <a href="UnLambdaLanguage.html">UnLambdaLanguage</a> evrything is a function, insted this is evrything objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program file is a object definisen for main object. Example:
      </p>
      <code>
        [x=#65;xx=+out;xx=+out;]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        print out "A" 2 times
      </p>
      <p>
        I hav to complete this document, and make a interpreter for it as well. And I made a mistake abuve now I fix it
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Is this language defined anywhere?</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        OK, here I will now:
      </p>
      <p>
        Commands:
        varname=value; to setvariable
        ==value; to set return value from +value
        ~ to forget 1 from calling stack
      </p>
      <p>
        Operaters:
        +value to make copy uv a object and return the ==value inside the codeing for that object
        [code] to make a new object with this code and no variables. This code will not execute rite away, but will execute wen +value call copy uv it
        . to get self variable
        object>varname to get variable inside object (can also be use on left side uv =)
        object-value to get indexed variable inside objcet (can also be use on left side uv =) be same index if object pointer the same
      </p>
      <p>
        Numbers:
        Ar # and integer number. Number ar global object can be acses and changed the same as enything els, it has these variables bilt in:
        prev=number-1
        next=number+1
        sgn= -1 for <0 0 for =0 +1 for >0
      </p>
      <p>
        Main Object:
        The object the main object has these varible objects ar pre-coded:
        in = to input 1byte
        out = to output 1byte
        x = set to number value to in/out
      </p>
