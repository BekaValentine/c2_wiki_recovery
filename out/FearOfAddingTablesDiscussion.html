        I've seen the downsides of over tabling. I tend to lean toward fewer tables, and am thus bothered a bit by the suggestion to make more tables. I suspect people are trying to make tables fit OOP, when it should perhaps be the other way around. Is this another <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> at play? How about some examples and scenarios to explore.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> In fact, if you lean toward fewer tables that could even be seen as more object oriented... with good </em><a href="ObjectRelationalMapper.html">ObjectRelationalMapper</a> (with Hibernate to use <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> example), you can save a complete object graph equivalent to huge number of tables in to a single table... that of course is not considered a good practice, but it is certainly possible... and easy to do.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe having few tables is bad from a purely relational point of view, because by reducing the number of tables, you make foreign key integrity relationships less meaningful (If you store cities, countries, and flavors of ice cream in a single table, and then add a foreign key relationship to it form another table, that only needs ice cream flavors, the database will not be able to help you to avoid putting a city on the place of an ice cream flavor).
      </p>
      <p>
        Having fewer tables also make it harder to write queries, because you have to remember to filter stuff before writing joins:
      </p>
      <code>
        select cities.* from godtable as cities, godtable as states, godtable as countries where cities.type='city' and states.type='state' and country.type='country' and cities.parentgodid=states.godid and states.parentgodid= country.godid and country.name = 'China'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <code>
        select cities.* from (select * from godtable where type = 'city') as city, (select * from godtable where type = 'state') as state, (select * from godtable where type = 'country') as country where cities.parentgodid=states.godid and states.parentgodid= country.godid and country.name = 'China'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        are worse than the easier to read, easier to write, and perhaps even more efficient:
      </p>
      <code>
        select cities.* from cities,states,countries where cities.stateid=states.stateid and states.countryid = country.countryid and country.name = 'China'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Don't you think?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, if you have an <a href="ObjectRelationalMapper.html">ObjectRelationalMapper</a>, you can tell the Object Relational Mapper that the "type" column should be used as a discriminant. Map the god table to 3 classes (city, state and country) explain how they are related and then write the query like this (<em>Note that with a good </em><a href="ObjectRelationalMapper.html">ObjectRelationalMapper</a> you could write the queries with the exact same syntax regardless of the underlying existence (or not) of a <a href="GodTable.html">GodTable</a><em>):</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        select c from cities c where c.state.country.name = 'China'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Or even like this, if you choose to do so (but I prefer the abbreviated method):
      </p>
      <code>
        select city from city ,state,country where city.state=state and state.country = country and country.name = 'China'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Of course, you could achieve similar effects using CREATE VIEW to simulate 3 tables, but if you do so, why not simply have 3 tables from the beginning? You also have the problem that your DBA might not want to grant you privileges to create views. Requiring special privileges to create views to make your queries more readable is one of the well-known <a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a>.

        I am not sure what the above country example is trying to demonstrate. A generic "location" table may be useful in the case of an international databases in which the number of "levels" varies per country. Concepts such as "state", "county" may not be applicable to other (non-US) country's conventions. Of course, "it depends".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Exactly, it depends, the above country example is trying to demonstrate that, by default, unless you get help from an </em><a href="ObjectRelationalMapper.html">ObjectRelationalMapper</a>, it is harder to write queries when having a single <a href="GodTable.html">GodTable</a> (like location), I agree with you that a location table could be helpful for an international database (or maybe not because SQL is not that good for handling recursive trees), but the point is that unless you're sure that you actually are going to get a specific advantage by creating a <a href="GodTable.html">GodTable</a> you should prefer to split stuff into different tables, because while having few tables seems to make your design simpler, in fact it is only moving that complexity to another place (your queries).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, if it is for a US company that does not have "odd" requirements, it generally makes sense to have STATE, COUNTY, and CITY tables (although county is not used very often by commercial firms and is usually skipped). But I have seen borderline cases where regions/areas specific to the domain (marketing or internal area carve-ups) could perhaps be better served by a locational <a href="GodTable.html">GodTable</a> of sorts. At least the drawbacks versus the benefits are close enough that I could not fault either decision. Dealing with ever-changing domain areas can get sticky, and a <a href="GodTable.html">GodTable</a> just may be a bit more flexible. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But I have seen examples where the name of the </em><a href="GodTable.html">GodTable</a> is something like "GLOBAL_CATALOG" and after the developers add locations to it, and see it works fine, they start adding all kind of stuff to this GLOBAL_CATALOG (like Colors, auxiliary Status Information (stuff like "Open, Close, Busy, Blocked, Paid, InTransit"), and finally they decide to store the names of their favorite ice cream flavors.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also kicked around the idea of having one table for the smallest partition (such as a specific retail store), and then another table to map those specific spots to general categories or groupings such that they could even overlap if need be. Location info is often not a perfect tree and different departments may have different overlays/regions. Thus, this is the "set-centric" view.
      </p>
      <code>
        table: Spot<br/>
        -------<br/>
        spot_id<br/>
        spot_name<br/>
        etc...<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        table: Spot_group_links<br/>
        -------<br/>
        spot_ref   // f.k. to Spot table<br/>
        group_ref  // f.k. to Locat_groups table<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        table: Locat_groups<br/>
        --------<br/>
        group_id<br/>
        group_name<br/>
        group_type  // ex: tax, marketing, probation, etc. (optional)<br/>
        etc...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The groups perhaps could also be non-locational, or quasi-locational. The boundaries can get sticky in real-world stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Separate State/County/City tables might be a </em>bad<em> idea if you're attempting to represent hierarchical locations (because, as you mention, there are places where these overlap, though at least counties and states don't overlap). E.g. the 'City' table should not have an entry about which 'State' it is in unless you wish to treat as two or more cities every city that lands on a state border. A single table expressing a relationship between entities and locations (this entity (which might be a location) participates in that location-entity) is, semantically, the better way to go... even for expressing that a particular City 'overlaps' a particular state. Then, if necessary, the 'State' table may carry facts exclusive to the state (flag, motto, symbols, governor, etc.).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ''Unfortunately, this also is where Relational (esp. relational calculi and query languages) breaks down a bit: having one relation-table be associated with foreign keys from several different tables. A single '<a href="GodTable.html">GodTable</a>' for relating entities and their locations should, semantically, be used for everything from States and Counties to Employees and Vending Machines, each of which have their own facts and associations. However, making it work well in relational (in practice or theory) can be a pain. In practice, use of true '<a href="GodTable.html">GodTable</a>'s that relate lots of different kinds of entities seems to work better in the very flexible Logic programming languages, like Prolog, where there conceptually exists a true-to-the-word 'relation' for every single predicate (i.e. a full, potentially transfinite and uncountable, set of N-ary tuples with semantic meaning derived from both the name of the predicate and placement in the tuple). Logic programming languages, and their query and data specification mechanisms, don't offer many constraints or implications about how one predicate will relate to another; anything with a shared value will do so long as it is described in a list of predicate truths.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="FearOfAddingTables.html">FearOfAddingTables</a> shouldn't be any higher than FearOfAddingPredicates. However, the price paid for flexibility and correctness is usually space and speed. At which point does optimization cease being premature? Obviously, to most of you <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s, the answer is 'the moment I arrive'. You don't at all consider jumping straight to one of the popular 'relational' languages to be a premature optimization of a predicate-logic specification for data. Nor do you feel it appropriate to 'add a new table' to, say, add the 'official state anthem' (that can be lumped into the 'state' table within which you've already lumped 'flag' and 'motto' and 'capital'). Rant rant rant rant rant rant rant. I feel a little better now. I'm quite fond of optimization myself, but would prefer to see some real advances in full DBMS systems (you know, the sort with ACID transactions and concurrency? and maybe automatic distribution and replication?) that are focused more upon correctness and flexibility than upon speed; the DBMS itself should be capable of deciding when tables should be joined in representation as part of query-optimization and space-savings; users should feel that they can add a thousand tables (one unary-table for the 'IsState' predicate, one binary table for 'EntityMotto' relationship, one binary table for 'EntityFlag', etc. where a State is one 'Entity-Kind' that can have flags and mottos) all without significant loss of speed or efficiency.<em></em>

        Have you found anything that "proves" the opposite? And "proper normalization" has subjective components to it, such as "related". Ultimately everything is related, at least gravitationally. The "related" we use is from our own mental models, which are <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>s, but still lies. <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> is the best guide in my opinion, but there are situations were even that is not sufficient because there are different ways to score the weight of the "violations" when there are trade-offs involved. I've seen heated debates about where the "nulls" in sparse tables should be counted as "duplication". You get philosophical funbies such as, "How can they be duplication when they are stand-ins for something that doesn't exist? You can't duplicate something that doesn't existence. Can lack of existence be duplicated? Is empty space between galaxies all just a bunch of duplication of emptiness?" Fun stuff, but it never gets settled. -- top

        <em>Proves the opposite of what? "Proper normalization" is not subjective. It is an algorithmization of </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> based on functional dependencies. If I recall correctly, Date described it as "the automation of common sense". If your functional dependencies are unclear, then your analysis is insufficient. Go back to the users and ask questions. If it's still unclear (rare, but happens when the users don't know, either), this will make a difference in a few tables; on a large schema, a very small and manageable percentage. This does <strong>not</strong> represent some philosophical approach to data modeling, because there isn't one. You're either modeling the real-world facts -- to support user requirements -- in a normalised manner, or you aren't. If you aren't, then you should be -- modulo the occasional (and hopefully, deeply begrudged) denormalisation to achieve acceptable performance within budgetary constraints.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      <p>
        I believe somewhat of a consensus or compromise has developed on other topics spawned from this one. Whether one's view is a wide-table view or a narrow table view should be just that: a view. What is underneath the hood does not have to matter to the query language user. Relational has the potential to be flexible enough such that one can use whatever "named group" of columns they want. It's just sets. In theory, named column sets can overlap: it does not have to be either/or. However, limits of existing RDBMS (such as limited updateable views and wimpy column dictionaries) with a combination of a shortage/underfunded/uncaring DBA's makes this goal difficult in practice. The battle above is mostly about which to give priority given the existing limits. --top

        Another anecdote: I'm implementing a smallish intranet app to replace an MS-Access one that some complained was too complicated. It tracks PC's along with hardware and software. One thing I decided to do with have a single table for software and hardware rather than make a separate Software table and Hardware table. One of the reasons I did this was that the distinction can be blurred. For example, is a dongle that comes with configuration software truly just one or the other? Is a USB thumb-print reader for security access to a specific app software or hardware or both? I don't want to hard-wire such classification into the system prematurely. If I'm on vacation or get hit by a bus, there may be nobody around to adjust the columns if a software-only field becomes shared (or vise versa). There's not exactly spare staff around here to do the new-column dance all the time. --top

           <em>It's quite possible that software and hardware </em>do<em> represent two user interpretations of the same concept -- which might be "assets", "inventory" or "resources" -- that are distinguished by an attribute, perhaps "AssetType".  Then it's fine.  On the other hand, if you have combined two distinct concepts in a single table, then this approach is wrong.  It may cause update anomalies, and will certainly represent meaningless "facts", such as that Microsoft Word is a "hardwaresoftware" or that Microsoft Word consumes unknown (null) watts.  Meaningless "facts" inevitably mean more effort at a reporting and/or data-entry level to filter them out or convert them into something meaningful.  If there are common attributes found in distinct concepts, they should be factored into a supertype table with hardware and software as subtype tables.  Monolithic user views, if needed, should be reconstituted from the tables using VIEWS, not by hardwiring them into a denormalised schema in an attempt to re-create a spreadsheet in a database.  Finally, the poor </em><a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a> of DBAs on your team should never be an excuse for bad data modeling -- unless you feel that the possible difficulty of finding a plumber to replace a tap that might break should be an excuse to always drink out of the toilet bowl.<em></em>

               Well, that is indeed true. Often its difficult to get sufficient DBA service, and a work-around is to shift some of the burden to the app. Plus, the DBA's head is usually not as deep into the domain as the app dev, so the DBA is not as ready to make thoughtful domain-centric decisions with regard to schema design. --top

                  Object relational mappers are kind of like HTML widgets that aren't maintainable separately - how come the ORM folks are so fond of maintaining HTML in templates separately from the application logic - but when it comes to the database, they put it all in one pile with the objects? For example, why not have html.div.box mapped to the business object too? Why store that in separate templates?  The ORM folks believe in taking all the complexity out of the database and putting it into the application - yet they don't believe in taking all the HTML complexities and putting it into the application too?

               But I've seen too many cases where they get the slices (abstractions/classifications) wrong. It is hard to undo those and you are stuck with a mess. A messy wide table is easier to deal with than messy skinny ones. I think the real problem is one or both of:

                   1. It's hard to get domain abstractions right.

A messy wide table is easier to deal with than messy skinny ones.

                           Sounds irrational.  While a well chosen wide table might be better than a poor narrow one, you have <strong>NO</strong> justification for saying 'poor wide tables' are better than 'poor narrow ones'.

A simple degrees-of-freedom analysis on ways to mess up would indicate it is much easier to make poor wide tables than poor narrow ones.

I don't care so much for '5-12' scenarios; it is better in my mind to create one representative scenario and explore it thoroughly.  And, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, I don't consider changing your mind worth anything.  Why?  Because, to the best of my knowledge, everyone else already disagrees with you, and most of those who might agree are dinosaur-soldier-DBAs not really thinking about much beyond keeping their jobs.

After that happens, DBAs would still be important for maintaining data recovery (e.g. remote backups of data), availability, and consulting for schema design.  Schema design will be reduced considerably by a greater focus on skinny tables and SixthNormalForm, and most optimizations that a trained DBA can perform today (and there aren't very many at the schema level) will ultimately be automated - even choice of indexes can be based upon what programmers initially profile as 'likely' queries and what the database actually experiences.  Availability concerns will reduce over time due to Grid Computing and web-service-hosting-agencies that support distributed operations and distributed duplication of any data marked critical.  Recoverability concerns will ultimately be reduced by growing use of bitemporal databases in combination with the redundant-distributed backups and just plain whole-service-backups provided by the web-service-hosting-agencies.

               <em>I agree.  But there is the opposite truth, too: "Testing an idea in production" is NOT a substitute for rigorous analysis.  Testing an idea in production is like one unit test - a single point of data; it can improve confidence in something already shown by analysis, but by itself carries very little meaning.  If you think otherwise, then I can only assume you've never bothered to acquire an education upon or analyze methods of analysis.  And the human element in software systems is ONLY relevant at the Human Computer Interface (which does happen to include programming languages) - it should never dictate design, architecture, or policy past that point except insofar as desired features (properties) of the HCI can only be met by certain structures or architectures (e.g. you can't build an HCI debugger without a certain amount of reflection in the system).  The moment you use it as a reason for a particular design, you had better be able to demonstrate that your assumptions about how the HCI relates to the underlying architecture actually hold - not just 'say' they hold as you typically do.</em>

               They both have their place. One tends to answer "IF" and the other "why". And your assumptions about HCI not applying to system design appear to <strong>assume unlimited labor</strong> <strong>[</strong><a href="DemandForEvidence.html">DemandForEvidence</a>]<strong>. If labor was cheap and plentiful, then overengineering to prevent every last possible thing may be warranted. But because labor is limited, HCI can make or a break a system. If a schema is hard to read, it may result in a mistaken human decisions by a designer. One of the biggest difference between anal people and non-anal people is that the anal people pretend like they have forever to devote to something trivial such that they overdo something and never get to other things.--top</strong>

               One of you agreed that removing *all* redundancy is not always warranted. It was also illustrated with the pizza example (I forgot where I put that). Domain design decisions may suggest leaving some redundancy in place. You guys appear to be contradicting yourselves. If redundancy remove was the ONLY criteria for all design (which should have been stated as a given), then you would perhaps be right.

                <li>
                   so-called '<a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>', you are utterly wrong even in your own field.  5NF isn't "just about redundancy removal" - none of the normal forms are.  <strong>All normal forms are defined in terms of Functional Dependencies and Semantic Constraints</strong>.  Every single one of them.  Review them, if you must, if they aren't just "academic nonsense" and "<a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>" to an almighty brain such as yours (which is capable of imagining that at least everything is true in his mind).  Redundancy removal is a consequence of normalization, and (<strong>therefore</strong>) normalization is a means by which to achieve redundancy removal.  Another way to remove redundancy is to delete all your tables - there is no redundancy at all in a database without any data.  It just so happens that normalization is a form of removing redundancy that doesn't lose you any information or the ability to represent the facts you wish to represent.  So, obviously the goal is not JUST to remove all redundancy (because that was our goal, we'd just <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> and delete the tables); rather, the goal is to achieve <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> representation of facts - to eliminate redundancy <em>without</em> losing data or changing the set of facts we wish to represent.  And that should have been obvious to you from the start.  And note that <em></em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> representation of <strong>domain values</strong><em> isn't on the agenda at all.</em>

                <li>
                   Just because one can maximize 2 or 3 factors does not mean those the results say one should always maximize JUST those factors. In the pizza example, could you confidently say that the higher-normalized form is always the right form? See <a href="SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple.html">SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple</a>. I don't dispute that high normal forms maximize the factors that the authors are measuring. What I dispute is that there are not <strong>other factors</strong>, generally human and economic factors, that are also important even if they are difficult to quantify.

                    <li>
                       Seems okay to me so far, though I'm having troubles seeing how you think it relevant to the greater context.  After all, if I can't quantify or qualify human or economic factors, then neither can you - which means you can't possibly use them in any rational argument you're attempting to present to support or defend your side of things.  That said, I think various human and economic factors can be quantified (given number) or at least qualified (given formal descriptors and/or booleans), such as: need for repetition in expression, security, availability, accessibility,  tolerance to human fault, measures for damage control, etc.

           That's why I'd like to explore normalization for specific scenarios, such as the <a href="PublicationsExample.html">PublicationsExample</a>. That way we don't have to compare generalizations with generalizations. If that example needs a tuning, as one of you suggested, then lets tune it.

           <strong>Ease of measuring and level of importance are not necessarily related</strong>. Let's say relevant  factors include ABCDEF. However, DEF are difficult to compute with, so we ignore them and only maximize factors ABC. You may get some nice "proofs" just by using ABC. However, those proofs failed to factor in DEF, and are thus incomplete. --top
          <ul>
            <li>
               Your assumption that factors DEF weren't considered is, most likely, a wrong one.  But you can name them if you think otherwise, and I can go to my list-of-reasons-that-thin-tables-are-better and see if they were considered.  For example, economics WAS considered, in the form of thin-table solutions being far better suited to <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a>.  So was security, integrity/correctness, optimization, semantic purity, human-factors such as the ability to easily browse and manipulate tables through HCI, etc.  Whatever you think I'm missing has probably been considered, so unless you can <em>actually name</em> something where you can offer evidence of relevance and I can't respond with evidence of how said relevant thing has been considered and is better or not relevantly worse - I'm not inclined to believe your position is more than just a bunch of hot air and yelling that I <em>could have, maybe, possibly</em> not taken <em>a vague something</em> into account in deciding my view regarding thin tables.

           Plus, there's the open issue of whether nulls should count as "redundancy", if redundancy is your sole criteria. Proofs are easy when there are only one or a few factors. However, <strong>reality usually injects far more factors than math models can handle.</strong> I think you guys WANT a simpler world that simply does not exist, so you blind yourself to the difficult factors, such as human psychology.

If you make assumptions on the security-environment - in particular that everything must be bottlenecked through a DBA - then one will (by even rudimentary analysis) need to <strong>over-specify</strong> and rely on great foresight as you do for your wide-table solutions - in particular, you need to do a lot of thinking up-front to make sure everything is there that the users will possibly ever need.  The more extreme thin-table design solutions (especially those deriving from logic language programming) take a <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a> approach - just add whichever tables you need (at the moment) to represent the facts you have (at the moment), and add more tables if you learn you need more tables (in the future); no foresight is required.

        Well, that's a very interesting philosophical question.

        I've worked with both types of design, and my summary gut feeling is that thin is not in. Wide tables allow one to "drill down" incrementally. You get the general entity concept first (the "wide" table), and then filter out what you don't need via column and row filtering. It's a <strong>hierarchical thought process</strong> more or less. (Yes, there are <a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a>, but we're talking mostly about a mental map, not a formal taxonomy. In fact, trees are overused because they are mentally catchy.) -- top (ctd.)

           Being <strong>in</strong> or not (as in fashion, or whatever) might land you on Fabian's quote of the month page. This has nothing to do with being <strong>in</strong> or being <strong>hip and satisfactory with the coworkers</strong> or whatever it is you are trying to be.  The relational model is not what you describe - and you should stop talking about your table oreinted programming model (if it is even a model) as if it is relational - because it isn't.  Over the past years reading through this wiki, I've come across tens of pages (maybe hundreds) where you appear to be defending the relational model, when in fact you have absolutely no relation to the relational model whatsoever. It is very confusing, misleading, etc.  You ought to defend your table oriented model as <em>the TOP model</em> or something else, and stop speaking of the relational model in any communications. The relational model is also not about <strong>gut feelings</strong> or <strong>pokes that I feel on my ribs</strong> or anything like it. Top model (if it is a model) may be about that, but the relational model has basically nothing to do with what you are defending.

        {With 'wide' tables you'll also have a bunch of scattered 'exception' tables (because wide tables are very non-homogeneous) that carry all the one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, and as consequence you still don't get "the general entity concept" - just a fractured view of it.  I'd much prefer to have good tools for constructing useful views on the fly than 'pretend' I'm getting some significant benefit out of wide tables.  I'll also note that the value of the 'entity' concept has always been at question - it may be worth its own little debate.  Thin table approaches, at least those with which I'm most familiar, don't embrace this 'entity' concept... they sort of kick it aside in favor of <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>.  The closest they come is recognizing semantic facts like 'exists(identifier-goes-here)'. -- db}

        With skinny tables its like trying to remember the name of an obscure person: there's no mental drill-down available; the mind has to do a sequential search. Now, I perfectly agree that if better schema sifting and virtualization tools were available, such may not be an issue. But, to misquote Rumsfeld, we have to fight the war with the army we have, not the army we want. -- top (ctd.)

        {I'll agree that the most popular RDBMSs aren't ideal for the thin-table approach (partially due to the spiral-effect: nobody outside the academic community uses thin-tables, so there isn't a lot of visible money-benefit of building one, so nobody builds one, so nobody outside the academic community uses thin tables ...).  That can reasonably affect your current actions, but I don't believe it a great argument for why wide tables are better.  And, yes, a thin-table approach would rely on the ability to rapidly identify or learn of tables.  Among other things, first-order-logic as part of queries would be useful in thin-tables, making meta-data (data about the database and the data) into <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> data.  This requires the ability to use a column-name as an attribute-value, grab it out as part of a query, and query upon it.  Your proposed <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a>(ies) follow this pattern, but similarly lack much support from modern RDBMSs.  Anyhow, what do you think Rumsfeld would have said should he have had the ability to construct armies out of well-arranged ones-and-zeroes simply by spending a few $million to hire some smart and experienced people to do it for him? -- db}

        Note that I don't disagree with all thin tables. The one that buggers me the most is doing it merely to get rid of nulls. <strong>Nulls are too volatile and trivial a concept tie key design decisions to</strong>. One shouldn't have to rework bunches of tables just because a column becomes "required" instead of optional, or required for different circumstances.  -- top (ctd)

      <p>
        {I can't imagine needing to rework a bunch of thin tables because a column becomes 'required', either.  It might help to know my conception of 'thin tables' in its extreme form is essentially that which I've derived from my study of logic programming languages and automated theorem proving: <strong>exactly</strong> one fact per row, or ConjunctiveNormalForm transformed into rows on a table.  A typical entity-table basis for databases has (ENTITY-ID,LIST-OF-ATTRIBUTES).  E.g. if there are three attribute-columns 'wears', 'makes', and 'eats', then this single row would represent three conjunctive facts wears(fred,what-fred-wears) AND makes(fred,what-fred-makes) AND eats(fred,what-fred-eats).   The 'thin-table' approach would break this into three tables (wears, makes, eats) each with a binary relationship.  However, there are non-binary relationships that cannot be expressed in this manner, e.g. where an abstract proposition (a <strong>predicate</strong>) has one, zero, or more than two than one parameter.  0-ary tables are simply boolean variables (essentially), unary tables are straightforward classifiers (like 'exists(x)' or 'isNumber(y)'), and ternary+ tables really need all three-or-more entries (e.g. delivers(bob,pizza,fred)).  There are NO entity tables that also carry facts about the entity.  Ever.  The closest you can come is an extensive-list of entity-identifiers of a single type (isPublication(y), isPeriodical(z), exists(x)).  Thin tables, in the more extreme form, entirely rejects <a href="EntityRelationshipModeling.html">EntityRelationshipModeling</a>.  Instead, its best-practices focuses on <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> explicit representation of facts (e.g. you'd never say 'is("publication",x)' AND say 'isPublication(x)', though you could say 'is("publication",x) :- isPublication(x)' - i.e. use implied or entailed facts... which (in this case) turns 'is' into a query or view).  And there are ways of specifying schema and constraint requirements (e.g. that 'isPublication(x) <strong>requires</strong> known(y),hasTitle(x,y)') - db}

        Like I said before, that's like purchasing the decorations for a house based on the clothes you happen to have on. Big design decisions should be tied to "big" concepts, those that are as invariant as possible. Empty columns often don't qualify.  (Note that I am not happy about the way current RDBMS implement nulls, but that's another topic.)
      </p>

        Perhaps we can sum this up in a more general rule: <strong>Don't make hard partitions in designs unless the hard partition exists in the domain itself.</strong>  Otherwise, changes will be painful and risky.

        <em>I can appreciate that more tables, rather than fewer, may represent a visualisation problem.  This is certainly true when you have to deal with a project that has hundreds of tables.  That does not mean, however, that you should accept or allow the update anomalies that result from denormalisation.  That would be like deliberately writing bad code because you have to program in Notepad.  Instead, use (or create) tools that facilitate visualising complex schemata.  The "relationships" view in Microsoft Access is surprisingly good for this, especially in terms of following foreign key relationships, though I've long wished for a more sophisticated schema management and visualisation tool that would permit zooming in and out, showing/hiding only the tables that are related by foreign keys to a specified table, and defining arbitrary groups of tables -- e.g., Accounts Receivable, General Ledger, Inventory, Billing, etc. -- and hiding/showing group details (i.e., the individual tables within a group, or the attributes within the tables within a group) as needed.  I started working it -- as a kind of ER-modeller/DBA tool from Hell -- around the turn of the century, but, alas, the pressing demands of other projects have largely squeezed it out of the running.

        We'd have to look at specifics to see if there are really "update anomalies". Not all "problematic" wide tables result in the typical update issues. The devil's in the details.

        <em>If your design is not, for example, in 5NF when 5NF is warranted -- or in 3NF, period -- then there are, by definition, update anomalies.

That means you don't have to look at the "specifics", or rely on conditions (such as "<x>, <y> and <z> tables will never be updated") that hold true today but may not hold true tomorrow.</em> -- DV

        "Relational" means roughly "based on tables". However, the "thin table" approach is more akin to maps (dictionaries) than tables. Perhaps the thin-table approach should be called "mapational" or "maptional".

        "Thin table" approaches still allow for n-ary relations of arbitrary degree 'n'.  The rule determining the degree is essentially that one row = exactly one complete fact (i.e. no conjunctive 'AND' clauses implicit in the predicate reading of the fact represented by the row because those can always be fully reconstructed by use of table joins).  As such, likening 'thin tables' to 'maps' seems an invalid analogy <em>even before</em> one starts to consider the variation in needs for indexing (maps are indexed on exactly one key, but thin tables could be indexed by any subset of the powerset of columns) and the common difference in query and manipulation languages (maps don't typically support joins, intersects, unions, views, etc.).  -- <a href="WhiteHat.html">WhiteHat</a>

           <em>Well, set expressions/operators can certainly be added to maps. My concern is that if most of the tables are thin, then perhaps one might as well byte the bullet and endorse maps as the "atom" of this thin table philosophy. It may simplify the math/model to always "know" one is working with just maps. Keeping atoms simple sometimes makes the model cleaner. Just something to think about. If the majority of your tables are essentially maps, then perhaps making them all maps allows one to ditch notation baggage and confusion related to supporting the possibility of 3 or more columns, allowing a more compressed notation/model.

           It is true that relational operators can be added to maps, but then you wouldn't just have a map anymore... sort of like supporting 'dequeue' for a stack results in something other than a stack.  'Maps', and all objects, are defined at least as much by their accessors as by their underlying structure.  But you are wrong about switching to 'maps' keeping things 'simpler'; indeed, in practice people who utilize maps to emulate tables often find they need to maintain <strong>two</strong> maps, carrying identical data, with the indexing reversed.  Essentially, you'll have user-maintained indexes instead of user-maintained databases.  It would be far simpler (for the user moreso than for the language implementor) to have 'tables' be the primitive and allow the user to simply define which indices are needed... just as is done in modern database systems.  -- <a href="WhiteHat.html">WhiteHat</a>
