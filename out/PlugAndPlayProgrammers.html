        Plug And Play Programmers
      </h1>
      <p>
        From the Microsoft term describing automatic detection and configuration of hardware devices (and subsequent automatic loading of device drivers) to extend system capabilities. PnP programmers are viewed by IT managers as being easily hired and easily fired, yet good enough to get the average programming job done.

      <p>
        To be successful, the programming environment itself has to be widely available to produce a population of candidates. The System/38 and later AS/400 RPG markets were particularly strong in this regard - one application language, one visual interface (character mode <a href="GreenScreen.html">GreenScreen</a> and fixed font printing), and one database. <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> with <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a> and/or <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> is another example.
