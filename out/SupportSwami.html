        Some issues, such as meetings, defects, and emergencies, require a programmer to be present.  However, continual interruptions make it difficult for programmers to work.  Therefore, create a role, filled on a rotating basis by the programming team, that's dedicated to these issues.

        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The team is interrupted less often and works much more efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="SupportSwami.html">SupportSwami</a> becomes overloaded with work that should have been planned.
        </li>
        <li>
           The role rotates and problems raised during the previous swami's tenure tend to stagnate.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>(Note: The name "support swami" was a fun title that the </em><a href="DenaliProject.html">DenaliProject</a> team came up with.  We even had a cheesy JohnnyCarson swami hat made from a bicycle helmet.  No offense is intended to people who deal with real swamis on a regular basis.  If we had thought of ProblemPontiff or SalvageSaint, we might have used one of those with a different funny hat instead.  We're just that annoying.  Have a nice day!  --<a href="JimLittle.html">JimLittle</a>.)<em></em>
