        <a href="AgileDevelopment.html">AgileDevelopment</a> reduces the <a href="CostOfChange.html">CostOfChange</a> and of defects by deciding as late as possible and mistake proofing through automation as much of the software creation process as feasible [<a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> & StoryTestDrivenDevelopment].
