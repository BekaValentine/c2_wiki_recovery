        The Chemical Emergency Planning Wiki was hosted by <a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a>. It was intended to be a collaborative workspace for all to learn about, share, and improve the state of the art in chemical emergency planning, prevention, response, mitigation, and recovery.

        It is crtainly prudent for anyone to know about natural and man-made hazards where they live. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has some Web resources for finding about nearby chemical inventories: <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/oswer/ceppoweb.nsf/content/chemicalsinyourcommunity.htm?opendocument">http://yosemite.epa.gov/oswer/ceppoweb.nsf/content/chemicalsinyourcommunity.htm?opendocument</a>

        Note in these days of heightened anxiety about terrorism, convenient online access to the collected information is not available to the public.
