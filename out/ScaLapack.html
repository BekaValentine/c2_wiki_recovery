      <p>
        ScaLAPACK is a version of the <a href="LinearAlgebraPackage.html">LinearAlgebraPackage</a> which has been extended to allow <a href="InterProcessCommunication.html">InterProcessCommunication</a>. This is organized via the concept of a DistributedArray which is shared in an organized way across the memory associated with each of a grid of processors. Consequently, the size of problem which can be tackled can be larger than will fit in the memory available to any one of the processors. In such a scheme, it is not trivial to get the data installed before processing can start.
      </p>
      <p>
        ScaLAPACK can use for <a href="InterProcessCommunication.html">InterProcessCommunication</a> either the <a href="ParallelVirtualMachine.html">ParallelVirtualMachine</a> library or an implementation of the <a href="MessagePassingInterface.html">MessagePassingInterface</a> standard.  
      </p>
      <p>
        ScaLAPACK at present implements a subset of the methods available in the <a href="LinearAlgebraPackage.html">LinearAlgebraPackage</a>.

        The ScaLAPACK project home page is <a href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/.">http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ScaLapack.html">ScaLapack</a> is implemented in <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>.

        The strategy used to build this is very much one of reuse. For any installation, there is a set of libraries with the high-level ones providing the interface to the user and the lower-level ones providing building blocks. Items used in ScaLAPACK include the following.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="BasicLinearAlgebraCommunicationSubprograms.html">BasicLinearAlgebraCommunicationSubprograms</a> (BLACS)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="BasicLinearAlgebraSubprograms.html">BasicLinearAlgebraSubprograms</a> (BLAS)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="LinearAlgebraPackage.html">LinearAlgebraPackage</a> (LAPACK)
        </li>
        <li>
           ParallelBasicLinearAlgebraSubroutines (PBLAS)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If these are put together properly, the top-level user is spared much of the detail of <a href="InterProcessCommunication.html">InterProcessCommunication</a>.

        <strong>October 2007</strong> New versions of <a href="ScaLapack.html">ScaLapack</a> and LAPACK (<a href="LinearAlgebraPackage.html">LinearAlgebraPackage</a>) are now available from this site:

        <a href="ScaLapack.html">ScaLapack</a> can do wonders on modern computer systems. I am using the Intel MKL libraries and running quite large matrix problems (~40000 and not sparse).  The occasional case does crash.  I have one at the moment which runs on 9 or 25 processors and crashes on 16 with a lot of <a href="NotaNumber.html">NotaNumber</a> values. I have coined the phrase <a href="ExtraLegsOnToaSwan.html">ExtraLegsOnToaSwan</a> for this, as there is one call which is leading to a lot of action on all the processes. <em>I did solve this eventually - it was a code bug.</em>
