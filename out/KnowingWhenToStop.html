        Knowing When To Stop

      <p>
        There have been three 'aha' moments for me on <a href="IndexCard.html">IndexCard</a>s:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In the coffee shop when Ward turned that card 90 degrees from all the others (sorry it's too precious and personal to describe in detail in something as "open and vulnerable as Wiki")
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Realising as the <a href="NikiNiki.html">NikiNiki</a> team tried to capture all details of <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> and <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>'s for Niki on Niki that we had somehow lost the wonder of XP's "card plus conversations" - which reminds me of the other DontImproveItUntilYouveUnderstoodIt mistakes we made along the way.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Reading this in <a href="VlissidesOnBeck.html">VlissidesOnBeck</a>: "a la CRC, where you keep people from blathering through sheer physical constraint? ... Right. You say the three most important sentences you have to say."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Blathering too much unverifiable stuff and not paying attention to human relationships - the two biggest problems in most projects (and on Wiki).

        Time for me to stop too. --<a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>
