        Knowledge Ecology
      </h1>
      <p>
        Knowledge ecology seeks to focus on the relationships, learning and social processes concerned with knowledge exchange, creation and use.  Knowledge ecology differs from <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a> due to its focus on cognition, situated and social learning and knowledge sharing.

      <p>
        The <a href="KnowledgeEcologyNetwork.html">KnowledgeEcologyNetwork</a> proposes to adopt a social recruiting paradigm and hopes to help business and not-for-profit organizations cope with cultural changes and the people aspects of the networked economy.
