        The four novels above, written in the late 1960s, explore near futures in which society and the world are worsening in different ways. Roughly, StandOnZanzibar focuses on overpopulation, TheSheepLookUp on pollution, <a href="TheShockwaveRider.html">TheShockwaveRider</a> on "future shock", and TheJaggedOrbit on fear of strangers (as manifested in social customs and the widespread adoption on personal weapons). Each is an "if this goes on" extrapolation, and some of them are disturbing.

        <a href="TheShockwaveRider.html">TheShockwaveRider</a> introduces the notion of computer worms (was "viruses", but strictly they are worms -- they autonomously move from host to host, rather than attaching their code to other programs) and has some interesting passages on <a href="SlowDownToSpeedUp.html">SlowDownToSpeedUp</a>.

        <a href="TheShockwaveRider.html">TheShockwaveRider</a> inspired some of the first theoretical work on worm programs at Xerox PARC in the early 1980s; unfortunately it also inspired Robert T. Morris to write his Internet worm program.
