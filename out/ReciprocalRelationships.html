        Reciprocal Relationships

      <p>
        In the context of the <a href="AttentionEconomy.html">AttentionEconomy</a>, <a href="ReciprocalRelationships.html">ReciprocalRelationships</a> are relationships between parties that are both likely to pay attention to each other. A relationship between myself and someone famous is not reciprocal, because I am far more likely to pay attention to them than they are ever likely to pay attention to me.

        In the modern world a substantial amount of our attention is devoted to <a href="WellKnownSources.html">WellKnownSources</a>, and we get much of our information that way. This means that a large proportion of information flow is essentially one way. There is also severe competition to get information into <a href="WellKnownSources.html">WellKnownSources</a>.

        The Internet and the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a> have not changed this situation as much as one might hope for, which is why I have developed <a href="MiskiConcepts.html">MiskiConcepts</a> -- <a href="PhilipDorrell.html">PhilipDorrell</a>.
