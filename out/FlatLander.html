        A <a href="FlatLander.html">FlatLander</a> demands "proof" of the existence of things that can't be rendered in his [flat] space and, seeing no such proof, declares that if it can't be rendered to his satisfaction, it doesn't exist.

Something like "of course there are not warp-drive powered apache helicopters, since I haven't seen any in my plane" may be signed </em><a href="FlatLander.html">FlatLander</a>, implying that anyone who agrees with that statement is simply blind, and so closing off any further discussion.  <a href="YourMileageMayVary.html">YourMileageMayVary</a>.<em></em>
