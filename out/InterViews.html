        <a href="InterViews.html">InterViews</a> is a set of libraries and tools for building
        graphical applications under X11.  It's freely available [1], but
        it's past its prime.  Its intended successor was Fresco (<a href="FrescoFramework.html">FrescoFramework</a>).

        <a href="InterViews.html">InterViews</a> is  still useful today, especially to a programmer willing to investigate problems generated by their derivations in a debugger.  Several interesting things have been built with it [3], and a few
        significant packages like Target Jr and <a href="IvTools.html">IvTools</a> [4] are still undergoing development.  But as a portion of the <a href="InterViews.html">InterViews</a> team carried on in their quest to unify structured documents and structured graphics (Fresco [2]), and one
        member of the team started to write about <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> extracted from <a href="InterViews.html">InterViews</a>, the original tar file was no longer maintained or evolved.

        This represented an opportunity for third parties to come out with derivative works, which Vectaport did, layering frameworks [4] for Motif-look-and-feel, hierarchical documents, large-scale rasters, multi-frame and network editing on top of the original <a href="UnidrawFramework.html">UnidrawFramework</a>.  Other parties (like VRweb) incorporated slightly modified copies of <a href="InterViews.html">InterViews</a> into their own software distributions, much like different Linux distributions do with Unix utilities.  This is a process open to all-comers, given the BSD style copyright permission notice, and represents a powerful approach to programmers concerned with access to the source where-ever they might need it (a feature of Fresco [2] as well, by the way.  It never went proprietary). -- <a href="ScottJohnston.html">ScottJohnston</a>
