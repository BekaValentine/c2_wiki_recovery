        Idempotent Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong>
        You have an operation that needs to be carried out
        (e.g., on a database, a configuration file, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong>
        The operation is one of a series that will be carried out.
        <em>Or:</em>
        The operation may be carried out incorrectly the first time, and may need to be fixed and re-done (e.g., installation in <a href="TestEnvironments.html">TestEnvironments</a> that may uncover defects).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>:
        Design the operation to be <em>idempotent</em>; that is, if it's carried out more than once, it's as if it was carried out just once.
      </p>
      <p>
        (You may remember from math courses that an
        <em>idempotent</em> function <em>f</em> is one where, for all values of <em>x</em>, <em>f(f(x))=f(x)</em>. (For example, the function that returns the absolute value of a number is idempotent.)

        "Sorry, once that's been done, we have to do all <em>this</em> stuff before we can do it again." (*sigh*)

        <strong>Related patterns</strong>:
        Most (all?) <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> is idempotent, but not all idempotent design is functional.

        <em>I think that's a bit ambiguous.  Are you talking about f(x) followed by f(x), in which the second function call must evaluate to the same as the first in a functional language, or are you talking about f(f(x))?  There's no reason why the latter should be true for arbitrary f, even in functional languages. </em> --<a href="JasonGrossman.html">JasonGrossman</a>
