        I am (Oct 2004) working at IBM as a <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> consultant, alongside <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>. I have a book, <a href="EnterpriseIntegrationPatterns.html">EnterpriseIntegrationPatterns</a>, co-authored with <a href="GregorHohpe.html">GregorHohpe</a>, in the <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> signature series. I'm also a co-author of the <a href="DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion.html">DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion</a>, have chapters in the four <a href="PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign.html">PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign</a> books, and have written several articles in <a href="DeveloperWorks.html">DeveloperWorks</a>, <a href="JavaDevelopersJournal.html">JavaDevelopersJournal</a>, and <a href="SmalltalkReport.html">SmalltalkReport</a>. And I chaired the <a href="PlopConference.html">PlopConference</a> in 1999. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:woolf@acm.org.">mailto:woolf@acm.org.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a new blog on <a href="DeveloperWorks.html">DeveloperWorks</a> at {1}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to IBM, I had a stent at the North Carolina Department of Transportation's I/T department, where I was reasonably successful in getting them to use the <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a>, JUnit (<a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> and <a href="JunitWithEclipse.html">JunitWithEclipse</a>), <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, and even some other <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> (XP) practices like <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>. But we did it all without management's knowledge, and from what I hear, it all fell apart after I left. I've worked as a consultant for Versata and their VIS (VersataInteractionServer) product, formally known as the <a href="VerveProduct.html">VerveProduct</a>, a product for modeling and running a <a href="WorkFlow.html">WorkFlow</a>. From April 2000-June 2001, I was at <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> Corp. as a Senior Architect and member of their <a href="AdvancedApplicationArchitectureTeam.html">AdvancedApplicationArchitectureTeam</a> (A3T) with <a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>, <a href="BruceWhitenack.html">BruceWhitenack</a>, and others. The team was developing collateral for <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>'s JavaSuccess site. While at <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>, I also become personally interested in <a href="LeaderShip.html">LeaderShip</a> issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, I contracted for almost a year at Interpath on the IPath project, also with <a href="BruceWhitenack.html">BruceWhitenack</a>. There I learned how to use the <a href="VerveProduct.html">VerveProduct</a>, a <a href="WorkFlow.html">WorkFlow</a> engine. Before that, I worked at <a href="SilverMark.html">SilverMark</a>, my last Smalltalk job. I ported their testing tool from <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> to <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a>. Before that, I was a consultant at <a href="KnowledgeSystemsCorporation.html">KnowledgeSystemsCorporation</a> (KSC) for five years, where I specialized in <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a>, <a href="EnvyDeveloper.html">EnvyDeveloper</a>, and design patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        My introduction to patterns came from <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> at OOPSLA '93. I remember that he was very excited about the concept but that I didn't understand what the big deal was. Sort of like the first time I heard about Smalltalk, actually. In both cases, I didn't really "get it" at first. My first tutelage in pattern writing came from <a href="KenAuer.html">KenAuer</a>. He was how I ended-up attending PLoP '94.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a> and I have written a <a href="SmalltalkGraphicsFramework.html">SmalltalkGraphicsFramework</a> tutorial. It draws heavily from the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> book. I have also written a tutorial on the <a href="ValueModel.html">ValueModel</a> hierarchy in <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> Smalltalk that draws heavily on the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> book. I've also presented a tutorial about patterns at Software Development East '96; it really stood out against all of the Windows '95 and Java tutorials!
        Bobby also was the shepherd for the pattern language that <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> wrote
        about <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a couple of chapters in the <a href="PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign.html">PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign</a> books: one on the <a href="ValueModel.html">ValueModel</a> framework {2} in PLoPD-1, one about <a href="EnvyDeveloper.html">EnvyDeveloper</a> {3} in PLoPD-2, and two chapters in PLoPD-3: The Null Object Pattern and The Type Object Pattern  (co-authored with <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>).
