        Html Is For Documents
      </h1>
      <p>
        Html Is mainly For Documents and nothing more.
        That's the way it is and was designed. It may contain simply hyperlinks which reference to other documents. Any attempt to make Html into a working "application" seems to produce either a failure, incomplete result, or a slow clunky result, due to the document design and origins of HTML.
