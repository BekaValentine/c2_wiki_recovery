        False Assertions And Unattractive Restrictions
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have started to find that models make assertions and announce restrictions (see <a href="DesigningVsModeling.html">DesigningVsModeling</a>).  Nowadays in my classes I test the students on their ability to see the false assertions and restrictions presented by the model.  Example of a false assertion, "a customer can only rent 1 tape at a time".  Example of a restriction, "we only track the latest rental of any customer or tape."  The difference is, that an assertion is non-negotiable, it is either right or wrong.  A restriction is negotiated.  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>
