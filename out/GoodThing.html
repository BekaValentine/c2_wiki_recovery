        c.f. 1066 And All That (Sellars and Yeatman), which used the capitalized phrase 'A Good Thing' to describe historical events which are universally accepted in schoolbook history as having a net positive effect. So, for example, the signing of the Magna Carta was A Good Thing.

        Some think that touches of beauty and pleasant fragrances like that of flowers are a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>. Not to mention BeesMakeHoney of it.

        Some question still exists whether it is possible for anyone to actually say whether a thing is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> or a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a> or even good or bad. This page is not about that. Try <a href="EverythingIsRelative.html">EverythingIsRelative</a>.

        Some are certain that they know whether a thing is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> or a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a> and are rarely troubled about having discriminations which identify things as good or bad. They usually are uncomplicated, simple and common people one usually can value as being one of their friends. They probably don't even consider that people have difficulty in knowing the difference, but may have trouble in choosing those they know are good, over the things they know are bad.

        Saying something is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>, is not the same as just saying it's a good thing. If something is a good thing that's a straightforward statement about its <em>relative merits</em>. If something is a Good Thing, that means that it has some sort of generally <em>recognised status</em> as being of accepted value or virtue. Its goodness is <em>part of a people's current values</em> and you'd be taking a fairly radical stance it you argued against it. - Or at least I think that's what it means.

        <em>Yes indeed! And the same Good Thing happened when we capitalized the "o" in "object", which is just a fancy word for "thing" when it comes right down to it. But on Wiki, the "init caps" status means something a little different, as it signals the advent of discussion (or, god help us, "dissertation") on the idea, something that happens far before the value or virtue of the idea has been exposed. -- </em><a href="WaldenMathews.html">WaldenMathews</a><em></em>

        Good as expressed in good thing means "acceptable", or also as opposed to an alternative "more fitting", and as such is based on the judgement of the one making the expression. As in: When someone who advocates the use of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> expressing the use of a particular method as a good thing, the meaning is that it fits the overall scheme. Those who judge the "goodness" or "badness" of the thing, do so more as acceptance or rejection of the overall scheme, the thing itself, and the expresser as well. This fits the sense expressed in <a href="EgoCentrism.html">EgoCentrism</a>.

        I think it is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> when we use <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> to express our current and personal judgement of a specific situation. <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> allows us to share our gut feeling instead of using our heads.

        A <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> might be "good" the first minute and a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a> the next. It's usually based on outcomes over time. <em></em><a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a> on Audiences and constituencies as well, as to how a Thing is viewed and valued. But such may say more of the nature of the Audience and Constituency than of the thing.

        Wasn't it <a href="WinnieThePooh.html">WinnieThePooh</a> who first used the phrase <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> with such overtones, or was it just the word good? -- <a href="AndrewCates.html">AndrewCates</a>

        Some <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>s are labeled <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>s by the recipient of a consideration, gift, or a courtesy. It may have been offered and done because the doer was able, willing, and of state of mind where such deeds were considered as the "thing one does". While the former values it as a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>, the latter may only consider it as a "thing to be done". An application of the golden rule where one does appropriate and thoughtful things for others because they are needed and the doer has the capability and resources to do it. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
