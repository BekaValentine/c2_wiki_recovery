        Hi,
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to my wiki home page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are my likes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="DigitalPhotography.html">DigitalPhotography</a><em>: I have always enjoyed analog photography, but digital adds more levels of control into the fray. Some aspects of analog photography as still superior to digital but for my purposes, they are minimized by the added value I get from digital realm. I enjoy being able to evaluate the images immediately (decide which shots are worth keeping while still with the subject.) I am able to pop off experimental shots with no worry about wasting film at 300+ shots on a 512meg card, I got lots of playing room. Editing the images in a computer is another big plus. This is nothing new, but we don't need a quality scanner to do this: the photo is already digital.</em>

           <em>DVD movies</em>: Although not really perfect, the format is much more pleasing than VHS. The commentary tracks are great and I think when properly done, really augment the experience. A great way to spend a few hours. I just wish they would tell you if FullFrame means PanAndScan or full negative. I find PanAndScan ugly, but full negative is still clear, but shows more of the image (than the cropped widescreen.)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Family time</em>: This is the most rewarding of all. I understand some folks give up the family time in order to pursue money or fame, but I don't believe that the returns truly offset the vacancy it creates. Humans are social creatures. Go figure.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Programming</em>: After working in the photography business and programming as a hobby, I turned it around. I now work as a programmer, and have photography as a hobby. Hey, much better pay! I've always enjoyed programming. The rush when the project gels is great.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Reading</em>: Nothing better than a book on the latest programming language. Seriously though, I do enjoy reading, but it seems I don't have enough time to do it. Sick days are great for reading...

        Here are my dislikes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           hatred:
        </li>
        <li>
           violence: both entries are largely detremental and do not add to the quality of life.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other toss away lists:
        Lots of folks add lists to their home pages. These are great for maintaining jumping off points to other Web sites that the author deems important. Not so here. My lists are just lists and not presented in any order other than stream of thought.
