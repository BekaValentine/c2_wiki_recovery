        On Holy Wars Anda Plea For Peace

        "ON HOLY WARS AND A PLEA FOR PEACE", Danny Cohen, 1 April 1980
        <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt.">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt.</a> An edited version appeared in IEEE Computer Magazine, October 1981.

        This very influential and amusing classic paper introduced the terms <a href="LittleEndian.html">LittleEndian</a> and <a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a> and urged people to stop fighting holy wars over which byte ordering was superior. It is still a must-read for anyone who ever has a reason to care about byte ordering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms big-endian and little-endian were borrowed from Swift's satire <em>Gulliver's Travels</em>, in which two countries went to war over the question of which end of a boiled egg should be eaten first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formerly <a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a> versus <a href="LittleEndian.html">LittleEndian</a> was the subject of many intense holy wars, which have calmed quite a bit in recent years.
