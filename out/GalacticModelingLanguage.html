        Galactic Modeling Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        The GML (<a href="GalacticModelingLanguage.html">GalacticModelingLanguage</a>) is a modeling language with three elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Box
        </li>
        <li>
           The Line
        </li>
        <li>
           The Label
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        GML diagrams mean what they mean when they are scribbled. The preferred GML <a href="CaseTool.html">CaseTool</a> is a hotel pen and a beer-stained cocktail napkin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proposed by Kent Beck, not entirely a joke. E.g. slashdot story <em>Is UML Really Necessary?</em> : 'A while ago I saw Kent Beck talk at the Java user's group meeting here in Seattle. Someone asked him about UML. He made a derisive noise and sneered that he had come up with a better version called GML, Galactic Modeling Language. He said (and I am paraphrasing here) that GML had three components "Boxes, Arrows and Arrows Pointing to Boxes". '

        <strong>Real Life:</strong>
        <em>(is stranger than fiction...)</em>
        I was working for a vice president of a large corporation who was putting a lot of pressure on this division to reduce paperwork - <strong>by reducing the number of forms</strong> used. Eventually, I got sick of the whole game and said, <strong><em>"OK, from now on we will have ONLY ONE FORM in this entire organization: A Lined Pad of Paper.</em></strong> If you want anything, like inventory parts, a PO, a sales order, etc, just write all the necessary information on it and give it to the appropriate person. There; done; one form."

        Most of the time, I use GML++ (Box, Label, Line and Arrow). I guess that makes me some kind of counter-revolutionary around here ;-). -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>
