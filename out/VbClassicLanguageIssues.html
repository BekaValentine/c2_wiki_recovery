           The lack of real OO encourages <a href="SpaghettiCode.html">SpaghettiCode</a> on a massive scale. Lots of plumbing code, redundancies, nested ifs and so on.
        </li>

        <em>Incorrect. The only part of OO that VB currently does not have is Implementation Inheritance. Most OO Gurus warn that Implementation Inheritance is vastly overrated and that most designs don't need it or need it on the scale that people think. Look at </em><a href="PeterCoad.html">PeterCoad</a> 's book on Java Modeling in Color, where he suggests different approaches. If you want, you can do it with Aggregation or Composition anyway like COM does. It's not in COM either for a very good reason. The <a href="FragileBaseClassProblem.html">FragileBaseClassProblem</a> is one big reason. As to the argument of being fully OO, you can ask 50 people for that definition and get 50 answers. Anyone can write <a href="SpaghettiCode.html">SpaghettiCode</a> in ANY language. You must apply discipline. Use what what VB gives you - class modules, structure your code well. My engineers are able to create fully OO VB components that are readable, maintainable, and not <a href="SpaghettiCode.html">SpaghettiCode</a> by applying these skills. I don't understand the remark of plumbing code because in my opinion, VB totally hides or eliminates the Windows plumbing code. If you are using a lot of nested ifs and so on, I would contend it's a bad design myself.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm happy with COM. I'm content that components oughtn't to inherit implementations. But I'm not content that within a component my classes can't inherit. Delegation in VB is clumsy and error prone. This plus the lack of generic types, except for the dreadful Variant, creates lots and lots of redundancy. The nested ifs caused by no lazy evaluation I believe you've conceded above. And by plumbing code I mean recordsets and so on - because it's difficult to leverage your own design abstractions, due to the lack of OO completeness, most of your implementations depend mostly on MS abstractions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last is good in some respects. It means an inexperienced programmer doesn't have to understand your design to maintain your code. But it's trouble on larger systems because it results in a lot of redundancy that's hard to maintain.

        I would like to see a specific example of lack of OO creating tangled code as the only option, although I may agree that VB's procedural tools are sometimes not as powerful as they could be and OO (or other changes) may offer a way around VB-specific limitations. -- top

        Actually the language is responsible for its "misuse." In general, a lot of VB code reminds me of C code. Unfortunately, the addition of OO capabilities to VB did not have as strong an influence on coding practices as the introduction of C++. Perhaps the changes chould have been advertised as VB++. VB does not strongly guide developers to use class structures and the result is many develop long, rambling functional novels. It is a valid expectation for a language to try and minimize poor usage. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

        Is there some reason they couldn't have used the same calling syntax? The only difference is that the one doesn't return a value, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A </em>'function<em>' returns a value.</em>
        <em>A </em>'subroutine<em>' does not.</em>

      </p>
      <p>
        Calling a function and accidentally ignoring the value is a common cause of error in C/C++ programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: <em>So you can't call a function like a subroutine in VB and ignore its return value?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Yes you can.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> is much more anal about forcing callers to use the return values of functions, and C/C++ now have "functions" that return "void" - making them, in effect, procedures, not functions. In VB, you can "Call" a function - ignoring the returned result. Try that in <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

      <p>
        I've been writing C for years and C++ for about a year, and I don't <strong>ever</strong> recall having a problem because I called a function and accidentally ignored the value. -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, it's been a common problem in C, as practically all I/O functions returned some kind of result indicating if they worked or not. On output, these were generally ignored. Like, how often do you check the return value of the printf function? -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I generally think of VB as a <strong>half-compiled and half-interpreted</strong> language. If you expect the compiler to flag everything, you will be disappointed, and missing return values is one of those things that has a foot in the dynamic floor. You mostly only find such problems when run-time behavior is not what you expected. However, some things are even looser than other interpreted languages, like unassigned variables being interpreted as null instead of an error (if Option Explicit isn't used). That one is inexcusable even for a dynamic language. -- top
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you forget to either assign a function value, or to use the word "call" in front of a procedure, you get no error or warning, but instead reference parameters just get passed by value. Is that inexplicable or what?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In C++ the compiler will catch you if you screw the syntax up - in VB you get no error, no warning, no nothing - all you get is a bug when your <a href="ByRef.html">ByRef</a> is magically and silently turned into a <a href="ByVal.html">ByVal</a>. At the very least Option Explicit should fix this behaviour. It doesn't.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Okay, it has no inheritance, and won't even let you fake it. But does its polymorphism have to be <em>so</em> lousy? I mean, if you implement the foo interface, which say has a method bar, your implementation can only offer this as Myclass.foo_bar >:-P
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>No: Your class offers it as foo.bar; a variable of type "foo" can hold a reference to your object, and call the method "bar." An internal implementation detail of your class is that the method name is called foo_bar, but caller's won't be calling your implementation class directly.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have Implementation Inheritance in every object oriented language, including Java. You don't have it in VB, ergo VB isn't OO. Let me tell you what I *really* want. I *really* want: OO.
        If VB is OO, then so are Fortran and Cobol. -- PM 
      </p>
      <p>
        What about the previous comments that "<em>There are many great arguments against implementation inheritance. Why did people leave it out of Java?</em> ???"
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        As to VB's exceptions, they seem much weaker than in any other modern language. How can an exception handler differentiate them by type?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(Right: Error handling, up to VB6 sux.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Um, how is it pilot error if a file can't be opened, a device can't be accessed, or some other typical exception occurs? Is everything in the world a pilot error now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, everything is not due to lack of VB development understanding. However, it seems that this topic has lots of references to the VB IDE crashing on exceptions as a rule and I say that this is *not* the case. There are rare cases when the VB IDE will crash while running problematic source in debug. For example, when you pass a ref to a bStr (</em><a href="ByRef.html">ByRef</a>) to an API function that expects a lpStr and you do not initialize the size of the bStr, you will get a crash of the IDE. I can only think of 2 other similar cases, anything else causing the IDE to crash is either a bug addressed by an SP, a bug in the CPU or a <a href="PilotError.html">PilotError</a> IMHO. Running VS6 SP3 on NT SP4 and not seeing any of the crashes that are plaguing some in this group tells me some in the group are doing something wrong.<em> -- Charlie Ferebee</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a single global error handling object is obscene. To create a large scale application you <strong>must</strong> have a published, coherent error handling strategy for each layer (or glob) of software. Because of VB's single global object, consistent error handling combined with the natural tendency to reduce duplicate code leads to bloat and hackery. To avoid duplicate code one tends to reuse error handling routines. If you do this in VB, when your call to the central error handling routine returns VB resets the global error object! This makes it impossible to do another common practice, rethrowing the error for a higher-level routine to catch. Since switching to a different group in my company I've been using VB exclusively. I feel dirty. To conform to the coding standards of this group and avoid code duplication, I've had to use a goto statement for the first time in 17 years. This language is a giant step backward.

        Let's face it, VB is a RAD tool. It should only be used for RAD projects, and making thin GUI layers on top of code written in other languages. Using VB for enterprise-scale projects is suicide.

      <p>
        <em>What exactly is an </em><a href="EnterpriseApplication.html">EnterpriseApplication</a> anyhow? I never get a good definition. The trick is to break it into smaller applications instead of try to make One Big Exe. One Big Exe is a design smell for almost any language for interactive apps.

           No lazy evaluation of conditionals. And, Or and IIf always evaluate all expressions, whether they need to or not. So instead of clear logic, you have nested ifs.

      <p>
        <em>(Maybe someday they'll learn... Sigh.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I wouldn't view lazy evaluations as a positive design choice. It tends to make code more fragile and too dependent upon intricate knowledge of the conditional evaluation sequence. Explicit code is always better than code relying on implicit knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, you can usually replace nested if statements with sequential else if statements with no associated processing. Often it is much clearer to state what you want to exclude from processing rather than what you want to include. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

        <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> has the same issue: No shortcut evaluation of AND/OR - you have to use nested conditions. This can be a real pain in loops. <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> does this to give the compiler more freedom to optimize expression evaluation; it may evaluate the two sides of an "AND" in any order it chooses. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        <em>VBScript is a SUBSET of VB, which requires late binding, which requires the Variant data type just likeother scripting languages use one or two types.

        Why is it impossible to implement a "Visual Basic" iterator <strong>in Visual Basic?</strong>
        (IE: To support "foreach item in X" syntax on a collection class you create, you have to build and return a Collection (or something written in C/C++), because Visual Basic can't "correctly" implement the "Item" method.)
        <em>[I think that's the method name. Please correct if I'm mistaken.]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The exact reason for the last question: </em>ActiveX implements what they call an "Enumerator" interface (which is really an Iterator) using a Magic DISPID on a member.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you could declare the DISPID for a member you could do a real Enumerator interface.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can set the DISPID for any method in VB. Simply write yourself a sub or function and then go to "Tools->Procedure Attributes" on the menu, click the "Advanced >>" button and look for the "Procedure ID" combo box. Select a well-known DISPID or type in your own if you like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now... the <strong>real</strong> reason you can't implement an enumerator in VB is because of the IEnumXXXX family of interfaces in COM. Automation enumerators, like the one used by the "For Each" syntax are based on IEnumVARIANT specifically, however others like IEnumString and IEnumUnknown exist as well. The IEnumXXXX family has four methods that look like any standard iterator, look it up in MsdnLibrary if you want more details. The quick explanation is, that these interfaces use advanced concepts in COM that <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, an Automation based language, is not capable of implementing.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, all that being said... most people who need to expose a custom collection from a <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> component usually write their own collection class, consisting of a <strong>typed</strong> <em>Item</em> property, the standard <em>Count</em> property, and then a hidden method usually called "_NewEnum" which they mark with the afformentioned procedure property editor as DISPID_NEWENUM or -4. Underneath these customized collection classes, they're really delegating the calls to a standard collection object. For example, suppose I were writing a collection class in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> which I wanted to hold humans. Well... I <em>hopefully</em> have defined a Human class somewhere and now I just define the following for the collection class:
