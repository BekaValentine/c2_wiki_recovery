        When we try to get things done, whether at our job or where we live, how it gets done and how we feel about it is determined by how we value it. 
      </p>

        Procrastination and lowered priorities are applied to the things we value less, or are tedious and unrewarding. Admit it, some of the our work is labor, and some is work we enjoy doing.
