        Personal Safety
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the seven properties of <a href="CrystalClear.html">CrystalClear</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Personal safety is being able to speak when something is bothering you, without fear of reprisal."
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        When searching for a new job, this is perhaps the hardest of the seven properties to evaluate. The others one can easily find out about in an interview. "How often do you get feedback from users?" is a relatively easy question to answer. Similarly, you can look at the office layout for signs of <a href="OsmoticCommunication.html">OsmoticCommunication</a>. But what do you ask or what do you look for in order to evaluate personal safety?

        Some ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Is it a tight-knit team?
        </li>
        <li>
           Does anyone complain about <em>X</em>? (<em>X</em> is some characteristic that is clearly suboptimal. For example, "Does anyone complain that engineers, marketing, and HR people all work in a single, open office area?")
        </li>
      </ul>
