        We got these practices, they do it all.<br/>
        Support many projects both big and small.<br/>
        We add hardly nothin to our kit of tools,<br/>
        Though our tools can do it, folks call us fools.<br/>

        There used to be a guy, used the name of Occam,<br/>
        Was into simple, said "Features, Foccam.<br/>
        Don't add new stuff until you need it,<br/>
        Gotta carry it around, write it up and feed it".<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The Occam dude he dead as nails,<br/>
        But his ideas live, we follow his trails.<br/>
        We see a new problem, we check our kit,<br/>
        Tool we got can do it, we go with it.<br/>

      <code>
        Idea's to have a kit that's light,<br/>
        Stay with what could work till that ain't right.<br/>
        Then add new stuff when you got a real need,<br/>
        That's the best way to go full speed.<br/>
