        <a href="MorituriTeSalutant.html">MorituriTeSalutant</a> is a Latin phrase which translates into English as "We who are about to die, salute you!".  This is what gladiators said to Caesar before fighting to the death.
        The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) also had a branch called the Weather Underground using force, up to and including bombing buildings; the more extreme of the Weather Underground were called Morituri.
