        Golden Ratio

      <p>
        The <a href="GoldenRatio.html">GoldenRatio</a> is
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the ratio (sqrt(5)+1)/2 : 1, which is approximately 1.61803398874989484820458683436564:1
        </li>
        <li>
           the limit of the ratio of successive terms of the <a href="FibonacciSequence.html">FibonacciSequence</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           the number that is least approximable by rationals
        </li>
        <li>
           found everywhere in nature, because of being difficult to approximate in rationals
        </li>
        <li>
           easily shown to be irrational
        </li>
        <li>
           the ratios between various segments of a pentagram
        </li>
        <li>
           the solution to the following question:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt>	 </dt>
        <dd>"What is the ratio between two quantities such that the whole is to the larger as the larger is to the smaller?"</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	 </dt>
        <dd>In symbols, (a+b):a = a:b.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>This has various simple geometrical interpretations, which explains why the OldGreeks liked it.</dd>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the square root of its increment (g^2 = g + 1)
        </li>
        <li>
           the inverse of its decrement (1/g = g - 1)
        </li>
      </ul>

        It is often called "phi" or "tau", depending on which side of the pond you are on. Note that 1/phi = phi-1, And there's this really nice series to o with integral powers of phi.

           <em>Can someone interpret this comment about the series for me? Thanks</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Perhaps it's that phi = sum phi^(-n) for n>=1
            </li>

        A rectangle that has sides in the <a href="GoldenRatio.html">GoldenRatio</a> was in the era before print and TV felt to be more pleasing to the eye than other ratios. The studies, however, generally compared 1:1 with 1:phi and 1:2, and people generally preferred the intermediate ratio. Later studies show that people can't really choose between 100:150, 100:155, 1:160, 1:165 and 1:170. The page at <a href="http://plus.maths.org/issue22/features/golden/">http://plus.maths.org/issue22/features/golden/</a> says a lot more about this.

        <em>I find that 1:sqrt(2) is pleasing, simply because I am accustomed to metric-sized paper. But when putting a JFrame on the screen, I always centre it horizontally and move it up the screen vertically by the golden ratio.</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        JFrame f = new MyJFrame();<br/>
        // initialize the content of f<br/>
        f.pack();<br/>
        Dimension d = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();<br/>
        f.setLocation((d.width-f.getWidth())/2,<br/>
        (d.height-f.getHeight()) * (1000-618) / 1000);<br/>

        <em>Phi is also the ratio of all voters to "No" voters, and of "No" voters to "Yes" voters in the recent Dutch referendum on the proposed EU Constitutional Treaty.</em>

        More pleasing, in the same sense that different musical modes instill different emotions.
