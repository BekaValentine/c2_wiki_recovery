      </ul>
      <p>
        Parts for Java is a Java IDE (I believe it was actually the first IDE for Java). It is an outgrowth of Visual Smalltalk and has tried to bring some of the features of the Smalltalk world to Java. Especially notable is the Class Master that allows one to browse classes much like in Smalltalk.
