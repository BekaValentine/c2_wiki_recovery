        I'm an OO Architect/Developer/Mentor who has really never done anything but OO. I've used Obj-C, C++, Smalltalk, Object Pascal, Object-Forth (Neon), CLOS and other OO systems. I have used and programmed OO systems since 1987. I am still the most amazed at Xerox's Analyst system. It was all written in Smalltalk and was done for the CIA. It does (it is still used last I heard) things that systems today don't do. It also has the most amazing information linkage system I've seen. Would love to get a copy of it some day.

        In my other life (not work), I like to do video editing on my Mac.
