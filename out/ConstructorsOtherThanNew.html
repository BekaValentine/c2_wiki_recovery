        Constructors Other Than New
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some programmers avoid "new" as a constructor name.
      </p>
      <p>
        What are some examples of how this can improve code?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           iterator := Iterator traversing: anArray.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>This one's not bad, though some would still consider naming it "newTraversing" to make it a bit more consistent.</dd>

      <ul>
        <li>
           ...
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>
           user := User instantiate: 214.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>

        <dd>Why throw away the existing habits of object-oriented programmers if you don't get any clear benefit?  I've heard it argued that you're not creating a "new" user, only "instantiating" one.  However, in this case, the one-line description of the "User" class would be something like, "Represents a user of the system".  So, you actually are creating a "new" representation of a user of the system.</dd>
