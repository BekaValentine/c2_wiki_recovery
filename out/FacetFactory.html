        One problem that comes from using the javamail API throughout<br/>
        is that it makes it difficult to innovate and optimize. For<br/>
        example, javamail does not provide an API to get the number of<br/>
        undeleted messages in a folder. This is a number we want to<br/>
        display in our UIs. We can't just add a new API to our<br/>
        subclasses of Folder, because we want to work with third-party<br/>
        implementations of Folder as well. And while it's possible to<br/>
        determine this number using the existing APIs, it is a very<br/>
        slow and expensive process to do so.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        To solve all this, we will define a FolderExtra interface.<br/>
        FolderExtra has all the extra APIs we need, like<br/>
        getUndeletedMessageCount(). Our implementations of Folder will<br/>
        also implement the FolderExtra class.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        When we have code (e.g., our UI code) that is given a Folder<br/>
        object and wants to call a method on FolderExtra, it gets a<br/>
        FolderExtra object by calling FolderExtraFactory.Get().<br/>
        FolderExtraFactory determines if the given Folder directly<br/>
        implements FolderExtra. If so, it returns that object. If not,<br/>
        it creates a new object which implements all the FolderExtra<br/>
        methods in terms of methods available on Folder.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        This all makes things a bit convoluted for callers. But it<br/>
        means we can use our fast code for our own Folders, and be<br/>
        assured that things will work (though slower) on Folders<br/>
        provided by other parties.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Similarly, there is a MessageExtra interface and a<br/>
        MessageExtraFactory. Other Extra interfaces will be invented<br/>
        as necessary.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        It would be nice if we could just use the pk.core.Supports<br/>
        interface for this kind of stuff. However, this strategy only<br/>
        makes sense if the base Folder object implements Supports.<br/>
        Since Supports is one of our own interfaces, and Folder comes<br/>
        from javasoft, I can't see this happening.<br/>

        <a href="FacetFactory.html">FacetFactory</a> was the best name I could think of; there may be a better or standard one.

        A facet is like an interface on an object, except it may actually be a different object that forwards to the real object. This is useful when you want to add an interface to an object, but can't because the implementation of the interface can't be added to the objects code, or because it has different identity semantics.

        See <a href="FacetFactory.html">FacetFactory</a> for a Java example.
