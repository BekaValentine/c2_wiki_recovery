        Gross Over Simplification
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>"Simpler, but no simpler"</em> --Einstein
      </p>
      <p>
        When you grossly oversimplify a matter, you are violating the "no simpler" part of the above quote from Einstein.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something should be simplified, but not simplified so much that it is too simple.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Examples of oversimplifying:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Programmer says</strong>: hey, we don't need a boolean in our programming language, we can just use 0 or 1 instead
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>True you could use 0 or 1 to emulate a boolean, but using 0 or 1 is too simple</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm not sure I have a problem with using 0 and 1. But this is probably not the topic to battle that out. -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Programmer says</strong>: we don't need a mouse, the keyboard is the way to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>True you could just get away with using a keyboard and no mouse, but mice have been proven to be extremely useful despite adding a slight bit more complexity to our computing experience.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I do think well-designed CUI's are more productive than GUI's for non-art/drafting uses. However, they take longer to master. -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Programmer says</strong>: command line is good enough for everything, gui's don't offer power
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>True you could just use a command line, but a GUI, although more complex, offers more power, not less. You can even use a console within your GUI, at least doubling your power.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Programmer says</strong>: let's just use xml we don't need a database for our banking system
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, you are probably going to need something a bit more sophisticated than simple XML for a banking system, sorry.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Creationist says</strong>: god created the world, the bible is the only absolute truth
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, we evolved, and it isn't that simple.</em>
