        Back Channel
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is basically communications carried on in the background about what is going on in the foreground.

           <em>Backchannel is the practice of using networked computers to maintain a real-time online conversation alongside live spoken remarks. The term was coined in the field of Linguistics to describe listeners' behaviours during verbal communication, Victor Yngve 1970.</em>

           <em>The term "backchannel" generally refers to online conversation about the topic or the speaker. Occasionally backchannel provides audience members a chance to fact-check the presentation.</em>

           <em>First growing in popularity at technology conferences, backchannel is increasingly a factor in education where </em><a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> connections and laptop computers allow students to use ordinary chat like IRC or AIM to actively communicate during class. More recently, researchers from Penn State University have explored bringing "backchannel" up front in classrooms using what they call "ClassCommons," to increase students' participation in large size classes.<em></em>

        It is kind of like <em>Tuning out to </em>TuneIn<em>. Something about what is said, or is happening triggers the mind into making enquiries or excursions away from the main reason for the present physical location of a hearer. </em>

        It is also like five people sitting at a lunch table, two of which are carrying on a conversation between them, while four are busy texting on their mobile devices. While they are physically together, they are (all but one) backchanneling.  (I observed this with a group of people at a museum at a lunchroom table). I now know what to call the behavior.

        It can also take place on chat channels about an online game the players and chatters are involved in. In effect the IM space in Audio and Video conferencing programs (either made part of the program, or being run on the side), are good examples. One such program is called Skype (over 17 million people are to be found using it at most times).
