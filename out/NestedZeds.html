        A pattern of fractally traversing a quadrant of a plane of integers such that the plane is equally divided into 4^n parts for integer values of n, like so:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           02 05 06 17 ...    
        </li>
        <li>
           04 07 08 19 ...
        </li>
        <li>
           10 13 14 25 ...
        </li>
        <li>
           12 15 16 27 ...
        </li>
        <li>
           34  etc ...
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Is there any good use for this, or is it just a cool pattern?  Does it already exist under another name?
      </p>

        <em>It looks like a </em>MortonOrder matrix to me. (Also known as Z-order, so you were thinking along the same lines as others.) When I was in graduate school, one of the professors was researching using the MortonOrder matrix representation to improve data locality. <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=379559">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=379559</a> --BrookeChenowethCreel<em></em>

        I use it for music notation, see <a href="SyntaxOfMusic.html">SyntaxOfMusic</a>.
