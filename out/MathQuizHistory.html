        <strong>Q1:</strong> What number is the first blank in the well-known sequence below?
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          , blank, blank, 120, blank, blank, 140, 144, blank, 150, ...
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>A1:</strong> The answer is 90. The numbers are generated by 180 - 360/n (where n takes the successive integer values 3, 4, 5, ...)
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Q2:</strong> Why is the sequence "well-known"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A2:</strong> Consider the simple regular polygons with n sides, where n = 3, 4, 5, etc. The number of degrees in the interior angle at a vertex is given by 180 - 360/n.

        Interesting challenge: how to communicate that you know without passing along valuable clues.  Hm... It involves something that you can do at the dinner table if you have enough silverware. --<a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>

        This is actually a topic in information theory, called Zero Knowledge Interactive Proof Systems. -- <a href="UncleMatt.html">UncleMatt</a>

        The classic solution is to code the answer in an anagram, like:
        "The angels of regal Ulys' pogon". Today, 
        we just give out a crypto hash of the correct answer. -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>

        It seems harder to give an good unhelpful hint than to solve the problem.  Here's a pretty obscure one. (two levels of indirection)  Teaspoon of water... -- <a href="MatthewWilbert.html">MatthewWilbert</a>  (This was intended to be decoded as TSPH2O, and then to
        Triangle,Square,Pentagon,Hexagon,Heptagon,Octagon.)

      <p>
        [Fair enough - but one level really - I had thought you were hinting at "n" as well ('an good' instead of 'a good') -- vk]

        For this type of answer, the subtlest hint that you've figured it out correctly suffices -- <a href="VickiKerr.html">VickiKerr</a> [<em>Get it?</em>]

        One of the tricky parts of Q2 is that not all of the <em>blank</em>s are integers, but since the problem involves a sequence, you are lulled into thinking that they are.
