                   <em>The same is not true for tacit knowledge: often, different communication means (from more traditional e-mail to blogs, wikis, etc.) are proposed as the only means to deal with this more problematic kind of knowledge. All these solutions support socialization, but they are usually proposed without taking the maturity level of the target community into due consideration [21].</em>

           <em>When referring to computational artifacts, context awareness means that artifacts are to some extent able to sense the context in which they are being used. The idea is that artifacts determine the actual context of their use in order to adapt their functionality accordingly</em>

                   <em>The idea of context-aware artifacts is that computational artifacts are able to recognize the context in which they are being used so that these artifacts are able to adapt their functionality to the respective context. Most work in developing context-aware artifacts appears to be technology-driven by which we mean that often the relation of the artifacts to the underlying concepts of context remain unclear.</em>

                   <em>look at the concept of context in context-aware artifacts from a cognition-oriented perspective ... for an explicit distinction between the concept of context that is operationalized and the original usage situation a social setting that has been negotiated among peers</em>
