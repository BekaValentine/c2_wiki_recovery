        Make Parameterization Possible
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's harder to write code that can be parameterized by data than it is to write straight procedural code.
      </p>
      <p>
        And after all <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Force all programmers to keep all persistent state in a <a href="NonPermutationDependent.html">NonPermutationDependent</a> format a.k.a XML. Force all classes to become purely reflective through the <a href="RestArchitecturalStyle.html">RestArchitecturalStyle</a>. Define straight procedural code as a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        From the tone, it is not clear whether this is intended to describe a pattern or an anti-pattern. Is this about parameterization, about XML, or about procedural code?  Exactly what is being recommended or derided here?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, and what's the big deal with </em><a href="PermutationDependent.html">PermutationDependent</a> data? Is that really the same thing as non-parameterizability?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a way, yes, but first you have to understand that <a href="DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing.html">DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OK, I understand that </em><a href="DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing.html">DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing</a>.  Now that I've completed the first step, would you please give step two (and preferably, the remaining steps as well)?  Can you provide an example demonstrating how <a href="NonPermutationDependent.html">NonPermutationDependent</a> persistence formats coupled with purely-reflective classes in the <a href="RestArchitecturalStyle.html">RestArchitecturalStyle</a> is better than whatever it is that you don't like--so much so that it is worth forcing all programmers to do it this way?<em></em>
