        Encapsulation For Dummies
      </h1>
      <p>
        While <a href="ObjectOrientedForDummies.html">ObjectOrientedForDummies</a> is a good summary of OO basics, you should be aware that its use of "encapsulation" is different from common industry practice. Common industry practice uses the term "encapsulation" to mean "separating interface from implementation and managing data access."

           <em>Hiding details and providing common interfaces is called encapsulation, which is an analogy from making an object look like it's covered by a capsule (the interface in this case). This allows two objects differing in internal representation but having the common interface interchangeably usable (called interchangeability). Interfaces also allow to facilitate the use of data structure and </em>'guard the state of the object from invalid inputs and modification of the structure<em>'.</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation,</a> emphasis mine)

        Far from being an "official" definition, I think the "FOLDOC" use simply mistaken. For example, the FOLDOC summary of the history of object oriented programming (<a href="http://www.nightflight.com/foldoc-bin/foldoc.cgi?object-oriented+programming)">http://www.nightflight.com/foldoc-bin/foldoc.cgi?object-oriented+programming)</a> jumps from SIMULA-67 to C++, while describing Smalltalk as "another popular object-oriented programming language" (though they do admit that it was "seminal").

        <dd><em>Also called "information hiding", this ensures that objects cannot change the internal state of other objects in unexpected ways; only the object's own internal methods are allowed to access its state. Each type of object exposes an interface to other objects that specifies how other objects may interact with it. Some languages relax this, allowing some direct access to object internals in a controlled way, and limiting the degree of abstraction.</em> ("Science Daily", <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/encyclopedia/Object_orientation)">http://www.sciencedaily.com/encyclopedia/Object_orientation)</a></dd>

        I think that the term FOLDOC (and apparently therefore Eric) was intermingling with "encapsulation" is "Abstraction". Let me start an <a href="AbstractionForDummies.html">AbstractionForDummies</a> page.

        The other side:
      </p>
      <p>
        It's possible to encapsulate (group) data structures with methods without hiding anything. Some languages have no visibility restrictions, yet they provide encapsulation. Keeping the terms encapsulation and data hiding distinct is useful, regardless of what some web sites say.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Some web sites"? The meaning of both "encapsulate" and "abstraction" are clear, the definitions are consistent and have been for two decades. The starting place for changing their meaning, if you choose to attempt that, should surely be the community in which they've been used for twenty years, as opposed to explanatory text for newcomers. No wonder there's so much confusion here on Wiki about "object-oriented" software, theory, and practice if even these kinds of elementary concepts are mangled. Why stop with "encapsulate" and "abstraction", lets argue about the meaning of "bit", "byte", "true", "false", and so on.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not trying to change the meaning of encapsulate. I'm trying to preserve the meaning I thought it always had. I think a lot of people are unclear about the distinction, but I don't think we should let go of it.
      </p>

        <em>Maybe it's time from you to start contributing to wiki with the willingness to learn. So far, you've shown an excessive willingness to "preserve" what you know.</em>

        What good will come from changing "encapsulation" to mean "data hiding"?

        The definition of encapsulate according to a dictionary is <em>"enclose in a capsule or other small container"</em>. This can be done through modules, nested procedures, closures, local variables, static variables... or even just a parameter to direct a method or procedure to do something different based on what the parameter is set to (hiding the intricate details in the method or procedure, i.e., putting it in a capsule). Don't believe the OOP hype; apply encapsulation to your programming no matter what paradigm(s) you use.
