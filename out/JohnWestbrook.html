        To me, being a software engineer means using the right tool for the job. This means knowing lots of languages, techniques, and methodologies. A carpenter doesn't always use all the tools in his toolbox, rather he uses the ones the job demands. And while he may be masterful at but a few, he is necessarily proficient at many.

        I have recently been introduced to <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>, and I am soaking it in. It's a great platform, and I love how highly specialized the language is, specifically how SQL is built in. I'm so sick of cating together strings in VBA. The closest I've seen in language specialization is <a href="AllaireColdFusion.html">AllaireColdFusion</a>, which is a great web application platform, but built on the client/server model, which isn't always what you need.
