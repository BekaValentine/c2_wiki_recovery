        Cost Of Capital
      </h1>
      <p>
        From <a href="LifeAsaBusiness.html">LifeAsaBusiness</a>. When a company's <a href="CostOfCapital.html">CostOfCapital</a> is low, it can afford to take on lower return projects, and therefore have more projects to choose.

        In many parts of the western society there has been a stockmarket boom (2003) which fueled a realestate boom. Unless there is a realestate bust (on similar scale to the boom) the long term effect is an increase in the cost of capital of running a business within the countries concerned. It will be devastating to jobs and tax base.
