        Lowest Common Denominator Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        When trying to build a generic interface over specific vendor products or standards, one sometimes is faced with a choice of going with a <a href="LowestCommonDenominatorInterface.html">LowestCommonDenominatorInterface</a> (stick with only features they all have in common), or to give in and go with vendor-specific features to get more features and power. Typical examples include RDBMS and GUI's. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To make such a decision, one must consider the probability of switching to another vendor. Principles such as <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a> and <a href="FutureDiscounting.html">FutureDiscounting</a> come into play.
