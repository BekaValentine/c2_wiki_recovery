        Reuse Granularity
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've noticed that the concept of granularity is important to ReUse. There seems to be a fundamental trade-off: the larger the size of the reusable components, the more difficult is the adapting process for a new usage, and it may not work at all because it's lacking some key abilities. However, the smaller the granularity, the more time is spent gluing the small parts together for usage. Finding the best balance takes skill and practice, as does related issues, like learning how to partition the parts for best reuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I've been leaning toward a smaller granularity. For one, it's a safer bet than do-it-all kits, but it also allows more experimentation, and thus learning what works best by trial-and-error.
