        The Full Monty
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TheFullMonty.html">TheFullMonty</a> refers to Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (leader of British troops in North Africa during WW2), and his insistence on having a full English breakfast wherever he was.

        <em>Any relation to the Katrina Hurricane FEMA guy who made sure he had a lunch rather than manage rescues?</em>

        I believe <a href="WinstonChurchill.html">WinstonChurchill</a> said: "Montgomery: In defeat indomitable, in victory insufferable."

        <a href="TheFullMonty.html">TheFullMonty</a> is also quite pervasive in the erotic media industry. It has a variety of meanings, depending on context ... but I suspect most are apparent without further explication here.

        The Full Monty movie is very funny where a group of men from Sheffield who are on the dole hit on the idea of stripping to make some money. Very, very funny.
