        <dd><em>Miranda was developed in 1985-86 by David Turner, and is now currently being marketed by Research Software Ltd. of England. Miranda was the successor to the functional languages SASL and KRC (also developed by David Turner). With Miranda, the main goal was to produce a commercial version of a standard non-strict purely functional language. To make Miranda commercially viable, the development environment had to be made very flexible and easy-to-use. </em></dd>
