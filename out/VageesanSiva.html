      </p>
      <p>
        we are considering using the wiki to partially replace our rather limited mail based communications system in our organisation [damnit i have only been using it for 12hours straight and i am already a <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        please visit our fledgling wiki @ <a href="http://www.espnow.com/wiki">http://www.espnow.com/wiki</a> and give us your opinions. dont forget to sign our Recent Visitors pages too. thanks ;)
