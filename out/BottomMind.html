        Bottom Mind

      <p>
        I am <a href="BottomMind.html">BottomMind</a>. I am a <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>, though I don't appreciate excessive drama.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sometimes preach bottom-up understanding of the machine, <a href="BottomUpDesign.html">BottomUpDesign</a>, DeepUnderstanding of the consequences of the <a href="VonNeumannArchitecture.html">VonNeumannArchitecture</a>, high levels of abstraction, and the consequences of an unmanaged memory model (PowerfulAtomics).
      </p>

        I demand <a href="RootAccess.html">RootAccess</a> to my development workstation. I will do what is necessary to get the job done, up to and including <a href="AspectOrientedTheHardWay.html">AspectOrientedTheHardWay</a>. I think at MultipleLayersOfAbstraction at the same time. I code in languages from <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> to DotNetFamily at will. I can and will use FunctionPointers and/or delegates. I am a <a href="ThreeStarProgrammer.html">ThreeStarProgrammer</a> (or worse) as need be.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a>. Get used to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        On occasion I am an electronics engineer, a firmware engineer, a mechanical engineer, a chief cook, and a bottle washer.

        I do what must be done to bring a product to life. It matters not to me whether the product is strictly software running on a conventional desktop machine or within a "normal" server environment, or if the product exists as a standalone device with its own internal power, mechanical systems, sensors, and computing environment. It's a product. It must be created from the ground up. Sometimes "ground" means an application framework, and sometimes it means a pile of dirt.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use the tools, techniques, and methodologies that I know work. I do research to find out what works in domains with which I am not familiar, and I try to bring that which has proven itself to me in the past into those domains. I am not blind to new approaches, nor do I stick with dead wood that won't work in a particular case.
