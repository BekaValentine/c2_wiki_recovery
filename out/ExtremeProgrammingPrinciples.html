        Extreme Programming Principles

      <p>
        <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> introduced the XP principles in his <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange.html">ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange</a> to help measure whether or not an adaptation to an <a href="ExtremeProgrammingPractice.html">ExtremeProgrammingPractice</a> is supporting the four <a href="ExtremeProgrammingValues.html">ExtremeProgrammingValues</a>.

        The hypothetical <a href="ProcessPrinciple.html">ProcessPrinciple</a>s that underlie XP's practices. With knowledge of the XP principles, we could scale XP to problems for which it wasn't designed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Possibilities:
      </p>
      <ul>

        An interesting idea. But maybe there are two sets of principles involved here.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The principles that were used to develop XP 
        </li>
        <li>
           The principles that underlie XP's practices (as stated above)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My votes for set 1 (i.e. methodology development principles):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DoWhatYouSaySayWhatYouDo.html">DoWhatYouSaySayWhatYouDo</a> - Say what you <em>really</em> do, then improve it.
        </li>
        <li>
           TurnAllTheKnobsToTen - If a little is good, a lot is better (See <a href="TurnAllTheKnobsToSeven.html">TurnAllTheKnobsToSeven</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ExtremeValues.html">ExtremeValues</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My votes for set 2 (i.e. software development principles):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DoWhatYouSaySayWhatYouDo.html">DoWhatYouSaySayWhatYouDo</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
           Fixed time increments
        </li>
        <li>
           Code always works 100%
          <ul>
            <li>
               Most important things first
            </li>
            <li>
               Keep the code clean
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        There is only one core principle underlying Extreme Programming that I can see:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The form and functionality of the program being developed should grow at the same rate as the programmer's and customer's understanding of the application.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The above principle is not expressed as clearly I would like it, but it will do for now.
