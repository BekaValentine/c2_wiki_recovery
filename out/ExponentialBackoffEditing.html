        Exponential Backoff Editing
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is my means to avoid <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s and saving my energy when cleaning up vandal attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will edit/correct/fix/undelete some attack on a page immediately. If it is repeated, I will wait a short time and clean up again, and so on, delaying by the next higher unit (second, minute, day, week) each time (roughly). 
      </p>
      <p>
        This has quite some advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It saves my energy (O(1) cost per attack, 1+1/2+1/4+...=2).
        </li>
        <li>
           It allows other <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s to fix it without getting in the way of each other too often.
        </li>
        <li>
           Assuming that the vandal is less dedicated to this wiki than I, I will undo his changes when he has left.
        </li>
        <li>
           If the vandal is dedicated, he has to look continuously for changes, whereas I have to do so seldom (O(n) cost for the vandal).
        </li>
        <li>
           I have time to reconsider my fix, whether it was warranted, what other <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> do about it.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Has anyone implemented <a href="ExponentialBackoffEditing.html">ExponentialBackoffEditing</a> in code for their wiki? This has the advantage of inhibiting <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s and uncontrolled <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> back-and-forths, but might also inhibit contributions from people who tend to immediately follow their posts with several <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a> corrections.
