        Ancient Programmer
      </h1>
      <p>
        In my book, an <a href="AncientProgrammer.html">AncientProgrammer</a> is one who can remember working in a commercial environment, where they had to manually type in the boot loader to start up the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You were able to use a keyboard? Luxury! In the old days, we had to enter the boot sequence using switches on the front panel.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You misunderstand - when I said "type" I meant from the front panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You had switches? Decadence! We had to rewire the main board.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Eee, tha were lucky. We used to <strong>dream</strong> of rewiring t'main board. (Still do in fact) <em>Actually this reminds me of a client I had years ago who wanted their PLP 11/70 entirely menu-driven. This included all system administration tasks, and system boot :(</em> -- RomanStawski

        Back in my day, you debugged with oil and a screwdriver.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Oil and screwdriver?? You lucky b*st*rds! All we had was goose grease and an axe!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wow! You're lucky to have such nice programming tools! All we had was a piece of chalk, and we had to write our programs on cave walls in unary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chalk! You had it good, we had to use our own blood. When we had it real good, we found a cave, but most of the time we had to write in the sand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cave? Unary?? Blood??? Writing!??? The Neanderthals evicted us from *our* cave; sent us back to the trees! Blood comes from using
        BleedingEdgeTechnology unary. Real men don't need no stinking 0's! Why <a href="WriteItOutLonghand.html">WriteItOutLonghand</a> when you have <a href="WordOfMouth.html">WordOfMouth</a>?

      <p>
        Numbers!?  Hmph. Try coding with bananas hanging upside down by your tail!

        In case you missed it, the above is no doubt inspired by a <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> skit in which four old men try to outdo each other's childhood poverty stories. The winner said he had to work 26 hours a day and pay his boss for permission to come to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The skit ends, "You try tellin' the young people of today that... and they won't believe you!"
      </p>

        I'm intrigued - just what sort of computers were you guys using - please do tell more? Also, do eXtreme Goose Greasers exist? Sounds messy, but fun (except for the goose, of course).
      </p>

        <em>Sounds like someone about my age - 38.  Wow - that's ancient!  Of course, there were younger folks in my high school programming class, so someone precocious 35 year olds might be able to make the same claims.</em>
