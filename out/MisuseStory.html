        Misuse Story
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is stolen from the title of a paper in a recent conference.
        The paper was about Misuse Cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="MisuseStory.html">MisuseStory</a> spells out what should be done if a user
        attempts to get into a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> but does something unexpected.
        It is a parallel concept to the UML/Objectory idea of an Extended Use Case.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: if the <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> is that the customer has asked to be able to
        input a number like 13 and get the square 169 back. Then a <a href="MisuseStory.html">MisuseStory</a>
        describes what to with input like "III" (output "IX"? reject with polite
        message? ). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The default is to treat misuse as erroneous.  However a system
        can get more useful by adding functionality to handle misuse cases.
        The resulting misuse story is just a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only value in the term Misuse Story is to encourage people to make
        systems that do not reject mistakes but do good things in return.
      </p>

        Compare with a <a href="UserAntiStory.html">UserAntiStory</a>.
