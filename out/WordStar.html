        Word Star

        Once the world's best and most popular word processors, released in 1979 by Micropro International Inc. It was later supplanted by <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a> which was undeniably the most popular until <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a> took over. I think many people still debate whether or not <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a> was actually better than <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a>, but I think tools like grammar checking make <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a> the clear winner (although, I should note that grammar checking was a third party package for many years).

        <em>Lest we forget, </em><a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> for CP/M would run in 48K on a 8080 and gave acceptable performance. On a PC it was fast.<em></em>

        I remember on DOS 3 it bypassed the floppy driver, spoke directly to the controller, and generally spaghettified your floppy if you made the slightest mistake. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        <em>It could process huge files long before anything else could because it kept most of the file on disk.</em>

        Nice feature. But other programs do that without bypassing the drivers.

        <strong>[inserted]</strong> As a reminder, there was SpellStar a spell checker (from MicroPro) and Grammatik (by another company) which provided grammar checking.  <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> could also be modified but it wasn't for the faint of heart. I wrote an article that described how to make patches to the print menu to add items specifically found on Epson printers. If you want to see "cool" consider downloading one of the Apple ][ emulators for PC's, loading Apple CP/M on it and running <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> under that. I've watched my dBASE II (CP/M) programs from some 15 or so years ago operating. It is almost scary. -- <a href="TomLeylan.html">TomLeylan</a>

        <strong>[also]</strong> <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> was the first program in whose manual I discovered an empty page on which appeared the words <em>This page unintentionally left blank</em>.

        I can't seem to learn <em>vi</em> now that I have notepad to fall back on ... but I still know the ctrl-k wordstar commands.

        If I remember correctly, the Wordstar "dot commands" are reminiscent of troff. (For example: ".ce" "centre line", ".." comment.) Not the first time I've seen the troff "dot commands" cloned in a wordprocessor. I believe Acornsoft's "View" did that too. --

        <em>Was </em><a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> the first software to use a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>?<em></em>

        Surely not. For instance, wasn't <a href="VisiCalc.html">VisiCalc</a> spelled that way too?
      </p>

        <em>Except that </em><a href="DanBricklin.html">DanBricklin</a> wrote <a href="VisiCalc.html">VisiCalc</a> after <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> was already on the market.<em></em>

        I guess they didn't want it to be called WordsTar

        IIRC, the most frequent operations were mapped to key combinations that involved the base keys asdf-jkl;, such as Ctrl-K-S and Ctrl-K-D. When you touch-type, these keys are your fingers default and starting positions, making these key combinations very convenient and fast, much more so than any function keys. Your Mileage May Have Varied :-) -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>

        Many editors appeared that used these Ctrl-K commands. E.g. the built-in editor of <a href="TurboPascal.html">TurboPascal</a> had <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> key bindings. <a href="JoesOwnEditor.html">JoesOwnEditor</a> and jed are two unix editors that come with <a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a> key bindings (but they can also both be configured to use Emacs key bindings). -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>
