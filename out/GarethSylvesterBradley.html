        Describe <a href="GarethSylvesterBradley.html">GarethSylvesterBradley</a> here.

        <em>(1998)</em> Well, that's me. (I'd really rather be GarethSB but wiki's hyperlink regexp doesn't like that as others already pointed out in <a href="WikiWikiSuggestions.html">WikiWikiSuggestions</a>.) It took at least an hour having first strayed from the web proper to Wiki to find (a) some real content, and (b) a vaguely appropriate place to add some of my own. :-)

      <p>
        A long long time ago, I used <a href="AdvSys.html">AdvSys</a> to author adventure games or what might now be called <a href="InteractiveFiction.html">InteractiveFiction</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm programmer with patterns (see <a href="PatternIndex.html">PatternIndex</a>) and an XpApprentice. My software development homes are in C++ and Java but I have made excursions in SQL and perl, and stop-overs wherever necessary; recently <em>(in 1998!)</em> prolog, lisp and 8051. There were encounters with ML <em>-- ML is fun --</em> and Modula-3 along the way.

      <p>
        At the moment <em>(2002!)</em> I work for Sony Broadcast & Professional Research Labs -- <a href="http://www.sony-bplabs.com">http://www.sony-bplabs.com</a> -- doing fun stuff with emerging metadata standards and technologies for the broadcast industry. <a href="CodeGeneration.html">CodeGeneration</a> using <a href="XmlSchema.html">XmlSchema</a> is the current thing. Some of the time, <a href="DuncanMcGregor.html">DuncanMcGregor</a> hangs around at Sony too.

        <em>(2000)</em> Well what directed me back here was finding <a href="OliBye.html">OliBye</a>'s cool <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a> at <a href="http://www.xpdeveloper.com/.">http://www.xpdeveloper.com/.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(2002)</em> And now I'm playing with JSPWiki -- <a href="http://www.ecyrd.com/JSPWiki/">http://www.ecyrd.com/JSPWiki/</a> -- <a href="WikiAsIntranet.html">WikiAsIntranet</a>.
