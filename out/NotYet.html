        The answer to the question, "When should I optimize?"

        <strong><em>Cute. Wrong, but cute.</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's always someone who doesn't like cute, pithy answers because they're not 100% correct.  However, for the 99% of programmers who optimize prematurely, this is the correct answer to the question.

        <em>I didn't say I didn't like it, I said it was wrong. Either that, or there is a stage of some projects that should be called "</em><a href="NotYet.html">NotYet</a>".<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you aren't yet forced by some requirements to optimize (which the question "When should I optimize?" seems to imply), it is likely that the project is in the "<a href="NotYet.html">NotYet</a>"-stage, isn't it?

        "You have to denormalize the database and store everything as XML files" the expensive consultant said, "because this is a 'high visibility' project and performance will be crucial!!!"

        "Look," I said, "according to the numbers I'm looking at, we expect a few thousand transactions <strong>a day</strong> of a few dozen records each and a required turnaround time of 60 seconds.
        I think Oracle can handle it.  Where's your evidence that it won't?"

        <em>Tell ya' what:  Let's just run it on the fraction of the data we have now, and see if it takes more than a second or two to run a transaction; then we can talk about it.</em>
