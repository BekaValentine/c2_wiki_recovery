        I'm just another software engineer. I live in <a href="FinlandEurope.html">FinlandEurope</a>. I've written quite a bit of Haskell and C++ code in the past 10 years or so. I'm not sure much of it is very useful though, the current situation seems to be that I have many unfinished pieces of code that do not do much. But I'm slowly working towards getting actually something useful.
        I actually do have quite ambitious plans, but as said, it's unfinished.
