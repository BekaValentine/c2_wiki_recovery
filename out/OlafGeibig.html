        My love for computing began back in the 80ies when I was a kid of 14 years. I found out about a lonely apple II computer at school. My first computer was a Sinclair ZX81, followed by an Atari 800 and a C-64 (assembler and basic). In 1987 I got into more serious programming with the Atari ST (Modula 2 and C). I bought my first PC in 1994 on which I made my first steps with Linux (kernel 1.0). I started with OO and Java in 1996. I've worked as an employee for several companies in Germany and as a freelancer, usually as java developer.

        I'm a huge fan of testing and continous integration. Recently I became very interested in the new languages which could replace or at least complement java: scala, clojure, groovy, erlang. It's a fact that future apps have to be highly concurrent and I want to be prepared.
