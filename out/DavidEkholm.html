        FeelTheBase is a great utility that can be used as a colorpicker, numberbase converter etc.
        FeelTheBase is written by <a href="DavidEkholm.html">DavidEkholm</a>, this is how the he describe the tool:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Have you ever searched for the <a href="AsciiCode.html">AsciiCode</a> of some special character or vice versa? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Are you tired of using a calculator to convert numbers between decimal, hexadecimal and binary bases? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Do you want to pick a specific color on screen? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Do you work a lot with IP addresses and net masks? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Do you want to improve your "feel" for how numbers are handled inside the computer? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If so, you need FeelTheBase. This utility handles numbers in decimal, hexadecimal, binary, text and IP address form simultaneously. A change to any type of number is immediately reflected in its other forms with a mouseclick or return press. It's also a color picker. Grab any color on screen and see it's numeric form.
