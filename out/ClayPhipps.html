      <p>
        <a href="ClayPhipps.html">ClayPhipps</a> is the webmaster for Upwelling (dot) org (<em>indeed he was, but other priorities intervened, and the domain got squatted in the interim.  Sigh</em>).
      </p>
      <p>
        His formal academic background is in the design and implementation of programming languages. He has developed, maintained - or participated in the development team - for

      <ul>
        <li>
           3 Pascal compilers (<a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>), including 2 heavily extended to support system programming on superminicomputers;
        </li>
        <li>
           1 C compiler (<a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>);
        </li>
        <li>
           1 FORTRAN-77 compiler optimizer (<a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>) for a CDC (<a href="ControlData.html">ControlData</a>) vector-processing mainframe;
        </li>
        <li>
           1 set of assembler macros to allow PL/I programs to transparently call <a href="InternationalBusinessMachines.html">InternationalBusinessMachines</a> S/360 (<a href="IbmSystemThreeSixty.html">IbmSystemThreeSixty</a>) Assembler H code;
        </li>
        <li>
           1 heavily used subset of C low-level library routines to schedule them for pipelining by a high-performance microprocessor;
        </li>
        <li>
           1 object-code optimizer (i.e.: an optimizer whose <em>input</em> is object-code), to circumvent the high-overhead procedure-call instruction on the CDC Cyber 180 (<a href="CdcCyber.html">CdcCyber</a>); and
        </li>
        <li>
           1 <em>awk</em> emulator (<a href="AwkLanguage.html">AwkLanguage</a>) in C, to dramatically speed up a simulator for a high-performance microprocessor.
        </li>
      </ul>

        He was an official <em>observer</em> for the Joint X3J9/IEEE P770 Pascal Standards Committee (<a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>) and the X3J2 BASIC Standards Committee (<a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a>).

        Here on the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, he was initially focused on elaborating pages on a few programming languages.  But shortly, there seemed a need to create (new) pages related to various computer manufacturers.  Although that effort evoked at least 1 (anonymous) inquiry, he focused for a while on them because their identity seemed <em>relevant</em>, e.g.: for hardware features that compilers were designed to showcase, or for programming languages unique to them, or for the popularity of particular programming languages within various manufacturers' user communities. --C.P.
