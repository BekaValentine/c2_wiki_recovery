        Does anyone around here use this? We're assesing it right now, and it's not clear to us when the refactorings made on the UML view (we're using the tool stand-alone) get put back into the source files. Does this just take a long time and happen slightly randomly, or what?

        I use it under JBuilder6, but not the UML views.  JBuilder6 includes a couple of useful refactorings as part of its but JRefactory includes several more.  A quick attempt at using the UML view to do a Rename Class worked fine. Of course, if you're looking to report a problem, this wiki probably isn't as effective a place as the jrefactory project's bug tracking area on sourceforge. --<a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

        Sure, sure. But before we think about reporting a defect it's not unreasonable to enquire here what other users experiences might be, right?  <em>true</em>
