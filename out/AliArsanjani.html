        I am a Senior I/T Architect with IBM Global Services where I lead the Component-based Development and Integration competency for the National Center of Competency. I also enjoy teaching computer science; focusing on software engineering, framework development, components and patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have extended current object-oriented methods to handle component-based and recently, service-oriented software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have developed <a href="VariationOrientedDesign.html">VariationOrientedDesign</a>, <a href="GrammarOrientedObjectDesign.html">GrammarOrientedObjectDesign</a> that help build reliable component-based software architectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patterns and Pattern Languages I have been working on include:
      </p>
      <p>
        RulePatternLanguage
        Patterns for ComponentBasedDevelopmentAndIntegration
        Patterns for SymmetryInSoftwareArchitecture
        PatternsForGrammarOrientedObjectDesign
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a> is another area of interest.

        Hi Ali. I hope you come back here often to give tutorials on <a href="WhatIsSoa.html">WhatIsSoa</a>. The more I read, the more I get confused (yes ZapThink and others have issued warnings about that confusion). -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a> Nov05
