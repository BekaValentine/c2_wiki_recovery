        Uncle Charlie
      </h1>
      <p>
        Common affectionate name for <a href="KarlMarx.html">KarlMarx</a> by Marxist and post- (as opposed to anti-) Marxist thinkers and theoreticians. Uncle Charlie can be a bad-tempered, ornery son of a gun with some views that are nowadays considered hopelessly out of date, politically incorrect or just plain wrong, but he still retains the power to surprise you with unexpectedly useful or contemporary insights like <a href="GeneralIntellect.html">GeneralIntellect</a>.

      <p>
        <em>Coincidentally, "Charlie" was also the nickname given to the Viet Cong by American soldiers during the </em><a href="VietnamWar.html">VietnamWar</a>.  That name doesn't derive from any reference to <a href="KarlMarx.html">KarlMarx</a>, instead it is a shortened form of "Victor Charlie", which is how "VC" was in pronounced in the well-known <a href="PhoneticAlphabet.html">PhoneticAlphabet</a> used by (among many others) the US military.<em></em>

        Note that <a href="UncleCharlie.html">UncleCharlie</a> and <a href="UncleSam.html">UncleSam</a> often fight over gas money.
