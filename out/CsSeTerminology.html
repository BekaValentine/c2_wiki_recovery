        What is <em>computer science</em>? What does it mean to have a <em>science</em> about man-made artifacts? We might as well have <em>automotive science</em> in our universities. (See also: <a href="DisciplineEnvy.html">DisciplineEnvy</a>)

           No, we have Physics which encompasses automotive science. We have <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> to define a <a href="PhysicsOfInformation.html">PhysicsOfInformation</a>.

        Computer science, as it is taught today, is a subdiscipline of mathematics. It should really be called <em>computational mathematics.</em>

        <em>Yes, change the name and everything will be suddenly better. The truth is we do not have enough knowledge about how to develop software programs and are only slowly learning as time goes on. Call the programs whatever you will, but the fact remains, the people graduating from colleges are quite unprepared to do professional-grade programming.</em>

        This is not only my observation. I think I remember (and I could be wrong) that the creator of the first CS program stated publicly a while back that they made a mistake in calling it CS (this could be through CACM... I'll check if I get a chance). Is it any wonder that software engineering is being taught and advanced more by practitioners than the academy these days? I'm not complaining. I tend to feel that it should be this way, but it is a crying shame that architecture and design have been weighted so slightly against computational theory. Especially when CS is the only prevalent academic opportunity for future developers. -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

        People graduating without being prepared to do professional-grade work is <strong>far</strong> from being restricted to computer science.
