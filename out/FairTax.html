        Fair Tax
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Fair Tax is a bill (HR 2525) before the UnitedStatesCongress to switch from an IncomeTax to a national SalesTax. The official site is <a href="http://www.fairtax.org.">http://www.fairtax.org.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="FairTax.html">FairTax</a> eliminates IncomeTax, CorporateIncomeTax and PayrollTax and replaces them with a single 23% national ConsumptionTax. It also repeals the 16th Amendment legalizing income taxes in the first place. It is important to note that the <a href="FairTax.html">FairTax</a> will not affect American Federal government spending in any way. The <a href="FairTax.html">FairTax</a> is completely revenue neutral. i.e. no Federal expenditure need be cut as a result of this bill (including Social Security, Medicare, welfare, defense, etc).
