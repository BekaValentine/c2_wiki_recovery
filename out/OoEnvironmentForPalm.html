        I posted to <em></em><a href="news:comp.sys.palmtops.pilot''">news:comp.sys.palmtops.pilot''</a> [old] about an OO environment for the 3Com Palm. I would really like to sketch out and test solutions on my palm. Something like smalltalk would be ideal, but it has to fit on 2 Mb space, with a maximum 64 Kb guaranteed contiguous memory, and a processor which runs at around 20 Mhz (I think).
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming that it is possible to create a rapid prototyping OO environment on such a small footprint, what would it look like? How would it work?

        One language that hasn't been mentioned so far is LUA. It seems to be a lot like Python in some respects (late-binding, scripting), except that it has much less extensive libraries and is not quite as object-oriented. It seems to be popular as an embedded scripting language in the game programming community largely because its libraries and engine have a much smaller footprint than python.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I bring it up is that, while no one was looking, it seems like they have already achieved the holy grail - a Palm runtime and a basic Palm IDE. have a look at the PLUA project here: <a href="http://netpage.em.com.br/mmand/plua.htm">http://netpage.em.com.br/mmand/plua.htm</a>

        I have no experience of smalltalk, but I've had a rummage around the source code for <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a>, and got the <a href="BlueBook.html">BlueBook</a> from the library. In short, smalltalk is _way_ too big. But I think the environment would have to be smalltalk-like. <em>Actually, there is a small talk for the Palm. Development happens on the PC, but still, it executes as interpreted smalltalk on the Palm.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Forth is very small and fast. Would OO work with a stack-based system? I guess messages would have to be objects then, are they objects in smalltalk?
      </p>
      <p>
        But I digress. I don't intend for this to be a QnA session for my benefit. Is anybody else interested in discussing how small we could push an OO environment that is still effective, accessible?

        This is a <em>working</em> Smalltalk <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> for the Pilot. I wrote a little program that did a fair amount of stuff, it worked fine first time in an executable of around 30k (image and VM!). Warning: as the author warns, this is a work in progress, so no graphics yet and it did nuke my Pilot when I created around 1000 objects...

        <strong>Original Posting</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have read several posts referring to the possibility of having Java, or at least a <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a>, on the Palm. While I'm sure this would be really useful (I'm a programmer myself), I do wonder whether this is going slightly against the ethos of the Palm. I'll try to explain what I mean by that - I'm a bit of a palm newbie so feel free to correct me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see the Palm as an entirely different creature from palm-sized PCs, and I want to see continual improvements in the technology and the applications that are available, I don't see desktop PC emulation as a holy grail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applying this to my particular area of interest, I wonder whether we should think about a development environment which would suit the Palm, rather than  try to twist the Palm's spec to run an existing environment which was designed for a much larger machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use my palm to take down small notes quickly, to sketch out ideas while I'm on the hoof, and so on. Following that train of thought, I guess I would like a development environment that would allow me to sketch out solutions, data models, and even at a lower level, specific algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smalltalk would seem to be ideal for this, but from what little I have read, it would be difficult to implement. In fact, looking back at my argument above, implementing smalltalk, or at least Smalltalk-80, would be just as invalid as implementing Java, <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why am I saying all this? Well, I would like to have a go at developing an OO environment for the palm. I don't know how feasible this is, but I think it's worth looking into, and throwing a few ideas around. If anybody else is interested I can set up a mailing list and/or a website, and we can start talking.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I would personally be very interested in doing something like this, especially if it were possible to get a Smalltalk subset up on the machine. I am more interested in having the environment than in building it: it sounds like the same is true for you. In any case, I'm interested if we can get a virtual team together. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Not at all, I'm very much interested in building it! But I am aware that I'm not an expert in: compilers, smalltalk, porting, low-level coding and probably other areas too. I don't plan to let that distract me - I have the most fun when I'm learning new stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        But regardless of who codes the environment, I think it is really important to investigate it at a conceptual level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every Saturday morning, I get up early because I know I will be able to work (something to do with <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a>). With the Palm I can walk around the house, make coffee and still take notes - sometimes perching in the kitchen, sometimes leaning on the window ledge. With that in mind, my personal preference would be for the environment to support the coding equivalent of hand-waving arguments.

        Here's how to find the interface you want. First learn Smalltalk. Then find a friend that also knows Smalltalk. The two of you take a long road trip ... say, across North America and back. You drive, and while you do, dictate an interesting program to your friend who runs it on a laptop. On the way back home, you program some more. But this time, pay careful attention to what you say. That is your programming environment. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        One of my complaints about some 'modern' programming environments is that they violate flow, forcing me out of the meta-level ("Put some guards around this") and into the syntax ("Why didn't that line turn green when I typed it?") prematurely. For me, a great programming environment for the Palm would allow sketches and <a href="PseudoCode.html">PseudoCode</a>. I want to be able to save something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (index is out of bounds)<br/>
        [  throw appropriate subscript exception]<br/>
        else [ do actual processing]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        without officious warnings that "This code won't compile!". I know it won't compile. It's an idea, not a source file. I'll turn it into working code after I've debugged the idea.

        do:[:element | element processNormally]<br/>
      </code>

           It should have as little syntax as possible. Writing Lisp code would be awful on a Palm, because the added time to write the parentheses (two strokes) would get in the way of the idea.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Is <a href="PalmGraffiti.html">PalmGraffiti</a> really fast enough to think in? When I type, I don't need to think about individual keystrokes - I touch type, and how to do it is down in my fingertips. Graffiti still takes longer - I have to think about letter shapes which distracts from thinking about the larger ideas. Perhaps I just need more practice?

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What is the coding equivalent of a hand-waving argument, anyway? Ward may be close - I can envision saying something pretty generic and having another experienced programmer turn it into real code and giving me real feedback. I'm less sure about how to write a program that would make it easy to organize my thoughts so I could turn them into code later. Perhaps one of the outliner programs (none of which I've used) as long as I could attach pictures right into the outline, since I can often think about a problem better as long as I have a picture of it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Yes, <a href="PalmGraffiti.html">PalmGraffiti</a> takes longer, but I'm hoping that it will become more intuitive for me over time. Still, it will greatly influence the syntax of any input. If the underlying OO model is simple enough, there is no reason why the system should not support different styles of input (other than memory limitations).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I would like to be able to sketch out a skeleton of a class using a simplified OMT/UML tool, and fill the implementation of the methods in later. That would give the system enough information to see which methods were being selected, and so on.

      </ul>
      <p>
        I've developed a simple version of Wiki for the Palm, and I plan to add support for annotated diagrams, outline lists, OMT diagrams. Actually, the plan is to have a simple API to allow anybody to add new functionality. I see no reason why a system like this could not be hooked into the OO environment. Ward's <a href="HyperPerl.html">HyperPerl</a> springs to mind, though I am perhaps becoming a tad too adventurous.

        << The <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> is very small and fast. Would OO work with a stack-based system? >> Getting back to an early question - I love the concept of Forth and think it is a good candidate for the Palm. I'd be interested in a discussion of Forth implementing the virtual machine for Smalltalk, or a similar OO environment. I think of Forth as a one-address machine (there was an article about this in a SIGPLAN some years ago, called, The Ultimate Risc Machine) rather than so much as a stack machine. The only bad bit is Smalltalk's use of returns out of a blocks, which causes things to stay around and exit not in stack sequence. Perhaps someone else has an idea for an alternative with better stack behavior. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Neon and Actor were stack-based, threaded-code, OO languages for the Mac. Neon came first and even used post-fix notation like Forth. But apparently it looked too alien to sell. So they developed Actor which used a more standard, "Pascal-like" syntax. (That's how it was typically described as Pascal was a biggie on the Mac in those days.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently, Neon is still around and being maintained but under a different name for legal reasons. Off hand, I don't recall the name, but if there is interest I could dig it up.

        You may consider defining a language/environment with the palm constraints in mind. For example, any language syntax should be abbreviated (2 characters per keyword?) since handwriting is slower and the screen is small. Also, reduce or eliminate punctuation for language syntax since this is more difficult to enter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the language should convert easily into traditional languages (so the models you create aren't throwaways). I've done a little Palm programming using gcc in Windows if you want some help.

        Heehee, that would be fun. Though, the copious free time I was planning to spend on seems to have evaporated when I wasn't looking.

        I've been thinking about the Palm development environment a lot. I've been looking at pilotFORTH and PocketC, which has been enlightening. Here's a start for a wish list.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, if a written language is chosen, the syntax should be primarily alphanumeric (since this is the easiest to type). Punctuation, if any, should be limited to simple characters (".",",","/","\"). Since the screen is sooo small, the keywords should have single letter abbreviations. This limits you to 26 keywords, but I'm not sure this is a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my testing of ideas/algorithms, I would want single inheritance, polymorphism, recursion (both direct and indirect), and dynamic memory allocation. Some package mechanism would be nice for reducing collisions in the namespace.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the limited speed of the Pilot, I would suggest having the language compiled rather than interpreted, smart recompilation based on time/date to reduce compilation time, and easy embedding of assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The machine isn't that bad at interpreted code. For one thing, it doesn't have to spend as much time minding other things like a complex </em><a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a>, or background tasks.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, it would be nice to be able to create free-standing executables.

        IMHO, the principal advantage of the <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a> is that the software is designed for its purpose rather than trying to shoehorn a desktop OS into a palm-sized device. Just look at the fact that <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> has no apparent "file system". On a device that has no disks it doesn't make sense to save your work to a file. This is the principal reason why the device is so cheap and easy to use.

      <p>
        The odds are against file-oriented languages. (Think about "CLASSPATH", "cout", and "#include...") The Smalltalk "image" concept looks more appropriate.

        Having said that I agree that file oriented programs on the PP don't make a lot of sense (although PocketC is probably the most popular on-Palm development language, and that's file based), and despite what I said about C++ above my first significant PP programs will probably be in <a href="PocketSmalltalk.html">PocketSmalltalk</a>. -- pth

        I'm not so bothered about an OO environment for developing on the palm - what I'd like is a component model for the palm. Here are some things that'd be worth investigating:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Shared functionality and access to common abstractions from different palm applications
        </li>
        <li>
           Form-based "controls" for entering new data types, shared between different applications
        </li>
        <li>
           Installation of palm-based "components" via the conduit
        </li>
        <li>
           Perhaps it might be possible to keep proxies of palm objects in a desk-bound environment and to do queuing and forwarding of messages to the ultimate targets on the device.
        </li>
        <li>
           Connectivity between palm-based components and the usual suspects (CORBA, <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a>, COM...)
        </li>
      </ul>

        I looked at the book 'Object Oriented Forth'. It requires some extensions to the Forth language itself not available in all Forth implementations, at least not in <a href="QuartusForth.html">QuartusForth</a> the best Forth going on the Palm. I still believe that one could get an object language going on top of Forth, someone pointed us to some OO extensions above, but I also believe it is a moot point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of special note is <a href="LispMe.html">LispMe</a>, which others have also pointed out. I looked into it and found it to be a moderately mature environment that runs entirely on the Palm. Some of the environment that makes Lisp and Smalltalk so productive is there. It also has some features which make it very well suited to taping out a quick algorithm on your Palm and running it. I created a simple object environment called <a href="LispMeObjects.html">LispMeObjects</a> for a project I am working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably the most likely OO environment in the long run will be Python. Pippy is working in a limited capacity now and should become more robust over time. The Pippy folks seem to be working to give it an on-board development environment like <a href="LispMe.html">LispMe</a>. You could then add modules by cross compiling from the desktop or you could experiment with code on board, that would be perfect. -- <a href="DonWells.html">DonWells</a>

        I really like the idea of a UML notepad for analysis and design work. It should have an ability to export to the Memo Pad in XML so it can be manipulated later for input into Rose, or whatever. Something simple at first with, say, use-case, class and activity diagrams, and then getting into behavioural modelling with sequence and state diagrams and beyond.

        I would suggest as a first step that someone comes up with a Pilot simulator. The manufacturer probably already has one that is an environment running on a PC that fully simulates the Pilot's native language, but with single stepping, interactive debugging, etc. A nice little unit test framework for this environment would be good too. A Pilot assembler comes next if one does not already exist. Perhaps a Forth implementation comes after that (Forth needs an assembler to implement some of the Forth language itself). (I recommend Forth because it is designed specifically for stuffing 10 pounds of software into a 5 pound processor.) Now you are ready to implement an OO VM of some sort (the primitives). Hopefully not Java, but something interpreted like Forth itself, logo, lisp or Smalltalk. Next comes the development environment, but it needs to be small so that the source code for the environment is available within the environment or the source code is interpreted directly so it is resident. Logo is a source code resident language as I recall. I believe Forth can be decompiled giving an intermediate solution. I have a book called Object Oriented Forth at home I will try to remember to look it up.-- <a href="DonWells.html">DonWells</a>

        I believe there is more than one place where researchers are porting a small implementation of Java to the Palm platform. I haven't heard of an OOP development environment though.

        What measure of efficiency? Space-efficient is needed. Speed efficiency often isn't.

      </p>

        For space efficiency, a byte- or threaded- code language might well win, especially if the support library is small and shareable between applications. For standalone applications, C or assembler probably win on space -- pth

        Seen it. I don't agree with the premise behind Ron's sarcasm. I'll try again: In my view, the context of development of applications for a <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a> is different enough that many of the purported disadvantages of C++ in other contexts either don't apply or are weakened to the point that C++ is a reasonable choice as an OO development environment. That context includes:

        <li>
           Programs are of limited functionality and so...

           Programs are often of limited complexity

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Space is limited, but programs are small (because of the above), so fixed overhead is more important than "code bloat" (whether the memo pad program is 8 or 14K is probably irrelevant, adding 100K to every program isn't)

      </ul>

           The probable use of cross-development tools, rather than native environments, if for no other reason than the difficulty of typing on a Palm.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If for your needs you want native development, then I would agree that a C++ compiler <em>on</em> the Palm would probably be inefficient. If you're happy with cross development, then C++ is a respectably efficient choice for any meaning of efficiency. -- pth (heretic)

        One of the benefits of a <a href="PolyannaLanguage.html">PolyannaLanguage</a>, if ported to C/C++ and compiled for Palm and/or <a href="PocketPc.html">PocketPc</a> would be to allow you to make your own language for the device. Assuming the grammars were open source (text files) and there was one for each popular language, it would make more languages available for these devices than are now. For instance PocketC is not C++ (not object oriented). Someone posted a OO framework for <a href="LispMe.html">LispMe</a> but it seems cumbersome. With the Polyanna framework you could potentially get subsets of Perl, Ruby, Eiffel, whatever you prefer on the device it would be slow but that to me would be a worthwhile tradeoff to have a range of languages to play with at the bus stop. You're not doing anything anyway who cares if the program takes a few extra seconds to run. See also <a href="ProgrammingOnHandHelds.html">ProgrammingOnHandHelds</a>.
