        A ceaseless array of requirements and priorities flows into your life from the future. How do you decide what to do today?

        What is the most important thing?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ignore everything else.
        Pretend that nothing else exists.

        <em>Um, yeah, great. Now if you can tell us how you go about deciding what the most important thing is ...</em>

      <p>
        <em>... deciding what the most important thing is ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, given that this will always be subjective, figuring it out for a daily routine is not so hard if you are able to determine what the <em>long term</em> important thing(s) is(are).
      </p>
      <p>
        If the most important thing is to "GoToTheMoon" (arguably a long-term project), then today's "MostImportantThing" will be whatever contributes the most value toward accomplishing GoToTheMoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deciding what your GoToTheMoon goals are ... well, that's a matter of personal inspiration, desperation, or whimsy.

        <a href="LifeVectors.html">LifeVectors</a> has a model for how it breaks down, but establishing the goal itself is up to you.
