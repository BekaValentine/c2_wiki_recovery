        While working on the machinery of <a href="WikiBatics.html">WikiBatics</a>, the notion of including, expecting and pursuing connections which exist within the original document,  discoveries are made which lead to interesting and perhaps powerful concerns or artifacts. The pursuing of the interests take place in two or more strategies or stages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Strategy One</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               In wiki document, the linking of these are made through noting hyperlinks with WikiWords. The number of links of the first order (those in the immediate document) are finite and result in a sensibly sized artifact when prusued and attached (call this "Strategy One")
            </li>
            <li>
               Their are exceptions. Documents composed almost exclusively as lists of links, like <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, Members of <a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a> or Groups of documents linking to the present document (<a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a>). 
            </li>
            <li>
               Documents which are presentations of notions, ideas, or observations are linked with a reasonable number of related artifacts. (I am speaking of well-formed and informed documents)
            </li>
            <li>
               This is a powerful characteristic of wiki documents. Links lead to additional information the reader should find which meets an information need. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Strategy Two</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Applying to the list of artifacts discovered in the document processed in "Strategy One" the same process except the results are retained in the <a href="WikiBatics.html">WikiBatics</a>(.pdf) document, or become linked artifacts within the document.
            </li>
            <li>
               The size of the document grows as it contains many more artifacts some of which are of lesser, perhaps no interest regarding the specifics of the initial document. Artifacts so discovered are more numerous, having extended relevance.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
