        Many believe that Gore never said this, and that what he did say was that he played an important role (when he was in the UnitedStatesSenate) in ensuring that the Internet would be available for public use, and that "<a href="InventedTheInternet.html">InventedTheInternet</a>" was a Republican distortion.  <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>: Al Gore belongs to the Democratic Party, in opposition to the Republican Party, which between them largely dominate American politics. The UnitedStatesSenate is one of the two houses of the national legislature.
