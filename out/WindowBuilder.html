        An advanced visual editor for designing user interfaces.  Originally created by <a href="CooperAndPeters.html">CooperAndPeters</a> for VisualSmalltalkEnterprise, then ported to <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>.  Was purchased by <a href="ObjectShare.html">ObjectShare</a>, which was then gobbled up by <a href="ParcPlaceDigitalk.html">ParcPlaceDigitalk</a>, who then renamed themselves to Objectshare (you keeping up with this? <g>).

      <p>
        Active development moved to <a href="VisualAgeSmalltalk.html">VisualAgeSmalltalk</a> by EricClayberg at SmalltalkSystems.  Version 4.0 was a real winner.
