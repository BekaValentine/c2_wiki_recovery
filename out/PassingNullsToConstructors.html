           Judging by the <a href="SetTheBozoBit.html">SetTheBozoBit</a> page, where almost all of the contributors cheered on the <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> as if it were a <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a>, I think this is by far the most important section, and therefore perhaps needs to be expanded.

           The exterior link to this antipattern did not at <strong>all</strong> help emphasize that it was an antipattern rather than a pattern; such things need very clear emphasis.

        <strong>Examples in Practice</strong>:
        My practice: I use a large object layer for one particular kind of thing stored across many rows of the database. In order to completely initialize, it needs some parameters about how the image that it will draw on top of is laid out. Most of the time, I don't need that part of the layer. Therefore, I pass null for that parameter as the signal that I do not want it initialized.
