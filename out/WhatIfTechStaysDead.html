        What If Tech Stays Dead

        This is not out of the question. The world employs very few automobile designers because there are very few automobile manufacturers. It could be that all paying software jobs concentrate in a few large package vendors who wield monopolistic power over their sectors. Another even more extreme scenario would have manual programming replaced with some form of automation that does not require talent from the individuals involved. The model for this would be telegraph operators who were once at the center of a rapidly shrinking world only to be totally obsolete a few decades later.

        Depressing thought. The thing is, corporations believe in the <a href="ArmyOfProgrammers.html">ArmyOfProgrammers</a> theory: that programming is just like any other semi-skilled job, like digging ditches, and so, if you get enough ditch-diggers, it doesn't matter whether they are unskilled or semi-skilled (and management is already of the opinion that this is not a fully-skilled job category).
      </p>
      <p>
        They're wrong, at least when it comes to the truly <em>'difficult</em> projects, of course, but how to make them see that? Or shall we all roll over and play dead and tell management that programming requires nothing special that's any different than ditch-digging?

        I for one am not very worried about this. A high percentage of techies are very creative and will develop an entrepreneurial spirit under pressure. While the economy stays strong we will find ways to sell our talents.

           From personal experience I can attest that entrepreneurial skills are often different from tech skills for the most part. Marketing is key, and few of us techies have existing sufficient marketing skills or knack. The best mousetrap will go nowhere without sales. (Very few products are self-selling, and it is not likely we can all find those rare gems.)

        I agree that this is a bad time for us techies, we are under pressure, but these things are cyclic.  The wheel will turn, I believe that the point I made above is one of the factors that will cause it to turn.

        <em>But you have to be of a certain mindset to take advantage of the shifts in an industry like this. The thing that cost $10000 three years ago could cost $100 now, so you have to be willing to keep moving, pushing forwards into the problems that are new and have yet to be solved and interest you. I think not many people feel this way about their work, or want to. If you're not one of those people, you should either a) organize with other like-minded souls to enact deep structural change in the technology industry (and capitalism in general) or b) get out. -- francis</em>

        I think we can learn a great deal from the computer game industry.  There was a time when one person could make a fortune by writing and selling a game written in Basic.  He could compose the monophonic sound track, draw the crude graphics and write the code all by himself.  Customer expectations were much lower.  Today's games have teams of people who never write a line of code: graphic artists, musicians, voice talent, designers, marketers.  Writing the software is still hard work, but the development tools have advanced significantly.  Today's customers expect more human creativity and artistry from their games, and that's where the big costs are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing a game used to be more like writing a book.  One dedicated person could do it in their spare time.  Today it's more like making a movie.

        <em>This is true in general, but there are successful small teams out there.  The six developers of Yohoho Puzzle Pirates (</em><a href="http://www.puzzlepirates.com/)">http://www.puzzlepirates.com/)</a> is an example (and that's for a persistent world multiple player online rpg).  I wouldn't be surprised if there were a few others.<em></em>

        I worked for four startups, got to where you are now, went to work for a Fortune 500 company, and am now getting outsourced to India.  I'm putting back in with the startups.  At least in a startup, whether I actually do work or just sit on my thumbs all day means something.

      </p>
      <p>
        I don't question that there will always be small niches here and there in tech, but the problem is that there is/will-be an oversupply of displaced techies digging around for such niches, often getting in each other's way. The key decision is whether to try to stay with tech and prepare for a rough battle, or find something else that is less offshore-able.

        Okay, shameless, but hopefully helpful to some, plug aside, I think (and this is my own view, not necessarily the view of <a href="ThoughtWorks.html">ThoughtWorks</a>) tech will stay dead, if dead means that 1999-like boomtimes will not return. That day is over. It was built partly on a lot of false assumptions anyway. Also, outsourcing <em>will</em> grow and companies will get better at managing these projects. If a college student asked me if it was a good idea to major in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> these days, I'd have to say "no". I'm not being pessimistic, I just think that there is a whole world of smart people waiting to have the opportunity to be brought into the economy, and that software projects are easily done remotely (as compared to giving health care to someone), so it's going to happen more and more. There will still be a strong but small demand for very bright and/or very senior people onshore... or people who have tons of domain experience. That is the <a href="WayToWin.html">WayToWin</a> I am currently looking for personally. If I focus on becoming a domain expert in a complex domain or two to augment my programming abilities and leadership skills, then I have maximized my employment potential, and minimized my chance of being OffShored. That's the theory I've concocted anyway.

        <strong>Anti-Family Trend?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: <em>and don't mind traveling...</em>
      </p>

        It seems more of the available tech jobs are temporary contracts and/or require a lot of travaling. Those of us with families find this problematic. One of the reason that H-1B visa workers are so popular with employers is that they don't have families to tie them down. They not only are willing to move about, but can work 80-hours a week without the distraction of family issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Another view: it's not necessarily true that H-1Bs *don't* have family issues; they just put their families aside geographically for economic reasons. This might be because the job market or economy in their home country sucks, and it's financially advantageous to work in the US. However low-for-the-market they may be paid in the US, their home country probably pays less; sometimes you do what you need to do for   your family.]
