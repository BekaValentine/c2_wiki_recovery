        Hysterically funny and affectionate spoof of <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> or, more accurately, the worst aspects of the "Trekkie" (as opposed to "Trekker (as I understand it (which I don't, really))) fandom. Released in the UK some years ago, it disappeared without trace from cinemas in about a week and has now gone to video. It is here that the phrase "<a href="HistoricalDocuments.html">HistoricalDocuments</a>" appears. Most likely only trekkies (or trekkers, whichever you prefer) will appreciate all the in-jokes, but a passing acquaintance with Star Trek probably suffices.

        <em>Alan Rickman is always worth watching, and Sigourney Weaver as a blond is brilliant.</em>

        <em>Sig as a blonde was amazing</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anecdote from the set: The director asks, "Could we do that again, but this time, Sig, start talking while you walk over."
      </p>
      <p>
        Sigourney reasons this out; "You want me to talk <em>while</em> I'm walking?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The director replies, "I think that wig is affecting you."

        On the DVD there are some scenes that didn't make it into the final cut. In one of them, stoner Fred (whom the aliens think to be the Scotty-like "Tech Sergeant Chen") gives a demonstration of consulting technique that would do any training video proud. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The aliens ask Fred an incomprehensible technical question. Being just an actor, not the engineer they think he is, he asks one of them, what do you think? The trembling alien blurts out a highly involved description of the problem. To which Fred replies, after a thoughtful pause, and what does that mean? Thus prompted, the alien stumbles its way to the correct fix. At which point it is <em>Fred</em> who receives the genuine and spontaneous praise of the assembled throng for his brilliant solution. A lesson to us all. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

        On cable (and video?) they made a bogus edit. One of the funniest lines in the movie is when Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver walk up to the "<a href="GalaxyQuestChompers.html">GalaxyQuestChompers</a>".  Watch her lips.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yup - I saw the original. When I saw the non-lip-sync version I was caught by surprise.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't see it in the theaters.  I saw it on video, and noticed that her lips didn't match the audio.  I just assumed the same edit had been made in the theatrical release as well, to get it a PG rating. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        When will Tim Allen figure out his movie career is going nowhere (Who saw Joe Somebody?? Joe Nobody, that's who) and work to get a <a href="GalaxyQuest.html">GalaxyQuest</a> series on TV?

        I'm guessing it would outdraw <a href="StarTrekEnterprise.html">StarTrekEnterprise</a>. They could have seven years of episodes just from mocking the <a href="StarTrekOriginalSeries.html">StarTrekOriginalSeries</a>. Look, it's Frank Gorshin and John Astin in identical green jumpsuits -- one has question marks on his outfit, the other has <em>upside down question marks</em> on his outfit, one has the left-side of his face black, one has the right-side of his face black. Imagine the ensuing hilarity... -- <a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a>

        <em>Not convinced they could get that much out of it. After all, </em><a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> only has about four plots.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Alien of the week.
        </li>
        <li>
           Time travel.
        </li>
        <li>
           Holodeck malfunction.
        </li>
        <li>
           Klingons attack!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Actually I think the list is:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Unknown fatal plague</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Invincible Alien</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Democracy forced on some other civilisation</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="TimeTravel.html">TimeTravel</a> but don't change history<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But there are so many variations...the planet of the gambling brains, the planet of the beautiful women, the planet of the readily available saltpeter, the planet of the rebirth of Christ, the planet of the beautiful women II, the planet of the American revolution, the planet of the funny alien gangsters.

        Well, if we're talking about the original series of Star Trek, the plots are thus:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Kirk and crew kidnapped and forced to fight someone.  Usual ending: "No, I won't kill you."
        </li>
        <li>
           Some society has subjugated its rights to computers in some way.  Usual ending: Kirk argues the computer to death.
        </li>
        <li>
           Dying race kidnaps Kirk and possibly others in hopes of saving their people by force.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ship taken over by weird invincible power.  Usual ending: Either deus ex machina, or Kirk knocks out the source of its invincibility.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think you can find at least three episodes that match each of the above patterns.  The first and last of these were the basis of the Futurama episode, "Where No Fan Has Gone Before", which featured most of the original cast.  "Now say nuclear wessels!"  -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        (Upon further examination, I think Futurama <em>is</em> the Star Trek parody proposed earlier in this page.  Too bad it's cancelled.  --<a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>)
