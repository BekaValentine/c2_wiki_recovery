        <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> has excellent support for Internet-related technologies, and a lot of practical support via various class libraries that people have written. In addition to the very practical stuff, it also has a lot of experimental code written for it. The UI can look a bit funky at first, but it is easy to modify - for instance, with one package, you can load IceWM themes. Contrary to what was written here before, there is support for various OODBs (Magma, MinneStore, <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>/S, GOODS), ORM support, improved programming team support (via Monticello + SqueakSource), and the <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> can be installed within a two minutes of downloading a virgin image using the <a href="SqueakMap.html">SqueakMap</a> package loader, which is sort of like Debian's apt-get (but without dependency resolution - soon, though!).

        </li>
        <li>

           - On the other hand, I have occasionally had Squeak crash on me, usually when trying my hand at <a href="JustInTimeProgramming.html">JustInTimeProgramming</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           + Is quite stable for most folks, including the people using it for enterprise apps.
        </li>
        <li>
           + Has a decently sized and vibrant community around it- the folks in #squeak on irc.freenode.net are always up to helping someone new toSqueak.
        </li>
        <li>
           + It may look like a bright, shiny toy, but can easily be converted into looking like a boring Windows/Unixish app.

               Dissenting Opinion: I got started on Smalltalk first by reading <a href="SmalltalkTheLanguageAndItsImplementation.html">SmalltalkTheLanguageAndItsImplementation</a>, then by using TekSmalltalk. As far as I am concerned, Squeak is <em>the</em> Smalltalk interface. While I will agree it is different from the interfaces one often sees around, this, to me, is more a limitation of the other interfaces than of Squeak.... -- <a href="BillTrost.html">BillTrost</a>

               First time I ran Squeak, I was stunned. I got this weird sense of how much history there was to GUIs, and how I knew nothing about it compared to what I thought I knew. This UI was almost 20 years old, and looking just fine. (Update: Yesterday at Oopsla, Dan Ingalls showed a salvaged <a href="SmalltalkSeventyTwo.html">SmalltalkSeventyTwo</a> system running on top of Squeak. I was only BORN in '71. That was a really humbling experience.) <em>-- </em><a href="RichardEmerson.html">RichardEmerson</a><em></em>

            <li>
               Squeak's interface, Morphic, is extremely powerful and flexible. However, it suffers from a lack of newbie-friendly documentation. Even many VAST/VW/etc vets often dismiss Squeak, not wanting to learn Morphic by poking around in the Browser. I've used Squeak as my windowing environment at various points in time- using <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> or the FFI I've controlled a web browser (the only app outside Squeak I really need); some apps I used were written in Squeak; and what was left over I was able to run from the command line using the totally useful vt100/xterm TeletypeMorph that IanPiumarta wrote- this includes running emacs/vi just like it was in a 'real' xterm. I can tailor the Squeak GUI in a way that just isn't possible in OS X, Windows, or X11, at least not in the time it takes to accomplish in Squeak. -- AaronReichow

        This "product" is insanely expensive (like many thousands per seat) when you get a quote from IBM.

        <a href="GnuSmalltalk.html">GnuSmalltalk</a>, though free (GPL) does have the relatively fatal legalism that any of the image files you create with it are automatically GPL whether you want it or not. It might make sense for smalltalkers interested in using a *nix smalltalk to lobby the FSF to rerelease it under the LGPL, particularly since there seems to be a fairly sizeable community that would be interested in it.

        <em>I don't think this is a "flaw", since it appears to be quite intentional.

        <em>Besides, what's so bad about shipping your code under the GPL? Just refuse to service it for Machines without a support contract, or something along those line.

Written with the intent that any single programmer would be able to know of each class and method in its implementation. It is very far from a full-blown Smalltalk-80 system, and doesn't implement the ANSI standard. Little Smalltalk has a few derivatives (Public Domain Smalltalk [PDST], Susie, Chi Parla) which are generally being developed by one person in their spare time, but Little Smalltalk itself is no longer in development and has no community base of support. The book of the same name teaches the reader how they could implement such a small Smalltalk system.
