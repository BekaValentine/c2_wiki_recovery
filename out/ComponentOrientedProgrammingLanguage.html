        Component Oriented Programming Languages:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Proposed Criteria for a </strong><a href="ComponentOrientedProgrammingLanguage.html">ComponentOrientedProgrammingLanguage</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        So I propose these criterias for a language/development environment to be recognized as component oriented or component based:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Should have a precise definition of what <strong>component</strong> means. Both in <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a> and in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, component is a very precise term.
        </li>
        <li>
           Should have a legitimate claim to a standard definition of component, if the definition of component goes against the grain. By legitimate I mean should have been there for some time, not just attach a word <strong>component</strong> to let's say <strong>distributed object</strong> because components are very fashionable lately.
        </li>
        <li>
           Should have been proven by practice. A research language doesn't count too much here, unless it's proven that influenced more practical projects.
        </li>
        <li>
           Should support a sensibly different way/method/technique of software development. The new way of doing things should provide sensible advantages in terms of productivity, reliability and so on. <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> and <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a> clearly do that, and their way of doing things have been labeled as <a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a> for a long time already.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>or</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Should adhere to a reasonable concept of component as instituted by the above rules.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anything that doesn't meet these criteria, and claim to be component oriented and/or component based , is for me just an illegitimate marketing scam. --<a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing I would add to the list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Must have a well defined version handling and compatibility procedure.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you no longer link together pieces into a single executable, maintaining versions and ensuring interoperability between versions of the various components becomes a major chore.  --<a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

        I posture that a language named <a href="ComponentPascal.html">ComponentPascal</a> would debunk the claim. Interestingly, <a href="ClemensSzyperski.html">ClemensSzyperski</a> used it for its example code in his <a href="ComponentSoftware.html">ComponentSoftware</a> book, while he was working at OberonMicrosystems (I think).

        I would guess that what is meant by a 'component oriented' language would be that components were <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> in that language. Or possibly that the whole design of the language was predicated around making it simple to work with components (no drawing pentangles or writing IDL). -- <a href="BrianEwins.html">BrianEwins</a>

        Just because the language is called Component Pascal and that the authors declare it component oriented doesn't make it component oriented. Let's debunk the debunk.

        If you go to <a href="http://www2.fit.qut.edu.au/CompSci/PLAS//ComponentPascal/language_report.html,">http://www2.fit.qut.edu.au/CompSci/PLAS//ComponentPascal/language_report.html,</a>

        Really? Then I'd propose a couple dozen languages as component oriented. I don't know why the classic Pascal or Oberon or Modula-2 wouldn't qualify. A lot of marketing hype has been placed around <a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a>, including naming a perfectly normal and ordinary language <a href="ComponentPascal.html">ComponentPascal</a>, including incorrectly designating tons of technology as having to do with <em>components</em> : <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a>, COM/DCOM, CORBA, probably .NET will come soon. I for one cannot accept for example that "components" as in COM family is just object-oriented RPC (oh, this qualifier is also ill defined and heavily abused).

        <strong>Features of </strong><a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> that would Support Claim<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What features of </em><a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> make it a <a href="ComponentOrientedProgrammingLanguage.html">ComponentOrientedProgrammingLanguage</a> (other than what we have in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>)?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary feature that has been cited to me is the notion of the
        <strong>assembly as a boundary of naming, deployment, versioning, and security.</strong>
        Everything to do with types, interfaces, type dependencies, and access
        is granular to the assembly level.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The concentration in C# seems to be the  design, creation and use of
        business-problem-solving classes and components.  It seems to be designed
        to guide the developer/ architect smoothly into blueprinting a class that's
        intuitive and easy to client-program against.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's not a great amount of functionality within the language itself, but
        rather it provides a very good framework (I use that word in a different
        context; I don't mean the .NET Framework) to leverage language-independent
        libraries and create and manage  business objects that use that leveraged
        functionality.  The learning curve for the language itself is shallow,and
        distinctly separate from the BCL's.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Java, there's a bit more of a curve with everything sort of being lumped
        together under the language itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some more with help from the <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> folks:
      </p>
      <p>
        The major feature of "componentness" ("componentality"???) is that the
        component is a self-contained entity that has everything it needs to be
        a component encapsulated inside of it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From a feature perspective, I'd say this means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Properties
        </li>
        <li>
           Indexers
        </li>
        <li>
           Events
        </li>
        <li>
           Attributes
        </li>
        <li>
           XML docs as part of the code
        </li>
        <li>
           Explicit override
        </li>
        <li>
           Parameterized Properties
        </li>
        <li>
           Filtered Exceptions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In a word: assemblies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A component tends to consist of more than one class - it's a lump of code
        that provides some particular facility.  (All but the most
        trivial/apallingly-written components will be implemented in terms of
        multiple classes.)  The unit of packaging in .NET is the assembly, which
        corresponds to a component.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Java you have class files, which represent precisely one class, and you
        had jar files, which represent, well, nothing in particular - just a bunch
        of class files.  Jar files provide a much weaker mechanism for deploying
        components, because they've never been a fundamental part of Java's
        programming model.  (And neither have packages, which are arguably related
        to this area.) <em>? The component model in java is based on EJBs, not individual classes or jars. Jars do represent something if the manifest is used properly; also the jar variants (war, ear, sar) provide other, additional packaging concepts. In this sense the 'COPL' associated with java is not in java itself, its the deployment descriptor which describes how components are assembled into an application. This has the identical concept of 'assembly as a boundary of naming, deployment, versioning, and security' described above.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        EJB is an extension library, not the language itself. <em>fair enough - I was just commenting on the comparison of .NET assemblies and Jars. A better way of putting might be to say that in C# the thing equivalent to the java's XML deployment descriptor is also written in C#, which would justify more of a claim to be a component oriented language (I just went to the C# lang spec to figure out what you meant, this seems to be it?).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But I can think of two problems with proposing the EJB component model as a
        competitor to .NET assemblies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           This is only any good if you're actually writing EJBs
        </li>
        <li>
           The physical EJB component packaging model is a hack to work around the absence of proper support for components in the Java platform.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To expand on (1), I have come across J2EE systems where <strong><em>everything</em></strong> was
        written as an EJB.  IMO this misunderstands the intent of EJB, and is always
        a mistake.  Unless you are actually writing something which fits into the
        mould of a Session Bean or an Entity Bean, you really don't want to be an
        EJB at all.  I work on a lot of Java systems [1]*, and a lot of code fits
        into neither of these roles - I believe there is a place in Java enterprise
        systems for good honest old fashioned Java classes.  In fact many of the
        systems I work on use nothing but this, Servlets, JSP and JDBC, and don't
        seem to be any the worse off for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying to lever everything into the EJB model is more or less directly akin
        to making all of your .NET classes inherit from ServicedComponent.  Or in
        the pre-.NET MS world, it would be akin to writing everything to run in
        MTS/COM+ as a configured component, whether it made sense or not.  This
        would be just as much of a misapplication of technology (and at one stage it
        was just as rife as misapplications of EJB seem to be today), and it's never
        a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I would maintain that whilst the EJB component model may address some of
        the shortcomings of Java in this respect, that's of no help to anyone not
        writing code that fits usefully into the EJB model.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for (2), I think the existence and nature of the EJB model stands as
        testimony to the shortcomings of Java in this respect.  That they had to
        invent it for EJB illustrates that it was something the platform was
        missing.  And I never enjoy my experiences with working with this aspect of
        EJB.  (Although this may be a quality of implementation issue...)  The
        mechanism of building a component all seems a bit clunky and half-baked to
        me.  And none of the fruits of your labours seem to be accessible
        afterwards - as far as I'm aware there are no extensions to the Java
        Reflection API that enable you to examine EJB components.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said I do like the concept of the WAR file (Web Archive) - the idea
        that I can package up everything that a container needs to run my web
        application in some standard format appeals to me.  (So many hours wasted on
        deployment...  WAR files seem to be a step in the right direction.)  But
        that seems to be dealing with a much higher level of granularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not trying to suggest that all things are equal, nor to argue the merits of one component model or t'other. Most platforms have a component model of some kind, but calling C# the first </em><a href="ComponentOrientedProgrammingLanguage.html">ComponentOrientedProgrammingLanguage</a> makes us ask what features of other platforms/environments have been included the C# <strong>language</strong> that aren't in other languages, specifically java. Since the main thrust of (this section of) the page was to ascertain what features of C# make it a component oriented language, I thought it only fair to compare against the features of the java (well, j2ee) platform which are component oriented. If java actually <em>had</em> every feature of C# in the java language, the claim would be nonsense wouldn't it? The whole point is that there are things which are part of one language but not the other! Hence, when it turned out that C# has language features for components that java has to reach outside the language for, I thought the question had been answered? Ho hum. I'll lay the confusion at the door of my (& suns) using java to mean the language, the platform, the runtime, the libraries... :o) <em> </em>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Another hypothesis: it is improper to speak of ComponentOrientedLaguage. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We already have a widely accepted term <a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a>, and at least two commonly known example: <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> and <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a>. I'll even submit to the hypothesis that COM and EJB are component models (though I have very serious doubts) and with Visual Studio .NET bETA or whatever you are actually doing CBD. Now I just had a look both at <a href="ObjectPascal.html">ObjectPascal</a> (the language underneath Delphi ) and C# specs. Did a search for the word component ? Guess what, the word is not there. Both of them are very good <a href="ObjectOrientedLanguage.html">ObjectOrientedLanguage</a>, but they don't have a notion of component embedded in their construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>for .NET components =(assemblies)</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What they have is that they do have some specific features that makes it easy for a component writer to create components (properties, events and so on). But even less than that (a framework, or a naming convention can be used as in the <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a> example) can be enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus the component orientation is in all practical cases that we know of one level above the language (in a framework, in an integrated product, and so on). The language is just a support, and it usually is <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>, but I don't see any reason why it couldn't be a functional programming. Maybe component orientation can't be at the language level. After all my hypothesis ( see <a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a>) is that components should make design time interaction even easier than <strong>programming</strong>, because CBD essentially goes to code reduction and reuse even further. A lot of repetitive boring coding tasks are replaced by the property inspector, by connecting an display grid to a query component in a visual editor, and stuff like that. Of corse we shouldn't get rid of coding altogether, but CBD is about the absolute minimization of coding. Coding is for to be reserved for complex things, not for formating texts, displaying data, handling user input and stuff like that. --CostinCozianulololllll

        <strong>Research versus Production Languages</strong>
      </p>
