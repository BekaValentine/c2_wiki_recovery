        <em>from the org-patterns list, October 9, 1997 ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ... This reminds me of something that happened at OOPSLA. As some of
        you know, the AG Patterns Book had its debut yesterday and I had
        the privilege of signing books for purchasers -- a heady experience!
      </p>
      <p>
        After each book was signed, I pointed the purchaser to a small
        gathering of contributors to the book and said, "If you'd like,
        these folks would also be happy to sign your book!" One purchaser
        remarked that he really wasn't a seeker of celebrity autographs.
        I quickly pointed out that these were not celebrities -- they
        were just people! The thing that was extraordinary was our
        community! The purchaser had a difficult time grasping that but
        when he did, he couldn't stop saying, "What an idea! Autographs
        of ordinary people! I like that!"
      </p>
      <p>
        It was wonderful! I'll never forget it!

        How we forget <br/>

        how disappointing to find <br/>

        forgets my name, <br/>
        and is so ordinary. <br/>

        My wife and I were looking through one of our history collection boxes which contains photos, gift-cards, and other items which are a part of our past. One of the items in it caught my wife's eye, and because of the attention she paid to it, mine also. What was it? It was a guest-book from our wedding.
        Why was it so special? It contained the signatures of many <a href="OrdinaryPeople.html">OrdinaryPeople</a>: Mothers, Fathers, Brothers, Sisters, Cousins, Uncles, Great-Uncles, Grandmothers, Friends, former schoolmates, neighbors, members of the church and dear-friends and business-associates. What memories flooded back as we looked at the names of some almost forgotten people who, with their own hand, had put their names in it. While looking through the names, some were very close and involved in our past, both far and recent, but an occasional one would surprise us because they had come at more than a little cost of time and money. An uncle, all the way from Washington state, (It would be the last time I would see him). A Great-Uncle who was a busy and successful business executive. Dear Great-Aunt Mary, who from my earliest youth was a most influential force in all that is wholesome, good, and lasting. My Grandmother, who also was a wonderful person, whose character had been formed by the hardships and testings of pioneer life, and was based on a deep and personal religious faith. While some of them were quite special and dear to our hearts, most would be classified as <a href="OrdinaryPeople.html">OrdinaryPeople</a>, but as we spent quite some time looking through the list, which was much longer than I had remembered, we had within us warmth and glow generated by the memories of each of these dear people. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.20100117

        Well, I have been around for nearly 48 years; I have never met any <a href="OrdinaryPeople.html">OrdinaryPeople</a> and I am starting to wonder if they really exist. -- <a href="TimJarman.html">TimJarman</a> 22nd January 2010
