        Sloppy Focus
      </h1>
      <p>
        A FocusPolicy, available in most X/Unix environments, which acts like <a href="FocusFollowsMouse.html">FocusFollowsMouse</a> except that if the mouse pointer goes over the background (the RootWindow, in X parlance) the application/window which most recently had KeyboardFocus loses focus. Compare with strict <a href="FocusFollowsMouse.html">FocusFollowsMouse</a>, which then assigns focus to the RootWindow. In most configurations, the RootWindow only responds to a fixed set of key combinations which applications generally don't handle (instead they are passed up the window stack); thus there is usually no reason to specifically assign focus to the root window.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SloppyFocus.html">SloppyFocus</a> generally only applies to keyboard events; if the pointer is in the root window and a ContextSensitiveMenu is invoked, the default CSM is brought up and not the application which last had focus.
