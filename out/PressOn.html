        <em>Too many of us wait to do the perfect thing, with the result we do nothing. The way to get ahead is to start now. While many of us are waiting until conditions are “just right” before we go ahead, others are stumbling along, fortunately ignorant of the dangers that beset them. By the time we are, in our superior wisdom, decided to make a start, we discover that those who have gone fearlessly on before, have, in their blundering way, traveled a considerable distance. If you start now, you will know a lot next year that you don’t know now, and that you will not know next year, if you wait.</em> -- The William Feather Magazine

        Pressing on is more a strategy of determination and persistance, coupled with adequate knowledge and unending effort. There are those who continue efforts in complete denial, who fail to apply clear thinking to their actions, even when faced with overwhelming evidence. In the same conditions, others would opt out.
