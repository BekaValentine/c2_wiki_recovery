        Class Names Become Wiki Names
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> are defined by being in <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>. Unfortunately, this is also the naming convention for classes in C++ and Java (and for function names in some styles of C/C++); thus, there is often an extreme form of <a href="AccidentalLinking.html">AccidentalLinking</a>, in which code written out on wiki turns out to contain links. Sometimes this is good (for example, if you ever mention <a href="StringBuffer.html">StringBuffer</a>, you get a link to an informative discussion of that class), but it is more often annoying (when code is littered with little blue question marks).
      </p>
      <p>
        The workaround is to break up <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> words using <a href="SixSingleQuotes.html">SixSingleQuotes</a>, LikeThis. (not LikeThat -- that messes up the spell checker). This is tedious, but it works (plus, if you leave the code long enough in a visible place, the magic <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s often fix it for you!).
      </p>
      <p>
        A possible patch to wiki to escape this problem would be to disable links inside code blocks (which are defined by starting the line with a space); this would squash many of the occurrences, but wouldn't catch them all ("I hate the way you have to declare <a href="RemoteException.html">RemoteException</a> on all the methods of a remote interface in Java!"), and would disable deliberate links that might occur in code ("/* using <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> here */").
