        Example Of Greenspuns Tenth At Work

        I disagree that this is actually an example of <a href="GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a>; to quote the above:

      </p>

        And many other languages, eg Smalltalk, Java, Python, Mathematica, ... C is kind of a loner with its lowly string ability.

        More details, please? This page is so inaccurate in other respects that I am not sure how much credence to give that assertion.

        Anyway, what does this have to do with Lisp? Feh. I've seen plenty of examples of Greenspun's Rule, but this is not a good one. <a href="AntiMicrosoftBiasOnWiki.html">AntiMicrosoftBiasOnWiki</a> is doubly sad if the criticism doesn't even make sense.

        By far the best example I know of is the reimplementation of Yahoo! Stores in C++. As the shop builder evals Lisp code, they would have essentially had to implement a Lisp interpreter in C++. Ack! -- <a href="NoelWelsh.html">NoelWelsh</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Does anyone know <em>why</em> this (in)famous re-implementation was done? And does anyone know the official reason?
      </p>
      <p>
        I can't say for sure, but I thought I read that it was because the pointy haired bosses wanted it written in a standard language, i.e. something they'd heard of. Stupid as hell if you ask me, they paid like 90million bucks just to essentially downgrade it, not realizing that Lisp is the reason it was so good.
      </p>

        <em>There's an anecdote about a Common Lisp programmer interviewing at Yahoo!, mentioning he'd like to work on Yahoo! Stores. The boss says that they're planning on reimplementing it in C++. Why? They can't find Common Lisp programmers.</em>

        The Ant build tool is an example of <a href="GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a>. It has an XML syntax and an excruciatingly awkward way of using variables, writing conditional logic and calling tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ant is a _build tool_ (more precisely, as a better make). Majority of users consider serious programming/scripting in Ant an abomination. Anyway, how is having an XML syntax and awkward control constructs like implementing half of Lisp? If it is, then Excel and DOS batch files are also greenspunning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Build tools are an example of an </em>ExpertSystem--a build tool which contains a language (especially one which is <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>) strikes me as a <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>). DSL's, IMHO, ought to be exempted from charges of <a href="GreenSpunning.html">GreenSpunning</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Besides - how about </em><a href="MakeTool.html">MakeTool</a> itself (in particular, <a href="GnuMake.html">GnuMake</a> and anything which acts like it)? It's got a <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> language - one which is essentially a primitive Lisp dialect that puts dollar signs in front of its parentheses.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think some corollary to Greenspuns 10th is in order for GNU Make in its reimplementation of Prolog... And while backward chaining is ok for chasing dependencies, forward chaining (ala CLIPS, another language with sexp syntax) is probably better for describing the actions of a build system ("when a .y file is entered, make a .c file, when a .c file is entered, make a .o file, when these .c files enter, make this lib"). Sorry, Common lisp doesn't do *everything*, and just because CLIPS and Algernon use sexps doesn't mean CL has any claim on them.

        <em>Greenspunning is something which is done by </em>'programmers<strong>, not by <em>languages</em>. C++ doesn't engage in greenspunning, C++ programmers do. (Sometimes. OK, often). The amount of greenspunning a language might require could be considered a figure of merit; but to say that a particular tool designed for a specific purpose is </strong><a href="GreenSpunning.html">GreenSpunning</a> when it carries out that purpose is silly.<em></em>

        This might make the lisp lot gasp in horror but it might be of interest. We once started writing a numeric evaluator in java when we needed an expression parser to evaluate formulae in a basic framework environment - after a couple of days I decided just to use a database connector and submit select statements to the server. This meant we could do string manipulation as well of course in addition to homogeneously looking up currency rates etc...
