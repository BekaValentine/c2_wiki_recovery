        Directed Acyclic Graph
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DirectedAcyclicGraph.html">DirectedAcyclicGraph</a> is a <a href="DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a> with no circuits, often abbreviated DAG.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <em>circuit</em> is an ordered sequence of <em>N</em> arcs (<em>N</em> > 0), where
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the second vertex of the last arc is the first vertex of the first arc, and
        </li>
        <li>
           for all <em>n</em> such that 2 <= <em>n</em> <= <em>N</em>, the first vertex of the <em>n</em>th arc is the second vertex of the previous one.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        More generally, in a <a href="DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a>, a <em>path</em> is an ordered sequence of <em>N</em> arcs (<em>N</em> >= 0), where, 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           if <em>N</em> > 1, for all <em>n</em> such that 2 <= <em>n</em> <= N, the first vertex of the <em>n</em>th arc is the second vertex of the previous one (same as above);
        </li>
        <li>
           if <em>N</em> = 1, that's a length 1 path, and no particular condition is required;
        </li>
        <li>
           if <em>N</em> = 0, that's the length 0 path (the <em>null path</em>), and no particular condition is required.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thus, a circuit is a path that returns to its starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, <em>({A, B}, {(A, B), (B, A)})</em> and <em>({A, B, C}, {(A, B), (B, C), (C, A)})</em> both contain circuits, whereas <em>({A, B, C}, {(A, B), (B, C), (A, C)})</em> is acyclic.
      </p>
      <p>
        NB: Some people use the words "cycle" and "circuit" interchangeably. It's more correct to use "circuit" for a directed <em>path</em> and "cycle" for an undirected <em>chain</em>. <em>(Also note the terminological asymmetry between "circuit" and "acyclic".)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "cyclic" is an adjective where "circuit" is a noun, and the former ultimately derives from Greek whereas the latter comes from Latin, so there are multiple barriers to saying "* acircuit" or even "* acircuitous", although one could say "noncircuitous" (adjective + Latin prefix).
      </p>

        A very common use of DAGs is to represent expressions in a compiler or interpreter. The representation typically begins (conceptually or temporally) as a parse tree or syntax tree, and then recognition of common subexpressions (especially the simple case of multiply-appearing variables) transforms the tree into a DAG.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>I don't like the circuit definition because it distinguishes the start vertex. To me, the point of a circuit is that there is no "start point".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps this could be corrected by as simple a change as "returns to <strong>a</strong> starting point" rather than "returns to <strong>its</strong> starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
        [It should be noted that the choice of the "start point" is arbitrary; the definition of a circuit above is equally valid no matter which point you start on.]
      </p>
      <p>
        That's what I was hoping would be implied by saying "a" rather than "its".
      </p>

        How about this? (I'll use <- to mean "is an element of")
      </p>

        Given a set of Nodes <strong>N</strong> and a set of arcs <strong>A</strong>, where sink(a<-<strong>A</strong>)<-<strong>N</strong>, and source(a<-<strong>A</strong>)<-<strong>N</strong>, 
        we define a function isConnectedTo(x<-<strong>A</strong>, y<-<strong>A</strong>) := sink(x) = source(y) OR (there exists z<=<strong>A</strong>: isConnectedTo(x, z) AND sink(z)=source(y)) (ie, "is connected to" is transitive);
        a "cycle" is a <em>minimal</em> set of nodes <strong>C</strong> such that for all x<-<strong>C</strong>, for all y<-<strong>C</strong>, isConnectedTo(x, y).

        The WaterCycle can be represented as a Directedgraph:
      </p>
      <code>
        W = {V,E}<br/>
        V = {Cryosphere(c),Atmosphere(a),Biospher(b),Lithosphere(l),Hydrosphere(h)}<br/>
        E = {evaporate(h,a),drain(b,h),absorb(b,l),energize(l,b),transpire(b,a),precipitate(a,b),melt(c,b),sublimate(c,a)}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        DifferentialEquations as a basis for a SimulationProgram could be included for each Edge.
