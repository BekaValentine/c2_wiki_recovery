        Data Object Library

      <p>
        Class Library from <a href="CodeFarms.html">CodeFarms</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The only class library on the market which is based on intrusive data structures. This makes it more efficient and easier to use than other, container based class libraries. Collections, data structures, and relations are represented as objects. Data and relations are orthogonal (independent). This has many advantages: With our library, you code 3-5 times faster, while producing code which needs very little debugging: Dangerous allocation and pointer errors are eliminated like in Java or Smalltalk, but you maintain the performance, safety, and flexibility of C++. At the same time, your classes are automatically persistent - there is no need to code serialization functions manually. The library comes in full source, and has a set of about 80 programs that test every feature of the library.
