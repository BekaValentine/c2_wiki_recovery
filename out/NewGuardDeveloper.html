        New Guard Developer

      <p>
        Developers who are not <a href="OldGuardDeveloper.html">OldGuardDeveloper</a>s. Think neophiles vs. neophobes. These guys keep up, care about quality, and champion TDD and new architecture. Every once in a while you might have to sacrifice one of them for the greater good. But think diamond-hard before doing so - they're too valuable to waste, and if you let them even get a whiff of the idea that you're sacrificing them on purpose, they'll turn on you in a gnat's wink.

        You just place the names of those who ask this question on a list. Never mind what happens to that list. Probably the same kind of thing that Santa does.

        They are the ones who can't finish a design before going off to rewrite it in the latest fad.
        They are the ones who list 100 programming languages in their resume - all with less than 1 year experience.

        <em>This conflicts with the definition on </em><a href="OldGuardDeveloper.html">OldGuardDeveloper</a> saying than the <a href="NewGuardDeveloper.html">NewGuardDeveloper</a> latches on, stays, and becomes Old Guard on it.<em></em>

        <em>Rather, this warrants terms to describe the rate at which the programmer acquires relevant skills. This is at or below O(log n) for an </em><a href="OldGuardDeveloper.html">OldGuardDeveloper</a> and a <a href="NewGuardDeveloper.html">NewGuardDeveloper</a>, and would be about O(n) for these other people (like me, sadly). Are there already terms for this? HemProgrammer, HawProgrammer, SniffProgrammer and ScurryProgrammer? --<a href="JesseMillikan.html">JesseMillikan</a><em></em>
