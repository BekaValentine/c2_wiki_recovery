        Three Star Perl

      <p>
        <em>Here is an example of </em><a href="ThreeStarPerl.html">ThreeStarPerl</a>. It is apocryphal, since it was created by a very good abstractor as an exercise to see just how inscrutable working <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> could be.<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        sub removeDupesButPreserveOrder () {<br/>
        (%_ = ()) || (return [ grep ( !($_{$_}++), @{$_[0]})]);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        <em>While I appreciate the particular skill required to emit this code, I find it most useful as a counter-example. The developers I want to hire are the ones who look at it and say "Yuchh! It might work, but why on EARTH would somebody write it THAT way!". I want the developers whose sense of taste and hunger for abstraction compel them to complain about code like this. -- </em><a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

      <p>
        It doesn't work.  (Someone forgot to <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>.)  The @{$_[0]} fragment is a array whose name is the first element of the list to be processed (this array probably won't exist).  The extra [ ] brackets mean that this subroutine returns an anonymous array whose first element is the un-duplicated list.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't think that's what Someone meant.  Someone was assuming removeDupesButPreserveOrder would be passed a </em>'reference<em>' to an array, returning a reference to the resulting filtered array.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's what a real multi-star programmer might write:
      </p>
      <code>
        sub unDup { %_=(),grep(!$_{$_}++,@_) }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ...although such a short fragment probably wouldn't become a subroutine.  For even more fun, consider:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But that takes an actual array and returns an actual array--so it's not solving the same problem.</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        sub unDup { grep(!$_{$_}++,@_) unless %_=() }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The code above would make a nice interview topic for a Perl programmer: "What's wrong with this code, and how would you rewrite it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And the answer should include "It's too obscure"</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an answer I might give:
      </p>
      <code>
        sub removeDuplicates {<br/>
        my %temp = ();<br/>
        return grep(!($temp{$_}++), @_);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>That code can be clarified with a better hash name.  Same idea, slightly different style...</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        sub remove_duplicates {<br/>
        my %is_seen;<br/>
        grep {not $is_seen{$_}++} @_;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Post-incrementing an associative array is a very common idiom in Perl (explained in <a href="ProgrammingPerl.html">ProgrammingPerl</a>).  Using this within grep is less common (grep itself is fairly unusual).  Return is not necessary, but it is nice for people who use other languages.--<a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a> (author of fine <a href="PerlMunition.html">PerlMunition</a><strong>'s)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd rewrite it like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        sub unique {<br/>
        my %hash;<br/>
        @hash{@_}=();<br/>
        return keys(%hash);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Which won't preserve order like the original attempt above, but is concise and clear. -- <a href="RossLonstein.html">RossLonstein</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I assume you want "$hash{@_}", and are you sure that using a list for a hash key will work this way? <em>No, it's a hash slice: @hash{@_} means the list of elements of %hash identified by the list of hash keys in @_. Assigning the empty list to this makes each element of the hash undef, and the duplicate keys overwrite each other.</em> My style would be more like
      </p>
      <code>
        sub unique {<br/>
        my %seen, @out;<br/>
        while (my $item = shift) {<br/>
        push @out, $item unless $seen{$item};<br/>
        $seen{$item} = 1;<br/>
        }<br/>
        return @out;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (This does preserve order.) or (following your paradigm)
      </p>
      <code>
        sub unique {<br/>
        my %out;<br/>
        while (my $item = shift) {<br/>
        $out{$item} = 1; # duplicates removed by set semantics<br/>
        }<br/>
        return keys %out;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        -- <a href="KarlKnechtel.html">KarlKnechtel</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Simpler yet:
      </p>
      <code>
        sub unique {<br/>
        my %out;<br/>
        $out{$_} = 1 for @_;<br/>
        return keys %out;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I've written Remove duplicates discarding order as:
      </p>
      <code>
        sub uniq { return keys %{ map { $_ => 1 } @_ }; }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or, more accurately, I used @array = keys %{ map { $_ => 1 } @array }; more than once, and decided that it deserved a name to document what it does.
      </p>

      <code>

        (bag @_).List<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Hehehehe...That one doesn't preserve order, though.
      </p>
      <code>
        sub unique {<br/>
        use v6;<br/>
        my %seen of Bool;<br/>
        gather {<br/>
        for @_ {<br/>
        take $_ unless %seen{$_}++;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Perfect!
