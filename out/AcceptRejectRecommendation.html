        Accept Reject Recommendation
      </h1>
      <p>
        The  <a href="OopslaProgramCommitteeMeeting.html">OopslaProgramCommitteeMeeting</a>(s) I've sat on had complex rating schemes for papers :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           your recommendation
        </li>
        <li>
           your confidence in your recommendation
        </li>
        <li>
           your familiarity with the paper's topic
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of this went into creating a numerical rating for the paper. I found this approach too pseudo-scientific for my taste.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole program committee meeting comes down to thumbs up/thumbs down for every paper. I wanted the committee members to be thinking about that binary decision from the first, so I only accepted binary decisions as recommendations. These recommendations went into creating the <a href="SortedPaperList.html">SortedPaperList</a>.
