        Confusing Expertise With Elegance
      </h1>
      <p>
        This particular <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> occurs when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Someone invests a lot of time in a system which we'll call <em>A</em> (an OS, programming language, library, tool, etc) and becomes an expert in <em>A</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
           S/he is introduced to a different system of the same type, <em>B</em>. <em>B</em> may be billed as "better" than <em>A</em>; whether it is or not (assuming "better" may be determined) is of no consequence.
        </li>
        <li>
           After some initial training, etc. in <em>B</em>, person finds that s/he is not as productive in <em>B</em> as s/he was in <em>A</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Person concludes that <em>A</em> is therefore better (more elegant, simpler, whatever) than <em>B</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This confusion occurs at the subconscious level; it (usually) is not malicious or intentional. It can be somewhat rational; the amount of time invested in <em>A</em> to acquire expertise is (partially) wasted if someone needs to invest additional time to acquire similar skill in <em>B</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a common cause of <a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a>, particular if <em>A</em> is an in-house creation and <em>B</em> is not. Also a common cause of <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Am I right in thinking that a more verbose page title might be "confusing (expertise with a tool) with (relative superiority of that tool)"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are complex interactions between</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           tool superiority and the shape of the <a href="LearningCurve.html">LearningCurve</a> (how steep at the start? how steep at the end? how high does it reach?)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="LearningCurve.html">LearningCurve</a> and ease of use (OnMySSide)
        </li>
        <li>
           ease of use and expertise
        </li>
        <li>
           potential user expertise and tool superiority
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>which I think could be usefully discussed. At least, if we can avoid the </em><a href="ShellVsIde.html">ShellVsIde</a> and WizardsVsRollYourOwn wars.<em></em>
