        Method Selector
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, a method selector is more commonly known as a MessageSelector.  A message sent to an object (the receiver) contains a selector.  The receiver looks up the first ClassMethod in its ClassHierarchy that matches the selector, and evaluates that method, returning the result to the CurrentContext.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> languages have closely related semantics.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The process of looking up an appropriate method is known as MessageDispatch or MethodDispatch.
