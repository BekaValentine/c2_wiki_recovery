        Oracle Jdeveloper

      <p>
        Oracle JDeveloper is a Java and XML development environment from Oracle. It has a good level of support for database development (not just Oracle), web services, J2EE development (including <a href="JavaServerFaces.html">JavaServerFaces</a>), and UML modeling. For Java developers, the built in profiling, codecoach (runtime analysis) and debugging tools are particularly useful. Since the 9.0.5 release, JDeveloper has combined a bunch of useful frameworks (OracleBusinessComponentsForJava, UIX) for building J2EE applications into the Application Development Framework (ADF).

      <p>
        Older versions of JDeveloper (3.2.3 and earlier) were based on licensed <a href="BorlandJbuilder.html">BorlandJbuilder</a> code. It's a common misconception that JDeveloper is still just "JBuilder with knobs on". The IDE was completely rewritten by Oracle in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> from scratch in 1999. Another common misconception is that JDeveloper is only useful for Oracle coding.
