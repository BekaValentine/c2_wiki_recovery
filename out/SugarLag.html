        Sugar Lag
      </h1>
      <p>
        High glycemic index foods - refined carbohydrates and especially sugar - spike blood sugar, causing feelings of rush and anxiety. The body produces insulin to mop up this spike, resulting in a drop in blood sugar below normal levels and a relatively prolonged period of drowsiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ThreeOclockSleepies.html">ThreeOclockSleepies</a> can be largely avoided by staying away from high glycemic index foods at lunch.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, why avoid them?  It is not unknown, after a nice, leisurely lunch and a siesta, to discover that those seemingly intractable problems from the morning have simple solutions after all...  Or, as <a href="SleepToWork.html">SleepToWork</a> points out, the <a href="ThreeOclockSleepies.html">ThreeOclockSleepies</a> may then be a perfect time to clear out the drudge work.
