        Extreme Programming Challenge Eighteen
      </h1>
      <p>
        Excerpted (without permission from author Phlip) from comp.object:

      <p>
        Someone - no idea exactly who - writes a huge spaghetti-code Win16 program using the Cascading Dialog Boxes Anti-Pattern. The user claws their way thru dialog after dialog, mostly working blind, until they clear the last one and get a beautiful output. To edit this they have to back-track a number of dialogs, change stuff, and roll-forward again. Also blind. The CDB Anti-Pattern is /very/ closely related to the Show The User Our Private Object Model And Nothing Else Anti-Pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm charged with replacing the UI with an OCX wrapper. We'll create a new UI (in glorious VB, of course) that drives the OCX, which then paints the program's output into a rectangle on the main app - not floating loose in its own crummy Win16 frame window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can't touch the spaghetti - it does a doctoral thesis worth of complex math in there.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the ODL for this OCX, I create one function for each dialog box from the Win16 app. Each argument to each function is named exactly the same as its origin on a dialog. This enables me to plug the function in right where the dialog box used to plug in. Very little research needed; just searching the code for comments that the original authors copied out of their dialogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Result: The last-version user-documentation, and user-interface, is now the programmer-documentation for my OCX's interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, I copied that documentation, and the results of all my research into the Pasta Zone inside this mono-object, into big fat comments in the ODL file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, I used TallTree's DocJet to translate these comments, with their functions and parameters with them, into a Web site, including excuse-free index pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, nobody except me ever used the OCX. I wrote the VB UI, and of course I gave it a real Editor UI-Pattern, where the user always sees results, and can change any config variable at any time - my VB takes care of the mechanics of calling all those dialogs to always produce output.
      </p>
      <p>
        So no coders except me ever read the Web site I painstakingly built. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the user-documentation writers direct their attention to my product, and they start nickel-n-diming me with questions like "The option 'Grid by Linear Dip Projection' on the second tab: What's that mean? and why does that make all these other options visible when you turn it on?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I tell them "uh, could you point your Web browsers at this URL here before asking me anything?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ummmm, and the challenge is?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't look at me. It was just an anecdote for "literate programming to the rescue". An <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> team would have instrumented the legacy code with unit tests, applied "<a href="ExtractAlgorithmRefactor.html">ExtractAlgorithmRefactor</a>" to build an <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>, then ripped it all up. I wasn't a team at the time ;-)  --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>.
