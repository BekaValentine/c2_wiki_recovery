        Abstraction Versus Marketplace
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Lisp (and related dialects) is perhaps the most <strong>flexible</strong> language known. You can make it be just about any paradigm or abstraction you can envision. Or at least its flexibility-to-syntactical-complexity ratio is near the top (power without clutter). It's a marvel to behold; a "language design formula" that is perhaps the E=mc^2 of programming. Lisp has been around for about 50 years, and enjoyed a renascence of popularity in the 1980's during the <a href="AiBubble.html">AiBubble</a>, which spilled over to non-AI projects. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, despite plenty of opportunities in 50 years, it <strong>failed to catch on for rank and file development</strong>. Its ideas keep getting introduced to various languages over the years, but often fail to "stick" for common usage, partly because such languages or add-ons don't do it as well as Lisp (meta + complex existing syntax = mess), and partly because it can encourage <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>, job-security "creativity" in programming, and increases the caliber of skill needed to read code using such techniques, which <strong>increases employee and recruiting costs</strong> beyond what companies want to bear.
      </p>
      <p>
        One can argue that Lisp-like techniques are the way it "should" be done, but the industry keeps saying "no" for good or bad. The industry wants tools that cater to semi-transient <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a>. This often results in tools that do some amount of <strong>"herding" to provide consistency</strong> with pre-packaged semi-domain-specific idioms, and less catering to "abstraction gurus". It's not quite "lowest common denominator", but something closer to the 25 percentile, meaning that roughly 75% of those hired need to be able to grok the code in a timely manner. (The economics of the caliber of hiring is debated later).
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen organizations complain even about "excessive function usage" with old-fashioned functions because some developers in the past were confused by the level of factoring used and they didn't want to fire them because they otherwise did decent work under lower abstraction, and often had better people skills than the "high brow" developers. (Perhaps they were partying in college while the gurus were writing compilers.) I've seen this phenomenon in multiple organizations and have at times been <strong>ordered to "dumb-down" my code</strong>. I even limit my favorite abstraction, <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>, because other maintainers are not used to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Duplication rarely gets somebody outright stuck; it's just more busy work and perhaps more little bugs caused by missing one of the repeating segments accidentally. However, heavy abstraction can get developers outright stuck. <strong>Businesses often value consistency and predictability more than average higher productivity</strong>, and hum-drum code gives them that. Being able to make accurate future predictions in terms of scheduling and resources is often highly valued in business and management. Owners and managers have repeatedly decided that this is often more important than higher average long-term productivity. (Start-ups and R&D-style projects may be an exception because "rock-star" developers can rocket you past the competition in the shorter term, getting your company or product on the map.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>"[H]eavy abstraction can get developers outright stuck"???  Really?  Misuse of </em>'anything<em>' can slow developers down.  There's nothing quite like a tangled web if IF statements to ruin an afternoon.  Bad programming is bad, regardless of the level of abstraction, though it's low level code -- "three-star" C code and the like -- that's particularly notorious for being obtuse and brittle.  HOFs in, say, Javascript are notably easy to read.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I mostly meant reading <em>other</em> people's code, not a programmer tangling themselves with HOF's. And everybody knows IF's, so such is easier to detect and notice. Misuse of a wrench is more obvious because everybody has experience using a wrench. However, misuse of a Sonic Screwdriver may go undetected because so few have experience with it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Every programmer knows IFs once he or she has learned them.  Before that -- like every language feature or concept before it is fully understood -- they are mysterious.  Beginners can misuse any feature -- I'm sure you've made mistakes, as have I, even with IF statements -- but once learned, mistakes are relatively unlikely.  Perhaps if you find HOFs "tangling", it's because you haven't practised them enough to fully understand them.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An org usually keeps a closer eye on new programmers' code. The higher you go up the abstraction ladder, fewer "mentors" are available. And I'm looking at it from an org's perspective, not mine right now. Remember, they complained about MY function factoring.

           [New programmers <em>should</em> have learnt about higher-order functions. They're not a mystical hyperadvanced feature that requires years of meditation to comprehend; they can be learnt in a couple of hours, assuming a programmer has already learnt about functions in general and perhaps loops (both of which new programmers learn quite early on). -DavidMcLean]

           I have pages of "should have's" for work-world behavior and human endeavors. Your personal should-have idealism doesn't scale. Don't forget, <a href="HumansSuck.html">HumansSuck</a>.

If wealth is at all a goal, academia and education are last places you want to be.  </em>DavidMcLean is right -- new programmers learn about higher-order functions.  They're not mystically complex and understood only by a rare few, they're currently part of the average programmer's education.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I have seen such goals. But, perhaps I should have also included prestige or feeling needed, etc. It's human nature to want to feel "needed". As far as HOF knowledge, other than fallowing a code pattern in the doc examples, I just don't see it widespread in the field. We'll probably have to <a href="AgreeToDisagree.html">AgreeToDisagree</a> on that point.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I'd hardly call learning about HOFs an "education".  My experience with programmers being shown HOFs is that the majority find passing functions as values to be logical and intuitive, especially as they're used to passing around objects and primitives as values.  Understanding HOFs typically requires considerably less effort than learning the quirks of the latest version of MS Office.  Resistance -- to the extent that I've seen any, which is negligible -- is invariably from older programmers imbued with the essence of languages where functions are strictly static, structural, and second-class.</em>

           FP is kind of in "fad mode" right now, partly because of being stuck with the <a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a> client "standard", and partly due to exploration of parallel programming. If the typical "problems with abstraction" play out, the future may be different and settle back to the usual pattern: stiffer DomainSpecificLanguages to herd programmers. The skepticism of "older programmers" perhaps has some worth in terms of forcing fad-chasers to justify "why". Newbie programmers are not very good at "why", other than $$$. Addressing "why" is often a good exercise for everybody involved. See also <a href="NaturalEventSyntax.html">NaturalEventSyntax</a>. -t

           <em>Organizations that complain about "excessive function usage" are clearly dysfunctional.  In terms of language design, why cater to dysfunctional companies at the expensive of functional ones?  Dysfunctional companies are uncompetitive, and guaranteed to eventually fail when other companies -- equal in every way, perhaps, but with a more capable IT department -- will successfully compete with them.  Isn't it better (again, in terms of language design) to help the strong and capable companies get stronger, rather than let the weak ones stay weak?</em>

        In short, <strong>Lisp Lost</strong>, and this includes Lisp-like techniques. You can bitch about the industry being "stupid" or "ill informed", but the reality is what it is and that's how it acts to the high abstraction attempts.

        <em>I'd hardly describe being #13 on the </em><a href="TiobeIndex.html">TiobeIndex</a> (as of February 2013) as "lost", especially compared to what LISP beats.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not a good index of "production" language usage, as described in that topic. I don't question that it's personally popular. It's also a great teaching language. I've seen no evidence of common usage for custom business applications (unless maybe <a href="AutoCad.html">AutoCad</a> is involved).  Look how many <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> topics there are on it: <a href="CategoryLisp.html">CategoryLisp</a>; it's a grand nerd conversation piece, cranking up its "mention" score. It's kind of like Lamborghini's: talked about far more often than purchased. <strong></strong><a href="TiobeIndex.html">TiobeIndex</a> would be like estimating the number of Lamborghini's <em>on the road</em> by counting web pages that mention them.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm pretty confident in estimating that less than one percent of commercial app code is in Lisp, and would guestimate the actual number is something like 1 in a 1000 lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What source of statistics -- outside of your inevitably-limited (and that's nothing personal -- all our personal experiences are limited) experience -- do you have for "common usage for custom business applications"?</em>

      <p>
        I don't have anything approaching an <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a>, but neither do you. It's anecdote against anecdote.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Be that as it may, the fact that we're debating LISP's significance over fifty years after its inception, </em>'and<strong> the fact that it ranks 13th on the </strong><a href="TiobeIndex.html">TiobeIndex</a>, <strong>and</strong> the fact that modern implementations like Clojure are growing in popularity, <strong>and</strong> the fact that its used as a scripting language in a variety of products, <strong>and</strong> the fact that some of its original concepts -- dynamic typing, higher-order functions, homoiconicity, functional programming -- have such an impact even on current products, means LISP lost nothing.  It won.  It didn't win by being a popular programming language like C# or Javascript.  Those will eventually diminish in popularity.  It won by being profoundly influential on <strong>every</strong> modern programming language, including C# and Javascript, and LISP will certainly influence the languages that follow them.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In short, if there was a </em><a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a> -- and I'm not sure there was -- LISP won.  Not by being a popular language, mind you, but by being influential on <strong>every</strong> popular language.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I wont deny it's had some influence on a lot of languages. However, that's not the same as taking over production languages and/or production code design (language features actually used, not necessarily what's included in the language). I've already described the problems with your reference to <a href="TiobeIndex.html">TiobeIndex</a> above. Lisp fans have been saying the mainstream breakthrough is <strong>"just around the corner"</strong> for several decades. I heard the same song and dance in the 1980's. It's like how religious groups keep predicting the immediate end of Earth, but we are still here. Semi-<a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>s are still in charge and still pre-package common abstractions and idioms of the domain/focus to make them <strong>more digestible to fungible staff</strong>. Whether that's good or bad, it's what the industry likes and keeps backing despite 50 years of Lisp's mega-meta capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are two simple reasons why LISP won't replace C# and Javascript: the perception that a festival of parentheses hurt readability, and the perception that prefix notation hurts readability.  The concepts it demonstrates, however, will endure far longer than the languages that adopt them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I do agree Lisp has what could be described "syntax issues", as partly described in <a href="MaspBrainstorming.html">MaspBrainstorming</a>. But that's not the entire problem. Over-meta-tizing mainstream languages or trying to introduce such a language has repeatedly failed to catch on and I see no reason why that would change. The forces causing it are still in place. JS is in a unique position in that it's kind of forced on the industry due to historical issues akin to QWERTY keyboards.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, the "syntax issues" are the entire problem.  The "over-meta-tizing" you deprecate is being adopted by other languages.  This will, no doubt, continue.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Until it becomes an expensive-specialist and convoluted product/stack, and then something like Html or VB comes along that's easy to for average developers to pick up quickly, and steal the market share from the it, and the cycle continues. The basic <a href="AlgolFamily.html">AlgolFamily</a> idioms continue to dominate in terms of actual code written even if a particular language has <em>additional</em> meta capabilities. (Somewhere on this wiki is a lost topic about how languages "past their prime" add on features to try to stay competitive in the feature brochure check-mark race, but that's not the same as actual feature usage.) {Text added after original dialog.} -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>HTML is a text markup language, closer to the old-skool wordprocessor Wordstar than a programming language, so it doesn't count.  You can't write programs in it.  It's true that "easy entry" languages do pick up a market share from professional languages, especially when a field is developing, but that's because beginners need an easy starting point and new fields attract a lot of beginners.  Such languages inevitably gain features -- i.e., more "meta-tizing" -- as their users grow more proficient.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't believe they become more meta-tized. If anything they become less meta-tized because the common idioms are included in a declarative way (like common GUI idioms SHOULD be in HTML or its offshoot). Making common activities be paint-by-numbers (like "Wizard" dialogs) is how they get people to pay for upgrades to the next version.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>C++ did not provide templates at first. Generics were added to Java. C# recently gained lambdas. "Meta-tizing" gets added because it adds power.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Often its a feature-bullet-point pissing match, perhaps unnecessary. MS wants to make C# more of a <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> language to compete with C/C++, not just an app language, and that's partly why they added it. Languages do tend to pick up clutter over time, and I'm not sure it's a good thing. C++ is known for its steep learning curve and piles of gotcha's. It has a few too many +'s.

           [Actually, one of the main reasons lambda expressions were added to C♯ is for use in LINQ, which is significantly more useful in application software than systems software. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
        <li>

           FP is kind of up in fad ranking right now, partly fueled by interest in parallel programming. Hopping on the bandwagon does happen. Besides most application developers <em>use</em> the LINQ libraries but do not write them themselves. Usage of a feature/API that is built on top of meta abilities is not quite the same as developers writing new code with meta capabilities. (Material added since original dialog.)

           LINQ-like technology may be better with strings/eval because then we can send the strings to other DB vendors without waiting for MS to write or fix their drivers. Strings are more sharable cross-platform/language than HOF's.

They'll write drivers for their own platforms, and publish the LINQ driver specification such that third parties can write LINQ drivers for <em>their</em> own platforms. (This is what they actually did. There's actually very in-depth tutorials on how to write your own LINQ queryables up on MSDN.) -DavidMcLean]
            </li>
            <li>
               And just when other vendors perfect their drivers, MS will change standards and produce Mink or Bink or Stink as the "new collections standard".

        It is true that "average" developers wag the industry's dog, but that's just the way it is. You need to see it from the economics and staffing perspective of org decision makers. Being frustrated that no support is given to higher-brow developers isn't productive. (I addressed the parenthesis issue above already.)

        <em>Us "high brow" developers aren't frustrated at all.  We typically make many times the salaries of mediocre developers and retire wealthy.  Nothing stops us from using the tools we prefer, and we succeed because we excel at using them.</em>

        Regardless, Mitt, there appear to not be enough of you to change the industry patterns. I've learned to avoid excess meta-tizing and indirection because of complaints about confusing follow-on developers.

      <p>
        <em>I don't want to change industry patterns.  It's </em>'you<strong> who seems to want languages that cater </strong>only<em>' to the lowest common denominator, developer-wise.  The rest of us are content to allow you to use as few features as you like, as long as that doesn't impinge on our ability to use features that are as powerful as we like.  Your concern for follow-on developers is laudable, but why do you assume they'll be incompetent?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They are not "incompetent", just often not skilled in meta techniques. You seem to be trying to paint a grey issue as black-or-white. There are plenty of developers who are quite productive under "regular" levels of abstraction. Sometimes they type more than necessary because of it, but that's their prerogative. Their code may be fairly tedious to maintain because of the duplication, but at least it's strait-forward: no drama, no weirdness, no <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> experiments.

        That kind of reminds me of the assault weapon debate. One side argues that "assault weapons" are too dangerous to allow regular citizens to own, while assault weapon proponents argue they are useful more often than they are misused or cause problems. Lisp is the ultimate assault weapon of languages: compact, accurate, reconfigurable, few parts, and rapid-volume fire.

        <strong>Part Time "Jack" Programmers</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A general trend in the industry is away from centralized specialists and toward "departmental generalists". In other words, instead of dividing up by skill, organizations are deciding that dividing up by organization structure (departmental) may be better, and to have a <strong>multi-hatter generalist IT person</strong>. An in-between division is "hardware" versus "software" where the hardware person does general trouble-shooting of hardware, OS, and basic installations; while the "software" person focuses on learning the department's purchased applications as a power-user-level trouble-shooter, a DBA, and a custom software developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that the person doing the programming will likely only be able to devote a fraction of his/her time to programming and the skill of programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not just about programmers being "dumb", it's that they are asked to be a <strong>jack of all IT trades</strong>, which makes them master of none.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perfectly reasonable.  Any skilled programmer who can't fix a PC, change printer toner and other gubbins, sort out network issues, make coffee, work with users, design a system, install a package, create a dynamic Web site, clean a keyboard, construct a database, and learn -- and quickly be productive in -- new languages, tools, and paradigms, should quit and take up knitting.  I don't know about you, but to me that's </em>'exactly<em>' what being a "skilled programmer" means.  As developers, we may be able to distinguish programming from printer repair, but the average user can't and is just looking for someone who is "good with computers."  So that's exactly what we should be.  The days are ending when all office work would stop to ring Tech Support and hope that the third or fourth call would finally get exactly the right kind of techie -- who, no matter how good he is, didn't have a clue who you were or what your office did -- to solve the (mysterious) computer problem at hand.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your suggestion that they master everything IT is unrealistic. Maybe a select few can, the Mozarts with photographic memories and speed-reading capabilities, but it takes experience for most to do things well. Without experience one wastes time getting stuck on gotcha's and poorly-documented corners. It's more economical to have in-house or rented specialists for the times when the generalist gets stuck. Your false Mozart-or-knitting dichotomy is silly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, it's not.  It's the skill profile of those who succeed in IT and keep their users happy.  And it's not as uncommon as you think; indeed, it's a typical "computer geek" profile.</em>

        From an economic standpoint, it doesn't make sense to pay a skilled specialist to do a semi-commodity activity that could be done by somebody who earns much less per hour. An extreme case is paying a $300/hr brain surgeon to clean and scrub his tools after surgeries. Cleaning would then cost the hospital $300/hr when it could cost them only about $20/hr. They would have to pass that extra cost on to consumers or patients. Whether a given person falls into that category has to be evaluated on a case by case basis. The human ego may mentally put oneself in that category, but outsiders may see it otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Medicine has not yet demanded, to use your phrase, "departmental generalists".  However, every brain surgeon knows how to clean and scrub his tools after surgeries.  It's an explicit part of his or her expertise, whether he or she does it regularly or not.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing how and actually performing something regularly are pretty much two different issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not in this case, or the IT case.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me clarify: should the surgeon know how to clean surgical tools? Yes. Should an established surgeon <em>regularly</em> clean his/her surgical tools? No. One could argue that he/she should still do it on occasion to keep in practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We're talking about IT, not surgery.  Specialisation in IT is baffling to non-IT people, who find it mysterious that the person who will write a program won't fix a printer and vice versa.  From a non-IT point of view, it's all computers, isn't it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no specialties within "computers"? I find that a rather curious claim. Anyhow, if it takes the programmer 3 times longer than the experienced shop "hardware guy" to fix the printer, then it may not be <strong>economical</strong> to the org for the programmer to fiddle with it. It's probably good to keep your skills fresh by trying variety, but that can be taken too far.
      </p>
      <p>
        [There indeed are no specialities within the domain of "computers", <em>from a non-IT point of view</em>. In general, non-IT people don't recognise a distinction between "hardware guys", "software guys", etc., generally collapsing them under umbrella terms like a simple "computer guy" moniker. It's obvious to us that there's a difference between skill with hardware and skill with software, but it's not obvious to the rest of the world. -DavidMcLean]

        <strong>Why So Long?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        HOF's have been around for about 50 years (longer if include the fact that in machine language you can "point to" a subroutine.) So why would they be mostly excluded from mainstream "production" languages for 50 years and suddenly mainstream programmers are allegedly ready for them <strong>now and only now</strong>? Did the Internet change something specific? What? What Great Switch suddenly flipped? And why didn't the Lisp fad spike of the 80's trigger it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Much of the industry was diverted into achieving language productivity through IDE evolution, rather than language evolution, until Javascript and Ruby -- both heavily influenced by LISP -- demonstrated that higher-order capabilities were worthwhile outside of functional languages.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By the way, the fact that machine language can "point to" a subroutine is not the same as a higher-order function.  A higher-order function captures its calling scope.  A subroutine generally does not.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I still believe their semi-prominence is a temporary blip until IDE-centric or a GUI markup language standard pre-packages GUI idioms. It's a blip comparable to C++ for Windows GUI's heyday until VB, Delphi, MS-Access, etc. came along. The VB desktop approach to low-budget in-house apps was very popular and appeared to be solid until the Web's deployment ease bit into it. Shops didn't go web because web was easier to develop and maintain with existing or fungible staff, but because it reduced deployment costs and <a href="DllHell.html">DllHell</a>, which really ate up help-desk time. But, we'll see. (It's not that I love VB, but shops in generally sure did, minus deployment issues.) What the industry really wants is something like VB without the deployment issues. <strong>Shops are spending waaaay to much time on UI fiddling</strong>. Something has to give.  -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course, VB and Delphi are still there for the shops that love them.  If developers are frustrated with Web UI fiddling, they appear to be missing an opportunity to fill a market void with a profitable product.  But then, why aren't Web application builders catching on?  Google "web application builder" to see acres of software that you've probably never seen before.  Maybe it's because developers are realising that drag-n-drop interface builders with limited languages aren't as productive as powerful languages on their own.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I will agree with that last sentence generally. However, it doesn't matter enough for a combo of staffing and behavioral reasons already discussed. The industry repeatedly votes for pre-packaged idioms (be it IDE's or markup or DSL's). "Meta-friendly" languages often lead the bleeding edge, but pre-packaged idioms usually follow closely behind when the patterns become less murky. The web side has just been later than normal to finish the cycle. I suspect it's partly due to a misguided obsession with MVC. I have plenty of gripes about certain drag-and-drop IDE's and limited meta ability also, I would note. (Deployment of desktop apps is still a problem.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is the lateness of the Web side to finish the cycle really because it's later than normal, or because there's a permanent shift away from pre-packaged idioms to "meta-friendly" languages?  Are meta-friendly facilities, in fact, the new pre-packaged idioms?  Time will tell.  As for MVC, I'm surprised you're concerned with the apparent obsession thereof.  After all, aren't your favourite technologies the ultimate expression of MVC?  I.e., model = database, view = UI, controller = code?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that's one possibility. However, many programmers I know gripe about the <a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a>. <strong>I see no love</strong>, other than from highly-paid Web UI specialists for trendy public front-ends. Many turned to Flash to get better control and consistency, but Apple, MS, & Google are trying to kill it now. As far as MVC, it perhaps has multiple interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed, I see no particular love for the raw </em><a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a> either. Love starts with languages and tools that wrap it, like Javascript and jQuery.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the features/idioms <em>could be</em> packaged into something easier to digest. VB's timer case in point: drag the timer object with the stop-watch icon onto the form, right-click to set properties (cycle duration), double click to open the event code editor, and type in the code that repeats. (The right-click and double-click are standard IDE behaviors in VB. There's other shortcuts also not mentioned here.) No "naked" HOF's or other implementation guts sticking out and no need to dig in manuals for setup and parameter syntax etc. Even a drunk programmer can do it. The markup version shown in BradyBunchDiscussion(?) is almost as easy.  -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's fine when the "packaged" materials precisely suit requirements.  Unfortunately, they rarely do, and that's why we have higher-order functions and other mechanisms to help define what isn't pre-packaged.  Drag'n'drop forms and click-able property lists encourage human interaction, which is an inefficient way to implement customisation and (especially) automate repetitive tasks.  Language encourages automation; drag'n'drop interfaces do not.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        HOF's don't provide any new functionality that cannot be done some other way (unless the root or base system is built around them.) A code "design" improvement is perhaps debatable, but do versus not-able-to-do is another thing. At the very least, we have <a href="TuringEquivalency.html">TuringEquivalency</a>. Generally the "idiom machine" will handle roughly 80% of our needs, and the rest needs to be custom coded. Ideally primitives or lower-level building blocks are available such that one can diddle individual bits or pixels if need be for special cases. You have not presented a CBA case where they offer a significant improvement (outside of client and <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a>-specific idiosyncrasies).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's true -- HOFs don't provide functionality that cannot be done some other way.  But, by the same token, 'for' loops don't provide functionality that cannot be done with 'while' loops, and we don't really need 'while' loops when we've got gotos. Functions & procedures aren't necessary -- they don't provide functionality that cannot be done with masses of in-line code.  All you </em>really<em> need are gotos, 'if' statements -- no 'else' required -- I/O, variables and simple expressions.  We don't even need multiply and divide; we can construct them from repeated addition or subtraction.  Sounds like 6502 assembly language, doesn't it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Obviously, 6502 assembly is no longer a reasonable tool for developing business applications.  For the same reason, "primitives or lower-level building blocks [that] are available such that one can diddle individual bits or pixels if need be for special cases" aren't reasonable either.  Lower-level facilities are more complex, more awkward, and generally riskier in terms of reliability than higher-level abstractions.  High-level abstractions are preferred, precisely because they make it easier to achieve reliable functionality than lower-level constructs.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Even if HOFs only offered a significant improvement in client-specific and </em><a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a>-specific cases, that alone would be a reasonable justification for HOFs. Client-specific and <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a>-specific cases <strong>do</strong> appear when developing business software, and it's better to have facilities to easily and reliably handle them than not.<em></em>

To summarise: The use of objects to inject executable customisations into an algorithm, i.e., <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>, is semantically equivalent to the use of first-class functions to inject executable customisations into an algorithm, but syntactically more verbose. The syntactic overhead makes many common higher-order function patterns a lot less convenient, and the semantic equivalence means that passing the customisation in an object <em>isn't</em> going to be any more familiar. The developer must equally understand the concept, utility, and implications of passing blocks of code through the application whether the functionality is a first-class language feature or is "faked" through <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> techniques. Finally, there is no greater flexibility in the ability to attach attributes to an object, because functions have the same capability (as described in <a href="TopOnAbstraction.html">TopOnAbstraction</a>) and in any case a large subset of the attributes you'd <em>want</em> on a <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> can simply be captured in its closure without explicitly declaring them. -DavidMcLean]

My professional background and continuing professional connections are with software companies and forward-thinking (as opposed to those who grudgingly endure IT as a cost of doing business) IT departments, which are often eager to create their own software to sell, or to gain competitive advantage over companies who use off-the-shelf software.

           Re: "Seek your abilities": having optimization projects going on in them (separate from what I do) would not prevent my hire. The same filtering mechanism that applies to you (above) would not apply to me since a mutually-exclusive build-versus-buy choice would affect their evaluation of me because I don't specialize in optimization. If they were using OTS for such, the programming pool(s) I encounter probably would not be involved and thus I wouldn't see such usage. If on the other hand, many org's did roll-their-own optmizers, I'd see those pools working on it even IF I wasn't directly involved in such projects. If my special is custom X's, then that directly affects how often I'll see off-the-shelf X's. However, if my specialty is Y, then that will have little if any impact on the ratio of custom X's versus off-shelf X's. Make sense? If they want a competitive advantage by rolling everything themselves, why not also roll their own word processors, OS's, spreadsheet software, etc? Why only roll optimization tools?  Most developers are looking for a job, not stock options anyhow.

Vertical market software is far less generic, and far more coupled to business-specific infrastructure, data models, tools, and so on.  It's hard to obtain a competitive advantage with a new spreadsheet package, because the new package will be just like the old one and just as integrated (or not) into the corporate infrastructure.  A new scheduling and timetabling package that ties directly into staff and student record systems, and handles a university-specific way in which rooms and timeslots are rotated, could definitely represent either a significant competitive advantage or a significant efficiency gain.  As for HOFs, even if you never need them to inject customisations into business algorithms, the trend in UIs and UI frameworks is toward greater customisation and greater higher-order capability.  Unless your apps don't have user-interfaces, you're going to have to get used to using HOFs and other higher-order functionality.</em>

Ruby and JS don't produce anything as simple as <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a>, because they can mix/use different delimiters, nesting characters, etc. in rather arbitrary ways, hard-wiring say square brackets at nesting level 3, parenthesis at level 4, curly braces at level 5, etc. It's ugly and confusing, offering huge potential for write-only code abuse.

Both languages associate delimiters with specific built-in constructs: square brackets for arrays, parentheses for grouping (and invocation, in JS), and curly braces for blocks (and object literals, in JS). About the only complaint you could make is that JS reuses the same delimiters for two purposes, but parentheses for invocation/grouping are an accepted convention of all C-style languages, and it's obvious from context whether braces are used to indicate a literal or a block. (In addition, there's <a href="CoffeeScript.html">CoffeeScript</a>'s rule that braces <em>always</em> mean object literals, if JS's conflation is really that big an issue.) It's impossible to abuse these delimiters for write-only code, because developers have no control or customisation of the delimiters required at any "level", because they're strictly associated with language constructs. -DavidMcLean]

You don't "have" arrays and don't "have" blocks, but rather DO block-ish things or DO array-ish things to any structure.

If we only look at HOF's and only look at them for semi-occasional usage, it may not matter much (and in such cases, OO is good enough anyhow in my opinion). As far as the inclusion of certain abstraction tools in languages, just because they are available does not mean they should be used in all or most cases. Just because it's possible to give every foot soldier a nuke does not mean the military SHOULD give every foot soldier a nuke (or approve their frequent use). <strong>High abstraction gives bad or evil programmers more room to blow up the base camp</strong> (such as jamming up a project because current staff cannot grok the code to fix or add a key feature.) Low-brow repetition is often the lessor of two evils. I'm just the observant messenger.

It has hints of MASP-ness (<a href="MaspBrainstorming.html">MaspBrainstorming</a>). The C-style may just shrink and be replaced with XML-syntax-based programming. If most of your work is assigning values to attributes, then an XML-style may work better than C-style, which is either crappy or dialect-inconsistent at mass attribute supplying, especially if we want named slots.

As far as XML versus <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a>, there are already long topics on that. Note that in my opinion XML is usually easier to read even though it's more verbose.
