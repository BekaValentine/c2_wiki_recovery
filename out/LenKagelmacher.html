        I'm employed at Computer Task Group Inc.[1], a large computer consulting firm based in Buffalo, N.Y.  There I
        administer approximately 800 Internet user accounts.  We're looking for
        ways to attract our remaining 3500 employees to participate
        in this wonderful medium.  I think you guys may have hit on
        just the idea: collaborative projects on the Net.  WOW!!
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests lie in UNIX, Internet services, foreign languages
        (German, Russian), computer chess, running (10 marathons),
        and anything that fosters communications -- like this!
