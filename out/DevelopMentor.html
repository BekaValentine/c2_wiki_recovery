        Home of "Guerilla COM," and heavy advertising of the same.
        <em>(So if you know any guerillas who need to use COM...  ;-)</em>

        A few years ago I attended their <strong><em>"Essential COM(+): for C++ programmers"</em></strong> course and was very satisfied with it.
        It was the best course I could find on COM -- for programmers who are <strong>*NOT*</strong> neck deep in GUI code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(Everyone else was teaching variations of the Microsoft course, which assumes you're "trying to make a </em><a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> forms-based GUI business application" in C++ with MFC.)<em></em>

        They do good work.
