        I started to wonder, are we trying to reach some sterile and dry state in the middle? With rubbish, poetry and strange languages on the borders? Seems scary to me. Don't know why. It's like a tree that is turning to stone from inside. Cold and hard. -- <a href="GirtsKalnins.html">GirtsKalnins</a>

        I think the trick is to have writing that is engaging and lively, but also straightforward. It can be a difficult balance. On one hand, you don't want to be so dull and pedantic that people fall asleep. On the other hand, you don't want to be so misty and metaphorical that further discussion can gain no purchase. -- <a href="FrancisHwang.html">FrancisHwang</a>

        In shiny summer days like this, I believe there is less valuable contents on internet. Or content on internet is less valuable. <em>2004-05-20</em>

        Writing code is great, reading as well. I'm so much more relaxed about doing that now, than when I immersed into Wiki in the start of 21st century. And after a decade of being pro, it's nice to have software as a very important aspect of self. Also goals and expression is more important than process and correctness. <em>2011-03-02</em>

        Been looking into <a href="AgileSoftwareDevelopment.html">AgileSoftwareDevelopment</a> again lately. It's gone from development to project managment. Or checklist management. <em>2013-07-17</em>
