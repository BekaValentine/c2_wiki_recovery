        Stl Is Not The Cpp Standard Library
      </h1>
      <p>
        People often refer to the ANSI-<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> standard library and the <a href="StandardTemplateLibrary.html">StandardTemplateLibrary</a> as if they are one and the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are <strong>not</strong>.  Nor is one a subset of the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="StandardTemplateLibrary.html">StandardTemplateLibrary</a> is a collection of generic classes (useful in statically-typed languages with generics) originally developed for <a href="AdaLanguage.html">AdaLanguage</a>, and ported over to C++ in the 90s.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The C++ standard library didn't truly come into existence until the publication of the ANSI C++ standard in 1998.  Before that, there were libraries described by the AnnotatedReferenceManual; some of which (iostream, etc.) were widely used and some of which (the ARM container classes) generally weren't.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Standard Library was developed as part of the standard; a big chunk of the STL was made part of the Standard Library.  Some key features (such as the hashed containers) were <em>not</em> made part of the standard C++ library (though hash_map and the like come with virtually all C++ implementations).  But the Standard Library contains lots of things (iostreams again, the exception hierarchy, complex, etc.) that aren't and never were part of the STL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rumor has it that more of the STL (including the hash containers) will be added to the C++ standard library when the newest version of the C++ standard gets published.  In addition, parts of the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a> are being considered for C++ standardization.  But not all of the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a>; it will be just as wrong to claim that <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a> == the standard library when that occurs.
