        It's actually supposed to be an exact <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> implementation. You can use it to print your files on your non-<a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>-capable printer, but a cooler approach is to use it as a more-or-less ordinary programming language. If you start it with `gs', it will show a prompt at which you can enter <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> commands, and a window in which you see the result of drawing commands.

        Written by <a href="PeterDeutsch.html">PeterDeutsch</a>, who invented <a href="JustInTimeCompilation.html">JustInTimeCompilation</a> and applied it to the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> in 1983, producing the first implementation of Smalltalk that could run fast enough on cheap hardware. Peter could very well be the best <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> implementor in the world. So, it is not surprising that he wrote a good <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> implementation.

        These days, GhostScript is much more than simply a <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> interpreter. It also handles <a href="PortableDocumentFormat.html">PortableDocumentFormat</a> files, and does a number of interesting bits of TransCoding, including <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> to PDF, which is essentially the function of Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product.

        That said, GhostScript has a number of serious weaknesses, including generally poor <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a>, and also a messy, uneven collection of drivers for printers. I'm really hoping to see things improve on both counts. -- <a href="RaphLevien.html">RaphLevien</a>

        Raph didn't mention that he took over the maintainership of GhostScript: <a href="http://www.artofcode.com/ghostscript/openletter.html">http://www.artofcode.com/ghostscript/openletter.html</a> <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> 20090509 which is not so surprising as this was last edited in 2003.

        <a href="GhostScript.html">GhostScript</a> has since gone through many releases.
