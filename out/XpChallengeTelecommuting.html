        You're consulting to a multinational with development groups from here to Kalamazoo. Three of these groups want to tap your expertise for a codevelopment that is very important to each. Trouble is, the three groups are in Timbuktu, Podunk, and Murcheson Sound. Logistics make it difficult for you to spend much time with all three in person, and impossible for each to work independently. Worst, the multinational wants to use this telecommuting technology they've heard so much about.

        Could XP be successful here?

        It seems to me that <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> works because it forces constant communication between the team members.  The face-to-face communication substitutes for a lot of formal process that other groups use.  Interactive communication is better for a team than emailing questions and answers back and forth.  And finally, isn't <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> supposed to increase your productivity so that you don't need large teams of people? -- <a href="SusanJohnson.html">SusanJohnson</a>

        It is possible that nothing can be successful here.  The question is
        what "work independently" means.  Distributed development often fails.
        The trick is to reduce communication requirements as much as possible.
        Don't divide your project with "analysis and design in Timbuktu", 
        "coding in Podunk" and "systems integration and testing in Murcheson 
        Sound".  Don't divide it as "database design in Timbuktu", "GUI design
        in Podunk", and "business logic in Murcheson Sound".  If you can make
        it be something like "patient records in Timbuktu", "insurance management
        in Podunk", and "medical imaging system in Murcheson Sound" then perhaps
        there is a chance.  Break the project into pieces and let one piece of
        the project be a customer of the other.  This would let pair programming
        happen within each group, but not force you to do it between groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        How good are the communication channels?  An alternative might be to do 
        pair programming across the Atlantic.  If you had two-way high-speed 
        video links and a fancy windowing system where you could see what was 
        on someone else's screen then this might work.  Time zone differences
        will make this be a problem.  On the other hand, if each site has some
        people who prefer to work 5-2 and others who prefer to work 12-8 then
        you would already have this problem.  You might require people to sign
        up for one of six time-periods (24 hours divided by 4 hours is 6) and
        require that all pair-programming be with someone in a different group.
        This would tend to spread expertise.  So, if I am in the 8am-4pm EST
        group (which would suit me well, since I am in the midwest and prefer
        things early) then I would work with Europeans in the morning and 
        Californians in the afternoon.

        One problem with treating the whole project as a single development
        organization is that it would be hard to have a <a href="StandupMeeting.html">StandupMeeting</a>.

        There may be some technical support for <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>:  Imagine that I have two links, audio and digital, to my partner.  The audio is a simple hands-off phone connection.  The digital takes the form of one of these PC-Closeup type things, where I can drive your machine from mine.  After all, the pairs work seems to focus on each of us having the same machine to work on. -- <a href="MichaelHill.html">MichaelHill</a>

        I share Ralph's concerns about this one.  Was thinking that the thing to do was to change strategy from C++ to Smalltalk and let everyone go except in whichever location is closest to Ann Arbor.  But seriously, folks, distributed projects are gonna be hard!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Speaking as someone presently involved in a distributed project, though in mostly a single timezone, I can say that, yes, distributed projects are hard. Video-conferencing is far from all it's cracked up to be, and shared windows/whiteboards are simply not as high bandwidth as a physical conference room. I believe distributed </em><a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> ought to be possible if the pair have some experience with it, but the real problem is keeping a common mental map of the development. Even meeting once a day, it's easy for distributed groups' assumptions, priorities, and connotations to diverge. <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> will help this, but I'm interested in how things like <a href="ExtremePlanning.html">ExtremePlanning</a> might help too.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't believe, so long as you have the language skills, that distributed development is harder in C++ than in Smalltalk. Using a merging source repository like </em><a href="CyclicCvs.html">CyclicCvs</a>, <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> or SourceSafeFive enables <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> and then the other XP dynamics ought to be adaptable too. But C++ is the subject of <a href="ExtremeProgrammingChallengeSeven.html">ExtremeProgrammingChallengeSeven</a> ...<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I should also add an amen on the responsibility/geography splitup Ralph describes - by feature-set rather than by toolset or subsystem. Otherwise you're looking at compartmentalized expertise and very serious integration issues.</em> -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        So is there any consensus about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> (<em>XP</em>) working in an environment where team members are not <a href="CoLocated.html">CoLocated</a>? Has anyone tried XP with <a href="NonCoLocated.html">NonCoLocated</a> teams?
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is definitely a plus. But can XP work without it? Should XP work without it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Even better, can <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> be done when the pair is geographically separated? With technology, remote PC control would solve the <em>slide the keyboard</em> dilemma. Could a telephone or PC based video conferencing solution solve the communication issues that the pair would face?
      </p>
      <p>
        I would be real interested in any experience that anyone has had with this. I talked with <a href="LaurieWilliams.html">LaurieWilliams</a> (email actually) about this and she agrees that it should work but didn't know of any actual experiences. She did ask for volunteers for a study though ;-) -- <a href="AndyFutrell.html">AndyFutrell</a>

        I believe this will work too. So much so that I'm about to trial it in my organisation. We're planning to use something like <a href="NetMeeting.html">NetMeeting</a> to share desktops across locations and to allow developers "slide the keyboard" from one site to another. We're thinking about using audio conferencing across the net too. I reckon the <a href="NonCoLocated.html">NonCoLocated</a> <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> thing is gonna be easier to fix than having business in one location and developers on the other side of the country (UK) :-( -- <a href="TonyStansfield.html">TonyStansfield</a>
