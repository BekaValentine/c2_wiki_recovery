        I have built many applications over the years primarily using the following language(s):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="VbScript.html">VbScript</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most recently however, I have landed a role within the practice of <a href="EnterpriseArchitecture.html">EnterpriseArchitecture</a>.  All I can say for the moment is that I am certainly enjoying a brand new set of opportunities and challenges associated with taking a holistic approach to strategy development spanning the business, information, application and technical architectures of an organization.  It also a very interesting role considering I am a consultant on an assignment that is filling a variable resource position as guess what, a consultant (to my client's enterprise)!  Good stuff so far...
