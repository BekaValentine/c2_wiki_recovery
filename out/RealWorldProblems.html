      <p>
        <a href="RealWorldProblems.html">RealWorldProblems</a> are exemplified by the way the nasty little details of reality conspire to bite theoreticians on the ass when the theoretician actually tries to do something non-theoretical.  Typical example from physics:  1) assume a massless rope and a frictionless pulley are used by a physicist to lift a big weight...  Result from the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> when the theoretician actually tries it with a rope that has mass and a pulley that has friction... dead theoretician.

        In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they differ...
