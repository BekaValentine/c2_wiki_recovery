        Cardboard Analyst

      <p>
        Faced with a scarcity of people available to grab for <a href="DebugByDescribing.html">DebugByDescribing</a> sessions,
        one engineering organization acquired a <a href="CardboardAnalyst.html">CardboardAnalyst</a> from a local video store.

        <em>Why is that developer trying to explain two-phase commit to a big cardboard wookie?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Don't ask.</em>

        It is not unusual to be helping someone by listening to their tale of woe when all of a sudden they proclaim <strong>AHA I know what it is</strong> and suddenly you have been turned into a <a href="CardboardAnalyst.html">CardboardAnalyst</a>.

        And nice people say "Thank you" before hacking away on their keyboards. :)

        <em>Or </em>after<em> hacking away on their keyboards. It wouldn't do for them to forget whatever they just realized by doing something else before using it, such as calling a thank-you routine that potentially overwrites the register it's sitting in! Lack of register-saving around nested calls seems to be a design flaw in whatever it is that we were compiled with.</em>

        I wonder why we have to talk to activate our thinking. Just thinking in my mind is not 
        effective as talking though the same issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talking through an issue -- rather than just thinking about it -- certainly helps. This is simply because one is using a different part of one's brain when talking a problem through.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For me it's helpful because I'm forced to be aware of when I'm skipping over something. It's too easy to gloss over a potentially important issue when it's just in my head.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It marshals resources in the left temporal lobe and recruits them into the problem solving. That's a sizable chunk of grey matter. Using it might temporarily double your IQ. Hence my talking to myself during problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unless you have an undeveloped </em>TheoryOfMind, you know that other people don't have the understanding of the problem that you do, meaning that you have to 
        explain non-obvious things. However, those non-obvious things weren't in active memory; you knew them but you weren't thinking with them. Now they're in active memory, you know the answer.<em></em>
