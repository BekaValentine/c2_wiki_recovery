        Mental Totems
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Totem is something that shows to people that they belong to the same group.
      </p>
      <p>
        A totem can be something worn, such as an icon, or a color.  
      </p>
      <p>
        But there are also Totems in the head - believing in something because everyone you know and respect believes in it.  By accepting without question this belief, you show that you belong to the same group that they do.
