        Anonymous Contributors And Contributions
      </h1>
      <p>
        In Apr05 I saw a statement in a sister site where the administrator said:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Anonymous contributions</em>' are welcomed. </strong>Anonymous contributors<em>' are not.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Do we have something similar on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>? I am aware Ward has previously stated the preference for anon contributions to be unsigned, but it is not the same as the above statement.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Is Wards preference based on the preference for <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> pages? Whilst there is a discussion of content going on, people need to be identified, even if temporarily, so the proper context is kept. Any one objects to that line of thinking?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I suppose the statement was made due to experience that "new anonymous contributors" often resist compliance to existing <a href="WikiSocialNorms.html">WikiSocialNorms</a>, and many even enjoy debating as an end in itself.

        BTW there are a lot of pages on identities, user names, etc and I think interested and capable (rules me out) community members should get together to do a lot of <a href="RefactorByCondensingConversation.html">RefactorByCondensingConversation</a>. We need good and balanced guidance for new members of the community who can use <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a>s.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <a href="RegularContributors.html">RegularContributors</a>, Ward clearly states: <em>Finally, in a few cases it wasn't clear to me who made the contributions so I identified the pages with the author's host machine. There is nothing wrong with being anonymous.</em>
      </p>

        <a href="AnonymousOnPurpose.html">AnonymousOnPurpose</a> for now. But regulars know who I am.
