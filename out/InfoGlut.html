        <a href="InfoGlut.html">InfoGlut</a> is basically unprocessed, badly processed, or irrelevant information. When people have to deal with <a href="InfoGlut.html">InfoGlut</a>, they cannot absorb it, feel that it is incoherent or are overwhelmed by a whole bunch of superfluous detail.  Think of it as a metaphor for unnecessary fat (glut) but for information.

      <p>
        <a href="InfoGlut.html">InfoGlut</a> is NOT <a href="InformationOverload.html">InformationOverload</a>.  Even if the information is well processed and presented (Ha!), people can be overwhelmed by a large amount of information to absorb.  People usually find it easier to absorb large amounts of well presented and processed information versus a large amount of equivalent <a href="InfoGlut.html">InfoGlut</a>.
