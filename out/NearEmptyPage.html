        Near Empty Page
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="NearEmptyPage.html">NearEmptyPage</a> is a question - it's asking whether an idea resonates with someone here or not. If it doesn't resonate with you personally, fine, leave it be. If the page stays empty for a few weeks or months, then by all means delete it. Otherwise just you <a href="FixYourWiki.html">FixYourWiki</a> and give these other seeds of signal time to flower.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm not sure what I think of this. I haven't been deleting new, </em><a href="NearEmptyPage.html">NearEmptyPage</a>s myself. But perhaps it should be incumbent on the starter of a new page to actually make an effort to justify that page's existence right from the start. I'm thinking, for example, of <a href="IllusionOfChaos.html">IllusionOfChaos</a>, which seems to me to stem from a "Throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks" approach.<em></em>

      <p>
        <em>I'm reminded of the complaint of a friend who worked at a literary journal in college: "Good poetry can be short, but we get so many bad poems here because people think they can just dash stuff off and submit ten at a time."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes page title could be the reason for deleting, if it's inconsistent with page contents page looks much more doubtful. What should people with weaker command of <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a> do in this case?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you have weak command of a language, then you shouldn't try to write short, pithy sayings in it. I was always wordier and less clever when I was living in Spain; yet the tradeoffs were worth the experience of communicating with others.</em>
        Or, you could do your best, explain what you're trying to say, and ask for help from someone else. Pages can be renamed easily, especially new ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point made is not about what the page contains, but the right of the poster to have the page seen by those other than the viewers of a single, or a few days.  Perhaps if you feel you must delete such a page and it is new, let it roll off of the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> first.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The impression I get is that some people want to delete </em><a href="NearEmptyPage.html">NearEmptyPage</a>s because they don't feel like the page presents anything new, and is just sort of rambling. Obviously, the line between "rambling non-idea" and "undeveloped idea with potential" is highly subjective, but so is everything else here on Wiki.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I will also say that too many people here place too much importance on starting new pages and contributing new content -- and not as much on less visible behavior like contributing to existing pages, and refactoring other people's content. I would even go so far as to say that one could fairly put a "burden of proof" against all new pages: All new pages should prove their right to exist or they are fair game for deletion. (I'd also say that the burden should be relatively forgiving, but a page like </em><a href="IllusionOfChaos.html">IllusionOfChaos</a> seems like it would hardly pass such a test.)<em></em>
