        <strong>Observations made</strong>

      <p>
        The article at <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/business/28210-print.shtml">http://www.theherald.co.uk/business/28210-print.shtml</a> quoted a study that some Scots have chosen to migrate to Dublin to make a living, as the corporate culture is more relaxed, professional, flexible and supportive. Perhaps a Decentralized Organization could aim to win back the individual creativity lost through implementation of rigid policies by management at remote locations.

        The author went on to using Harvard U to illustrate his case. Has anyone got information in the 6-8 years since his article, whether educational institutions are indeed much more decentralized?
