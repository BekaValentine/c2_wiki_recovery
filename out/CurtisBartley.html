      <p>
        I'm a software engineer in Seattle, Washington.  Currently (May 2003) I'm working part time as a research assistant at the Human Interface Technology Lab at the University of Washington.  My most recent real job was at Tangis, where we did software for wearable computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to Tangis, I worked at a company called Netpodium which was acquired by INTERVU, which was in turn acquired by Akamai.  It's just as well that I never did get my INTERVU business cards.  Whose idea was it to supply business cards in lots of 400, anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past I worked for a startup called Dimension X, which was acquired by Microsoft, and that's how I ended up in Seattle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Dimension X, I worked at a little company in Dallas, Texas called Altsys.  Altsys probably didn't qualify as a startup by the time I got there because they were making a ton of money licensing <a href="FreeHand.html">FreeHand</a> to Aldus.  Then came the Adobe-Aldus merger, and Altsys got bought by Macromedia.
      </p>

        I used to do a lot of coding in C++, but for the last couple of years I've been programming mostly in Java.  When I'm doing quick and dirty stuff or I just want to program for fun I usually use Python.  Unlike many of Wiki's participants, I have historically been involved in the shrinkwrap application side of the business.  Now I'm learning about distributed applications, databases, and reliability.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a website at <a href="http://www.almostinfinite.com">http://www.almostinfinite.com</a> and I can be reached by e-mail at <a href="mailto:cbar1@almostinfinite.com.">mailto:cbar1@almostinfinite.com.</a>  Right now the website is just a place to put my online resume and to hang a semi-permanent e-mail address off of.  One of these days I may put some more interesting stuff there, but I'd recommend that nobody hold their breath.

        Since you asked for feedback if we read far enough: I looked at <a href="OneRealWorldLoggingSystem.html">OneRealWorldLoggingSystem</a> and found it pretty interesting. <em>Thanks. -- cb.</em>

        Hi Curtis!  No I'm not at Macromedia any more, I've updated my home page with my latest news.  The <a href="MsWiki.html">MsWiki</a> link on your site is broken.  I'm interested in alternate <a href="WikiUserInterface.html">WikiUserInterface</a> and would like to check it out.  --<a href="SarahAllen.html">SarahAllen</a> <em>Calling it a website is being overly generous.  The </em><a href="MsWiki.html">MsWiki</a> link never went anywhere.  However, if you go back to that page (<a href="http://www.almostinfinite.com/preprocess.htm)">http://www.almostinfinite.com/preprocess.htm)</a> and do a view source, you can see some of the example mark-up and JScript to automatically format it.  -- cb<em></em>
