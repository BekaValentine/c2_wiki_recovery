        Critical Resource Flow
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Pattern Name:</strong> <a href="CriticalResourceFlow.html">CriticalResourceFlow</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Aliases:</strong> Get Enough To Eat, Don't Try To Do Too Much
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> System functions are working well enough for now. But
        new objectives are being considered that will require the use of
        dedicated resources that are most likely being used elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> No resources are available to divert to the new
        objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong> The current system is probably not using all of
        its resources at highest efficiency. The minimum amount of resources
        to support existing functions is unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Determine the minimum amount of resources required to
        sustain the current system as it stands. Locate inefficiencies and wasted
        effort so that resources can be diverted to the new objectives. Locate
        poor communication, transport, and control channels and upgrade them.
        Ensure that current resource flow is operating at maximum efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong> The new objectives do not create undue stress
        and hardship for the system in its current configuration. The slight
        (we hope) shuffling that occurred has actually invigorated that system
        as a whole, potentially galvanizing it to be ready for the new objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Design Rationale:</strong> Having new objectives is a good idea every now
        and then, just for the sake of shaking up the sleepy parts of the system.
        It is good practice to find the limits of the system's capabilities so
        that unrealistic objectives are avoided. If this is a regular practice,
        then when hard times require a new strategy, the system is accustomed
        to inspecting itself and adapting.

        A Checkup before Traveling Internationally, Using a Personal Trainer to get
        ready for a Race.
