        Open Firmware is essentially a specification for a largely machine-independent BIOS based on the <a href="AnsForth.html">AnsForth</a> standard that is capable of probing and initializing plug-in cards that have on-board IEEE-1275 compliant Fcode in their ROMs. It was invented by MitchBradley to aid in debugging recalcitrant hardware at Sun. It is found in Sun, IBM, <a href="PowerMacintosh.html">PowerMacintosh</a>, and <a href="OneLaptopPerChild.html">OneLaptopPerChild</a> systems.  
      </p>

        Sun has now made their implementation <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>: <a href="OpenBoot.html">OpenBoot</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An effort to create an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> open firmware exists: the OpenBIOS project - <a href="http://www.openbios.org/.">http://www.openbios.org/.</a> While not being completely done, it has successfully booted Linux and MacOS (9 and X).

        It also has a theme song (sung by the inventor of <a href="OpenFirmware.html">OpenFirmware</a>, MitchBradley): <a href="http://playground.sun.com/1275/misc/ofwsong.au">http://playground.sun.com/1275/misc/ofwsong.au</a>

        As of 2006, the new Intel (x86-64)-based <a href="AppleMacintosh.html">AppleMacintosh</a><strong>'es use Intel's </strong>ExtendedFirmwareInterface rather than Open Firmware. One was able to give a <a href="PowerMacintosh.html">PowerMacintosh</a> owner a harmless but most amusing scare by holding down Command-Option-O-F when booting his computer... (see <a href="http://www.kernelthread.com/mac/osx/arch_boot.html).">http://www.kernelthread.com/mac/osx/arch_boot.html).</a>

        "The IEEE-1275 Open Firmware standard was not reaffirmed by the OFWG and has been officially withdrawn by IEEE."

      <p>
        Does this mean the project is essentially dead?
