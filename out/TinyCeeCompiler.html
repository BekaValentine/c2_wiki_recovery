        Tiny Cee Compiler
      </h1>
      <p>
        FabriceBellard's <a href="TinyCeeCompiler.html">TinyCeeCompiler</a> is at  <a href="http://tinycc.org/">http://tinycc.org/</a> ( <a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc">http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc</a> ) - it is a very small and very fast <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> compiler which can either be used from the command line, or embedded as libtcc in an application so that it can be used to compile <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> code for delayed or immediate execution. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="DeeLanguage.html">DeeLanguage</a> interface to libtcc is included in the <a href="LanguageMachine.html">LanguageMachine</a>, where there is a proof-of-concept implementation of a calculator ruleset in which each expression is translated to <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> code, compiled by libtcc and immediately executed to give a result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently FabriceBellard wrote a boostrap loader for the <a href="LinuxKernel.html">LinuxKernel</a> which compiles the kernel from source as part of the loading process as a way of demonstrating that the compiler is pretty fast, and that it can deal with the kind of <a href="GnuCee.html">GnuCee</a> that is used in the <a href="LinuxKernel.html">LinuxKernel</a>
