        Email Hurdle
      </h1>
      <p>
        I get too much spam.
        Perhaps if sending spam were more difficult, I would get less of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>principles of the ideal email hurdle</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the hurdle makes it impossible for anyone to send millions of emails per day.
        </li>
        <li>
           invisible to end users -- sending a few emails per day is no more difficult than it used to be.
        </li>
        <li>
           Strangers pay, friends fly free. (Eric S. Johansson, Keith Dawson)
        </li>
        <li>
           Anyone you send mail to is your friend. (Eric S. Johansson, Keith Dawson)
        </li>
        <li>
           An anti-spam system's operation should be transparent to the user. (Eric S. Johansson, Keith Dawson)
        </li>
        <li>
           can be implemented piecemeal -- doesn't require everyone to upgrade to new email software simultaneously
        </li>
        <li>
           decentralized -- "must not rely on a central resource that could be subjected to a denial of service (DoS) attack." (Eric S. Johansson, Keith Dawson)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any other requirements/wishes I'm missing? I think we need one dealing with opt-in mailing lists.

           Hashcash <a href="http://www.hashcash.org/">http://www.hashcash.org/</a> computes a partial hash collision unique to each outgoing message. It only takes a few seconds per email message for your computer to calculate the hash collision - but spammers depend on being able to send millions of messages a day per machine, so it destroys the economics of spam for them. <a href="http://www.cypherspace.org/~adam/hashcash/">http://www.cypherspace.org/~adam/hashcash/</a>

           TMDA (Tagged Message Delivery Agent) requires senders to do a little extra work (respond to a challenge) the first time they send spam before the receiver ever sees it: <a href="http://www.tmda.net/">http://www.tmda.net/</a> . However, "Challenge-Response Anti-Spam Systems Considered Harmful" <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Mail/challenge-response.html">http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Mail/challenge-response.html</a> claims that challenge-response systems are inherently flawed.

        It seems that these can be classified as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "make-work", forcing the sender (or his computer) to do a little extra work that doesn't have any direct benefit, other than keeping out the riff-raff.
        </li>
        <li>
           cryptographic authentication or challenge-response authentication, so that (fraudulent) email with forged "from" lines can be automatically disposed of. (See <a href="SpamSolutions.html">SpamSolutions</a> under "Require Certification" )
        </li>
        <li>
           "Require Small Fee On Emails", forcing the sender to pay money to directly benefit the receiver -- see <a href="SpamSolutions.html">SpamSolutions</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Are there any other possibilities?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Rather than pay me directly with money, or do some time-wasting calculation, would it be possible to force senders to donate 30 seconds or a minute of computer time to my favorite </em><a href="DistributedComputing.html">DistributedComputing</a> project?

        How about a system like <a href="ParasiticComputing.html">ParasiticComputing</a>(which would be similar to the distributed computing comment), but more generalized?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't see how this is relevant.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I didn't make the suggestion, but <a href="ParasiticComputing.html">ParasiticComputing</a> is a form of distributed computing, so this makes sense as a direct followup to the other suggestion. <a href="ParasiticComputing.html">ParasiticComputing</a> doesn't require download of a specialized client program, so saying it is "more generalized" makes sense. On the other hand, <a href="ParasiticComputing.html">ParasiticComputing</a> is not currently reasonably practical, so it doesn't seem to help to suggest it without also suggesting a means of making it more practical.

        I have an address that I freely publish on the web and usenet, but my MX will divert it straight to /dev/null unless you include the correct passphrase in the subject line.  
        (the passphrase is "don't buy this".)  
        Is this an example of an <a href="EmailHurdle.html">EmailHurdle</a> ?
