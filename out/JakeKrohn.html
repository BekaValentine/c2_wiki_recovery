        Programming is a necessary evil.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You mean for companies, or personally? Regardless, is it inherently evil, or is it fixable? (or were you just confessing that <strong>your</strong> programming is evil? Or in need of exorcism?)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ol>
