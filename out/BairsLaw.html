        Bairs Law

      <p>
        <strong>Don't ask a question unless you want to hear the answer.</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This law, initially formulated by Charles Bair, relates to the more famous but less clear "It's easier to say sorry than ask for permission".
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The law's applicability is quite broad. Consider here some questions that shouldn't be asked unless you want to hear the answer:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Honey, do I look fat to you?
        </li>
        <li>
           Can I go to the mall?
        </li>
        <li>
           Boss, can we do <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>?
        </li>
        <li>
           Do you want the last pork chop?
        </li>
        <li>
           What did you buy me for my birthday?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Also related to, "Never detect for an error condition you can't handle."

        Don't ever write anything in a memo that you wouldn't want to see on <em>60 Minutes.</em>

        Or, "Always have a BATNA (<a href="BestAlternativeToNegotiatedAgreement.html">BestAlternativeToNegotiatedAgreement</a>)."

        This rule of thumb came up in a fairly good Paul Newman movie, _The Verdict_ as advice to a trial lawyer. I think it was expressed in the movie as "Don't ask a question you don't already know the answer to," regarding questioning a witness on the stand.

        A public defender I know disregarded that advice, to good effect:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Defense: Given the complainant's age and weight, if she had drunk as much as she claims, would she have been competent at 1:00 AM?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Prosecution Expert Witness: No, she would definitely not have been competent.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Defense (fishing): What would have been her condition at, say, 3:00 AM?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Expert (consulting table): She would have been dead.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe a better rule would be: Don't coach your witnesses to give implausible testimony.

        I first heard this law from Admiral <a href="GraceHopper.html">GraceHopper</a>, one of Cobol's founders as such:  
        <strong>It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        p.s. Who was Baird?
