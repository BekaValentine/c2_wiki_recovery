        I was TA for a undergraduate group project/project management course. I noticed that many students were complaining that they were having to deal with the concepts in the group project before they were being covered in the lectures. Inspired by <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a>, I suggested that the professor do something like ProjectLifeCycleInOneHour (actually one lecture which is 75 minutes) next year before the course starts. He liked the idea... Unfortunately, I won't be around to see how it works out. -- <a href="JasonYip.html">JasonYip</a>

        The general term for what you're calling a <a href="ProcessMiniature.html">ProcessMiniature</a> is a Simulation. The best educators in the world use EducationalSimulations & <a href="EducationalGames.html">EducationalGames</a>. <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> will have a sibling soon as I'm hard at work on an XP sim. -- <a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>

        Another way to go is to have short iterations. At most, the three week glacial epochs that XP preaches. Then, you go through the whole process rather quickly. However, at the end you must then apply some double loop learning or <a href="TripleLoopLearning.html">TripleLoopLearning</a> and reflect honestly on what went wrong, what went right, what could be improved, what could be enhanced. Tweak a little bit (or a lot) and go through the next iteration. Consider each iteration a new experience! In fact, it might be valuable to force yourselves to try out new things frequently to avoid process rut. You might accidentally end up with a dusty <a href="ThreeRingBinder.html">ThreeRingBinder</a> otherwise. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        A process miniature is not just a simulation in an interesting sense of the word "Simulation". A simulation exists to run a person through many variations of situations so they can deal with varying conditions on the fly. A simulation may be time-matched or not. A process miniature is not time-matched. It draws on some native human capacity to build temporal connections - we are interested in generating those temporal connections, it is what <a href="GradyBooch.html">GradyBooch</a> long ago called a <a href="GestaltRoundTrip.html">GestaltRoundTrip</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the absence of a <a href="ProcessMiniature.html">ProcessMiniature</a>, those connections get built in the standard (haha) 3-month incremental deliveries. But that means you have to wait 3 months. How about doing a full increment in 1 week, or 1 hour (see <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a>)? That builds the temporal connections around the process in a shorter time frame so the person has the <a href="GestaltRoundTrip.html">GestaltRoundTrip</a> in that short time frame.

        I did a version of this, <a href="ExtremeHourWithActualProgramming.html">ExtremeHourWithActualProgramming</a>, with a client in South Africa.
