        Ideal Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        That fantasy project each of us carries around inside our head where we work with:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A team of people just like us</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Who know how to use the tools and know why our favorite tools are the best.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who write code others can actually read and not mistake for stream of conscious.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who never check in their "small change" without running the full set of Unit Tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who don't confuse "simplest" with "easiest."
        </li>
        <li>
          Who don't get defensive (or offensive) when something is broken; they just fix it, if possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who really like programming.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who appreciate a strange sense of humor (and understand the difference between "strange" and "dangerous").
        </li>
        <li>
          Who are strong enough to stand up for their ideas but flexible enough to get along with others (no <a href="CowboyCoder.html">CowboyCoder</a>s!).
        </li>
        <li>
          Who would never, never, never write smelly code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who are different and interesting in some way when we're down the pub. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Sane users</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Who know exactly what they want and how to communicate it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who never change their minds, or at least avoid going in circles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who don't mind waiting while we finish that "one last tweak."
        </li>
        <li>
          Who know when to say "Wow, how did you do that?"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Good management</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Who fight for the resources the team needs rather than fight the team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who appreciate "good clean source code."
        </li>
        <li>
          Who don't need hourly status reports to believe that I know what I am doing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Perfect tools</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Which never crash just before I save (or, even better, don't crash at all!).
        </li>
        <li>
          Which operate just like the manual (and marketing material!) said they would.
        </li>
        <li>
          Which work with me rather than forcing me to do it their way.
        </li>
        <li>
          Which remove ALL of the drudge work (but leave the good stuff).
        </li>
        <li>
          Which understand what I meant (no matter what I said).
        </li>
        <li>
          Which don't require too much effort to learn but do reward experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="IdealProgramming.html">IdealProgramming</a> is often synonymous with "the way we will do things NextTime."
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to add your own elements to this fantasy (within the bounds of good taste of course :-))!

        I'd add or modify some of the above. Some of them I don't need, such as a specific editor, or a team with a better-integrated psyche than my own. On my team we would:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Write code that expresses every idea it needs to express (definition of <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Keep all <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s running at 100% for every developer releases
        </li>
        <li>
           Welcome user changes because we can program anything
        </li>
        <li>
           Give ourselves minute-by-minute status reports using the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s GUI
        </li>
        <li>
           Give management continuous status reports with <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a> graph, <a href="ReleasePlanning.html">ReleasePlanning</a>, ExtremeReporting
        </li>
        <li>
           Use tools that allow us to change how they work and fix their crashes if any. (Can you say Smalltalk?)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Hopefully you will forgive me for pointing out that your "fantasy" sounds a little bit like bragging (although the two are often related :)).  I'm afraid that if I did all of the stuff you have suggested I would have to get a new fantasy  :-o. -- </em><a href="JeffShelby.html">JeffShelby</a><em></em>

        Okay, this is fantasy, but it's not realistic to assume that nobody will make mistakes. Am I looking for a realistic fantasy? Is that a paradox? In any case, I'd replace the stuff about people being perfect with something along the lines of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Everyone uses unit tests and everything gets tested
        </li>
        <li>
           Nobody gets defensive when something is broken; we just fix it
        </li>
        <li>
           Even if we have different ideas about what works or is best, we all buy into whatever process is used to make decisions, and stand by those decisions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Everyone has the same approach (a good one!) to documentation
        </li>
        <li>
           We use the documentation continually (what good is it if you don't?)
        </li>
        <li>
           Everyone is different and interesting in some way when we're down the pub (i.e. team is cohesive even away from work)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        OK, I can see that a fantasy needs to be (marginally) plausible in order to be enticing.  Maybe I just had my tongue a little too firmly planted in my cheek with the original list.  How do you like the updated version?  -- <a href="JeffShelby.html">JeffShelby</a>

        And, we never have to deal with bugs in
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the IDE
        </li>
        <li>
           the compiler
        </li>
        <li>
           third-party libraries
        </li>
        <li>
           the operating system
        </li>
        <li>
           the networking code
        </li>
        <li>
           the server
        </li>

        Keith, are you writing your own (see above)?  Or are you severely optimistic? -- <a href="WyattMatthews.html">WyattMatthews</a>
