        It Sucks Because It Doesnt Do Whati Want
      </h1>
      <p>
        A common way of flaming a technology, consisting of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Assert requirements or characteristics that any good system doing X (which the system in question, Y, is designed to do) must have.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Observe that the system Y doesn't meet one or more of the asserted requirements.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Proclaim that because of this deficiency, system Y "sucks".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This argument is frequently fallacious for many reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The asserted requirements may in fact be intractible, irrelevant, or otherwise lacking in validation.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Suckage, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.  Or the customer.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In many cases, the asserted requirements are far in excess of what the system was originally designed for.  (In other words, if you <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>, someone whose requirements you <em>didn't</em> meet will proclaim loudly that it sucks).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The absence of any systems which <em>do</em> meet the asserted requirements (or if such a system exists, it's a prototype which has its own deficiencies or is otherwise not ready for production use).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Finally, it should be noted that phrases like "sucks", "piece of shit", "garbage", etc. are frequently overused; and really don't have a place in serious technical or scholarly debate.  They are <a href="ConversationalChaff.html">ConversationalChaff</a>.  (But it's chaff that's fun to engage in, as it gives the ol' ego a boost to summarily dismiss someone's hard work with a four-letter rejoinder.  I must admit guilt here myself...).  It's better to point out what a given technology can or cannot do, and how these restrictions limit its applicability.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>It should also be noted here that there are occasions wherein the use of such terms are applicable; that descriptors of lesser venom may have been used in the past and failed to carry the necessary weight of condemnation. Thusly, "This !@#$!! piece of !#$%^! sucks out loud!!" may be needed as a marker of final attribution of a system or component's usefulness. After such an outburst brings needed attention to the object of reference all parties may then focus on moving on.</em> <ahem>
