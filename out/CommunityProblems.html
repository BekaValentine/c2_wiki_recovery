        Community Problems
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiProblems.html">WikiProblems</a> are <a href="CommunityProblems.html">CommunityProblems</a>. There may be outsiders wanting to spam, vandals wanting to test the patience of the community, etc. But the largest source of problems probably arise from within the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what possible community problems exist?
      </p>
      <p>
        How about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WhyAreWeAllHere.html">WhyAreWeAllHere</a> unanswered
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="AbsentLeadership.html">AbsentLeadership</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ApathyCalcified.html">ApathyCalcified</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           LynchMob behavior
        </li>
        <li>
           AntiAuthoritarian
        </li>
        <li>
           Loved to death as in <a href="HeatDeathOfWiki.html">HeatDeathOfWiki</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="LordOfTheFliesSyndrome.html">LordOfTheFliesSyndrome</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Immature and/or unstable <a href="WikiCulture.html">WikiCulture</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           (look up <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> for more pages)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Talked to death as in </em><a href="CommunityProblems.html">CommunityProblems</a> :-)<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ... etc
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all problems are equally significant for a given community, and there are always counter measures available. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggest maybe we consider the type of people drawn to <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, study their motivation and behavior as a approach for improving the wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, do the regulars here generally "know" other members of the community? How well do people know each other and what kind of trust exist? Do they know which direction other people want to achieve for the wiki?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Another suggestion is to examine the "hits and misses" of other Online Communities (wiki or otherwise) where real names are encouraged.</em>
