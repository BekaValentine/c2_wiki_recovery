        Have you ever tried driving 6" nails into your skull? Ever tried drinking battery acid? Ever tried sky-diving without a parachute? I never have. I guess I'll never know what doing that is like. It somehow feels as if this is no loss.

        With some appropriate restrictions this idea is suggested by the Bible:
      </p>
      <code>
        Try everything. Keep the best. <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (I freely translated this from German and memory. Does anybody know the English version and the reference?)

        In medicine there is something similar, called polypragmasie.
