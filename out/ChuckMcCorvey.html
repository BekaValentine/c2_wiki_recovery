        I've been involved in numerous projects over the last 20 years or so.  I started out with a 50/50 spilt of electrical engineering and software/firmware development.  For about the last 10 years, it's been all software.

        My current focus is on the delivery of inter/intra/extranet applications.  I generally use J2EE technologies in these ventures, although it never pays to be too rigid.

        I try to use XP where I can, but I often end up having to settle with using only a few of its elements.  This partial-XP (not really XP?) way isn't perfect, but it sure beats the old way.
