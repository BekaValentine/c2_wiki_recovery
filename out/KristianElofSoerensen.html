        I am at work building my own little software product company, that will provide a solution to a problem that I have heard a not insignificant number of companies complain about suffering from.

        <a href="TimeToChange.html">TimeToChange</a> is pretty close to one of my reasons for starting this company.

        With a group of business acquainties, quite a few of whom later turned into friends, I organized a patterns study group in Copenhagen. It all became a reality thanks to <a href="LindaRising.html">LindaRising</a>, who lived here for a year. Later on <a href="LindaRising.html">LindaRising</a> got the good idea of having a nordic PLoP conference and wanted me and PavelHruby <a href="http://www.phruby.com">http://www.phruby.com</a> to chair it. It is called  <a href="VikingPlop.html">VikingPlop</a>. We had a great time in September 2002 with around thirty participants and nineteen papers to workshop in writers workshops. The printed proceedings will be available in book form real soon. A 2003 event is in the works.

        Also I can often be seen at Kloster Irsee around <a href="EuroPlop.html">EuroPlop</a> time.
