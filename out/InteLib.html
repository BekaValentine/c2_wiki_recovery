        <a href="InteLib.html">InteLib</a> is a C++ library which lets one do <a href="LispProgramming.html">LispProgramming</a> within a C++ (<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, heh) project actually without any Lisp. Well so we can say <a href="InteLib.html">InteLib</a> is a tool for <a href="MultiParadigmProgramming.html">MultiParadigmProgramming</a>.

        The acronym <a href="InteLib.html">InteLib</a> stands for Intelligence Library. More details are found at the library's home site <a href="http://www.intelib.org">http://www.intelib.org</a>

        Well, Common Lisp is too big to clone it, specially if your intention is to design a <strong>secondary</strong> language to be used in C++ projects. The library implements a short dialect of Lisp which supports basic list operations, lex. and dynamic scoping, functions, macros (in the sense of <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>), nlambda functions (hmmm.. I know nlambda is not very useful), destructive functions including CL's SETF. Also it has basic input-output features (including a kind of LispReader), which I've found useful implementing a Lisp->C++ translator; CommonLispHashTables are also implemented, etc. But definitely it is <strong>way</strong> shorter and simpler than Common Lisp, and sometimes it is incompatible with it because of some features which came from Scheme (e.g., <strong>(defun (a . b) ...)</strong> instead of <strong>(defun (a &rest b) ...)</strong>. Some details are here: <a href="http://www.intelib.org/libdocs/ill_lang.txt">http://www.intelib.org/libdocs/ill_lang.txt</a>

        Actually there are two layers in the library, the first just implements S-expressions as heterogenous data structures (which sometimes is useful without the LispEvaluator), and the second implements the evaluator and the functions. -- <a href="AndreyStolyarov.html">AndreyStolyarov</a>
