        I'm a software developer in Canada, having worked for Waterloo Maple, Aruna, Navtech (<strong>not</strong> the one that does maps for one of the on-line map services), and now Maple again. I've also done custom programming on the side since I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 1989 with an MMath degree in Computer Science. I also produce a commercial product, MotoCalc (<a href="http://www.motocalc.com),">http://www.motocalc.com),</a> that I sell to electric model airplane enthusiasts.

        I've always been interested in various programming methodologies, language design, and so on. I've been programming in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> since 1985, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> since 2000, and have also picked up <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>, <a href="OberonLanguage.html">OberonLanguage</a>, <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a>, <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, and a few others along the way. (I first got started in programming in IBM's version of <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a> on the 5100 portable computer, way back in 1976.)

        My hobbies include building and flying electric model airplanes, flying real airplanes, and running a horse farm (<a href="http://www.bluebirdlane.com)">http://www.bluebirdlane.com)</a> with my wife. I also used to write a monthly column for QuietFlyer magazine. Many of my hobbies are documented on my home page (<a href="http://www.stefanv.com),">http://www.stefanv.com),</a> and many of my QuietFlyer articles appear there too.
