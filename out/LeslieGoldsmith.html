        From what I was told during my years with IPSA, Leslie was on a temporary assignment as a student, and cracked the security of the original mailbox system, so was hired to do a better job of it. The new version was audited by the RCMP who were unable to break it and it was deemed suitable for governmental communications. I was a mailbox steward for a while and to the best of my knowledge, it was never cracked. It was way ahead of its time, with features still not available in Outlook etc. (such as the hb flag!). /sse

        As I recall, Leslie was one of the original 'elfs' (high school students that were given free accounts as their compensation. (at a time when disk space was charged out at $5.00 / megabyte day! - and that was about 1/3 of the charges.) -- <a href="HansWobbe.html">HansWobbe</a>
