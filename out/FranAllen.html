           Today, she addressed the <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> department at <a href="UcSd.html">UcSd</a>. The most astonishing thing she claimed was that the introduction of the <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> in 1973 derailed CompilerDelvelopment.

        As a fellow at IBM and later at the NSA, she started first as a teacher of <a href="ForTran.html">ForTran</a>.
