        This book is about typography, and it's meant for people who know nothing about the subject. The title contains the word 'Mac', but this book might be useful for <em>anyone</em> interested in knowing how to make a paper look better.

        In some ways, the book reads like a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>. Each of the twenty chapters are very short (only one or two pages per chapter); each chapter presents a single idea; and some of the chapter titles even sound like pattern names (for example, "One Space Between Sentences"). Unfortunately, the reasoning behind many of the suggestions in this book is not given; too often, the author resorts to explaining particular ideas by writing things like "If you do it the other way, it's tacky."

        Still, there's a lot of useful information here. And as an added bonus, the book is short and cheap.
