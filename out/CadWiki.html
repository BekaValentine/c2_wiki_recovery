        Where the StorageArtifact will reside within or be represented by a CadBlock created in a 2D, 3D, or nD space, utilizing some innoventions similar to mathematical manipulators such as addition, substraction, multiplication, division, duplication, morphing, translation and rotation (in n dimensions).

        One might enhance, diminish (influence) or delete blocks via a process of dimensional scaling (deletion all scaling goes to 0, or where certain of the dimensions are dimished or zeroed out to become specialized artifacts.

        Imagine if you will a spherical-radar-chart which might be used to graph some visualized characteristics of an artifact. And then move the artifact while scaling some of its characteristics in response to changes of the dimensions (take one to be time, for example).
