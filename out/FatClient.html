        Fat Client
      </h1>
      <p>
        Also: <a href="FatClient.html">FatClient</a>, <a href="ThickClient.html">ThickClient</a>, <a href="RichClient.html">RichClient</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<a href="FatClient.html">FatClient</a> & <a href="ThickClient.html">ThickClient</a> may be considered pejorative by some: <a href="RichClient.html">RichClient</a> is more positive)
      </p>
      <p>
        A term whose meaning has become muddied over time, a <a href="FatClient.html">FatClient</a> system may be one where
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           most of the processing happens on the client (desktop) side as opposed to centralized server(s), or
        </li>
        <li>
           there are programs to be deployed to the client for the system to function (e.g. a VB client that simply sends request to the server would be considered a <a href="FatClient.html">FatClient</a> solution, as opposed to a browser-based solution where the target system is assumed to have <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> installed already)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By both definitions we have grey areas: Does using <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> make a fat client? Using lots of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>? (Perhaps we could assess how much <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> content has to go to the client per different application).  Suppose we rely on a plug-in that the browser may not currently have loaded up. Does it count as a program that needs to be deployed on the client system?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Plug-ins that can automatically install on the client system is the grey area. Other than that, the usual distinction between fat/thin is whether you need to install a client or not (with the assumption that the client already has a browser), so a heavy </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> app is considered "thin".  The browser assumption is natural since the term <a href="ThinClient.html">ThinClient</a> comes from the marketing of web-based applications.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The alleged advantage to fat clients is less load on the server and faster response to user input. Alleged downsides include more desktop "babysitting" to keep the client software up-to-date and configured properly, and more <a href="SecurityManagement.html">SecurityManagement</a> concerns because the business rules are on the client instead of on the server hidden behind protocols. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        AJAX, in my view, enables <a href="FatClient.html">FatClient</a> web applications. Is a desktop application that relies on one or more servers no longer a "desktop application" because of said reliance? Here's my list of things that differentiate <a href="FatClient.html">FatClient</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           User interactions handled locally.
        </li>
        <li>
           Asynchronous (background) server communication.
        </li>
        <li>
           Server interaction at the command, rather than gesture, level.
        </li>
        <li>
           Local (client-based) processing.
        </li>
        <li>
           Local (client-based) object/variable scope.
        </li>
        <li>
           Local (client-based) session management (though I'm less sure of this)
        </li>
      </ul>
