        You Can Improve My English

        <a href="WikiAuthor.html">WikiAuthor</a>s who do not speak or write <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a> perfectly (for whatever reasons) should still have a chance to contribute to <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you feel that you have a good contribution, but think that the language could be improved, put the <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a> <a href="YouCanImproveMyEnglish.html">YouCanImproveMyEnglish</a> near your contribution. Then industrious <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s can find it and improve it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> should feel free to improve your text at any time, regardless of whether or not English is your first language. Even native speakers need editors.

        Note that native English speakers are often most in need of assistance.

        <em>Heh, I love the humility of this </em><a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a>, but, like most badges, it's probably best <strong>never used</strong>! I, for one, really appreciate the people with English as a second language who have made some amazing contributions to Wiki over the years. We people who don't have the same challenge promise we will correct your English wherever we can. Just go ahead and contribute using whatever English comes naturally, please.<em></em>

        I try to keep in mind the fact that the problem lies not with the writer's poor use of English, but with my yankee total inability to read any other language! I have nothing but respect with those who struggle to overcome <em>my</em> lack of language skills.

        I've found that most of the people I've seen apologize for their poor English are actually quite good English-speakers. Often, they have excellent grammar, and what mistakes they make are so subtle that correcting them aloud or in writing would take more effort than it's worth. But such mistakes are quite easily corrected, in a covert way, on a Wiki. -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>
