        Stale Events

        Variant of the deadly-embrace (or is the deadly-embrace a special case of this?)
      </p>
      <p>
        Two objects (Foo and Bar) receive events from Baz, giving them notice of some index changing. The event object itself contains a copy of the index (commonly done). The index will be 0 when we jump into things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foo receives notice that the index changes to 1, and decides that it shouldn't be so, so it tells Baz to change it to 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foo then receives notice that the index is now 2, and all is now good in the world from Foo's point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bar then receives the notice that the index is 2. Okay, it reports this to the user (or whatever you'd like it to do).
      </p>
      <p>
        Bar now receives the original event that the index is 1. Which is, of course, incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we really want is the event to merely point to the current value of Baz's index: it shouldn't cache the result. The resulting situation is that, although Bar will receive two event notifications, they will always report the correct index: stale events are no longer an issue.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This is of course only a problem if delivery of events is not guaranteed to be in order.

        This is a symptom (a restatement?) of <a href="ObserverMustNotChangeObservable.html">ObserverMustNotChangeObservable</a>, which, IMHO, is a little clearer and provides possible solutions.
