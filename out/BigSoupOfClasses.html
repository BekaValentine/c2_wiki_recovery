        "OO seems to lack a grouping granularity between "class" and "application", making an OO app appear like "class soup" to me. Procedural has "task" modules, which seem pretty natural for me and relatively easy to find. I can navigate 200 task modules more easily than 1000 classes. (I would say the ratio is roughly between 1:2 and 1:10.) "
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, what is the <strong>large-scale structure of classes in OO code</strong>? Is there any consistency among methodologies? What are the mental steps one takes to navigate these? Suppose you were a contractor who walked into a shop with a fairly big OO application. How does one go about making changes and/or learning that application? For example, the manager says, "I want to add a 'full price' column to all reports and screens that currently have our discount price."

        The concept of central command-and-control is not a prerequisite for understanding the organization of a system.  Consider the possibility that in looking for that sort of structure it is possible to completely misunderstand how the system is actually working.

        I don't understand what you mean. An object can represent a high-level concept or a low-level concept, just like a procedure can. When I want to group a bunch of objects together, I make a "module" object and put the other objects inside it. I can do this at any granularity I want.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I want to find a particular object, I can start at the top and look at all the top-level modules, then choose one and look through it to find the sub-module that I want, and so on. Or I can search for the object by name, if I know part of the name. Or, if I'm looking at the object on the screen and I want to find out how it works, I can right-click on it and ask to see its code.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are lots of ways to group things, and lots of ways to find things. Why is this any harder with objects than with procedures?

        <strong>Answer:  Subsystems and libraries.  Just like with </strong>ProceduralTechnologies.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The big difference I've seen is that OO lends itself to building "frameworks," while procedural approaches tend to be limited to libraries of procedural functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can build frameworks with procedural languages, but it generally requires function pointers, which confuse many people.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You are going to start a fat fight if you suggest that OO is better at building frameworks without more evidence presented. This is probably not the place to resolve such claims anyhow.</em>

        <em>I am not sure function pointers are the only alternative. Besides, what confuses one person may not confuse the other.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also other models useful for organizing code, like layers.
        You can do them using procedural or OO techniques, but I've found that OO generally gives you more powerful and flexible tools to accomplish such goals -- like interfaces, for example.

        This reminds me of astronomy. We perceive stars and constellations first in the evolution of astronomy, then galaxies, clusters and only very recently "walls" and "spiderwebs". These latter were never obvious to the naked eye.

      <p>
        OO can operate conceptually at any level. The higher levels don't involve just "classes", they involve aggregations like packages, frameworks, subsystems, servers, tiers, etc. If you can only see (with your mind's eye) the classes, your perception of structure has yet to evolve. -- <a href="TomRossen.html">TomRossen</a>

      <p>
        Something similar to <em>distance</em> as a metric? How about <em>level of abstraction</em>? Not that this was my point in making the analogy. In fact <em>size</em>(which is what I think you intended here, rather than <em>distance</em>) is relevant to software: the higher level structures tend to correspond to larger and larger groupings of stars - I mean classes. -- tr

        A hierarchy can be a network seen from the perspective of a single node, which becomes the root. We use relational data modelling to define the network (all information re car parts), and create particular views to satisfy accountants or engineers. A view itself may be structured as a network (e.g., a website) that can in turn be accessed "hierarchically" from well-known entry nodes (e.g., a homepage).

      <p>
        <em>In other words, what is the </em>'large-scale structure of classes in OO code<em>'? Is there any consistency among methodologies? What are the mental steps one takes to navigate these?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two large-scale structures between classes and applications: packages (namespaces in some languages) and layers.  An application may consist of multiple layers, each of which may consist of multiple packages/namespaces.  Packages generally correlate to directories, just as classes generally correlate to files.  Layers don't have an analogy in the file system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Layers correspond to basic types of functionality.  Examples: database layer; UI layer; business layer.  OO programs generally have between one and five layers, depending on complexity.  There's only a handful of different kinds of layers that most programs use, and the three I mentioned are the most common.  You said you were interested in business modeling, which would correspond to the business layer.  Sometimes it's called the domain layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Packages correspond to finer-grained chunks of functionality, but are still larger-grained than classes.  The number of packages varies according to the size of the program and the tastes of the designers.  I prefer packages to have no more than a few dozen classes.  Examples (in the database layer): Oracle RDBMS package, accounting database package, HR database package.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good designs try to minimize relationships between layers, and between packages.

        <em>Okay, I am familiar with "infrastructure" kinds of packages and GUI layers, but what about business modeling itself?

        I've never worked on a corporate business modelling project.  So I can't speak from experience about really big business modelling.  But, as you probably know, nouns in the business are modelled with classes, along with a smattering of supporting classes.  When the number of classes gets too large, they're grouped into packages, with an eye towards minimizing relationships between packages.  I can't think of any examples offhand because it's been several years since I worked on a project that needed more than one package in the business layer.  However, <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>'s <a href="AnalysisPatterns.html">AnalysisPatterns</a> has more to say about this subject.  I would also say that business modelling is OO's strong point, but again, my experience in this area is a bit limited.  --<a href="JimLittle.html">JimLittle</a>

        <em>Regarding "looking for nouns", these often become database entities so that one does not need a module per noun or any other large code artifact for nouns (entities).

        Interesting question. I can't imagine what sort of "big picture" patterns you see in ER modeling - all there is is a Big Soup Of Entities - - there are no bigger organizing principles.  Ditto classes (in this sense classes are isomorphic to entities). Here's what I take away from the story so far: in the world at large, there are tens of thousands of objects and no organizing principle at all besides adjacency and enveloping/surrounding. Everything else, e.g. classification, aggregation, belonging, are added by the human mind. That follows naturally into the classes/entities universe.  What <a href="EricEvans.html">EricEvans</a> has done it to construct three different organizing principles for aggregating the classes in a software system, of which layers is only one, and the others I can't recall at this instant. --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

(Although there is disagreement over what "well factored schema" means, as described earlier.)<em></em>

        Higher level organizing principles are necessarily abstract. Domain modelling is half of the story, though no doubt attractive to the traditional OO academic interpretation.

        Consider that OO supports visibility restriction (public, private, protected) which helps discriminate externally significant from internally available in a trustworthy manner. This simplifies the <a href="BigSoupOfClasses.html">BigSoupOfClasses</a> into a simpler soup of visible classes & methods. The enforcement mechanism in OO languages is what makes visibility trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a more macro level between application and class, you have various schemes of restricted visibility:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Windows DLL - exported vs internal methods

        For me, I think this response gets closest to the core of the matter. OOP requires reductionist thinking, it drives reuse by allowing you to know as little as possible about large scale structure. By seeking to understand the 'bigger picture' you loose the considerable advantage of not needing to know the bigger picture. -- <a href="RichardCordova.html">RichardCordova</a>

        <em>First off, "reuse" as the main reason behind OOP seems to have diminished of late (</em><a href="ReuseHasFailed.html">ReuseHasFailed</a>). Second, there are other ways to compartmentalize things besides objects. The suggested claim here seems to be that OO allows one to keep thinking in the small, and the large-scale structure sort of organically emerges but nobody has to monitor or understand this large-scale structure. It is not a claim I hear very often. But it brings up the question of how things like <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> and data integrity can exist in such an organic environment.

        The idea that the superstructure needn't be limited to what someone can understand or oversee is quite appealing to me.

        Me too. As I mentioned on <a href="OneMoreLevelOfIndirection.html">OneMoreLevelOfIndirection</a> this is a kind of complexity that cannot be reduced by introducing another layer of abstraction but only by a layer of process (XP) or persons (experts).

        Sure, you can try to provide the necessary information in form of documentation or further layers of code. But this is not very efficient if a) your artifacts fasten then you can update your "index" documentation or b) your further layers and documentation impede working e.g. by making the mess even larger. Indexing is difficult, so you might need experts to even maintain it. Keeping the knowledge in the heads of the team <strong>may</strong> simply be more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Please clarify what you mean by "artifacts fasten". I don't necessarily mean external documentation. What I have in mind as examples are things like ER diagrams and a list of "primary tasks" typical of procedural+RDBMS-based design. I find these "big pictures" indispensable and relatively consistence from shop-to-shop (although the list of primary tasks may take some personal digging to uncover at first). The lack of something comparable in OO that is fairly consistent is disconcerting. Each new OO app is a random jungle with no map.</em>

        OO principles and <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> provide some of the basic tools and techniques you need to build scalable and durable systems. The trouble with design patterns is, that there are so many of them by now, that newcomers can be overwhelmed, and don't know where to start. However, there are certain design patterns that explicitly address scalability of object oriented designs. <a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a> builds on these patterns and has led to language constructs such as <em>interfaces</em> and <em>packages</em> in Java, and equivalent constructs in other languages. These  constructs can be used as building blocks for design structures larger than classes. For example, the KobrA approach to SoftwareProductLineEngineering uses a component definition that ensures components have a <em>fractal</em> characteristic. Poor dependency management is a very widespread "phenomenon", in both OO and in non-OO software, and more than "just" OO is required to design large systems that are maintainable. Because I come across dependency management issues again and again in my consulting, I have compiled a white paper on this topic at <a href="http://www.softmetaware.com/complexity-and-dependency-management.pdf,">http://www.softmetaware.com/complexity-and-dependency-management.pdf,</a> where I describe some general principles for components and framework design. -- <a href="JornBettin.html">JornBettin</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Design patterns are discussed above a bit.

This view tends to conflict with the GOF pattern view. Also, I tend to share the </em><a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> view that many OO patterns are a sign of weak languages. See <a href="PatternBacklash.html">PatternBacklash</a>. I agree though that the GOF pattern movement is the first real attempt to bring some order to OO chaos.

      </p>
      <p>
        I don't disagree that some patterns result from weaknesses in OO or in specific OO language environments. The question is: Does it matter? Many patterns can be expressed as aspects quite nicely. <a href="ModelDrivenSoftwareDevelopment.html">ModelDrivenSoftwareDevelopment</a> (MDSD) allows you to precisely specify <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> to apply <em>which</em> pattern mechanically, and it allows you to raise the level of abstraction. If you are an expert in a particular domain, you can use MDSD to define and implement <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>s. In this approach you typically leverage the concepts of OO frameworks and components. A lot of ingredients need to come together (<a href="DomainAnalysis.html">DomainAnalysis</a>, MetaModeling, ModelDrivenGeneration, TemplateLanguages, <a href="DomainDrivenDesign.html">DomainDrivenDesign</a>) to raise the level of abstraction. The component concept can be used to effectively partition huge domains. In contrast, an uncomponentised relational model with several hundred or several thousand entities becomes incomprehensible, leading to monstrous entities. "Customer" would be one painful example in ERP systems. Different subsystems in large systems often deal with different facets of one concept. -- <a href="JornBettin.html">JornBettin</a>

        [Queries miss the whole point of what he just said.  The model exists to help understand the domain, to add structure to it, queries have to work on that big imcomprehensible monstrosity he was speaking about called the schema.]

        <em>I find schemas more comprehendable than giant code bases. A lot of the problem with schemas are bad normalizatioin and bad documentation (such as no field description dictionary). However, sloppy designers pop up in all paradigms. But, I'll take bad schemas over bad OO any day.</em>

        [The whole point of the model is to escape queries, which are too soft, to maleable, and impossible to enforce rules on.  The model on the other hand, can enforce rules without requiring you know or understand the rules to use the model.  Queries can't do that, queries force you to understand every rule for each query individually, making them severly error prone.  A functioning model is far more useful and less error prone than a queryable schema in just about every scenario but ad-hoc reporting.]

        <em>Example? Relational data intregity is a pretty powerful tool. Plus it works regardless of the language accessing the data, something language-centric approaches have trouble with.</em>

        Different facets of one concept can be modeled with precision using components, OO principles and aspects. In short, objects and components are stepping stones on the path to raise the level of abstraction from software concepts to problem domain concepts.

        The latest additions to this thread seem to steer into the classical OO versus Relational debate. This has been dicussed too often to be repeated again. I just wanted to make the point that by now the real discussion has moved  well past the basics of OO. -- <a href="JornBettin.html">JornBettin</a>

        <em>Hell, even the basics were poorly defined/analyzed and lacked consensus metrics. Going "beyond" that puts hair on the fuzz. </em>
