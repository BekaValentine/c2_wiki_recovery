        Extreme Recruitment
      </h1>
      <p>
        We're a team doing XP and we're hiring some PostGrads at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key to the hiring process at the moment is the setting of a small problem and the discussion of the candidates solution....
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll talk more later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone have any thoughts about hiring into an XP team ?

        Alan, you might want to talk to <a href="TimMackinnon.html">TimMackinnon</a>. At Connextra I believe they require a candidate to go in for a half day and pair with one of their guys. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

        You should have a chat with <a href="JamesCollins.html">JamesCollins</a> and/or <a href="CarlParziale.html">CarlParziale</a> on the <a href="DoIt.html">DoIt</a> team. They've been struggling for 2 or 3 years for the best way to figure out who are good XP candidates -- with lots of different approaches to group interviews, technical vs. non-technical discussions, etc. Also looking at how recruitment practices have to change as the team grows...

        <em></em>PageChurn - has anyone got anything sensible to add to this discussion?  I will soon be recruiting and have some fairly specialist requirements. We haven't yet been able to do full XP, but I'm trying to learn the lessons and put into practice what I can.<em></em>
