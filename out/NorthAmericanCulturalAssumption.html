        North American Cultural Assumption
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The assumption that the USA is America. I once told someone from the US that a another friend of mine was also from America - which they were, they were from Brazil. The US friend told me later "You know they aren't really American, they are South American". <em>yes - I have to admit I was hoping to provoke such a reaction.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The US/Canadian cultural assumptions. Though there is a cultural difference between US and Canada, this is not as large as the difference between these countries an South American countries. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A lot of folks "south of the border" use the term <em>americano</em> to refer to people from the US.
