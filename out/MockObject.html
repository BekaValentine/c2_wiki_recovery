        Mock Object

      <p>
        <a href="TimMackinnon.html">TimMackinnon</a>, <a href="SteveFreeman.html">SteveFreeman</a> and PhilipCraig presented a paper at XP2000 on the topic of <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s. Similar in idea to stubs (see: <a href="MockStubShunt.html">MockStubShunt</a>), mock objects take stubs to an extreme and are used to set and verify expectations on interactions with model code. We found that this approach to unit testing has the side effect of making your code conform more to the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>.

        When I first came across this concept, I immediately thought of the scene from the movie <em>Twister</em> in which the tornado-chasing team deploys into the tornado a series of aerodynamic balls, each containing complex sensors that recorded the inner workings of the tornado and relayed this data back to their computers. Having read more about Mock Objects, this seems to be a nice visualization. At least it helped me. :)

        <strong>Reasons to mock:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           real object has non-deterministic behavior
        </li>
        <li>
           real object is difficult to set up
        </li>
        <li>
           real object has behavior that is hard to cause (e.g., network error) (similar to 1)
        </li>
        <li>
           real object is slow
        </li>
        <li>
           real object has (or is) a UI
        </li>
        <li>
           test needs to query the object, but the queries are not available in the real object (e.g., "was this callback called?") (This needs a <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> that has *more* stuff than the real object; the other cases usually require a stub that is far smaller than the real object).
        </li>
        <li>
           real object acts "normal" most of the time, but once a month (or even less often) it does something "exceptional". We want <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s to make sure the rest of the system does the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a> whether or not the object is acting "normal" or "exceptional". (Is this the same as #2 ?)
        </li>
        <li>
           real object does not yet exist
        </li>

        <strong>Discussion</strong>
        <em>I will take a somewhat contrary position. All except for the final point and point 2 above are valid boundry conditions which must be dealt with. If the real object is non-deterministic find out why. Either fix it or get it fixed. If it is out of scope, have your software deal with it gracefully. Point 3 is a rehash of point 1. Point 4 should not be an issue, just let it run in a test environment over night. Point 5, I have found ways to test GUIs using Nunit, just call the correct methods after creating an object. Point 6 this is more of an integration test than a unit test (you end up testing 2 or more classes), but call the object that creates the call that creates the callback. Integration tests are useful. Point 7 is once again a rehash of points 1 and 3, software *must* deal gracefully with boundry conditions.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My fear is that instead of dealing with what the reality of the situation is you end up dealing with what you wish it was. I have frequently dealt with legacy systems where the inputs have been dirty and unexpected, so I have learned *not* to try to force what I think the situation should be onto my software. It has always bitten me in the past. You must test what you have, not what you want. Please take this as advice from someone with scar tissue.</em> PedroLopez
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal here isn't to idealize boundary conditions away by having deterministic behavior. The goal is to cause the boundary conditions <strong>more</strong> frequently (e.g. have a network failure every time) to ensure they are tested.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal for using these to deal with nondeterministic objects is to feed the program a known value with a known answer in our tests so we can make sure the result under those conditions is correct, and not simply sensible.

        Jim - I am very surprised to hear that you have found that shunts are making
        your code hard to read. At XP2000 we presented a paper on <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s (which
        are the same as stubs/shunts but taken to the extreme) and one of the things
        we noticed was that it made our code more readable, and in fact improved the
        design of our code as it conformed to the Law of Demeter quite naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the other authors of the paper (Steve Freeman) came to visit our team
        at Connextra and I left him with two junior programmers to have a look at
        the code (which he had never seen before) and 1 hour later he had spotted a
        number of improvements and was able to navigate the design fairly easily
        with the help of the others. Part of this is XP - however the other part was
        that he recognized the mock objects testing/formatting pattern. Although
        Steve didn't look at the entire system - because of the isolated testing that
        <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s encourages he was able to move to totally separate areas of the
        system and comment on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A new member of our team (second day at work) who had sat with Steve
        commented "My god - I feel so stupid, how can a guy walk off the street, and
        just pick up our code so easily". When I explained that he understood
        <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s practice he was very relieved and the next day he was doing the
        same thing as Steve, spotting areas for improvement etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s came from our desire to eliminate getters that we were writing
        just so that we could test code. Worse still, the getter exposed data types
        that were a lot of work to test because they often lost precision (e.g. a
        stream or a string). The inner class technique you have hit upon sounds ok -
        but we have found that <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s and the way they encourage you to compose
        objects to write tests make inner class testing unnecessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure if this is a helpful comment for you - but thought I should chip in.

        That worries me, which was why I raised the topic a while back.
        Design for testability has a marked impact on the end result.
        Maybe I'm just not refactoring enough or in the right places to end up with a simple design that is easy to test.

        I recently heard about someone who uses Java's inner classes to provide a testing interface. This seems like a beautiful idea to me since the testing interface can duck around the business rules of the class's <a href="PublicInterface.html">PublicInterface</a>. (Java inner classes can modify private instance data within their enclosing class, in case you didn't know.) This seems to me to be a much simpler approach than shunts -- the only drawback is that now your testing interface is inside your production code.

      <p>
        I haven't tried this yet, but I'm seriously considering it. The shunt approach is giving people on my team major headaches when I introduce it to them. And even I, who wrote the whole thing, sometimes get confused as to what goes where and how. Definitely a sign of a troubled design!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I fail to see how this prevents you from having to use shunts/mocks. </em><a href="NestedTestCaseClasses.html">NestedTestCaseClasses</a> just buy you the ability to access private data. If I have a method that takes an object as a parameter, it doesn't matter if I have access to the private fields of the class that contains that method, I still have to mock out the parameter object that I'm passing in. The mock objects that you are passing in aren't the objects that you are testing, they are the objects that interact with the object that you are testing. -- <a href="JavidJamae.html">JavidJamae</a><em></em>

        One thing that I seem to be discovering, though, is that "the simplest thing that could possibly work" works much better when you have lots of prior design experience. I think that the "simplest thing" will be much more complex for a newbie than for an expert. Witness my botched first attempt at testable design... When I wrote it, I knew it was too complicated, but it truly was the simplest thing I could think of, and that's how I justified it.

        Thanks for the help. We feel that our methods become easier to move around, while there is a tendency in them to become "static" <em>(we ususually mark them static if they are not using any object state)</em>.

        Anyone tried writing mock objects in component oriented application servers (COM+, EJB's, WLE/Tuxedo)? Are you also running into trouble with a <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> design conflicting with the design requirements for declarative transaction processing (woe unto you who expose transactional objects to others)? Perhaps my troubles are merely a special case of what happens when you wish to unit test <em>with</em> the underlying logic and DAO layers, but <em>without</em> the complications of a live database (which you otherwise must set to a known state before every automatic unit test run: quite a maintenance burden). I'd be interested in any ideas on this, as I'm reluctantly moving towards the view that designing for testing with mock objects has a much too adverse design impact on most kinds of distributed systems. Are mock objects only applicable on the very lowest level, within components? -- PontusGagge
      </p>
      <p>
        It sounds like you are doing integration testing, rather than unit testing. I've found <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s to be most useful when testing individual units (classes, or Python modules) in isolation.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In some cases, it's not possible to use an interface and extend <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>. For example, a class I'm writing extends an application server-defined concrete class in order to use some out-of-the-box functionality like logging methods. When running unit tests, I can't use the actual superclass, as it in turn relies on systems that only exist when running in the container. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So the solution we've come up with is to write our own mock version of the superclass, and define it in a different classpath (the "mock classpath"). In that class, we implement mock versions of the required methods. Then, when we run the tests, we add the mock classpath to the beginning of the classpath, so the mock object stands in for the real object at test time. Does this seem like a valid solution? How have others dealt with this problem?
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        // GenericService is defined by the application server<br/>
        public class GenericService {<br/>
        public void logError(String errorMessage) {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public class MyCustomService extends GenericService {<br/>
        public void methodBeingTested() {<br/>
        // do something<br/>
        // log an error<br/>
        logError("something went wrong");<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        <em>Moved from WhichFactory</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is probably not a great page name, but I'm starting with a specific problem so I'll describe it in a specific way. I hope this can be generalized, later.

      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>The situation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Various low-level bits of code need to share a connection to a database. These bits can get this connection from a static method, a singleton, or a factory method. In any event, they typically have to know the class to call to get this connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, I want to provide a mock connection for testing purposes. If the low-level classes are calling a particular static method, retrieving a particular singleton, or calling a particular factory method, I can't substitute my mock object.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've thought of a bunch of different things, but I'm not real happy with any of them. I've asked others here, but not gotten anywhere. (They're doing their testing with real database; I want to isolate my testing from that.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So, how do you approach this problem?
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S. My current implementation, to get past <a href="AnalysisParalysis.html">AnalysisParalysis</a>, is to have a constructor that takes a factory object, for testing, and a default constructor that uses the normal factory object, for ease in the actual application. I think this has a faint <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I haven't tried </em><a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> on a DB yet, but here's something off the top of my head. Create a class called DataBaseAccessor, which has a static method getDataBase, which returns an object of abstract class DataBase. Create your real DataBase class as a subclass of DataBase, say RealDataBase for lack of context. Create another (<a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>) database class by subclassing DataBase again, say MockDataBase. The real one works like the real database, the mock one does whatever you tell it to do for the purposes of the test. Some things you might want the mock to do: Count accesses, hold onto the connection string for later comparison, set up a fake query result which you expect the testee to retrieve, etc.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's basically what I'm doing. In fact, I'm using the <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> project to create the MockConnection to the database (though I'm thinking about looking into <a href="EasyMock.html">EasyMock</a> as an alternative). This is what my MockConnectionFactory returns, whereas the default connection factory returns a real database connection to the real database. It bothers me that I have a constructor in the production code that is only used for testing, not for the production code. But it bothers me less than the alternatives I considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I have this problem as well. The approach I'm playing with right now is to do the test via a custom </em><a href="ClassLoader.html">ClassLoader</a>, so that when the unit under test tries to find the database class the class loader interferes and substitutes your mock class.

        On another Web page, someone stated that it was a smell to create setters just to be able to inject mock objects (and thereby breaking encapsulation). I last did something "smelly" like that, only I used conditional compilation to keep the setter out of the production code. The method is an accessor to a central, company-wide list of projects. I want to be able to replace it only when testing. I'm still confused if this is too smelly or not. Does anyone have an opinion about that? -- <a href="WillemBogaerts.html">WillemBogaerts</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        What I'd do in that situation is remove the setter since it's only used for testing. Instead I'd encapsulate all uses of the list of projects behind a method getProjects. Then in the test I'd override that method in an anonymous sub-class and use that for testing. See for more info:

        Does anyone have any good methods for doing mock objects in C++? It seems that the typical method would be to use a pure virtual base class / interface, and derive both the real implementation and the mock from it. But what if I can't actually use an interface (the code is too low-level and performance critical, I'd incur much wrath if I started adding runtime overhead for something which is just a debug feature).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Just</em> a debug feature? NASA engineers have a saying: "test what you ship and ship what you test". It's that attitude that let them rescue the Mars Rover when it crashed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While I appreciate your input, you've completely missed my point - adding extra overhead is non-negotiable. Other people set the rules, I just have to follow them. Around here virtual functions are frowned upon, templates are banned and exceptions are taboo. Even namespaces are viewed with mistrust (which is particularly odd given that we all know it has no actual runtime overhead).
      </p>
      <p>
        On further thought it becomes very apparent that we're basically coding in C with operator overloading (and singletons instead of globals, but thats a rant for another day). So I guess my question becomes, how can you do unit testing and/or mocking of legacy code in a procedural language?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In short, it is not possible to do that. The long answer is simpler: Having too many consatraints on a set of equations make the set to have no possible solution. Maybe you have too many restrictions, so lifting restrictions is perhaps a good way to avoid having no success.

      <p>
        Somewhat re-iterating the last question here; I need to use a <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>, but I'm struggling with the implimentation a bit. Let's say I'm writting a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> for class Monkey. As part of Monkeys operation, it MUST create an instance of class Banana (ignore the poor analogy).  Banana does something which I don't really want to happen during the unit test.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously I need to write a Mock implimentation of Banana, and theres two ways I've tried this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Create an interface for Banana, and have Banana and MockBanana inherit from it: I find this a little smelly because it imposes a vtable on Banana where it is absolutely not required. Further to that it means I have 3 copies of the same interface, this seems to violate <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Instead of linking against banana.o, link against mockbanana.o which impliments exactly the same functions in stub/mock form. I like this way even less because it imposes MockBanana on the entire program. In other words Monkey must be tested in isolation from everything else.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first way appears to be the nicest, however it doesnt work in this situation. Monkey constructs a Banana, not a MockBanana. Therefore, the only way it could work is if I made a BananaFactory, that would construct either a Banana or a MockBanana. This is yet more superfluous code to impose on the program, and it also affects the runtime behaviour of Monkey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there a correct way to do this? - MikeAinsworth
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's difficult with the analogy to see why Monkey should at all be responsible for Banana's construction. If Banana is too "heavy" to be used during a unit test, that would imply to me that it should be inheriting from an interface.  It's a conclusion based off very little information (none) on what Monkey and Banana are actually doing. That being said, worrying about vtables and superfluous code is nonsense. Testable code does not come for free.</em> --PatrickMcCormick

        I have to create a series of Java unit tests for existing classes (no TDD here yet) and what seems natureal to me is to create mocks by hand by creating an interface and making both the real class and the mock class implement said interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously I want the mock class and the unit tests to stay in different jar files than the real code so that I don't release unit tests nor mock objects to the customer. Reasonable so far, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        The only problem I have is that I need a factory to decide if I'm doing a unit test or I'm running production code, so that whenever said object is instantiated, the appropiate object (real or mock) is instantiated. What I really want to test is another object, this one has to be mocked in order to test the other one (that's the theory of mocks).
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem I have is that the tests classes have access to the real classes, but the real classes can't have access to unit tests or mock objects. Reasonable, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        And the real classes have to have access to the factories, which have to have access to both the real and the mock objects. So I'm in a conundrum.
