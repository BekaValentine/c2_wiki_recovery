        Yahoo! Messenger is yet another <a href="InstantMessenger.html">InstantMessenger</a> system. In addition to chat, it will provide notification when your Yahoo Mail account receives e-mail.

        It has some advantages over ICQ, like: contact lists always on the server (<em>you can have contact list in servers in ICQ for some time now</em> ) and you are able to change the color you use in chats (it is a important visual hint). And some cons too: the file transfer is not very stable and the Unix/Linux/BSD client could be updated more often.

        I'm looking for a decent alternate Yahoo Messenger client for Linux, as the official one sometimes crashes. I'm trying <a href="GaimMessenger.html">GaimMessenger</a>, it has some very interesting features and you can program plugins in C or Perl. It has Unix and MS-Windows versions.

        <em>Try a </em>JabberProject client (for example, I use Gabber). There are many Jabber servers which act as gateways to the Y!M network (and ICQ, MSN Messenger and so on - I have one client that connects to all my IM accounts).<em></em>

        <a href="EveryBuddy.html">EveryBuddy</a> is a reasonable unofficial client.
