        "screen" is a program for Unix-ish systems acts as a "window manager" for non-graphic (text) terminals.  SCREEN allows you to switch between programs and yet use just one "terminal".

        Benefits (roughly in order of significance):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You don't have to open up plural xterm windows to get plural terminals -- screen gives you virtual terminals within the terminals.
        </li>
        <li>
           It works locally and on remote sessions alike.
        </li>
        <li>
           It provides a model that many users actually find nicer to use than windowed GUIs (no ordering windows around). At this time, the only window manager I know that can do the same (and more) is <a href="IonWindowManager.html">IonWindowManager</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           You can detach and reattach sessions.  Especially, if you do something that takes a long time, you can run it in a screen and check the results later. (E.g.: If you're ssh'd to another system, and you run screen on the remote machine, even if your localhost goes away forever, you can still reattach to your previous login with "screen -r" or "screen -x")
        </li>
        <li>
           Screens are automatically detached on lost connections. This means your work is under yet another layer of protection.
        </li>
        <li>
           You can do multiheaded displays.  "screen -x" lets you connect several physical terminals to one screen session.  Some have suggested this technique for long-distance <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           The screen can be split into sub-windows, so that the top and bottom halves represent different virtual terminals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here are the most common commands (all of which are preceded with an escape key, Ctrl-a by default):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           c - creates a new screen
        </li>
        <li>
           Space - Cycle forward through screens
        </li>
        <li>
           the escape key twice (eg. Ctrl-a Ctrl-a) - Jump back to last screen
        </li>
        <li>
           <n> - Jump to screen #<n>
        </li>
        <li>
           w - list all available screens
        </li>
        <li>
           S - split the current screen in half (ie, have 2 half-sized terminals on the screen at once)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Note that this is a capital S. If you type Ctrl-a s, screen will send an XOFF character, and the machine will stop sending data to your terminal until you type Ctrl-a q to send XON.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           [ - enter a vi-like mode for scrolling back through the current screen, as well as copying and pasting (Ctrl-]) text between multiple screens.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ctrl+d (or however else you normally log out of a shell) - remove a screen
        </li>
        <li>
           ? - find help about all the other commands.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is also possible to define further commands. For example, I used the command <em>bind '^p' screen -t python python</em> to make (escape key:Ctrl-a) Ctrl-p open up the Python interpreter in another window (bind '^p' screen python), with the title Python (-t python).

        I like screen. I think that Ctrl+a is not the best choice for the default meta-key. It is also the default emacs binding for beginning-of-line (and readline is used by <strong>a lot</strong> of terminal-based programs). -- <a href="TerrelShumway.html">TerrelShumway</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Good point.  Others do this: "echo set editing-mode vi > ~/.inputrc" and get vi-keys everywhere, making it moot.  But, yes, Ctrl+a + Emacs keys is a bad combo.  What do you recommend instead?
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I find Ctrl-a to be a very usable escape key, because I have Caps Lock remapped to be left-Ctrl. Also, I prefer <a href="VimTextEditor.html">VimTextEditor</a> to Emacs, so the key clobbering isn't an issue. -<a href="SckotVokes.html">SckotVokes</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can change the escape key. I have no idea why they set it up with Ctrl+a as default, I suspect it scares away many potential users. On new accounts, I always write ~/.screenrc file with the following line in it:
      </p>
      <code>
        escape ``<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (They're 'ticks', the unshifted symbol you get from the ~ key. <em>[</em><a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a> - not everyone has the same keymap.]<em>). I use vim but emacs on the command line as well. This allows you to rapidly switch between sessions using your left hand. If you want to type a tick, just press the key twice. The only time I tend to get caught is when I'm typing something like `date -I` in a bash command. Of course, that could also be written without backticks as $(date -I). And `d is just the 'freeze session and exit' key so you can get back to where you were with</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        screen -r<br/>
      </code>

        This disconnect/reconnect feature is one of the best things about screen. You can run pine in a screen session, have your session disconnect, and then come back in and just continue from where you left off where normally you would have lost the email you were typing. -- Craig Turner

        Although I am a user of <a href="VimTextEditor.html">VimTextEditor</a>, I use emacs editing-mode in shell, so I type Ctrl+a pretty often to go to beginning-of-line. So, I use Ctrl+o as a command key(starting with screen "-e^Oo" in zshell). One thing that's inconvenient is, in vim, you use Ctrl+o to go to the old position. But I personally don't use it often(and if you *really* want to go to old position, type Ctrl+o and another o) , and I stick to that command key. The other reason why I use Ctrl+o is that I want to use both hands when switching between windows. I usually open 4~5 windows and if I use Ctrl+a, I should type Ctrl+a+1~4 with only left hand. Of course, It would be different in <a href="DvorakKeyboard.html">DvorakKeyboard</a>. -- <a href="JiwonSeo.html">JiwonSeo</a>

      <p>
        Often typing "^Aa" instead of "^A" is not too bad...  depends on how much editing you're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of using -e on the command line you can put something like "escape ^Bb" into your .screenrc
      </p>

        These days (2014) there is also tmux (<a href="TerminalMultiplexer.html">TerminalMultiplexer</a>), which does similar stuff to screen, but seems a little more intuitive to use (and is said to have a nicer codebase) -- Noah Birnel
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Much thanks!  I've never heard of tmux before.  Turns out it's available on the servers I administer and it seems slicker than screen.</em>

        If you want something that's not very BatteriesIncluded, you might want to look into dtach with dvtm.  Sometimes the constraints dvtm imposes makes me focus a little more.
