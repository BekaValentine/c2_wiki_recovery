        <a href="WebServicesSecurity.html">WebServicesSecurity</a> (WS-Security) has been evolving for a few years and was adopted in Apr2004. See <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article.php?story=20040409040946753">http://www.thestandard.com/article.php?story=20040409040946753</a>

           in an interview elsewhere, it was acknowledge that the WS-Security standard has been taken on board by most vendors and hardware manufacturers. With this broad based support, there is now an end-to-end programming method. <em>But it is still a building block for things to come. (meaning "unfinished")</em>

        <a href="WebServicesSecurity.html">WebServicesSecurity</a> (WS-Security) is a higher level <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> stack, and it will break if lower level protocols such as <a href="SimpleObjectAccessProtocol.html">SimpleObjectAccessProtocol</a> uses extensions that do not conform to requirements of <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> (e.g. when DirectInternetMessageEncapulation is used for opaque data transmission).

           in 2002 the WS-Security standard has yet to be ratified, but the example showed how other security technologies could be deployed in conjunction with the evolving WS-Security standard.

        In Jul05 Oracle joined MS and IBM to back the WS-Trust, WS-<a href="SecureConversation.html">SecureConversation</a>, and WS-SecurityPolicy trough the <a href="OasisOrganization.html">OasisOrganization</a>. However WebServicesFederation is not included in this arrangement. See <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/articles/print/2140082">http://www.vnunet.com/articles/print/2140082</a> "This is too bad.

        <li>
           After <a href="WebServicesSecurity.html">WebServicesSecurity</a>, MS and IBM had planned for two more set of higher level <a href="XmlSecurity.html">XmlSecurity</a> stacks, the first set being WS-Policy, WS-Trust and WS-Privacy
        </li>
        <li>
           The first set deal with "(ensuring) information has been certified or that it is understood how the information can be shared with others."

           The second group includes WS-<a href="SecureConversation.html">SecureConversation</a>, see more at that page.

        Secure web servers are the equivalent of heavy armored cars.<br/>
        The problem is, they are being used to transfer rolls of coins<br/>
        and checks written in crayon by people on park benches to merchants<br/>
        doing business in cardboard boxes from beneath highway bridges.<br/>
        Further, the roads are subject to random detours, anyone with a<br/>
        screwdriver can control the traffic lights, and there are no police.<br/>
