        Something Must Be Done
      </h1>
      <p>
        When faced with a problem, a strategy we accuse <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a>(s) of following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="SomethingMustBeDone.html">SomethingMustBeDone</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Here's Something.
        </li>
        <li>
           So lets do it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples of Somethings: hire more coders
        (when the project is in time trouble), rewrite everything in java,
        hold a workshop, avoid eye contact with the customer. Add Somethings
        you've seen below, it beats banging your head on the wall. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           make it harder to delete stuff from wiki <em>yes! in fact we should make it much more socially acceptable - has anybody bothered to comment yet on </em><a href="RefactorFasterDeleteMore.html">RefactorFasterDeleteMore</a>?<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           cancel all project-related travel <em>or</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           let's fly everyone to Phoenix for a week
        </li>
        <li>
           let's waste our lives writing stupid documentation!
        </li>
        <li>
           "Everyone stop working!  We need to have a bunch of really long time-consuming meetings about our lack of adequate progress."  <em>(Actually, this can be a very healthy response, if done properly.)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           "Work smarter, not harder," words to live by from the second most clueless manager I have ever worked for
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This also happens in democracies: There ought to be a law.
