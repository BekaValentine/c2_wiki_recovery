        <a href="SoYaWannaWikiWiki.html">SoYaWannaWikiWiki</a> has tips for running a pre-written server. <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> has a large list of implementations people have written, most of them free and available. This page has some insights for people thinking of writing their own, or curious about the process.

        I wish Ward would push the changes in <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> (like the cookies that show your username on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>) into <a href="WikiBase.html">WikiBase</a>. Will this ever happen?
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish Ward would push the <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a> Perl stuff up.

        <li>
          st, find a page that has <a href="WikiInStraightPerl.html">WikiInStraightPerl</a> <em>[does </em><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wikibase?WikiInStraightPerl">http://c2.com/cgi/wikibase?WikiInStraightPerl</a> count or is that the wrong version?]<em> </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is seldom updated, in a constant state of flux, and poorly documented, even though it is the original. Others have taken his code (with permission): <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> has a long list. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Next, try to figure out the setup parms in the cryptic form, if you're using <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>. They aren't important - you can always go back and change them in the code. It is meant as a convenience, not a requirement. Here is a hint for creating the initial database: <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wikibase?WikiStandardPages">http://www.c2.com/cgi/wikibase?WikiStandardPages</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Have Perl installed or install it: <a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Spend the rest of the weekend reading the <a href="SourceCode.html">SourceCode</a> and guessing how to make it work ... once you've done that, you might as well start tweaking it - everyone else is. If you don't know Perl, start with another code base, write your own in another language, or learn Perl <em>first</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people run something other than <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> - <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> is a popular pick: <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl">http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl</a> - it has the features people expect and is easy to set up for someone with a basic understanding of Perl 4 - but you're really selling yourself short if you don't shop around.
      </p>
      <p>
        Half the Wikis on the net are <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> - the other half seem to be homebrew, though <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> is becoming popular.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going the homebrew route, either you want to try to grasp <a href="WikiEssence.html">WikiEssence</a> or else you feel you have your own understanding of it. The minimal implementation is, well, minimal. <a href="TinyWiki.html">TinyWiki</a> (a good pick for hacking on, well documented, good install instructions) starts at 30 odd lines. Automatically generating links, autovivicating pages, handling some basic markup, and allowing people to save changes are the core requirements to be useful, unless another approach is taken. Any amateur programmer can easily implement this in the language of their choice in a weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most <a href="WikiClones.html">WikiClones</a> are written for Unix-like systems and are written in a scripting language like Perl or Python. Actually, most of them are written in odd languages like awk, but scripting languages predominate. Most of them run as CGI-BIN applications. If this is what you're looking for, you're in luck. If it isn't, the odds are still in your favor. Wikis that run their own webserver, run under <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>, are written in a systems language, or whatever your requirement, might very well exist. If there isn't one written in your language of choice for your operating system of choice, this is the stimulus that many other people have reacted to in writing their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reverse links, version control, <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, full text searching, user logins, subpages are all becoming standard features and people expect them to be present, though, once again, depending on the direction you want to take, you may be able to substitute other features or do without. Many people seem to write <a href="WikiClones.html">WikiClones</a> to experiment with their own concept of a simple forum, and leaving unwanted cruft behind is a valid motive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get confused thinking about <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> - <em></em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a><em> Quite so. RSS feeds, </em><a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a>, trust metrics, and other advanced features go from there. No Wiki has everything as people are all innovating with their own code base. However, discussion of <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> is the largest TarPit at this stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many authors are happy to discuss their version and help you with it. Perhaps this can be merged into <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> as a field. No one can teach you to program or use Unix-like systems, but if you want to discuss the code, find a strange problem, or want to help, by all means, contact the author of the software. If you fork someone else's software and release, drop them a quick note - they usually enjoy hearing about it. <a href="AustinDavid.html">AustinDavid</a> says he will help point you towards a suitable <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a>. So will I, <a href="ScottWalters.html">ScottWalters</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A forum like this won't give you a good impression of what software you should be using - these are only general considerations. Rather than ask here which you should use (and no provide any details on your situation), look around on the Internet and identify which ones suit your personality, then find the development site for that Wiki, and learn more there. If you're looking for biased information, you want as much biased information, as direct from the source, as possible. Nothing is worse than muddled, improperly located, biased information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another motivation is pluggability - <a href="http://slashdot.org">http://slashdot.org</a> has a Wiki written to plug into their "slashcode" code base. Apparently Zope has one. Lots of object frameworks have their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turning a Wiki into a community is another issue entirely - see <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SeedPosting">http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SeedPosting</a> for some thoughts.

        That's the overview. Implementation details follow from here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Find out whether the native DBM on your server can handle entries greater than 1K. If not,
        write a replacement DBM package that uses only files and directories (warning: you must provide your own locking!) <a href="http://prtims.stx.com/NonDBM_File.pm">http://prtims.stx.com/NonDBM_File.pm</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, write or use something that uses CVS as the back end, or plain files. <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s should be indexed for
        performance on a large Wiki, but on a small Wiki, the overhead of parsing thousands of lines of Perl every hit
        will far outweigh any advantage to having words indexed. Flat files can work just fine for a small site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> and <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> use <em>diff</em> for version control. <a href="TinyWiki.html">TinyWiki</a> uses CVS or optionally no version control at all.

        Blech. Python rules. <a href="KirkBailey.html">KirkBailey</a> says so.

        Here's a page for a Python server and wiki. <a href="PythonServerPlus.html">PythonServerPlus</a>
