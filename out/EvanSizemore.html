        So im confused about why the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> was so hated. It seems to me
        That he was just trying to help fix grammar mistakes.

      <p>
        <strong>And something i hate is how every page eventually ends up about programming.</strong>

        I found this site on february 25, 2013. So i havent been here for long. It seems to me that there arent many people here,  and those who are just lurk. Im going to actively create pages but try my best not to edit or delete previously made pages.

        <em>That's because this Wiki is about </em><a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> in <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>.  There isn't <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a> without programming.<em></em>

        <em></em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> is hated for the reasons described at the top of the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> page.<em></em>

        ok thank you. I am also interested in programming, it would just be nice to see other stuff, too.

        could you tell me the average number of people that visit this site every day?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I do not know the number of </em><a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a>s.  The number of Wiki authors is rather variable, but new edits can be seen on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.<em></em>

        There are about 36000 pages on the wiki and rather more than 4000 of them are home pages for individuals who have been here at some time in the past, although not many are active at the moment. There is a lot here to find and value, as well as the current discussions. It really depends what you are interested in. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
