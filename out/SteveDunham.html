        I'm a Software Engineer, Computer Scientist, and Mathematician. My home page
        can be found at <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~dunham/">http://www.cse.msu.edu/~dunham/</a>

        I'm currently working for a company in San Francisco called Clever Machine. I'm intrigued by XP, but haven't yet had a chance to use it. My
        general computer science interests are learning new languages and techniques, and advancing the art of programming.

        I also do a little work for the Debian Linux project.

        If you're in the Bay area and want to get together for a beer, drop me an email.
