        I am a programmer with opinions, probably like most that visit this Wiki. I first visited, I think, in '95 and my visits are occasional. I don't have much to say about myself here, but you might find a few things I've had to say about a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> here or there. Most recently I've been thinking you should <a href="WriteTheUserManualFirst.html">WriteTheUserManualFirst</a>. If you want to know more about me, that's what the links above are for.

        That said, I hope it is enough to convince all y'all that this page isn't spam. I thank the kind author who rescued my <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> from obscurity.

        <em>Skip, I've restored your </em><a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>, which someone deleted because they thought it was spam...<em></em>

        Do you know <a href="SkipList.html">SkipList</a>s? I know, that they are not named after you, but I couldn't but add this link :-)
        <em>Ah, so this is not the list of entries that appear when I google myself ;)</em>
