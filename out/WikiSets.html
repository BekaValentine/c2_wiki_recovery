        Wiki Sets
      </h1>
      <p>
        A place to write descriptions of interesting sets of Wiki pages.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>The set of all Wiki pages that are self-describing.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        An example is <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oddly, it is impossible for <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s to be cited as an example of this set. It could be an example, but it would stop being one if I told you about it by linking to it. <em>Unless you 'cite' DeadPages like that.</em> Wow. YouLearnSomethingNewEveryDay.

        Any others?

        ThePageThatListsAllWikiPagesThatDontLinkToThemselves gives us a nice paradox.

        <em>Not really, there isn't any particular reason why it couldn't maintain a link to itself in addition to the list.  Also, the title of the page itself could be included as the first item in the list :)</em>
