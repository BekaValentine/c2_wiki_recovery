          <em>The Include feature lets me create pages that are specifically tailored to each event and audience, literally without having to rekey or even Copy and Paste any existing text blocks. I'm even using this to assemble program source code from my libraries (possible since I try to standardize as much as possible.</em>

          <em> I am sufficiently impressed by all of this that I am thinking about how to swap 'Pages' containing useful text blocks with others, perhaps by simply Posting well-named 'atomic' Pages, that could be Included to instantly 'make' a relatively large, tailored document, especially if the Include pages are themselves also Posted.</em>

        Perhaps markup could be something like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Include_IncludePageName (Which the Engine processes and inserts at this point)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Similar to the way this wiki inserts images
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
