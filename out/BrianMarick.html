        I used to write for <a href="MarkSwanson.html">MarkSwanson</a> and The Wild Hunt. I took the first course in Smalltalk that <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> taught at the University of Illinois. I'm a testing consultant and have also returned to take another whack at a PhD under Ralph. Thanks to <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>, I find myself sometimes arguing that developers are doing too much <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing. This is a big switch.

        May I say, Marick's Corner is one of my favorite test resources on the web.

        I have a third web site at <a href="http://www.testingcraft.com.">http://www.testingcraft.com.</a> It's a place where people can show explicit examples of testing techniques and the like. Programmers learn to program (and design) by looking at code, especially big systems. Testers are supposed to learn by hearing generalities and seeing them applied to toy problems. Doesn't work. Testing Craft is an attempt to dredge out more big examples, especially ones testers can collaborate on.
