        <em>It appears that </em><a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> has hired Klingons....<em></em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           Specifications are for the weak and timid!

           This machine is a piece of GAGH! I need dual Pentium processors if I am to do battle with this code! <em>You are MISTAKEN!! Only a most excellent machine could be worthy of being compared to a plate of gagh!</em> How dare you! I am NOT mistaken. Machines should not be eaten, they are weapons, they should be hard and sharp, not soft and creepy!

           You cannot really appreciate Dilbert until you have heard it in the original Klingon. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Indentation?! - I will show you how to indent when I indent your skull! 
        </li>
        <li>
           What is this talk of "Release"? Klingons do not make software "releases". Our software "escapes", leaving a bloody trail of designers and quality assurance people in its wake! 
        </li>
        <li>
           Klingon functions calls do not have "parameters" - They have "ARGUMENTS" and they ALWAYS WIN. 
        </li>
        <li>
           "Debugging"? Klingons do not debug.  Our software does not coddle the weak. 
        </li>
        <li>
           I have challenged the entire quality assurance team to a Bat'leth contest. They will not concern us, again. 
        </li>
        <li>
           A TRUE Klingon warrior does not comment his code! 
        </li>
        <li>
           By filing this user request, you have challenged the honour of my family! PREPARE TO DIE!! 
        </li>
        <li>
           You question the worthiness of my code? I should kill you where you stand! 
        </li>
        <li>
           Our users will know fear, and cower before our software!  Ship it!  Ship it and let them flee like the dogs they are!! 
        </li>
        <li>
           Sales people have no honor 
        </li>
        <li>
           Four thousand lines of code may be typed in one night by a fast coder.
        </li>
        <li>
           A bug may become a feature in the time it takes to compile the code.
        </li>
        <li>
           Only a fool codes in an IDE.
        </li>
        <li>
           Perhaps today IS a good day to resign!
        </li>
        <li>
           Test or Code. Not both!
        </li>
        <li>
           They are not our customers. They are our enemies!
        </li>
        <li>
           Out Project Manager acted like a spineless P'taaq in that meeting! I have deleted his login and I assume command myself!

        This is fun the first time you see it.  A quick observation, though, is that a search on <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> shows that this already appears on the web some 200 times. Maybe I'm just a <a href="PartyPooper.html">PartyPooper</a> ...

        This page would not be complete without mentioning Var'aq, the Klingon <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>.  One typically ends a program with "abort(); kill(); kill();"
