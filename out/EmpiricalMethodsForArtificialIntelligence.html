        [ISBN 0-26-20322-52] A wonderful book which, while it has a slightly different notion of science (from my own), nonetheless talks a lot about how we can be more scientific in our work.

        <em>Computer science and artificial intelligence in particular have no curriculum in research methods, as other sciences do. This book presents empirical methods for studying complex computer programs: exploratory tools to help find patterns in data, experiment designs and hypothesis-testing tools to help data speak convincingly, and modeling tools to help explain data.</em> -- Amazon review
