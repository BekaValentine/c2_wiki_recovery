        Hello.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an Internet consultant, currently doing project management.  I'm also the founder and president of the InternetDevelopersAssociation [<a href="http://www.association.org],">http://www.association.org],</a> a non-profit trade association for Internet content developers.  My primary interest here in for my own project, developing a multi-user environment.
      </p>

        Recently a friend recommended reading Christopher Alexander's The Timeless Way Of Building and it has added a whole new dimension to the project. I've recently purchased the Gang Of Four book and I'm looking forward to reading it.
      </p>

        Many thanks to Ward Cunningham and the rest of the community here.  It is a joy to find such a wonderful, living resource.
