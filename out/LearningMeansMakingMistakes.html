        Learning Means Making Mistakes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Whenever programmers get a new toy, they play with it.  They push
        it to see how far it will go, and that means that they always
        misuse it.  This is how they learn how to use it.  When programmers 
        first learn OOP, they overuse inheritance.  When programmers first 
        read <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, they try to make every method into a Strategy
        and build a Facade for the smallest subsystem.  When programmers
        first use a system for graphically connecting components (<a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>
        is what comes to mind for me), they try to implement the whole
        application using it, leading to a dense network that is impossible
        to follow.  In all cases, the problem is not with the technique, it
        is with overusing the technique.  All benefits have a cost.  But the
        only way to find out the limits of a technique is to go beyond them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, we'd learn the limits of a new technique before we started
        using it "for real".  But that would require more training time than
        we usually want to spend.  So, we always end up learning on the job.

        For an interesting (although at times overblown) essay on this concept in the civil and mechanical engineering worlds, have a look at HenryPetroski's book <em></em><a href="ToEngineerIsHuman.html">ToEngineerIsHuman</a>: The Role of Failure in Successful Design<em>. Much of the book resonates powerfully with the issues facing software developers. --</em><a href="DavidThomas.html">DavidThomas</a>

        This is one of the first principles of teaching <a href="GameOfChess.html">GameOfChess</a>, <a href="GameOfGo.html">GameOfGo</a> or most any other skill that values accuracy.  Don't be afraid to make make mistakes <em>when learning</em> even if the eventual goal is perfection.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing to note: you do need to <em>recognize</em> your mistakes in order to learn from them, otherwise you just reinforce bad habits.  For most endeavors this means having an experienced coach or some other means of quality feedback.  For programmers, this could be the compiler if the error messages and warnings are high quality, or one's pair when <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> or reviewing code for the more subtle stylistic and design mistakes.
