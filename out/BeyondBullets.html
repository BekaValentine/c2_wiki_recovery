        No this is not spam it is something which was already here and is in my opinion interesting to discuss. It is based on work done with Microsoft <a href="PowerPoint.html">PowerPoint</a> but there is a lot more to it than just that. The main point is the application of ideas of how the human mind absorbs information to the use of presentation media. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
