        Since recently, I've been employed at Siemens. Right now I'm working with Enterprise Application Integration software TIBCO (<a href="http://www.tibco.com/).">http://www.tibco.com/).</a>

        It's the same company that recently got some interesting press for suing the hell out of Apple: turns out that Apple was using TIBCO's registered trademark Rendezvous to name their zero-configuration networking. Apple since changed their technology's name to Bonjour.

        In the meanwhile I've turned 26 and left my position at Siemens. I'm currently working in a small company specializing in consulting, design and development support with IBM's Rational tools. I get to write code, think about how to write code and most fun of all, I get to teach young programmers. I love working with people!
