        Hi Helmut, nice to see another Erlang hacker around. What're you doing with it? -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm using Mnesia (<a href="MnesiaDatabase.html">MnesiaDatabase</a>) and XMerl to write a content management system for technical documentation. I started to do XML processing with Refal (<a href="RefalLanguage.html">RefalLanguage</a>). XML processing in functional languages with pattern matching is much more natural than manipulating a DOM in the traditional OO way. When I needed a database, I searched for a language which is as similar as possible to Refal, but for which a well-integrated database binding is available. Of all languages I came to know of, Erlang was the one which met these criteria best. Only the pattern matching capabilities of Refal go far beyond those of Erlang. -- her

      <p>
        Explanation:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Most of this sentence is in a possible future tense.  (English teachers have a phrase that means "possible future tense".)</dd>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "I would be grateful"
        </li>
        <li>
           "if anyone could correct"
        </li>
        <li>
           "if anyone could put"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>English authors try to make each paragraph have a single tense.  (They don't always succeed.)</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>In the 'incorrect' version of the sentence, you have a past tense clause that is acting as an adjective:  "I made" describes "contributions".  This tense can be changed to better match the rest of the sentence.  The 'correct' version of the sentence has "I have made" instead of "I made". </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Some people prefer not to make this change.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Modern English authors try to use shorter sentences.  Shorter sentences have fewer verbs, so it is easier to make all of the verbs in each sentence have the same tense.</dd>
      </dl>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Also, most English style-guides say that if a quotation is at the end of a sentence, the period should go inside of the quotation, "whether it is logical or not."
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer to put the period "where it is logical".  -- <a href="JasperPaulsen.html">JasperPaulsen</a>

      <p>
        I also prefer to put the period "where is is logical".
      </p>
      <p>
        And to add my two cents to the corrections:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>I'd be grateful, if anyone could correct any contributions I have made and put some comments <strong>about</strong> what was wrong with the original version onto this page.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        You're going to wish you never started this Helmut :-)
