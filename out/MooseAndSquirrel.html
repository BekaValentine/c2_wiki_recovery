        The usual programmer, as referred to by the "big people".  Also, everyone according to Stalin.  Anything that's really annoying, and needs to be killed.

        <em>Hey, I liked Rocky and Bullwinkle!</em> also "Sammy You!"

        <em>Rocky</em> and <em>Bullwinkle</em> make great <a href="MetasyntacticVariable.html">MetasyntacticVariable</a>s.

        Also noted that Mulder and Scully of The X-Files are <a href="MooseAndSquirrel.html">MooseAndSquirrel</a> analogs

        <em>Really?  Funny, I can't picture Mulder saying -- Hey Scully!  Watch me pull a rabbit outta my hat!  And Scully in a WWI flying helmet? -- it just wouldn't work with her hair...</em>

      <p>
        Moose is the more gullible one, Squirrel the skeptic; Moose is taller; Squirrel is voiced by a woman; one X-Files episode even had Mulder listening to an informant retelling a tale that Scully ID'd as "last night's Rocky and Bullwinkle episode"
