        Close The Deal Quickly

        In some circumstances, such as sales, if the potential customer/client leaves the negotiations he/she will <a href="NeverComeBack.html">NeverComeBack</a>. For many buyers, selecting a job offer is an example of the <a href="BeautyContestProblem.html">BeautyContestProblem</a>, so either you have to convince them that <em>your</em> offer is the best they will get, or else they will leave. (Of course, if they do come back to your showroom, you have them at an advantage -- but that's generally rare). So it is a good idea to <a href="CloseTheDealQuickly.html">CloseTheDealQuickly</a>. Some ways to do this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Give them a <a href="DeadlineToAccept.html">DeadlineToAccept</a>. "This offer is only good today" can be a surprisingly effective technique, especially against an unskilled negotiator.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Alternatively, give them a carrot for closing the deal early ("if you buy this car today, we'll throw in a free tank of gas!")
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Even if you have no other offers, act like you have <a href="MoreThanOneOffer.html">MoreThanOneOffer</a>. Especially if the resource being bought is scarce (only one job opening, only one loss-leader on the lot), let they buyer know (or make the buyer think) they are in competition with someone else, and only the first to accept will get the deal.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Please note that the "techniques" described here are mostly bullshit. If you want to create long term relationships you need to treat your customers/business partners properly. You keep me by treating me right every time. You lose me by bullshitting me exactly once.</em>
