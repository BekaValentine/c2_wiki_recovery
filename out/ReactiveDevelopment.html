        Reactive Development
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ReactiveDevelopment.html">ReactiveDevelopment</a> means that management has a bunch of software built by over-waged repository legends, then builds a new, dynamic team of uprising developers around it to tinker it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A parallel definition perhaps is embodied in the reaction of developers when the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> states, "It's going to take you how long to do this?!?  I thought you were an expert in the field, we need it done by the end of the week!"

        I realize of course that this is like throwing chum into a pool of hungry irritable mutant sea bass.  But what the heck.  Here's a sample of the beauty which is Reactive Development:

      <p>
        "The beauty of Reactive Programming is its cyclicity. All you do now is go back to the Blind Coding stage. It's useful to try and forget as much as possible about what the customer may have said to you. Don't let facts and requirements cloud your mind: keep your programming pure. If Reactive projects have failed, 90% of the time it's because the programmers forgot this one vital element: do not, under any circumstances, listen to the customer. They don't really know what it is they want. It's your job to educate them!"
