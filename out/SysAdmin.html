        The system administration software for Multics was written in about 1969, by Joseph F. Ossanna and Michael J. Spier.  No one remembers now who coined the term or adopted the convention of <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>. (The first Multics <a href="SysAdmin.html">SysAdmin</a> other than test users was 
        <a href="TomVanVleck.html">TomVanVleck</a>, then a member of the MIT research staff.)
