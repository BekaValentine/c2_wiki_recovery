        Abstract Subclass

      <p>
        <a href="AbstractSubclass.html">AbstractSubclass</a> is a class that provides additional services based on the services the potential super/parent class provides.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is abstract in the sense that there are abstract requirements of what the super/parent class needs to implement.

        A simple example would be the EnumerableModule in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> in which a class provides an <a href="InternalIterator.html">InternalIterator</a> method called 'each', then by including/mixing in the EnumerableModule, the original class will be enhanced with new functionalities such as collect, detect, find, includes, etc.
