        <strong></strong><a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> management scheme needed<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, in Oct05, there is an influx of new people, a result of a more relaxed <a href="EditCodeWord.html">EditCodeWord</a> setup. I suggest we put a <a href="FlyingVisitor.html">FlyingVisitor</a> stamp on unrecognized people who create UserNames and nothing else that is <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>. For others who create <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> and have been recognized (maybe thru IP) to participate in community activities, then we add a <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a> to the created <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>. If the created <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> represent a recognized name in the computing field, then maybe we add <a href="CategoryPerson.html">CategoryPerson</a> if it could be of interest.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If there is a recognized IT person <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> added, we may want to watch the activities related to that name for a few days. If nothing happens we may want stamp it with <a href="DeletedButWelcomeToWiki.html">DeletedButWelcomeToWiki</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           If we do not do anything for a few days, then weeks later it will be hard to guess whether a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> was created in good faith. A better solution probably exists but I am too tired to think. -- dl
