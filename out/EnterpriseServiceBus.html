        Enterprise Service Bus
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="EnterpriseServiceBus.html">EnterpriseServiceBus</a> (ESB) is a technical infrastructure. It is one mechanism that can be used to assist with the implementation of a <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        See article <em>All aboard! The enterprise service bus pulls in</em> at
        <a href="http://www.zdnet.co.uk/print/?TYPE=story&AT=39162065-39020505t-21000005c">http://www.zdnet.co.uk/print/?TYPE=story&AT=39162065-39020505t-21000005c</a> (ref A)

        A good book for learning about the principles behind ESB is <a href="EnterpriseIntegrationPatterns.html">EnterpriseIntegrationPatterns</a>.

        <strong>ESB and </strong>AsyncMessagingLayer<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        An asynchronous messaging layer (see <a href="MessageOrientedMiddleware.html">MessageOrientedMiddleware</a>) differentiates this type of architecture from solutions built on older technologies like <a href="InternetInterOrbProtocol.html">InternetInterOrbProtocol</a> (IIOP), <a href="DistributedCom.html">DistributedCom</a> (Dcom), etc. Its use promises relief from IDL proliferation problems described in <a href="FacadeAtTheDistributionBoundary.html">FacadeAtTheDistributionBoundary</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ESB based implementations support a Publish and Subscribe Event handling mechanisms. Typically, the ESB engine has message transformation capabilities so it can assist in the integration of disparate applications. Other characteristics of this ESB based implementation are described in the article, "In Pursuit of Agility", located at <a href="http://www.intelligententerprise.com/print_article.jhtml?articleID=49400918.">http://www.intelligententerprise.com/print_article.jhtml?articleID=49400918.</a> The article is also the source of the following picture.
