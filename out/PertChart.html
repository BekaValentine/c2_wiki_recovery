        Pert Chart
      </h1>
      <p>
        A story I've heard several times over the years is that <strong>Pert</strong> was devised during the construction of the Polaris submarine not as a tool for managing the project, but as tool for distracting attention away from the project. By giving government oversight bureaucrats a big chart with lots of boxes that needed to be kept up-to-date, the bureaucrats where keep out of the way of the people who were doing the real work.
