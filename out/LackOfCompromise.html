        Lack Of Compromise
      </h1>
      <p>
        Lack of Compromise is when you wish to have a life outside of work, so you don't stay at the office as late. When you're not in the office, you're obviously not working hard enough. When you're away from the office you obviously only spend your time on Reddit and Youtube instead of socializing or tending to your family. There is no such thing as family. Only work. Just work. There is no compromise.
