        Software Development Improvement

        <em>What is </em><a href="SoftwareDevelopmentImprovement.html">SoftwareDevelopmentImprovement</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people equate software development to a process, implying <em>SDI = process improvement</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Software development uses many tools, so of course <em>SDI = tool improvement</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You couldn't tell from a lot of my code, but software development is part skill, therefore to some extent <em>SDI = skill improvement</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Computer scientists get their name from the fact that, partly, <em>SDI = science</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But many speak of software engineering, implying <em>SDI = professional discipline</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some point out that software development is a team activity, implying <em>SDI = social skill improvement</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kuhn would probably claim that for big advances <em>SDI = paradigm shift</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And of course post modernists and perl programmers would probably argue that <strong><em>SDI = all of the above</em></strong>.
