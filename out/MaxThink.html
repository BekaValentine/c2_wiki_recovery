        <a href="MaxThink.html">MaxThink</a> is a pioneering software product providing authoring tools for using hypertext. <a href="NeilLarson.html">NeilLarson</a> runs <a href="MaxThink.html">MaxThink</a>.  He is said to welcome phone calls to talk about this stuff, so I'm going to call him soon and talk to him about esp. the process of <a href="KnowledgeAnnealing.html">KnowledgeAnnealing</a> (he refers to it as InformationAnnealing) that linked me there to him and here.

        I used <a href="MaxThink.html">MaxThink</a> 10+ years ago in college when I was experimenting with a whole host of non-linear editing systems.  Alas most of those systems got squashed out of the marketplace by MicroSquash.  Glad to see some continuing interest there.
