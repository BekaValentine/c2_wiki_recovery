        Some pages use <a href="DoubleLines.html">DoubleLines</a> to separate a <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> <a href="OpeningStatement.html">OpeningStatement</a>, thesis, or pattern at the top of a page and (usually <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>) discussion below. The top part is generally the pages payload -- a short article on the page's title subject along with bibliographic information; while the bottom is meta-data about the page -- discussion, suggested changes, categorization, stories, indirectly related links etc...

      <p>
        On <a href="SeparateThreadsFromContent.html">SeparateThreadsFromContent</a>, someone said "The point is that no one seeking signal needs to read below the double lines."
      </p>
      <p>
        Reversing that statement would imply that everything below <a href="DoubleLines.html">DoubleLines</a> would be noise. As a newcomer, I'd rather see <a href="DoubleLines.html">DoubleLines</a> as an separator between stable and volatile content. Eventually as hint for later refactorisations. -- <a href="DavidSchmitt.html">DavidSchmitt</a>

        Sometimes it's used to separate different topics on a page.
        And, as such, it practically begs for the page to be refactored -- and offers some guidance on good break points for the refactoring.
