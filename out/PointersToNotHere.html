        This is a class of pointers which exist to indicate the lack of a pointed to State, Object, Reference, or Method.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is initially a Pointer to Nowhere and has no champion, being only a notation.

        It becomes actionable only when it is provided a destination or fulfillment by one who accepts, or is assigned the responsibility of action.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is useful because it announces that something is missing.

        This is what <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a> is. (Abstract, Structural, Not fully developed, suggestive) I mean for the idea to be abstract. In this way it covers more objects, much in the way classes do.

      <p>
        <em>[Indeed.  The above certainly raises the bar on </em><a href="WoodenLanguage.html">WoodenLanguage</a>.  Wouldn't the description be much clearer if it were replaced with a statement like, "These tags indicate pages in need of further work or attention," and perhaps change the page title to something meaningful like PageNeedsWork or CategoryNeedsAttention?]<em>  See Below (Plain Language Instances)</em>
