        Not Nice Enough
      </h1>
      <p>
        I propose this page to be a <a href="DeletionCandidate.html">DeletionCandidate</a>. It contains little or no useful technical information, and scarcely adds value to this wiki.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's exactly <a href="NotNiceEnough.html">NotNiceEnough</a> of you. The article contains a great example (dialog below) of a <strong>ranter</strong> who wants to fix problems, with a nice person responding back (bugs are okay, they are nice).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you can find value in the mess, please, feel free to extract it and delete the remainder.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The eye is in the beholder. Those who are insecure may even be offended by this article, the links it points to, and the clear example which uses dialog to demonstrate a ranter who wishes to fix problems versus a nice person who lets it slide by.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Yes, your examples clearly show that you think that being nice means leaving things alone, not complaining, not criticising, and not trying to make things better. Your examples clearly show that you think only people who are not nice ever get things done. Well, you're wrong.

           Based on the incorrect assumption that being nice is driven by being insecure. Maybe the author has only met nice people who are nice because they're insecure, but maybe that tells us more about the author than it does about the people they've met. Some people are nice because they're nice, it's possible to be nice without being a wuss, a wimp, or a loser.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>First, you need to buy a sense of humor somewhere. Second: you aren't being very nice yourself by not accepting the article as a comic, which it is clearly marked as so with comics in its web page. You're being very insecure by not simply laughing at the article and taking some useful points out of it. This is a sign of </em><a href="AnalRetentive.html">AnalRetentive</a>.<em></em>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           First, you need to decide whether this article is supporting your claim that being nice is a bad thing, or whether it's humor. You seem confused about what point you're trying to make, and how to make it. On the one hand you claim being nice isn't valuable, and you quote a comic to make your point, then on the other hand you claim it's a joke. Make up your mind.
        </li>
        <li>
           Second, some comics just aren't funny.
        </li>
        <li>
           Third, since it's simply not funny I considered the article carefully to see if there was anything I could learn from it. There wasn't. <a href="GetOverIt.html">GetOverIt</a>, move on, you're not making your points. This is a sign of being <a href="ChronicallyRight.html">ChronicallyRight</a>.

           Finally, this page contributes nothing useful to this wiki. Once, admittedly now over ten years ago, this wiki was an absolute goldmine of technical information, assistance, and ideas. Now it has pages like this one with you self-aggrandising all over it. If you contributed useful and interesting technical material I could put up with a lot of other crap from you, but you don't seem to add anything useful, even though there are occasional hints that you are actually really, really clever. Try this. Try spending a week discussing only technical issues. Maybe you can play a part in making this wiki valuable again.

      <p>
        A lot of people are offended by anyone who has a critical nature, anyone who writes articles (of any sort), anyone who criticizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        These critical thinkers are just are <a href="NotNiceEnough.html">NotNiceEnough</a> for society. Oh poo poo. We made someone feel bad. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The irony is that criticizing a person for being <a href="NotNiceEnough.html">NotNiceEnough</a> is not really nice itself - because criticizing the criticizer is criticism too. CriticismIsRecursive?
      </p>
      <p>
        People who are <a href="NotNiceEnough.html">NotNiceEnough</a> are often the ones who find bugs, find flaws, fix problems, etc.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           And you have some evidence for this? Perhaps those who are <a href="NotNiceEnough.html">NotNiceEnough</a> simply trumpet their own worth and get noticed more, whereas those who are nice are equally competent, perhaps even more competent, and just don't track the attention. Maybe they actually get more kudos and respect, and those who are <a href="NotNiceEnough.html">NotNiceEnough</a> actually accomplish less, make more noise, and get less respect. You can't tell. An empty barrel makes the most noise.

        For example why do some seem to write rudely, or why are some often accused of ranting?

      <p>
        Aims for a young scientist... wow.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Humble" has several definitions. In encouraging people to show more humility we are not asking them to become low in station - that would be ridiculous. Taking "humility" to imply that you are striving for low standards is ludicrous. Assuming there is meaning in the exhortation, another meaning of "humble" must be relevant. Here is a definition from the Concise Oxford Dictionary:</em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Having, or showing, a low estimate of one's own importance."</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <em>That sounds more likely. The exhortation is that everyone should show due recognition that others may genuinely be better. That is what it means to have a degree of humility. Accept that others may know more, and be smarter, and strive to convince them. In doing so you gain credence and reputation. To do otherwise, to criticize others and simply state things as if they are self-evident truths for lesser mortals to accept without question is to start by alienating them, and then either you're wrong, thus losing status, or you're right, fostering resentment. I strongly recommend you read </em><a href="HowToWinFriendsAndInfluencePeople.html">HowToWinFriendsAndInfluencePeople</a>. Although now very dated, if you read it to find information, and not simply to mock, there is much there about learning how to get along with people, and how to convey information in a way that makes them want to accept things that are right.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The quoted paper from EWD implicitly exhorts people to have a degree of humility. It says:</em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Never tackle a problem ... that ... will be tackled by others who are ... at least as competent ... as you are.</dd>

      <p>
        <em>This shows a healthy regard for the abilities of others.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This sounds like we are discussing <em>not being arrogant</em>. Who are the arrogant people who assume I am arrogant - which is an arrogant act itself, hence RecursiveArrogance. For example, how can you, as an arrogant person, say that I am arrogant - when I am catching you in the act of arrogance (AnonomousDonor, <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>, and all the other wimps who call <em>me</em> arrogant - yet I never call them arrogant, even though I've found several instances on this wiki which prove they are arrogant (I remain humble and do not say a thing, as I don't prefer to insult as much as I prefer to <em>engage</em> in <em>technical conversations</em> (this is not one of them, so please shut your trap hole)).

        Word of warning: all intelligent people in history were ranters, complainers, critically minded people, etc.

        I have strong bull shit detectors and I outright admit to having an ego and I outright admit to being extremely critical (yet I selflessly release thousands of source code snippets to the public, and participate in open source projects, so don't get the wrong idea that I am somehow selfishly egotistical).
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of easy going programmers go with the flow, listening to whatever they hear - agreeing with mainstream. I am not like that. So someone may appear mean, rude, critical at times.
      </p>
      <p>
        All intelligent people are like this. People that are too easy going are not as intelligent. People that don't critically analyze and nitpick are simply not intelligent - they are just followers. They aren't leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several quotes that prove this.

           {<em>Is</em> it better than being nice? Why? I've tried both. I've been a critical bastard, and I've been nice. These days, I try to be nice. Sometimes I slip and become a critical bastard, but without exception it turns out that being "nice" results in considerably more pleasantness for all concerned, including (if not especially) me. It also turns out that it's harder to be nice than be a critical bastard, but it's worth the effort. It's also possible to simultaneously be nice and be critical, which is a good thing lest idiocy hold sway. This is the hardest thing of all, but the rewards -- not surprisingly -- are greatest.}

           If we can make a compromise and some how be nice (and humorous too) while also being critical - then this is good. I try, but sometimes people mistake my humor as pure rudeness.

You were a bastard, Dave, when you criticized Top in places like <a href="FraudulentMindset.html">FraudulentMindset</a>, <a href="ImproveDatabasesOrElse.html">ImproveDatabasesOrElse</a>, etc. But you were nice too - so you are right, combining and making compromises is <em>better</em> than being <em>purely</em> rude.

        It's not a question of writing nicely or rudely, it's a question of being worth listening to. Linus and Pascal have both proven that they are worth listening to, and if they won't tolerate fools, then at least they've earned the right. You've created a lot of straw men here, and knocked them over, but you haven't made your case. You have said nothing that makes me believe you're worth listening to, and many things that appear to be a waste of time. You've compared yourself with Socrates, Plato, <a href="FabianPascal.html">FabianPascal</a> and <a href="LinusTorvalds.html">LinusTorvalds</a>, and it seems to me that the comparison is not especially in your favor. So by all means continue to rant, but don't expect people to be bothered to read it. If you don't care enough to attract a reader, I'm not going to care enough to wade through your self-congratulatory raving. Perhaps history will show that you were right, but if no one listens, no one will know.

        <em>I am </em>'not here to claim I am at the level of Linus or Dijkstra<em>'. That is changing the subject, and is a straw man. I just use them as examples since they are popular people you recognize and know, who rant and criticize. By the way, I have many articles which prove my own ignorance, and I openly admit to being ignorant on many subjects (such as not being a C++ or C expert). So drop that idea right now, that I am comparing myself to others - I am simply referencing others, like how we cite sources.</em>

        <em>What I am pointing out on this page is that all humans who are critical and intelligent, will </em>'question current practices<strong>. As soon as I question what Google is doing, that must be terrible! Google is the industry! They can't be wrong. The relational model is wrong. Must be. Oh poo poo. Your claim that people won't read me but they will read Dijkstra, is also straw man. The sad thing is, many people do not read Dijkstra, or Fabian, or Darwen and Date, or many other writings from intelligent people. (Linus hates Dijkstra, according to what he has said on newsgroups - and probably doesn't read his material.. so your claim that sensible ranters are read but insensible ones (me) are not read, is false..). Dijkstra, Fabian, or any other ranter are not read by vast populations of people (otherwise Fabian would be rich, for example) - which is </strong>exactly what this page is about<strong>. Most of the industry hates ranters, because they are </strong><a href="NotNiceEnough.html">NotNiceEnough</a>. Smart people are not good at marketing their reading material - the industry is better at that (Microsoft documentation is more read than a Dijkstra article is).<em></em>

        <em>Looking through Dijkstra's articles, many of them are pessimistic titles (rant style). Oh poo poo. Don't read those then. I've earned consulting projects because of being a ranter, BTW - people respect it, those who are in the know. Those who pass by my rants and consider me a lunatic, can pass by. I'm okay with that.

No. I'm just referencing you, citing you, etc. But I can't really cite you because you didn't sign your name - and I could throw up a straw man argument about how real men sign names, etc.</em>

        In contrast to what you claim above I've actually read quite a lot of what you've been writing here, and I've read a number of your "articles" on the wiki which you've referenced. I didn't know it was "your" wiki, but thanks for that information. It did seem clear that most of what I read was written by you, I just didn't know if that's because I only found "your" bits, or whether it was all yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I've been reading your strong opinions when they are on topics that interest me, and I've formed my opinion of the value of your comments. I also looked at the impression your writings leave, and wondered if it was intentional, or if you simply wrote without considering the form, as well as the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe you are wrong when you accuse me of not looking at the entire picture, but of course I would believe that. Perhaps I'm wrong in my opinions of you, your writing, your knowledge and your way of expressing it, and so I've been trying to help you see yourself as others see you. Clearly either I've failed, or you don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, I think much of your ranting on technical issues is misguided, unhelpful, or simply wrong. Some of it is genuinely insightful, but usually that is in criticisms of other people's work, and rarely is it accompanied by any useful alternative suggestions or options. I think this is a shame, because I see ability misapplied, and that's a waste.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Non helpful, non constructive, and misguided: such as my critical article about Google (the industry), in which I provide a clear constructive alternative to <em>Google File System</em>. It is called </strong>Google Relational Database System<em>. I provide a humorous but </em><a href="HaHaOnlySerious.html">HaHaOnlySerious</a> article and drawing, which shows computers spitting out tabular data - which I am <em>not</em> fully joking about. I only provide some humor (smily faces in the drawing) to ease in the idea to people like <em>you</em> who are <em>hurt</em> by my critical constructive intelligent suggestions. Apparently, this is offensive and you missed the entire <em>constructive criticism</em> parts of the article - such as me stating that Google employees are <em>BRILLIANT</em> (absolutely serious), but that they lack some relational model knowledge. Oh poo poo. And it is <em>true</em>. My argument is <em>fully</em> justified. I have also started to build my own cluster system using the very idea I outline in my drawing, and it is not just some academic <em>rant</em> of mine - but a real world solution to a problem of parsing large data sets. For those who do not see the constructive points about an article, may be destructive themselves. Look in the mirror.<strong></strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I appreciate the feedback you've given me. I've considered carefully your comments and assessments. You seem not to understand the meaning of the word "humble", certainly your usage does not match the meaning given in my dictionary. Yes, I've used the dictionary, because clearly you think that's the right place to look for a definition. Your dictionary must differ from mine in this particular case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, you said:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>... a strong case is not humble ...</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        This is clearly not the case. One can be humble, and yet make a strong case - the two are largely independent. I know many, many high-powered people in computing, mathematics, physics and other fields, some of whom are genuinely humble, and yet they can make compelling cases/arguments. As one example, I knew Dijkstra, and he was humble, even though his writing suggests otherwise to those who didn't know him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your argument that those who are not fools should not be humble is flawed. You are right that
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>... speaking up is </em>'not<em>' about humility or meekness or quietness ...</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        It is independent.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>No, it is not independent. You are fine tuning your own definition of humbleness and picking one tiny part of humbleness definition to suit your needs, which is very arrogant. Had you done your research and not been so arrogant and such an obnoxious bastard, you would find that humble people are generally very quiet, meek, and not very critical or outspoken. I write this in bold, because you need some serious education.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Finally, you cast aspersions on me because I don't sign my contributions. This is because you don't know even the relatively recent history of this wiki, and you have paraded your ignorance for all to see. That seems symptomatic of much of your writing. You don't care to be or appear insightful or knowledgeable, you seem only to care about appearing opinionated and prolific, even when those opinions are contrary to others who may yet turn out to be right.

          <strong>Could you please stop being so arrogant and criticizing someone else? Could you please be humble? Could you please refrain from calling someone ignorant who has already humbly and openly admitted to <em>ignorance</em> all over <em>his</em> wiki which apparently you did not read - since <em>you do not do proper research</em> before criticizing someone <em>else</em>.
