        <em>Why I'm on this Wiki:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I was lucky enough to start using computers at the early age of 7, and I've been (mostly) enjoying it since.
        The Internet, and this Wiki, have a huge amount of information, but sometimes I find new "ideas behind the code" that make up for everything else.  I haven't explored the Wiki enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between the projects on my to-do list and the "superproject" of prioritizing the projects, the Wiki is a low priority.
        But I still think it's important to contribute a little when I can.
