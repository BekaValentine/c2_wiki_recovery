        Man, I screwed this up once, so I'm hoping this time I do it better.

        First of all, this is <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a>. I'm interested in <a href="TeachingWithGames.html">TeachingWithGames</a>. I'm not a gamer, but I'm working on a school project where we use Age of Mythology in an English class. I believe this has been done on the university research level, but I'm trying to do it  on the secondary level. That said, all you middle-aged, career-changing individuals out there who find learning through the use of technology more exciting than the old top-down-I'm-filling-your-brains-with-knowledge model, talk to me. I can use all the help I can get.
