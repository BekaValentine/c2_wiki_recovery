        Acorn Archimedes
      </h1>
      <p>
        An Acorn computer from the late 80s.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Archimedes had an ARM2 RISC processor, the first ARM processor deployed in a commercial machine.

        Most of the operating system was on ROM - making it <em>very</em> quick to boot and requiring about half the hard disc capacity of a pc of the time. Later versions had a notepad like text editor, a simple paint package and a drawing package on ROM too.

           button mice as standard.

        Had an extended version of <a href="BbcBasic.html">BbcBasic</a> as the operating system command line.

        Had quite a nice operating system or am I just looking back with rose tinted glasses?

        Not at all. We use the most recent version as a commercial <a href="EmbeddedSystem.html">EmbeddedSystem</a>. The operating system is <a href="RiscOs.html">RiscOs</a>, and we extensively use C, ARM assembly language, and the built-in scripting language, which is a recent form of <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a>. -- ??

        Fantastic, I've not been near an acorn machine for about 10 years (I think my parents may still have a RiscPc somewhere though). It's all coming back now. The WIMP system would make a great case study for <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> still. -- jk

        Yeah they were nice boxes. OS upgrades were a bugger though. I remember going through an entire classroom with screwdriver and new ROM in hand ;-) -- <a href="AdrianHoward.html">AdrianHoward</a>

        One nice feature of the UI I'm still waiting to see elsewhere is a "save dialog" which included an icon that could be dragged to a destination to save the document to that destination. (The closest I've noticed since was in OS/2's programmers' editor EPM, which had an icon in its title bar you could drag to a drag and drop target at any time.)

        The Acorn Archimedes may also have been the first desktop machine to use anti-aliased scalable fonts.
