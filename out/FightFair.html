        Fight Fair
      </h1>
      <p>
        The one tactic that saved my marriage was to learn how to fight fair.  Perhaps you had better examples as a child, but I learned how to win arguments at all costs.  Marriage is another example of a situation in which it is possible to win the battle yet still lose the war.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Problem:</em>  Arguments happen.  Conflicts need to be resolved and feelings may run quite deep.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Context:</em>  Marriages are long-term.  Conflicts are short-term.  While it may be important to "get your way" it cannot be at the expense of the relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Solution:</em>  Agree on argument ground rules in advance.  Some suggestions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No one goes to bed before the argument is settled.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (Prevents multi-day disputes -- limits time extent of disagreement)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Limit scope of argument -- don't bring in issues settled in the past, or extraneous to the current discussion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (Arguments are a lousy time to settle the "you always..." disputes.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't interrupt.  Hard, but incredibly important to the mildly speech-impaired like me.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Forbidden subjects. Weight, baldness, money, parental ties, etc. can all be quite sensitive.  So sensitive as to poison the discussion.  Best to avoid -- do you think your partner doesn't know he/she is fat, bald, poor, Oedipal, etc.?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other rules may work for other people.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may all be an instance of a more general pattern for relationships: plan for failure while relations are good.
