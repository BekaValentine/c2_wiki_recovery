        Patterns Tool
      </h1>
      <p>
        A topic that people are starting to think about more and 
        more often these days is the idea of a <a href="PatternsTool.html">PatternsTool</a> that you 
        can use along with more conventional OO design tools and 
        languages to help you utilize patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ultimate <a href="PatternsTool.html">PatternsTool</a> (to me) would work in forward and
        reverse engineering mode.  In forward engineering mode it would
        help code your classes from a description of how classes would 
        interact.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance you might give the <a href="PatternsTool.html">PatternsTool</a> a set of class names
        and say "These classes are a composite -- this one's a composite class, these
        over here are primitive classes, now generate me the class definitions
        and method stubs to represent that."  
      </p>
      <p>
        In reverse-engineering mode it would look through your code and design
        diagrams and tell you "You implemented a Chain of Responsibility here, etc."
      </p>
      <p>
        Any thoughts?

        In the future I want to describe to my computer (by voice of course ;-) what to build.  It will need to understand a language (alas, full english is just to ambiguous).  I use to think that language would be a subset of english, but nowadays I wonder if a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> would do the trick.
        However, I think that I am looking <strong>far</strong> into the future here.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, I think that it may be premature to suggest that <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> have been taken far enough to start programming machines to <em>help</em> us generate code using them.  Then again, it may be my prejudices against <a href="CaseTool.html">CaseTool</a>s talking here....
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the reverse engineering bit though.  Hmmm... I wonder how I could feed new <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> to the tool...

        Since I originally wrote the above I've found out that there are several university groups working on different kinds of <a href="PatternsTool.html">PatternsTool</a>.  If you're interested, we've established a patterns-tool mailing list out of UIUC.  Send email to <a href="mailto:patterns-tool-request@cs.uiuc.edu">mailto:patterns-tool-request@cs.uiuc.edu</a> to subscribe.
