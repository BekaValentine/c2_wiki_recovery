        Good Object

      <p>
        One of my favorite belongings is a Balinese dragon cane.  It's carved out of some kind of super-hard tropical wood (probably endangered or something), which makes it very durable.  Yet it's also carved so that the handle is thicker than the base, so that it's quite light.  Moreover, the dragon design is not only decorative.  In order to simulate a serpent-form, the cane squiggles; when I bought the thing I thought it was just an aesthetic flourish, but it actually has use-value.  When I sit, the squiggle-angles mean that the cane sits at a much nicer angle against my leg than if it were straight up-and-down.

        When I do object-orinted code, I try to make it as good as my dragon cane.
