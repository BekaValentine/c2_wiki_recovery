        "Some solution domains have a very strong hierarchical structure as an intrinsic part of them." 
      </p>

      <p>
        Isn't this moving goal-posts? The original request was for "real-world" hierarchies. Several of these having been provided, it seems that the criteria are changing to something like "naturally occurring (whatever that's supposed to mean) single, definitive, pure tree structures that apply exactly to all cases under discussion and are the only view of that case required by all persons interested in it."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There seems to be some confusion about whether we are studying hierarchies here or modeling them. There are two semi-orthogonal issues here: whether real-world things are "tree enough", and then what the best computer model for them is. When designing a system, the question needs to be asked: is the domain inharently tree-shaped (or how tree-ish is it), and if not, are trees being used as a </em><a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> anyhow because of their simplicity? And further, how does one deal with the non-tree parts of domain "near" trees if modeled as trees? For example, if the domain is 95% tree, then how does one work the 5% into the model without making too big of a mess? (Or perhaps decide to skip trees as the modeling technique.)<em></em>

      <p>
        You mean like country->state->city->street->building->room ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps. But, it does tend to have a lot of variation below the building level. Plus government institutions sometimes have odd setups below the city level. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Oh, there's a great deal of variation in the detail of the tree in all sorts of cases. Nonetheless, I've never seen a non-hierarchical postal address anywhere I've been in Europe or North America. Nowhere is it claimed that the same one canonical hierarchy applies to all postal addresses.</em>

        Another issue to consider is that any given point on the map may have multiple ways to locate it. For example, political districts often correspond poorly with Zip-codes (US) or counties due to slick gerrymandering. Thus, the political map may not resemble the postal map. Each domain thus has its own independent or semi-independent hierarchy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>IP domain names (See RFC 1591)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        "In the Domain Name System (DNS) naming of computers there is a hierarchy of names." ... "As an example of a country domain, the US domain provides for the registration of all kinds of entities in the United States on the basis of political geography, that is, a hierarchy of <entity-name>.<locality>.<state-code>.US." 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>RFC 1591 references RFC 1480, which provides a detailed exposition of the domain name tree in the US, parts of which have five levels, eg. <school>.<school-district>.K12.<state>.US</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to postal address issues. <em>If you mean that they are both perfectly valid examples of hierarchical structures in the world, then yes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, it is not really a tree by itself. Those can all be considered independent attributes. For example, you might be a mail-order salesperson for kindergarten products. To find all kindergarten teachers to mail spam to, you might only want to look at the "grade" attribute. You are not thinking "tree" when doing that. One can think of the URL as a kind of tuple. However, the hierarchical view is based on the political division of the schools, and thus moves the issue to human organizational ("org chart") sub-topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So a tree is only a tree if every mail order salesperson thinks "tree" when they search it? Come on, be reasonable. It's a tree by definition. How it is searched doesn't change that.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        By definition? Trees are mostly in one's head.

        They are often used similar to how file hierarchies (folders) are used, and I find hierarchical file systems highly flawed as a categorization system for non-trivial stuff. Generally they are used because people readily understand them, not because they are the ideal classification system. It is the leftish side of the easy-to-learn-versus-power spectrum. See <a href="FileSystemAlternatives.html">FileSystemAlternatives</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to point out that Yahoo, if I remember correctly, tried to make a web search engine by building a hierarchy of categories. The tree grew too long and messy, and Google ended up kicking its butt in the marketplace using its free-association approach.

        <em>The example here, DNS names, has been evaded by examples of a subset of DNS names where you have attribute information on each field. Like it or not, many IT systems implement addressing using trees (IP addresses, domain names) - often for valid efficiency-of-implementation reasons. Like it or not, your software must be able to interface with these trees, and must be aware of the concept of the tree. The validity of the tree as a model for whatever they choose to model is irrelevant - you may as well argue that the sky should not be blue.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You will not have an attribute name for each field. When you have foo.bar.example.com, you don't know what entry "Foo" and "bar" represent.... you just know that "bar" is owned by "example.com" and "foo" is owned by "bar". That's it. And even if you do remap this tree (and it is a tree) into attribute names, you run into problems with context, just like the popular "Fire" problem with </em><a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a>. So you assign every attribute a "scope" attribute, and in turn the "scope" attribute it's own "scope" attribute, so you can clarify the difference between a military tank and a septic tank... but then your scopes become a BigMessyGraph, which makes for an implementation nightmare since a scope can have no "root scope" - if it did, it'd be a tree (or at least a <a href="DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a>).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In the end, almost everything is a </em>BigMessyGraph if you look at it hard enough... but sensibly traversing the BigMessyGraph is nearly impossible, so we whittle them down into structures that are conceptually manageable. Sometimes that's a <a href="DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a>, and sometimes that's a tree. And implementing those most modern databases sucks, compared to how easy it is in general-purpose programming languages.<em></em>

        <strong>genealogies</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Marriages and chromosome exchange are un-tree. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So what? Do you know what a genealogy is? It's the thing that traces the decent of an individual. It's a family tree. I'll type that again, family </em>tree<em>. The clue is in the word </em>'tree<em>'.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I am claiming that "tree" is a bit misleading because it is not a pure hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Wrong again. You are the child of two genetic parents, who are each the child of two genetic parents, who are each the child of... etc., etc. Until such time as human cloning becomes a practicality, your heredity is strongly hierarchical. Sure, in some isolated communities the same individual can appear multiple times in the tree but this is 1) rare, 2) besides the point.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Pure trees don't have 2 parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How hard can this be? Here is a partial genealogy, in abstract:</em>

      </code>
      <p>
        See the tree?
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay. I see what you mean. But beyond a few generations there will likely be common ancestors. IIRC, that is called a "directed graph". (It is impossible for a (biological) family tree to contain a cycle; that would imply that an individual is simultaneously the ancestor and descendent of another.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You're joking, right? I don't know about </em>your<em> family, but I only have to go back a few generations to find ancestors who lived so far apart they didn't even speak languages from the same language group. (Oh, and by the way, language families form a hierarchy, too). Sure, in some ultimate sense we all have common ancestors, but,..., well you're clearly just trolling now, so I give up.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The branch width of such trees are far wider than the total number of languages. Thus, obviously there are link-backs. Populations cycle back into one another. That is a fact of biology. There is almost certainly somebody on your mom's side that is related to somebody on your dad's side. How far back one has to go to find it on average, I don't know. Even across species there is sometimes DNA exchange through infectious agents. See <a href="LimitsOfHierarchiesInBiology.html">LimitsOfHierarchiesInBiology</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        BTW, perhaps "treeness" is a continuous measurement rather than a Boolean declaration. Although family "trees" have a high tree-ness factor, it is not 100%. Perhaps the metric can be based on the number of cycles or cross-overs divided by the number of nodes, or such like.
      </p>
      <p>
        I fully agree that there is some degree of "treeness" in almost all of these, but it is far from being perfect trees or the usage patterns (queries) are not always trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Examples with perfect "treeness" were not requested. Neither was the request for structures for which the queries had tree structure (whatever that means). It's time to raise the </em><a href="TrollFlag.html">TrollFlag</a> on you.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {You seem to view this as a contest. I view this topic as a catalog of example things in the real world that have some noticeable tree-ness to them, and a *study* of how "tree-ish" they are. The "tree query" comment is about how often the users of info from the alleged tree structures care about the tree-ness. For example, "show me all yellow nodes" does not depend on tree-ness. "Show me all yellow nodes that have green parents" does.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I think most will agree that the trees mentioned are imperfect in some ways. The disagreement is probably whether to use a tree as an internal (computer) model despite such flaws.</strong> In other words, the big question is: is a formal tree structure a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> (or useful-enough lie). Do we use sets and graphs to handle the "deviations", or do we somehow manage to live with them in a tree structure with some cross-branch links and/or duplication? In other words, tree-proponents will suggest that the benefits of tree structures outweigh the problems of a few non-tree cross-links. I lean toward the first (sets, graphs). Perhaps if I saw specific examples of how to deal comfortably with the deviations when using a tree structure, I might warm up to it. The larger something is (more nodes), the less tree-ish it tends to be in my observation. Thus, trees have a bigger penalty under scale-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I see only one contributor who agrees that the trees mentioned are imperfect in some way.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you saying that there are no cross-links in family trees?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then they are imperfect. Case closed, it appears.
      </p>

        [Absolutely everything in the real world is imperfect, not just trees. So what?]
      </p>
      <p>
        On the larger scale, genealogies appear to be a <strong>DAG</strong> - directed acyclic graph, if I am not mistaking; not a tree (barring some extreme incest).

        <strong>Library (Book) Classification Schemes</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="DeweyDecimalSystem.html">DeweyDecimalSystem</a> seems to be falling out of favor as more modern techniques are introduced. It does not handle orthogonal categories very well (see examples below). 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           False. It is constantly being updated and modernized, just like the other two primary systems. None of the three systems in use hand orthogonality issues that much better or worse than the other two. All three systems have strengths and weaknesses, but because they are constantly updated, as are their (quite complex) usage guidelines, none of the three is so clearly superior to the others anymore. There used to be elitism associated with use of the <a href="LibraryOfCongressSystem.html">LibraryOfCongressSystem</a>, which was justified decades ago, but isn't strongly justified anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
           In any case, this is perhaps the most thoroughly explored of all possible examples. There are conflicting goals. Books must be stored in locally linear order. It is desirable for books immediately adjacent to each other to be reasonably related in topic. It is similarly desirable for books on shelves above or below each other. It is desirable for there to be small changes in categories as one moves linearly along shelves, minimizing huge category jumps when possible. And then it turns out all books fit into more than one hierarchy simultaneously (e.g. subject vs author vs title), and most books fit into more than one place in a single hierarchy ("history of physics"). Since there are conflicting goals, <strong>any</strong> solution will be imperfect. It is not an indictment on the whole notion of hierarchies.
        </li>
        <li>
           For lingering doubts on the subject, go actually study the Dewey and LOC systems (I've got a mental block on the name of the third system) and especially the guidelines for <strong>filing</strong>, not just searching. It's all pretty interesting.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>All of which is true, but none of which addresses the issue at hand.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I am suggesting that it was a rather artificial hierarchy because it had to cater to physical constraints of the time. IOW, it is not an "intrinsic" tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's a completely artificial hierarchy (by the way, what have "physical constraints" got to do with it?), it is also a hierarchy widely met with in the real world.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (<em>Mightn't "physical" constraints refer to the fact that single copy of a book can't be placed in multiple locations at the same time?</em>)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That would be a violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> even in a database. A library could have multiple indexes on different factors, but that is not cost effective on more than a few factors. Compound searchers, such as <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> or multiple key words are also difficult to do with paper cards.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Until now, because something better is replacing it for most searching. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I will bet money that it will be a long, long time before no small town or secondary school library in the world is using Dewey. But that almost doesn't matter, since the Library of Congress (if not the largest library in the world, then certainly in the top handful) continues to use a hierarchical classification scheme, and this scheme is also used by national, university and research libraries the world over.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           We need to be careful about the usage of "replacing" here. Computerized multi-indexed search engines are now heavily used, but so is physical browsing. They are <em>both</em> used. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Well, that is because we as humans still do book browsing at the physical level. Tree taxonomies are indeed a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> at this level. You do agree that tree taxonomies are not perfect, correct? For example, a Bioinformatics book could go under both the computer section and the biology section but we cannot put it under BOTH without duplication or cross-links, which violates pure tree rules. Oreilly's Bioinformatics even contains an introduction to UNIX file commands. Similarly, a book titled "The Psychology of Computer Programming" could go under both the computer section and the psychology section. "The Business of Bioinformatics" could be put under "Business", "Computers", and "Biology". But Dewey can only put it under one major section; and using branches for minor sections can risk a <a href="CartesianJoin.html">CartesianJoin</a> (combinatorial explosion).
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose another way of saying this is that <strong>trees are relatively easily linearized</strong>. Thus, library taxonomy trees can be "flattened" into a numerical system that can be used to shelf books. It is tougher to do this with sets. Of course, this does not mean that sets are bad, only that they lack some features that trees have, such as easy serialization. It can still be done with sets fairly well if we also store weighting factors. It might even return the same answer that a tree does. For example, the Biz Bioinfo book above may have the highest weight on the "Biology" factor. If we want to browse "Biology" books, it would likely appear fairly high in that category. With Dewey, the highest factor, "Biology" in our example, becomes the primary factor. Weighted sets do that same thing by picking the highest factor's weight when we ask our query system to put everything in one and only one "main" category.
      </p>
      <p>
        The big issue is that the real world is limited, but <a href="SoftwareGivesUsGodLikePowers.html">SoftwareGivesUsGodLikePowers</a>. We can index and browse in a gajillion dimensions inside the computer. We don't have to constrain our classification system to fit physical bookshelves better. It will be interesting to see if <a href="DeweyDecimalSystem.html">DeweyDecimalSystem</a> and similar coding systmes eventually dies off now that physical libraries are also dying off. A list of key-words may serve our purposes better. However, the concept of "next to" gets more difficult to compute, but may also lead to better results. -- top

        (Re the first sentence in this section: That argument can just as easily be turned back on your point: "I tried to find out everybody Bob is responsible for, but I didn't have that set already, so I had to generate it from the tree." A tree may not be the be-all, end-all data structure, but sets have problems, too: You can't keep all possible sets like that around, and the moment you start talking about generating them, you're going back to the tree structure. Likely as not, your sets are implemented as a type of tree internally anyhow; trees have an obvious data representation in our modern machines but sets generally must be implemented on top of something else, as there is no obvious direct implementation of them. You seem to be arguing as if there are Sets and there are Trees and ne'er the twain shall meet, but there is a very smooth continuum between them in the sense of 'possible data structures'. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's virtually impossible to draw a line delimiting the two. Even if you think that you'll recurse on the sets and take the union of the sets of people Bob is the direct boss of, then the people they are the direct boss of, and so on until you're done, you're doing a tree operation with children implemented as sets.

One litmus test is to ask if the model can be implemented in a non-tree way (mostly ignoring performance, for this is not a performance topic). Most database indexes are implemented using trees, but it does not have to be that way. For example, bucket sorts and/or hash sorts can also be used. Someday in the future perhaps something will replace B-trees as the preferred internal indexing technique.

        IMHO, one of the signs of programming maturity is recognizing that the Standard Data Types (tree, set, list, etc.) are actually almost entirely orthogonal to one another, sometimes even to themselves, and can be mixed and matched almost arbitrarily. I've had trees that were also indexed with a list of all nodes, heaps that were also hash tables, even multi-trees where two different hierarchy dimensions were represented, and I mention this explicitly because I think this is perfectly normal, not as bragging that I'm doing anything outstanding. Part of the reason you can do anything with Sets is that Sets, and more precisely Sets of Sets, used in aggregate can implement almost any organization-based data structure. Thus, showing that Sets can do everything is not interesting. The question is, are they the best for everything? And the answer to that is clearly "no". If you want to ask for everybody who reports to Bob, directly or indirectly, you <em>will</em> use the tree; said tree may be implemented as a set but it's still a tree.)

        I am not sure what your point is. As a <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>, I see it trivial to represent such information in a database. The most general form is probably some kind of many-to-many table, but not the only.
      </p>
      <p>
        (I'm saying that you've got a tree in your database, and like I said probably a database in your tree, so this "either tables or trees must be better then the other" (with a strongly implied "in all cases" on your part!) line is kinda bunk. Tables are flexible "out of the box" but just as tables are more then just rows of data once you add relational algebra to it, there's more to "trees" than what a graph theorist would call a "tree", and there are many things more naturally thought of as tree manipulation, such as manipulating an HTML document in arbitrary ways with <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, then as tables.

           [Question from the peanut gallery: what is this "more to trees" to which you refer?] The fact that just because a given piece of data is contained in a tree doesn't exclude it from being contained in other trees, hash tables, lists, stacks, queues, etc.

        I guess you could say that at the level of abstractness this entire page seems to be arguing at, that tables and trees are isomorphic in terms of capabilities. So constant assertions that "I can represent that relationally!" do not impress me. I can represent your database as multiple interleaving trees, and it quite likely <em>is</em> in reality. Unless you're willing to argue a <em>much</em> more specific case, no meaningful discussion can be had. Handling imperfect-but-real hierarchies has almost identical implications, whether you're dealing with a multi-tree or a table implementation.)

        <em>I agree with the </em><a href="TuringEquivalency.html">TuringEquivalency</a> comment. However, combinations of trees, lists, and maps (<a href="NavigationalDatabase.html">NavigationalDatabase</a>) can get pretty messy as changes accumulate. In relational there are fewer ways to do the same thing, and this results in consistency. Trees of maps and maps of trees results in a shanty-town like mess in my opinion. Everyone will do it differently and there are no guiding principles to navigate the mess other than "car driver beware". They are the Goto's of data structures. See <a href="OoLacksConsistencyDiscussion.html">OoLacksConsistencyDiscussion</a>. Perhaps "navies" work for certain personalities, but night mine. I find them chaotic. -- top<em></em>

        I encountered a case for different institutional views of trees. Group A wanted to break out a given department (segment of company) by many detailed branches, while group B did not. The depth of some branches of A's and B's trees were thus different. It is not that the levels in general were limited, but the levels of that one deparment were different between trees. Group A's dealings happened to be more detailed with the department in question, and thus they wanted more detail in their hierarchy. For example, if you and I wanted to see an org chart, we would probably want more details on the IT branches than say Marketing because we are curious about the IT aspects of a company. To pull this off, either we need to store different trees for each group, or at least a partial tree(s) in order to list how deep to show the levels. (In an interactive system, we could probably use drill-down, but interactivity was not an option here.)

        March 2011 - I've just been burned again by using hierarchies instead of sets in an organizational summary structure tracking and reporting system having about 3000 leaves. It had been hierarchical for at least <strong>75 years</strong> in this organization. I dug through dusty old age-tinted binders to check. (I think I found a drawing by Da Vinci :-) I thus thought it was a safe bet to continue with hierarchies for a recent overhaul to prepare for a web-based system. Well, just after completion, Murphy showed up and mucked it all to hell with funny overlaps, creating a big fudgey mess to make "ghost trees" to fake it because we don't have time and staff to convert it to sets now. (I still say hierarchies were the professionally "proper" decision based on analysis of past history at the decision time, but the <a href="DiscontinuitySpike.html">DiscontinuitySpike</a> for getting it "wrong" is huge regardless.) It's kind of like buying stock in the twin towers on Sept. 10th, 2001. The Great Recession appears to have been at least part of the cause for such a big change. The organization took on "rogue" sub-organizations in order to keep revenue coming in. During good times they probably wouldn't have wanted the complexity and ghost-ish nature of these rogues.  --top

        Each cell nucleus in a multicellular organism is a product of mitosis. This forms a binary tree with the zygote's nucleus at the root. Every node (except gametes) contains the same DNA, but different sections are "executed" based on a node's position in the tree.

        Why would that change the fact that the cells form a binary tree? Yes, viruses can move genes between cells, but we're not talking about genes. We're talking about cells. Cells split into two siblings, regardless of viruses.

        Text data (collections of memos, web pages, letters, articles, etc) can be classified into multiple tree structures. Deriving the intersections is essentially a trees-to-sets transformation.

      <p>
        Yes, the indexes for the words that appear within the documents will be often rendered as trees, allowing the atomic operations needed to satisfy a set-based query: "find all {letters/articles/etc} documents containing references to (camping | hiking | packing) & (horses | mules | donkeys | burros)" is accomplished, atomically, by traversing trees and constructing a set view.

      <p>
        While much of GUI's can be represented by nesting components, there are issues to this also. For example, take a data grid (spreadsheet-like panel). One can represent a given cell with the hierarchy: table -> row -> cell. However, there are often times where it's more fitting to have: table -> column -> cell. No one nesting is always better than the other. The problem is that trees by themselves are an insufficient abstraction for 2D grids. Both views can be offered, but they are still only views on top of something non-hierarchical. -t

        Much of this page is attacking heirarchies with the implicit belief that the data-centric approach is inherently better - the <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s are creating a <a href="FalseDichotomy.html">FalseDichotomy</a>. The idea is that "trees suck, so use relational". The relational approach is, however, similarly flawed. Most relational systems barf all over themselves at tree traversal - and while many systems that look like trees turn out to be directed graphs, directed graphs are generally just fine for tree-like operations. One can still query a list of all the children of X from a directed graph - if you use pure-tree operations, you may get repeated results. Either way, a database query for this will be hideous, unless using Oracles not-very-relational CONNECT BY operation.
