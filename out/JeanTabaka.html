        I am a Certified Professional Facilitator as certified by the sole assessment body in facilitation, the International Association of Facilitators (<a href="http://www.iaf-world.org).">http://www.iaf-world.org).</a>  Along with a Masters in Computer Science from The Johns Hopkins University, I have an extensive technical background both as a developer and as a methodologist. My specialization in agile approaches such as DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Methodolgy)and Scrum dates back to the mid-to-late '90s.  Now, I am dedicated to setting XP, Scrum, DSDM and other agile projects in motion with a combination of collaboration and project visioning techniques.

        I am a member of the PMI and its local Denver chapter. I am also on the XPDenver User Group Board. I have authored a book through Prentice Hall on physical database design and am currently writing a book on collaboration approaches in software development projects. I have also been a lead methodologist with Qwest Communications, Sybase Inc. and Siebel Systems Inc. and used agile software development fundamentals for running an internet accelerator in Boulder, CO.
