           Added $$VERSION$$ option.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Stuff done in older versions and present in the new version</strong> (these are features that were in a version that had no version numbering; presumably EW 1.1 M0).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Added $edit:<pagename> command (to edit a file from anywhere on wiki (and not only from the page itself). 
        </li>
        <li>
           Added $html:<html code> command (to use html commands on <strong>any page</strong>. Ex: to change the color of the text, enter: [$html: <font color=blue>])
        </li>
        <li>
           \n is now written as &lt;BR&gt;<strong> so you can manually break pages. </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           'Added Wiki Formatting link on the Edit Page<em> to have a quick access to the formatting syntax information right from the edit page.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Added $$PAGE: Page Name$$ option (to show the contents of page B on page A)
        </li>
        <li>
           Note: The reverse link functions show the links to the current page on the page itself. Previously, you saw the links by clicking on the title.
        </li>
        <li>
           Added $reverselink command. We put this tag on the page we are on to see the links to that page. Ex: [$reverselink] put on the <a href="WikiFormatting.html">WikiFormatting</a> page will show links to the <a href="WikiFormatting.html">WikiFormatting</a> page. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Added $reverselink:<pagename> command. We put this tag on any page to have a list on links to any page. Ex: On start page we can indicate the links to the <a href="WikiFormatting.html">WikiFormatting</a> page by using the following syntax: [$reverselink:<a href="WikiFormatting.html">WikiFormatting</a>]. This command is very useful if we want to put a page establishing all the links to all pages. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Added $$REVERSELINK$$ option. We put this tag on the PageTemplate.html file and the links to each page will appear. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Added $$REVERSELINK:<a href="PageName.html">PageName</a>$$ option. The same as $reverselink:<pagename>, but now for the pagetemplate
        </li>
        <li>
           Added: Return WYSIWYG. When you enter a text on the next line (after a return) the text shows on the next line like in a word processor. 
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Comments</strong>

        <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> V1.1 is indeed easy to install and run, but the creator isn't all that keen on responding to mails with suggestions, requests, bugreports and general comments of his wikiserver. It's doesn't seem to be worked on very much, so I'm left wondering when (if ever) a new non-beta version will arrive.

        <em>It seems that it's not being developed any more. -- </em>MvdW<em></em>

        It can be annoying sometimes, when having a large page, to have to scroll down always before re-editing it. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           With some browsers, such as IE, you can get to the bottom of the page quickly by pressing the spacebar or End.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>You can change the pagetemplate, so it has an editlink at the top of the page. I have it in my default template. If you are interested, send me a mail and I'll send you my version of the </em><a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a>. -- MvdW<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There were some bug-reports too, but I'm afraid I don't remember them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This wikiserver could also be a good basis to hack it into something that is wanted on <a href="http://www.freesofty.org">http://www.freesofty.org</a> (paid jobs, votewiki).

        Note that I am quite happy with my current modifications. Also I don't have an infinite amount of time in a day, so suggestions are appreciated, but don't count on them to be implemented soon. -- MvdW

        <em>The WYSIWYG return is confusing and violates </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. There's already <space>-<space> syntax for a line break.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>One can't easily see in the editing box where the returns are.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion, it is not confusing, so it stays. -- MvdW

        <strong>Code Areas</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I have implemented code areas ( <strong>ALL</strong> formatting disabled ) for your wiki version, because the current [space]text is kind of annoying when pasting source code. Let me know if you want the diff file for merging. -- <a href="AndreiDragomir.html">AndreiDragomir</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Note: I have received these changes and they will be integrated into my version, but I have been quite busy and I will merge it after my holiday. -- MvdW
        </li>
        <li>
           Back from holidays and found some time to integrate them. Now available in version 1.1.m2. -- MvdW
        </li>
