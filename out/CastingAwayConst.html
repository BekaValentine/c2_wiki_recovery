        Casting Away Const
      </h1>
      <p>
        Quite simply, use of a typecast (or some other method) to tell a compiler to disregard the <a href="ConstQualifier.html">ConstQualifier</a>, and allow an object declared const to be mutated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> even has a special purpose operator for this; const_cast<T>.  (You can also use the general purpose <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> cast operator for this; however this is considered deprecated in C++).  Other new-style C++ casts (such as dynamic_cast<T> (<a href="DynamicCast.html">DynamicCast</a>) and static_cast<T>) don't let you discard const.  (They don't let you discard the <a href="VolatileQualifier.html">VolatileQualifier</a> either; for that you use const_cast as well...)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CastingAwayConst.html">CastingAwayConst</a> has two legitimate uses:  Dealing with a legacy interface which is <a href="ConstIncorrect.html">ConstIncorrect</a>, or implementing <a href="LogicalConst.html">LogicalConst</a>ness if other means of doing so (such as mutable) are not provided.
