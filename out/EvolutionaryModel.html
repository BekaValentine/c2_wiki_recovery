        Evolutionary Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        For every given chemical reaction event, there is a one in a trillion chance that a cosmic ray, or a deity, or the sound of the Boston Pops Orchestra travelling backwards in time will affect the molecules during the reaction and make it different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Per the laws of thermodynamics, the odds are very high that the interference will make the chemicals simpler. But a further small fraction will accidentally get more complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evolution does >not< mean "march forward in complexity". The overwhelming trend among self-reproducing molecules is towards simplicity. But a primodial soup of self-reproducing molecules will have a further, funny characteristic. If a given proto-cell's chemistry gets simpler, the odds are very high that the simpler cell will be eaten. And if a rare cosmic event makes a cell more complex in just the right way, the odds are now very high that it will eat all the other proto-cells and divide all over the place.

        Evolution defeats entropy by exploiting it.

        Now the inevitable ideological stance. The above is a good idea, and useful to help us understand cellular mechanics and <a href="BioInformatics.html">BioInformatics</a>, but it is still just a model; <strong>it's not the real thing</strong>. --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>
