      <p>
        A common design flaw in many older programming languages (for example, <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>)--entities must be given <em>names</em>, even if they are only intended for use at the point of definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the following C code...
      </p>
      <code>
        struct point {int x, y};<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void draw (const point *from, const point *to);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ....<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        /* Draw a line from (0,0) to (1023,767) */<br/>
        {<br/>
        struct point p1 = {0,0};<br/>
        struct point p2 = {1023,767};<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        draw (&p1, &p2);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In the above example, the variable p1 and p2 were created for no other reason than C doesn't allow the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        draw (&struct point {0,0}, &struct point{1023,767} );  /* or similar syntax */<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In this case, the extra typing isn't so onerous.  But if you declare a complex data structure with lots of indirection (pointers), it's impossible to initialize a pointer within a data structure to the address of a here-defined structure.  (The one exception is you can initialize a char * member of a struct with a string constant.)
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ makes things a little better if you use constructors... in C++ you could write
      </p>
      <code>
        draw (&point(0,0), &point(1023,767));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        assuming that the point class has a suitable constructor.  But this doesn't work for struct initialized with C-style syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another famous example is the lack of lambdas in C/C++ (though C++ can fake it with <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s).  
      </p>
      <p>
        More modern programming languages really ought to separate the definition/allocation of an object with its binding to a name.  (And many of them do, fortunately).
