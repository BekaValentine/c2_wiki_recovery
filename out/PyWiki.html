        Py Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        Anybody who had been paying attention will have known that <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> development
        stalled long ago. The code is crufty and bloated, and probably will not even
        run with current versions of Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        To my knowledge, <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> was the first '<a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a>' written in Python, and the
        first to be released under a GPL license. Evidence shows that I first
        released it in August, 1998. It was fun to do, and I did it just for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess open-sourced software never gets officially retired, but I am ready to
        announce that I am never going to work on <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will no longer be exposing any wiki services to the wilds of the internet,
        although I am an enthusiastic user of personal wikis to help manage various
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the time being, <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> code will still be available for download as
        described below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to anyone who has ever shown interest in <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a>, and especially those
        who offered constructive criticism and/or code.

        <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> is a <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a> written in the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> by <a href="TimVoght.html">TimVoght</a> as a 'first project in Python' exercise. An attempt has been made to mimic closely the functionality of <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>'s Wiki. The use of RCS for file archiving is the most obvious departure.

        Once again, <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> has undergone substantial refactoring. The project continues to be an educational one for me, and I continue to learn. The learning is slow to be sure, and all the slower in that I am working alone with little or no feedback, except for the occasional bug report or feature request.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been discussed that in <a href="ExtremeProgrammingForOne.html">ExtremeProgrammingForOne</a>, <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is impossible (preferable?). That is true, and when you're trying to learn some things, it's easy to ruminate about how helpful it would be to have an experienced pair of eyes over your shoulder and a helpful hand pointing out gaffes on the screen. The best the solitary programmer can do is set the project aside for awhile and work on other things. In a few months, the code will look more alien and more subject to criticism and improvement. Python is a big help here, because it is so readable. I played with Forth once, and found that I couldn't read my own programs a week after writing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing I learned is discussed in <a href="QuickHackTherapy.html">QuickHackTherapy</a>, where it is pointed out that OO beginners tend to 'over-abstract' some programs, making objects out of everything, often inappropriately. I am comforted by <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>'s conclusion that, for a learner, this is a good thing and will usually lead to a better understanding of the paradigm. I think this is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing I learned is discussed in <a href="GrainOfTheLanguage.html">GrainOfTheLanguage</a>. Python offers some very powerful abstractions in its list and dictionary structures (I think Perl folk call dictionaries 'associative lists' <em>nope--'associative arrays' or just 'hashes</em>'). I found that I had designed modules which laid an inferior facade of my own making over these elegant data structures. I had a sudden revelation that I was fighting the language. I'm trying to get over this. Go easy on me. I've been toiling over C and assembly language programs for a long time.

        <em>Release Notes </em><a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> 0.4.2<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Merciless refactoring.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Text editing rules now better enforced. The previous version actually accepted some HTML markup. No more.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sequences of the form anIllegalWikiName and bogushttp://www.voght.com are no longer recognized as links. Thanks to JuhaPohjalainen for the bug report.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          .jpg and .png files are now accepted as well as .gif.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          URLs ending in .gif,.jpg, and .png will now be converted into images on the page. Previously, pywiki would only do this with external ([] style) links.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some web servers do not create the QUERY_STRINGS environment variable when no query strings are present. <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> expected the presence of the variable in any case. A fix has been applied. Thanks to <a href="CeesDeGroot.html">CeesDeGroot</a> and DanRoot for their reports and fixes. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Editing for external link URLs is now on the same edit page as the text editor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Edit conflict detection has been implemented. If an author submits an edit and another edit for that page has been submitted (from another host) since the author fetched the edit form, the author is greeted with a page explaining what has happened. The author is asked to reload the form and submit again...            
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users of the 0.3.x versions of <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> should find that they can upgrade to 0.4.2 without any changes to their page archives.
        </li>

        After my first release of <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a>, I got a chance to see <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>'s
        wiki code on wikibase. When I looked at it, I think I saw 368 lines of Perl
        code. I was shocked and humbled. I do get some comfort from the fact that
        Ward's and my goals were much different, and I'm not sure in my case the
        ulimate goal was to create a working wiki. Incidentally my shock and humility
        did not prevent me from getting the book <a href="MasteringRegularExpressions.html">MasteringRegularExpressions</a> and figuring out exactly what Ward was up to.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think if I were going to start from scratch today and if all I wanted to
        accomplish was to create a working wiki, I would use <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> [<a href="http://www.zope.com]">http://www.zope.com]</a> the Python-based
        Web development package. I've just started looking at it, and at first glance
        it looks just plain cool.

        A recent extraction of the <a href="HyperPerl.html">HyperPerl</a> source for wiki yielded about 520 lines.  I would be surprised/disappointed if a Python implementation was significantly larger.  I'm playing with a reimplementation myself called <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a>, and will be interested to compare it to <a href="JohnFarrell.html">JohnFarrell</a>'s implementation as a <a href="JavaServlet.html">JavaServlet</a>. -- <a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a>

        Tim, <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> was a breeze to install and get working.  I had trouble getting another wiki to work, but I downloaded yours, followed the directions, and had it running in under 10 minutes.  Very nice.  -- <a href="RichardBash.html">RichardBash</a>
