        <em>What a soap opera.  But it's easy to see where they destroyed themselves: they took money from the wolves.  The moral might be phrased thusly:  Don't go to bed with anyone you don't want to wake up next to.</em>

        <a href="ArsDigita.html">ArsDigita</a> in the past when I first dealt with them left me with an impression that they were a bit of an elitist due to the software product.  Being an elitist definitely hurt them in the market place.  Oh, I forget, they no longer are in the market place.
