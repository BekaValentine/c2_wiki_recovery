        Public Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        A wiki that is used by more than one individual, as contrasted to a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>. The content is 'public' to its users. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are numerous <a href="PublicWikiForums.html">PublicWikiForums</a> as well as <a href="NonPublicWikiForums.html">NonPublicWikiForums</a> which have a closed user community but still fall under this category (as obviously does <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> you are on right now).
