        <dd>If we can commit our changes to the shared development source code repository whenever all the tests pass, and checking in more often is good, then why don't we check in <strong>every time</strong> all the tests pass?</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Similar in concept to <a href="ZeroButtonTesting.html">ZeroButtonTesting</a>, what if our tools automatically ran all the tests whenever they could, and when all the tests passed, shared all of our changes with all other developers on our project?
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Whenever the software under development is in a state where the tests could be run...  (IE: For compiled languages, it would have to compile successfully.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Run all the tests.
        </li>
        <li>
           If all the tests pass...
        </li>
        <li>
           Automatically update the local source code from the shared repository, receiving any changes committed by other team members.
        </li>
        <li>
           If there were changes, and no merge conflicts that couldn't automatically be resolved, then...
          <ul>
            <li>
               Run all the tests again.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           If all the tests still pass...
          <ul>
            <li>
               Check in / commit all local changes to the team's shared development repository.
            </li>
            <li>
               Comment the change (if needed) as changes needed to support the story or bug fix currently being worked on.  (There would have to be a way to configure this in the tool, for the process to be fully automated.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
