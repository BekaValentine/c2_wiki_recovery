        Do you feel it's an inborn trait, or something you practiced? Some people just seem to have the ability to stare at a screen and immediately spot stuff in text. I'm primarily a visual thinker, and characters are not visual enough for my physiology to process fast.

        <em>I don't know whether it's an inborn trait or not, but it's certainly something I've practised.  I am one of those who can stare at a screen and immediately spot stuff in text.  It's a source of some bafflement for my students how I can glance at a full page of essay text and instantly spot a spelling mistake, glance at a screen of code and find errors that the developer has been struggling with for hours, or grade a thirty-page dissertation in a few minutes and discuss its contents in considerable depth. I read a </em>'lot<em>' -- that's probably what does it.</em>

        I used to read a lot, but it didn't seem to improve non-linear inspection of text for me. If anything, my eyes got a little tired over the years and my eye muscles wear out sooner in the day, taking my eyeballs longer to focus/point. Maybe in my re-incarnation I'll ask for an upgrade to my vision bus or pre-processor. Maybe in 20 years they can plug directly into my brain. I'm sure my fingers and eyes will be completely shot by then. They show signs of wear now.

           Maybe all that "trolling" on C2 wore them out? ;-)

        <em>Indeed.  I forgot to mention:  My visual/cognitive processing is probably different from yours because I'm not human.</em>

        First we had to compete with 3rd-world-wage educated labor, and now The Grays.

        At least you solved <a href="FermiParadox.html">FermiParadox</a>.

        That's going to make for some rather attention-getting roadkill.
