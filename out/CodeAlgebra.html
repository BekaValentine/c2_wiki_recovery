        <em>This appears to me to be a parameterized/paraphrased discussion from the </em>RefactoringBrowserThesis. The <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> and thesis use FirstOrderPredicateLogic to prove various facts about refactorings. --<a href="ShaeErisson.html">ShaeErisson</a><em></em>

        I think <a href="SetTheory.html">SetTheory</a>, GroupTheory, <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> may be together useful backgrounds for building a code algebra. Those three sub-disciplines of mathematics were all founded with the idea that there are universal patterns in mathematics that can be extracted and matched. <a href="GraphTheory.html">GraphTheory</a> may also prove itself useful. The concept called "(homo)morphism" in <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>, GroupTheory, etc., is just a formal version of the concept of Analogy. And then if you can find strong analogies between different portions of code, then maybe you have a redundancy to eliminate there. -- <a href="MathieuBouchard.html">MathieuBouchard</a>
