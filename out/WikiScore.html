        One purpose for this rating system is to offer a way to analyse all the pages in a <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>. Or you could also say it's a religious-inspired description of a wiki as a temple of socially accepted behavior.

        <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a> what does "the service provider of actions defined by WikiStandardWords" mean?

        It would help to have examples for each score from 0 to 10.

        I have no idea what this is supposed to be.  It feels like someone is trying to measure the access/edt pattern of a page, and on that basis assign a "score".  That seems mis-guided, but perhaps I'm missing the point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please would someone who understands this take (at least) one of the scores - say 7 - and expand on it?  The above "descriptions" are a bit terse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even an introductory paragraph might help.
