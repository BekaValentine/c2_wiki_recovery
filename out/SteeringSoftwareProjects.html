      <p>
        Here is an attempt to create demand for processes like <a href="EvolutionaryDelivery.html">EvolutionaryDelivery</a> and <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, on the assumption that once the demand is there, the names won't matter so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why must the demand be created?  Isn't there already sufficient demand for better software development?  Instead of creating some high minded sounding document, I think we would be better off addressing the problems that exist today and how they can be solved.  [I don't mean so sound contentions here, but I do believe the approach started here is not productive and want to suggest a better alternative.]</em>

        If you want these rights, there is a process called <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> which allows your programming team to hold up their end of this deal.
