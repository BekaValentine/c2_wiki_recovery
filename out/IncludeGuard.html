        Include Guard
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> you can guard against the contents of a header file being parsed more than once by using an <a href="IncludeGuard.html">IncludeGuard</a>:
      </p>
      <code>
        #ifndef HEADER_H_<br/>
        #define HEADER_H_<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // The whole rest of the file goes here<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        #endif // The last line in the file<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If the preprocessor sees this file a second time it will ignore everything between the #ifndef and the #endif - <em>i.e.</em> the whole body of the file. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you bothered by the file being read every time it's included?  Then try <a href="RedundantIncludeGuards.html">RedundantIncludeGuards</a>.
      </p>

        It seems <a href="IncludeGuard.html">IncludeGuard</a>s is enough. I think of <a href="RedundantIncludeGuards.html">RedundantIncludeGuards</a> as an implementation detail that hurts maintainability and should be something dealt with by the compiler. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There's <em>should</em> ... and then there's the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most tests on modern compilers (such as KAI or MSVC) show the difference in compilation time between normal <a href="IncludeGuard.html">IncludeGuard</a>s and <a href="RedundantIncludeGuards.html">RedundantIncludeGuards</a> to be any where from non-existent to milliseconds. Are <a href="RedundantIncludeGuards.html">RedundantIncludeGuards</a> worth the time saved? Not for me, but do your own experiments and decide which is more important to you - a <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> <a href="IncludeGuard.html">IncludeGuard</a> or the slightly faster compile times of <a href="RedundantIncludeGuards.html">RedundantIncludeGuards</a>? Also don't forget there are multiple ways to skin a cat - using PrecompiledHeaders or creating smaller lexical units, for example, are preferable to <a href="RedundantIncludeGuards.html">RedundantIncludeGuards</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Modern</em> is not necessarily wide-spread (remember, the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>). Also, what size had the "most tests" systems. Pre-compiled headers introduce problems of their own, at least if they are implemented like in MSVC.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="RedundantIncludeGuards.html">RedundantIncludeGuards</a> may be useless, but <a href="IncludeGuard.html">IncludeGuard</a>s are important to prevent classes, typedefs, macros, etc. from being declared multiple times, which can result in compile failure.<em></em>

        Am I the only person that wonders if recurring includes is a symptom of a system structure that needs fixing? (see <a href="LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign.html">LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign</a> ) -- <a href="SvenDowideit.html">SvenDowideit</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, while I don't agree, I think it was Lakos in <a href="LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign.html">LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign</a> that recommended the use of <a href="RedundantIncludeGuards.html">RedundantIncludeGuards</a>.
