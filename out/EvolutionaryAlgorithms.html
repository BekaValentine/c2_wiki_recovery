        Evolutionary Algorithms

      <p>
        An <a href="EvolutionaryAlgorithm.html">EvolutionaryAlgorithm</a> is a type of heuristic search and optimization methods based on principles of biological evolution and breeding. The major camps and flavors are

      </ul>
      <p>
        although there are a plethora of other approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        In essence, they all come down to
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           choose a quantitative problem to solve
        </li>
        <li>
           choose a "good" way to represent solutions - raw bitmaps, lists of floating-point numbers, tree structures, or something entirely different? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You want a representation such that, given some initial guess, small changes to that guess (in step 5) give rise to solutions that are slightly better or worse, rather than surrounding each reasonably-good initial guess with large moats of terrible solutions that have to be jumped over to reach better solutions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           choose some initial guess solutions to the problem
        </li>
        <li>
           determine how good these are, objectively, at solving the problem
        </li>
        <li>
           allow the solutions that are better, objectively, to multiply more than the ones that aren't, with some minor variation
        </li>
        <li>
           get rid of some of the worse solutions you have hanging around, and keep the better ones
        </li>
        <li>
           repeat from (4)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Recombination of solutions features in a lot of these, but mutation (slight variation of certain "genes") is enough for some of the others. The literature on <a href="EvolutionaryAlgorithms.html">EvolutionaryAlgorithms</a> is full to the brim with slight fillips and specializations. -- <a href="BillTozier.html">BillTozier</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, mutation should be used sparingly. Some experts like Koza decry its use at all. The current framework for <a href="ExtremeGeneticProgramming.html">ExtremeGeneticProgramming</a> is capable of evolving solutions using crossover only. -- <a href="JonGroff.html">JonGroff</a>

        <em>Added "choose representation" step. I haven't done much with </em><a href="EvolutionaryAlgorithms.html">EvolutionaryAlgorithms</a> (experts, please comment), but I suspect more ProgrammerTime is spent diddling with various representations than any other step of this process. (Of course, most MachineTime is spent iterating steps 2 through 5, but that can happen while the programmer is taking a CaffeineBreak, overnight, or over a 3 day weekend.<em> -- </em><a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a>
