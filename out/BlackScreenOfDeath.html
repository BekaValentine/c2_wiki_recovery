        The "black screen of death" also appears to affect other Windows operating systems, including Windows 7's predecessor, Windows Vista, as well as Windows XP. When users log on, they see a completely black screen instead of the usual start menu, desktop icons and system tray.

        Firstly, there appears to be many causes of the black screen issue. The symptoms are very distinctive and troublesome. After starting your Windows 7, Vista, XP, NT, W2K, W2K3 or W2K8 PC or server the system appears normal. However, after logging on there is no desktop, task bar, system tray or side bar. Instead you are left with a totally black screen and a single My Computer Explorer window. Even this window might be minimized making it hard to see.
