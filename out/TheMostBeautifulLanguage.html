        The Most Beautiful Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        ... is <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>. Much prettier than <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also a gagillion times faster - potentially <a href="FasterThanCee.html">FasterThanCee</a> on modern architectures. And soon, with NDP on the GPU, so much <a href="FasterThanCee.html">FasterThanCee</a> that C will never, ever catch up ... <em>This all sounds like a bit of </em><a href="SufficientlySmartCompiler.html">SufficientlySmartCompiler</a> jabber. Did any of this pan out? --ArlenCuss<em>  Show me a Haskell chess program as strong as Stockfish, or even Fruit, and then I'll consider such a ridiculous claim. --</em><a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        And a lot safer. Haskell typing is static and strong even though it is pretter than <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>. For example you can't write a <a href="QuickCheck.html">QuickCheck</a> in Ruby no matter how many layers of Rails you cobble on top ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Looks to me like something like </em><a href="QuickCheck.html">QuickCheck</a> would be pretty easy to implement in Ruby. Why do you claim otherwise? --<a href="MarnenLaibowKoser.html">MarnenLaibowKoser</a>, 11 Sep 2013<em></em>

        xmonad is an X window manager written in Haskell. It is very much slower than dwm, the window manager upon which it is based, written in C.

        The most beautiful language would be one that uses supermodels as syntax.
