        Use Objects To Represent Objects
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some of the earliest object oriented programming systems used graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this is backwards.  If you are programming graphics it is
        easy to think of the things that are displayed as objects belonging
        to classes.   To put it another way, a graphic is often a simulated
        object and so the same forces that lead to objects and classes in Simula
        lead the graphic language and system designer towards <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>.

        Sketchpad Circa 1960 included the addresses of display functions as
        data describing the objects-- virtual functions.  Quoth Alan Kay.
