        Brand of keyboard which comes with a fancy mechanical action and all keys blank as standard. Useful for <a href="LearningTouchTyping.html">LearningTouchTyping</a>, showing off, and matte-black fashion statements. It currently comes in a standard 104- or 105-key IBM layout, from <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com.">http://www.daskeyboard.com.</a>

        Why the "<a href="DasKeyboard.html">DasKeyboard</a>" and the "labels" above the indicating lights were left is beyond me. What does the bottom side of the keyboard look like? is there a manufacturer name and serial number or any other identifying information? And what about the inside? are chips and circuit boards labeled, or left blank as well?

        I've been using the <a href="DasKeyboard.html">DasKeyboard</a> for about a month now and absolutely love it. Any programmer knows the benefit of a comfortable and beloved keyboard, so I was building a new system and decided to spend a good amount of $$$ on where my hands are most of the day. In pure sensory terms typing is as satisfying as popping bubblewrap with jackhammer ibm keyboard gunmetal clicking, visually it's like you are using Case's ono-sendai cyberdeck, and there is a minimalist elegance to the whole thing. I know it sounds like a product pitch, but I just love typing on this keyboard. It makes me cringe to use one of my other oatmeal style. It's not fancy(except for being totally black), no crazy keys, no programmable lcd's, no annoying play/stop/rewind/ie buttons, none of that... it's just a good solid keyboard that feels like it will last the years I hope to have it. Also, I never even noticed the transition to no letters, touchtypers won't even blink. -- <a href="LayneThomas.html">LayneThomas</a>
