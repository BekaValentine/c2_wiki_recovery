        Oxymoron Client

      <p>
        Perhaps the right name for <a href="RichInternetApplication.html">RichInternetApplication</a>? <a href="RichInternetApplication.html">RichInternetApplication</a> do too much to be ThinClients, but are too limited to be FatClients, so they like the JackOlantern of applications: JackOlantern life had been too sinful for Jack to go to heaven; however, the Devil had promised not to take his soul, and so he was barred from both hell and heaven.

        <em>"Oxymoron" is the wrong word for this. Perhaps "</em>GoldilocksClient". In either case, in a <a href="RichInternetApplication.html">RichInternetApplication</a>, the <strong>browser</strong> is the <a href="ThinClient.html">ThinClient</a>, and is a client <strong>to</strong> the server providing the <a href="RichInternetApplication.html">RichInternetApplication</a>. Of course, the <a href="RichInternetApplication.html">RichInternetApplication</a> is free to pump some protein... err... code over to the browser as a volatile thickening agent. <a href="HtmlDomJsCss.html">HtmlDomJsCss</a> isn't too fat or too thin. It's just right.<em></em>
