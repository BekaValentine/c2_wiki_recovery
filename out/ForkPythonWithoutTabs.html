        Fork Python Without Tabs
      </h1>
      <p>
        Rather than "argue with the customer" around and around over the tab issue, why not just make (fork) a curly-brace version of <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> and let the market-place decide? That's the beauty of OSS: split instead of fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tab fans can look at it this way: if a non-tabbed version of Python brings more developers into the Python fold, then the total gain of users may offset the loss due to the forking. It could "juice" the popularity of the language. VB.net and C-sharp generally co-exist fine as different syntax on top of the same engine, so it has worked in practice.
