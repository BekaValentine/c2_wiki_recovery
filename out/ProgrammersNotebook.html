        <strong>How to use</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting to keep a <a href="ProgrammersNotebook.html">ProgrammersNotebook</a> was the one of the two best changes to my <a href="PersonalSoftwareProcess.html">PersonalSoftwareProcess</a> I made over the last year. (The other was to use contracts, as explained in <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>.) If there is something I think of but cannot use right away, something I have to do, or a nice quotation, it goes in the notebook right away. It is also very useful for taking notes at a meeting. Sometimes, I also paste in a design or code sketch that I wrote down on a loose piece of paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently use a folio-sized notebook (slightly larger than A4). This is big, but it gives me the freedom to sketch designs etc. that would not - or barely - fit in an A5 booklet. But this is personal preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the notebook I keep a time log, so that I can always find out what I was doing when. But this is only a secondary use.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned about a programmers' (or engineering) notebook from a colleague. <a href="WattsHumphrey.html">WattsHumphrey</a>'s <a href="PersonalSoftwareProcess.html">PersonalSoftwareProcess</a> book also mentioned it, and that made me decide to try it.
        -- <a href="MarnixKlooster.html">MarnixKlooster</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I conditioned myself to initiate logging in the moment normally wasted debating "Shall I write something in my scribbler?" (This is a variation on my personal philosophy of "Don't hesitate to tell your wife you love her.") This sometimes took the form of a near-dooble, but over time my entries would break down into 3 basic types; sketches, prose blocks, and point notes (including calendar entries)</em> -- <a href="BenTremblay.html">BenTremblay</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Some comparisons with what Marnix does:
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm nowhere near as orderly as Humphrey would suggest, or as Marnix is. My notebooks are for fixing things in my mind, communicating with a quick drawing once in a while, and for having materials to refer to later. Most references back are to the same notebook; fairly often one book back; very rarely further.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use spiral-bound 8.5x11 notebooks, 5x5 quadrille-ruled. I've got them going back well over ten years. Sometimes, I even look back at them to find something.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the front of the notebook, I paste in one-page month-at-a-glance calendars for the few months I expect the notebook to last. Write my appointments and hours right on there.
      </p>
      <p>
        A trick I use for the <a href="ToDoList.html">ToDoList</a>: I put an array of those little yellow sticky notes on a page near the front. I write <a href="ToDoList.html">ToDoList</a> items on them, and remove each when it's done.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all kinds of specialized pages, try printing a little form and sticking it into the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        I start a new page for almost everything, although sometimes I can't resist reusing a page with only a couple of lines. For formal meetings and such, I write the date, meeting name, attendees at the top. Otherwise, I don't use much standard formatting. My notebooks are just for me, so I don't worry about format as much. I do use special symbols to mark action items and questions, and I use multiple colors of ink for direct meeting notes and meta-notes written then or at another time.

        I do this also. I have smaller notebooks: 9.5"x6." I use them for blurbs of at most five lines. It is a great way to organizing writing ideas. Periodically, I make new blurbs that reference previous blurbs to consider whether certain ideas will work together. For programming or just things in general, I use to-do lists in Notepad and splatter them across my Windows NT desktop.
      </p>
      <p>
        For finely grained work, I'll often liberally spread my code with one-line comments prefaced by "MF" to bookmark things to revisit, often optimizations. I <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> (often brute force) and then refactor as things come to life (in C++ no less). When I get rid of all the "MFs", I know I've done all that I set out to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Invariably, ideas come to me when I don't have my notebook, so at the end of the day I pull little scraps of paper from my pockets. I'm thinking about getting a <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a>, but not seriously. I know next to nothing about them and it is hard to believe that anything is better than paper.

        With the "two-pages-per-day" format, I have a whole page to write things that would normally be on random scraps of paper.

      <p>
        Typical entries: Start/stop times for billable hours (a religion with me ;-); counts of things I just did -- for status reporting; names, phone numbers and web addresses people mention; quick organizing notes for routine meetings; etc.

        One big thing I do with my 8 1/2 by 11 inch spiral bound <em>(read: cheap!)</em> notebook, is to draw a line from each "<a href="ToDo.html">ToDo</a>" item to the right margin, where I draw a box. When I do it, I check off the box.

        I tend to use an ASCII [<a href="EmacsOutlineMode.html">EmacsOutlineMode</a> file] rather than a paper book, but the concept is the same. I rarely remove from the file, and usually append rather than editing. See also <a href="DebugByDescribing.html">DebugByDescribing</a>.

        For dissociated, wish-I-had-time-to-do-that ideas, I write my thoughts on a Post-It note and stick it on my office wall. It amuses me to look up there and see them all while I'm thinking about something else, or want to get some inspiration for a current problem. Right now my amoeba-like Post-It note organism is about 1 square meter and slowly growing around my desk.

        I've been using <a href="IndexCard.html">IndexCard</a>s lately. They're hard to leaf through but very easy to reorganize as new information is added. I collect them into little decks by subject and put rubber bands around them. I don't use them to keep track of time, except when I have a bunch of immediate ToDos. Then, I put them one per card, put the cards in my pocket and periodically throw away the ones that are already done. I do this for open items between meetings too.

        I too do this a lot now. -- <a href="LaurentBossavit.html">LaurentBossavit</a>

      <p>
        I like using <a href="IndexCard.html">IndexCard</a>s (one of the many paper-based technologies) as a <a href="ToDoList.html">ToDoList</a> because, as you say, they're easy to reorganize. Or, rather, you aren't forced to organize them when you're writing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        With competing paper-based technologies, like the bound notebook or loose sheet of paper, you're required to impose an order as you write items down. But when you write items on <a href="IndexCard.html">IndexCard</a>s and throw them on a pile (or put them in your back pocket, if you're using the <a href="IndexCard.html">IndexCard</a>s release for the 3"x5" platform, upon which I've standardized), you're not required to look at them in the entry order the next time. Thus you can defer ordering and grouping. This makes it much easier to focus on content now, and worry about priority and categories later. Not to mention time estimates and risk and feasibility and all that good stuff. (This separation into a "loose flowing" phase (of entering items) and a later "refactoring" or "editing" phase is also characteristic of the <a href="WritingWithoutTeachers.html">WritingWithoutTeachers</a> or <a href="FowlerWritingMethod.html">FowlerWritingMethod</a> writing process, and of the "make it run, make it right, make it fast" programming concept, where you make things work first, and then refactor them.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This point about <a href="ToDoList.html">ToDoList</a> technologies doesn't necessarily apply to maintaining a <a href="ProgrammersNotebook.html">ProgrammersNotebook</a>, however. Perhaps a bound paper book is better for that.

        Not that paper doesn't have its place, but...
      </p>
      <p>
        When I started running wikis, I got hold of Apache32 for NT and <a href="ActivePerl.html">ActivePerl</a>, and set up a local server on my home NT system (notebook) that could serve a wiki. The thought was that it would form a decent "notebook" for random notes, with built-in searching and easy updates. Works fine. I mean these days one almost always has a browser running, and now with <a href="ActiveDesktop.html">ActiveDesktop</a>, any folder window is a browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        The neat feature from my point of view is that my local notebook is just an ftp away from being accessed from any location or machine if I place it on one of my web sites. I especially appreciate the hyperlinking between pages, from pages to files, from pages to Internet URLs... Not quite seamless, but close.

        I too have found a personal wiki valuable for project notes. I've found that when recording thoughts on paper, I often get bogged down in the details, sometimes losing thoughts forever in the effort to fit them into the linear notebook medium. In wiki, details are delayed by encoding them as AbstractLinks.
        Usually the link name can be descriptive enough to record the flavor of my thoughts at the time. I've found myself drilling down on subsequent passes and filling in levels of detail in a way that would have been much more difficult (or impossible) on paper. -- <a href="TimVoght.html">TimVoght</a>

        <em>That is a cool idea. I wish it were feasible for me to try. What I did was take a guestbook perl script, and change the text of it to indicate ideabook.

Now, I can get to it from home, work, the labs at school, walking down a hallway at school (they have terminals scattered around for users to check email and web with), and other places. I have a script on my home linux machine that back the files up to my home computer nightly (that script also backs up other dynamic areas of my site, as well as doing mail processing and downloading commonly read news groups).

        Here's a trick for keeping two books in one (say, to separate musing and personal observations from operational notes and lists): flip the spiral notebook vertically, turn it around, open it up, and start the second "book" on the upside-down pages. When your two books meet in the middle, start a new notebook.

        Here's one way to do a <a href="ToDoList.html">ToDoList</a> in your notebook. Reserve the second page or so, blank, for the list. <strong>Pave the page with blank yellow sticky-notes</strong>, the small 1.5x2" size. Write todos on the notes. Remove them when done. Rearrange to reflect priorities.
      </p>

        Seems like a <a href="BestPractice.html">BestPractice</a> to me, but some here might not require it of their minions, or might require more than just a text description. (The e-mail and version control logs tell all, you know.) -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        It's good. I wish I had written down everything that happened on C3 [<a href="ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation.html">ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation</a>]. I would be able to fill the Internet with stuff I learned and how I learned it. Instead of just Wiki. But what's email? -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        After reading this comment several times, I think I now understand why you ask, "What's E-mail?" You're pointing out that on an <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> project (like <a href="ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation.html">ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation</a>), all communication is face-to-face (which I agree is a good thing), so there is no "E-mail log". (Although there is a version control log.) Am I right? The comment probably wouldn't make sense to someone looking at this page who didn't know much about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. -- <a href="ApoorvaMuralidhara.html">ApoorvaMuralidhara</a>

        Funny. My friend added an RFC 2324 implementation to his and uses it to run his coffeemaker (which runs Emacs, of course, even though EdIsTheStandardEditor). -- <a href="JoeOsborn.html">JoeOsborn</a>

        There is a new piece of software from Microsoft called <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a> that might prove useful as a <a href="ProgrammersNotebook.html">ProgrammersNotebook</a>. It has many of the requisite features: include text and images, links between pages, runs on PDAs, etc.

        Except I just realized the trial version is 80 Mb. So maybe this isn't an ideal solution... Looks like a neat piece of software, though.

        I am just half-way through the trial period using this software, and I am convinced that it will soon belong to my toolset. It is versatile, comprehensive and easy to use. Its use is limited only by the user's imagination and curiosity. I have already included it in my FirstStep and SuccessOriented schemas. While it is useful in capturing pages from the internet, it is not limited to that. It has two ways you can capture, each of which having strengths and weaknesses, but when taken together, will cover most capture and recover efforts. The first is like a camera, taking a picture of what you have included in a user-defined rectangle, the second being a capture of the complete document. The second method captures not only text, but links and images as well. It has an additional feature I haven't used much where you can capture and store sound from your computer sound system and store in a page as a link. There are a host of other features I haven't touched yet, including handwriting recognition, etc. You'll have to try it to find out for yourself. No cost for trial, which is for an adequate period to allow you to decide whether you want to purchase it or not. 
        I will probably do so near the end of the trial period. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

        I've maintained an all-electronic <a href="ProgrammersNotebook.html">ProgrammersNotebook</a> since November, 1986, and have never needed paper. Of course, I'm what you might call a <a href="WordPerson.html">WordPerson</a> rather than a <a href="PicturePerson.html">PicturePerson</a>, so all-electronic works better for me. Can you imagine trying to search thousands of paper pages without an index? - <a href="BillZimmerly.html">BillZimmerly</a>, <em>Trees love me.</em> :)

        The process of using a <a href="LogBook.html">LogBook</a> for just about everything was drummed into me at college back in the 70s. My prof regularly stated that unless an observation was written down, it never happened. With a few lapses, I have stuck to this mantra since then and now have a wonderful repository of personal history to look back on.

        For years now (25 plus) I have followed basically the same method of logging. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I use A4 case bound ruled notebooks (occasionally spiral bound if I can't get case bound). I reserve the first 5 pages as an index and then number all other sheets (i.e. two pages on a single sheet of paper) sequentially (if not already done so). I start each topic/project/client/whatever on the right hand page of a new sheet. I then continue to use that sheet for that topic until the sheet (double page) is full. I then find the next empty sheet and continue. To link the sheets together, the right hand page of the sheet has the number of the previous sheet relating to that topic (or '-' if it is the first in the topic), the topic name and the number of the next sheet (filled in when a new one is started). <em>This sounds familiar. Wasn't at least one early file system implemented this way, as a bunch of linked lists of blocks in a BAM of some sort?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The index sheets contain a sequential contents list of the topics, plus a list of sheets containing the narrative of that topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        One variant that I used when I worked in Germany was to use A4 duplicate books. This allowed me to get the best of two otherwise competing access methods: a NarrativeStyle and a topic specific style. In addition to the logbook, I also had TopicFolders in my FilingCabinet. As each page was completed, the carbon copy was removed and stored in the topic's folder, leaving the master in the <a href="LogBook.html">LogBook</a>. By this means I had the complete narrative of a topic, together with any other materials, in one place. Unfortunately I can't get the A4 duplicate books in the UK, so I gave up on this approach.
      </p>

        I have toyed with the notion of using an <a href="ElectronicLogBook.html">ElectronicLogBook</a> many times, but I always come back to paper in the end.

        I highly recommend <a href="NoteLens.html">NoteLens</a> (google on it) for this. It is missing some minor usability improvements (like remembering grid sizing in registry), but satisfies almost all your needs in a simple way. It has great searching and categorization and does not get in the way of you, nearly as fast as notepad.
