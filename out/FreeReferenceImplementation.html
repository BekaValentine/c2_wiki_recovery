        Free Reference Implementation
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here's an idea: Protocols, languages and similar standards should have an implementation that is free for people to study, use, and experiment with.  Proprietary implementations can be tested against it, and working code is the best way of communicating the ideas.

        The <a href="InternetEngineeringTaskForce.html">InternetEngineeringTaskForce</a> requires this for submissions.  <a href="RichardGabriel.html">RichardGabriel</a> identifies this in <a href="PatternsOfSoftware.html">PatternsOfSoftware</a> as being important to the success of a new language.

        This makes me think of the Testing chapter in <a href="KentsBook.html">KentsBook</a>, where he describes the non-obvious (but important) benefits of embedding all the unit tests right there in the code. Every developer who gets the code and documentation can run the tests, establishing that it actually works. Every test that completes builds the confidence of the customer that he has a real, working solution.

        <a href="FreeReferenceImplementation.html">FreeReferenceImplementation</a> does the same thing. (It also makes me think of FreeRangeChickens, a totally different subject altogether!)
