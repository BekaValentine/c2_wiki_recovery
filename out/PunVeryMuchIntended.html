        Pun Very Much Intended
      </h1>
      <p>
        In my opinion, the phrase "pun not intended" is quite silly, especially in written work. If you notice a pun in what you've written, and are willing to take the time to write "pun not intended", and the pun is <strong>really</strong> so horrible that you can't <strong>stand</strong> to be associated with it or seen as responsible for it - why not reword yourself? Personally, I'd rather take pride in my serendipitous wit. And thus I do say "pun very much intended" in real life, in such situations. -- <a href="KarlKnechtel.html">KarlKnechtel</a>
