        Hi there!
      </p>
      <p>
        You've probably come here from a page whose text has been deleted and has been replaced with this message.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please understand that we mean no harm in deleting your page. In fact, we're delighted to have you, but the page you created seemed to contain no content worth saving. If this page was intended as a test, congratulations -- you succeeded in creating a page. Please use the <a href="WikiWikiSandbox.html">WikiWikiSandbox</a> for testing, or if you like, you can create a page with your <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a> and add a little info about yourself. Such a <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> normally won't be deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we misunderstood, feel free to go back and fill in your old content (it should be in the <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>), perhaps accompanied by a bit more explanation so nobody else will mistake it for a page with no content. In any case, if you'd like to learn more about <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> you can visit the <a href="NewUserPages.html">NewUserPages</a> where we officially <a href="WelcomeVisitors.html">WelcomeVisitors</a> and explain some of the conventions of Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if it really was just a test, you can complete the deletion by replacing the text <em>DeleteNoContent</em> with the text <em>delete</em> on your test page.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're not the person who created the page, please wait a day before seconding this deletion, so that the original poster will have time to see this message. Also consider using <a href="DeleteNoContent.html">DeleteNoContent</a> yourself when deleting pages you feel are lacking in content; it keeps Wiki a welcoming environment for newcomers, while still taking care of sandbox cruft.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
           is for pages with content like "Hooray! it worked!" or "Did this work?" or something like that.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Such pages are often created by newcomers to Wiki who are simply trying to convince themselves that they can, indeed, create pages.
        </li>
        <li>
           "WelcomeToWiki" acknowledges this, and offsets what would otherwise seem to be an unfriendly and unwelcoming act: deleting someone's first contribution. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Pages marked <a href="DeletedButWelcomeToWiki.html">DeletedButWelcomeToWiki</a> are often deleted within 48 hours of their creation

        <li>
           is similar, but the "WelcomeToWiki" doesn't necessarily apply.  
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="DeleteNoContent.html">DeleteNoContent</a> may hang around for years before being axed  
        </li>
        <li>
           Content (or lack thereof) is in the eye of the beholder, and so explanatory text (above) explicitly makes room for the possibility that the deleted page might have meant something to its original author.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Granted, these WikiTags seem similar, but the context and the connotations are slightly different.
