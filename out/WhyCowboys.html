        Why Cowboys
      </h1>
      <p>
        Cattle can be a convenient form of capital (so many head of stock...) because they bear interest of their own accord.  Unfortunately, they won't get to market on time on their own, so you'll need to put some cowboys on the payroll.  To partially make up for the inconvenience, the IRS will allow you to <a href="IncomeAverage.html">IncomeAverage</a>, even though it won't for software types.
