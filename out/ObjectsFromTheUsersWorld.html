        Objects From The Users World
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the early days of OO it was believed that all objects in an OO program should be derived from <a href="ObjectsFromTheUsersWorld.html">ObjectsFromTheUsersWorld</a>.

        And then we discovered that we were helping users create a new world.

        And then we found we had to fix the broken world we created last time round.

        How does this relate to <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>'s pattern ThingsFromYourLife?

        Actually, I think this belief was promulgated mainly by a subset of methodologists who didn't happen to think about all the classes involved in window system interaction, file system interaction, database interaction, etc. - not to mention the more modern issues of network interaction, distributed object middleware interaction, and whatnot. <a href="BusinessObject.html">BusinessObject</a> classes are still very important and valuable (and in fact still under-emphasized), IMHO, but percentage-wise they form only a minority of the classes in an application. <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>'s <a href="AdvancedApplicationArchitectureTeam.html">AdvancedApplicationArchitectureTeam</a> made a presentation on exactly this topic - see <a href="http://www.gemstone.com/news_events/online_seminar.html.">http://www.gemstone.com/news_events/online_seminar.html.</a> -- <a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>
