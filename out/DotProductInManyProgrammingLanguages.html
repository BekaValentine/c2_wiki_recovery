        "[T]he programming languages we use also
        force our minds towards ways of thinking. For me, LISP is far more the
        way I think than the "standard" languages like Basic, java, etc. Lisp is
        halfway to a functional language. It is as imperative as java or basic,
        but the line of thoughts of functional language can be used also."
      </p>
      <p>
        To give you an example of the difference in thoughts:
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you want to program a dot product of two vectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "standard" way of thoughts is: "Oh, I need a variable with a
        running sum, then I need an index to run over the number of elements of
        the vectors, I write a loop where I add the products for every element
        to the running sum, after I initialized it to 0." So all tiny steps that
        get way out of focus of the problem to be solved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "functional" way of thoughts is: "I want the sum of the elementwise
        multiplication of the two vectors." So it is more like the formal
        problem definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also leads to a huge difference in code:
      </p>
      <p>
        (in C)
      </p>
      <code>
        /* Assume that a and b point to array with at least length elements */<br/>
        /* Assume that none of the intermediate values overflows a double. */<br/>
        '<br/>
        double dotProduct(double *a, double *b, int length) {<br/>
        double runningSum = 0;<br/>
        for (int index = 0; index < length; index++)<br/>
        runningSum += a[index] * b[index];<br/>
        return runningSum;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (in <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>)
      </p>
      <code>
        ;; assume that a and b are the same length.<br/>
        ;; assume that corresponding elements of a and b can be multiplied together.<br/>
        ;;<br/>
        (defun dot-product (a b)<br/>
        (reduce '+ (mapcar '* a b)))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (The original code here used "apply" instead of "reduce", but that may hit a limit on the number of arguments.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The name of the lisp function "mapcar" is not very descriptive, but it
        means something like "perform elementwise".
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you'd end up consing the extra lists (returned from MAPCAR) so,
        in a production system, most lispers would use a straightforward, non-functional,
        loop and collect:
      </p>
      <code>
        ;; assume that a and b are the same length.<br/>
        ;; assume that corresponding elements of a and b can be multiplied together.<br/>
        ;;<br/>
        (defun dot-product (a b)<br/>
        (loop for x across a<br/>
        for y across b<br/>
        summing (* a b)))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Also, the above would probably have declarations on the types of vectors being multiplied.  And you'd like to check that they're of congruent dimensions (not done in above code).

        <a href="SteveHowell.html">SteveHowell</a>: Here's the test-first Python way of looking at the dot product problem:
      </p>
      <code>
        def test():<br/>
        assert sum([3,4,5]) == 12<br/>
        assert ElementWiseMultiplication([3,2], [4,5]) == [12,10]<br/>

      <code>
        def DotProduct(list1, list2):<br/>
        return sum(ElementWiseMultiplication(list1, list2))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It's a bit longer than the lisp solution, but it fits my brain a bit better. YMMV.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Python implementation need not be longer:
      </p>
      <code>
        def dot_product(a, b):<br/>
        return reduce(lambda sum, p: sum + p[0]*p[1], zip(a,b), 0)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>This is basically the same as the short LISP implementation above. Perhaps Python really almost is LISP with </em><a href="InfixNotation.html">InfixNotation</a>: <a href="http://www.norvig.com/python-lisp.html''">http://www.norvig.com/python-lisp.html''</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SteveHowell.html">SteveHowell</a>'s version can be reduced to the even shorter:
      </p>
      <code>
        def dot_product(a, b):<br/>
        return sum([a[i]*b[i] for i in range(len(a))])<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However the most Pythonic way is clean, lazy, and works on any pair of iterables (if you don't need <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>, use zip rather than izip):
      </p>
      <code>
        from itertools import izip<br/>
        def dot_product(a, b):<br/>
        return sum(x*y for (x,y) in izip(a,b))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Or a more FP style:
      </p>
      <code>
        from itertools import imap<br/>
        from operator import mul<br/>
        def dot_product(a, b):<br/>
        return sum(imap(mul, a, b))<br/>

        <em>No it isn't correct. Inner products (of which the usual 'dot product' is one), are defined on inner-product spaces, which are vector spaces which have (unsurprisingly) an inner product. This may or may not be a Hilbert space (i.e., have a norm). In any case, the operation is defined on vectors in a vector space.

        <em>Or you could strongly constrain the v1, v2 to some space you are working with, e.g. (check-type v1 (simple-array double-float (3)), eg, an optimized version for a declarations-as-assertions implementions working in double precision euclidean space might look like, venturing into the not-so-elegant world of productionish code that does these checks and works on a more concrete representation (simple arrays of length 3 holding doubles), which may (unfortunately) be needed for efficiency purposes in many of the sorts of things you actually use euclidean 3-vectors for. This example avoids the loop macro, to show a different approach.</em>

        I updated the Erlang version to signal an error if the lists aren't the same lengths. It's still defined for zero-length lists, is that right?

      <p>
        <em>Actually, you caught me typing late at night :) From the above description, you should see that an inner product needs a scalar Field, so zero-length tuples are out. Actually, length 1 tuples don't make sense either (then you are just operating in the scalar Field itself. The problem with this sort of thing is that an idea like the 'dot-product' generalizes simply algorithmically that it is easy/tempting to write general code (much like we have notation <a,b> which generalizes quite well). Mathematically, the operation only only make sense when applied to elements 'from the same place'. On paper, this means that you have to be careful you haven't written some nonsense if you are working with multiple inner product spaces. In the computer, something else should enforce this discipline. As long as you aren't after raw speed (think numerical simulations), you would stay with the elegant version. Python certainly isn't fast enough for that (without punting to C code, which you could do in other languages as well, I don't know about ML variants). There is nothing wrong with doing something like:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        (defun dot-product (v1 v2)<br/>
        (assert (and (= (length v1) (length v2)) (/= 0 1 (length v1))))<br/>
        (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'* v1 v2)))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>If you don't mind the consing.  On the other hand, if you do work with different spaces regularly, it may be cleanest to use CLOS to designate your inner product spaces...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On Python speed for dot products: One might be surprised.  I have a Python information retrieval application which does many dot products regularly, and the dot products are hardly a bottleneck.  As always, speed depends upon the application, and in this case, I get to have my elegance and use it too.  :)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well one might be surprised, but I wouldn't.  In the applications I am thinking of above, I would expect something like a million dot-products per time slice.  So we are looking at billions-to-trillions of individual dot products.  How many are you talking about?  The python version above isn't nearly as elegant as the lisp version, and probably isn't faster (I don't know enough about pythons internals to be sure of this).  Walking along lists in lisp is very fast.  For numerical work, the problem is that you just can't afford any temporary storage --- each dot product (on a suitable domain) *must* boil down to a few assembly instructions (preferably unrolled, if you are dealing with short vectors).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we all agree here: it depends on the application. We just have different applications. It's not surprise that those of us whose applications don't require cycle-squeezing wince a bit at the heavily optimized code :-) and vice-versa.  <em>Absolutely.  One nice thing about lisp is the ability to get both, without </em><a href="ForeignFunctionInterface.html">ForeignFunctionInterface</a> kludges etc; I don't claim lisp is unique in that regard.	Although to be fair, sometimes the only practical approach is to revert to a hand-tuned assembly library.  That can't be anything but yucky.<em></em>

        "List.map2" is the equivalent of Haskell's "zipWith". OCaml does not come with a standard "sum" function, so we had to do a fold explicitly. Extra spacing must be used when putting the multiplication operators inside parentheses for using them in non-infix style, because they contain asterisks, and "(*" and "*)" starts and ends comments in OCaml, respectively. In OCaml, the arithmetic operators for the different numeric types are different, and there are no generic operators for all numeric types, probably for reasons of speed, so the function for each type will have to be written separately. It can be modified to suit other numeric types trivially.

        It takes the Jacobian which itself is the derivative of a dot product (above) and cross product (not much more complex), of differentials of a function. The tricky part would be the differentiation steps. But many contend the <a href="SymbolicProgramming.html">SymbolicProgramming</a> distinction is illusory. Algorithms for the Hessian would see if some languages allow this to be expressed easier. I.e. hessian(f) where f is a polynomial (to keep it manageable) this function should do all the differentiation steps (input should not already be differentiated). Output is a matrix (vector of vectors) assume no simplification is needed but could be <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>ed.
