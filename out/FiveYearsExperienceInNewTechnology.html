        Five Years Experience In New Technology
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="HumanResources.html">HumanResources</a> departments often have clauses about number of years of experience with certain technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        These clauses are sometimes added for everything needed for a particular job search or independent contract opportunity without considering how long a technology has actually been available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is somewhat humorous, but can be annoying when stated as the reason for not being considered for an interview.
      </p>
      <p>
        This might go something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        HR::	"We're sorry, you need to have 5 years of experience with WhizBangTechnology."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Candidate::	"But, WhizBangTechnology has only been out for 2 years."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        HR::	"Sorry, but that's our policy. Please feel free to resubmit your resume in a few years."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Candidate::	"No thanks, you guys are clueless."<br/>
      </code>
