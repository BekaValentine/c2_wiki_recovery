        Franz Kafka
      </h1>
      <p>
        Franz Kafka, author.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born 1883 in Prague, where he spent most of his life, died 1924.
        Author of <em></em><a href="TheTrial.html">TheTrial</a><em> (</em>Der Prozess<em>), "</em>TheTransformation" ("Die Verwandlung"), and more.
        Strange and wonderful stuff. Kafka directed that all his manuscripts be destroyed on his death, but fortunately they weren't.

        "The Transformation" may be better known in English as "TheMetamorphosis".

        I "discovered" Kafka due to a reference on the back of a <a href="FrankZappa.html">FrankZappa</a> MothersOfInvention album.

        <em>That would be </em>We're Only In It For the Money<em>, which recommended listeners read Kafka's "In the Penal Colony" before listening to the album. Note that this album came out in 1967, during Ronald Reagan's term as governor of California. The reading suggestion sums up Zappa's attitude toward authority (and Reagan).</em>
