JohnGlenn - pioneer in space, oldest person in space, Senator. <a href="LeonardoDaVinci.html">LeonardoDaVinci</a> accomplished quite a lot. It depends on circumstances, effort and luck, but people can do amazing things if given the chance. You should be realistic but still try to see what your boundaries are, and expand them as far as possible. Your greatest challenge is to motivate yourself.
