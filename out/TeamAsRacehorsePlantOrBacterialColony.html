        Team As Racehorse Plant Or Bacterial Colony
      </h1>
      <p>
        Is a well-functioning team more usefully thought of in analogy to a Racehorse, a Plant, or a Bacterial Colony?

        <a href="BillBarnett.html">BillBarnett</a> warns, "Milan Kundera got it right when he wrote 'A Metaphor is a dangerous thing...' " I like the racehorse analogy, although it suggests an unpleasant outcome should the team, say, break an ankle. You can't take cuttings from a well-formed team, but it can send out emissaries to instruct, infect, and surreptitiously convert other teams to it's practices. Kind of like a bacterial colony? Speaking of which, have you read _Global Brain_ by Howard Bloom? Lots of interesting things for us to learn from bacteria!
