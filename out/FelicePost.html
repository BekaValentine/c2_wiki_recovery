        Hi, I live in The Netherlands, Amsterdam. I'm 24 years old.

        <em>Welcome to Wiki. Are you interested in computer software?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Well actually, I got asked in work to look up this WIKI thing, first time I heard of it.
        But I need to make a paper of what it does, what it can be used for, references, which programs it uses, how many people can use it, how many bites, history.... etc.
        So, in that way I AM interested in computer software(?)

        Now I am going to try to make a new page in my homepage. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this is possible and I hope no-one will delete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        AjaxRulesPage
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        ok, bin there, done that.
        Uhm. now I want to delete the Ajax page, but it doesn't work, and I don't know where to put the word [delete]...
        so if someone will be so kind...
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>It's gone now - reducing the content to "delete" does work.</em><br/>
        <strong>That's strange, because when I click the ? above after </strong>AjaxRulesPage I go to the page again. But you say its deleted.<strong> </strong><br/>
        Is it only for me visible or something?<br/>

        just another test 
        <a href="http://www.bigballoon.nl/inhoudspaginaas/looneytunes/looney-karakters/looney-lola.html">http://www.bigballoon.nl/inhoudspaginaas/looneytunes/looney-karakters/looney-lola.html</a>
        damn, I can't get a picture to show here, only the link-> what am I doing wrong? I also tried with [ ] around the url. doens't do the trick either.
      </p>

        <dd>The above is a reference to a page, not to an image. An image reference will end with <strong>jpg</strong>, <strong>gif</strong>, <strong>png</strong>, or some other image format.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <em>I guess, you wanted to do something like</em>
        <img src="http://www.bigballoon.nl/inhoudspaginaas/looneytunes/looney-beeld/looney-karakters-blauw/lola2.giffff" />
        <em>To see what I mean, remove the trailing ffffs in the url. I added them, because linking the GIF whould violate the copyright (as much as I oppose it).</em>
