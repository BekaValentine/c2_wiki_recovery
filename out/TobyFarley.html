        He has been known to work in the <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a> (no hissing please - he takes it very seriously). It does not support <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> but by Gosh he still thinks <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a> qualifies as a real <a href="ObjectOrientedProgrammingLanguage.html">ObjectOrientedProgrammingLanguage</a>.

        His interests include writing readable maintainable code and <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. Despite his interest in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, he is pursuing something without so much Dogma. The <a href="CrystalClearMethodology.html">CrystalClearMethodology</a> may be more appropriate for his work place. Toby Farley has a serious case of <a href="SteveMcConnell.html">SteveMcConnell</a> envy.
