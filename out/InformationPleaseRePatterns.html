        Information Please Re Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        I read a few years ago that this wiki was started as a repository of programming patterns. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I always wondered what these are and I'd like to know more. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Can anyone explain to me two things: 
      </p>
      <p>
        a)What are programming patterns?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They are idiomatic and useful arrangements of program components or software architecture that appear again and again and again.  See </em><a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> and <a href="PatternIndex.html">PatternIndex</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        b)Why is it that the original patterns idea never took off?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, it did.</em>
      </p>
