        <em>Franck, could you be more specific? Are you asking about teaching children or adults? If children, what age?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FreshmansFirstLanguage.html">FreshmansFirstLanguage</a> claims "It's too late to learn one's first programming language in college", so we're talking about children.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And it's horking wrong. I actually really learnt to program, e.g. not copy BASIC text games off books in late high school - the usual Pascal seminary, and I forgot half everything about it after starting university. Started with C then, and I got hooked on to making ugly "elegant", and "powerful" [bah!] compound statements. And in my 2nd semester came Java, and got me cured. I can safely claim I now have a better grasp of the principles of good design and concise, easy-to-understand coding than my classmates that were chewing on Pascal and C for five years, and am the only one that doesn't get an attack of the vapours whenever OOP is mentioned. -- </em>DavidVallner<em></em>

        What difference does age make? If the best language varies with age, I would be interested in exactly how it does vary with age. -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a>

        Ideal features of first programming language:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Interactive: kids thrive on immediate feedback
        </li>
        <li>
           Free (so schools can give away a copy to each and every student, and run on a wide variety of old computers)
        </li>
        <li>
           Not too many picky syntax details that have to be exactly right, or other traps for the unwary
        </li>
        <li>
           A <a href="LittleLanguage.html">LittleLanguage</a>: the less syntax to learn the better
        </li>
        <li>
           Graphics (for the visually-oriented students and the "wow" factor)
        </li>
        <li>
           Embodies good principles, so there is less to unlearn later (excludes unstructured Basic)
        </li>
        <li>
           Kid proof sandbox so you can't crash the environment or get stuck in an infinite loop.
        </li>
        <li>
           Friendly error messages: getting an obscure error message on one's first program is one of the most common turn-offs
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Based on the above, I would recommend <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> (especially <a href="DrScheme.html">DrScheme</a>), <a href="LogoLanguage.html">LogoLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a> (if structured), and <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a>.

      <p>
        <strong>interactive</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediate feedback helps the learning process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not sure... It depends on what they are learning! Immediate feedback on a screen can make optional the imagination. I think child-programmer should be invited to imagine what will happen before it really happens. The feedback should be only for control purposes; learning by trial-error mechanism is good too, but should not be the only way</em>

      <p>
        Is there a list of "interactive" languages somewhere? "<a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>" lists some of them. But lots of languages are interactive without being considered a "scripting language".
      </p>
      <p>
        Some languages let you call a procedure from the command line (<a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>, <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>, <a href="MatLab.html">MatLab</a>, <a href="LogoLanguage.html">LogoLanguage</a>, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> ... what else? ...).
        This makes it much easier to immediately test out a procedure I just wrote.

      <p>
        <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           GOOD: Easy to learn (<em>hah!</em>), good modelling habits, syntax common to a lot of other programming languages. Also, references are easy to find, and the JDK is free. Used in American AdvancedPlacement tests. Standard graphics. Environments such as <a href="BlueJay.html">BlueJay</a> allow interactive testing.
        </li>
        <li>
           BAD: Doesn't give any sense of the underlying structure of the machine. students don`t allocate/deallocate memory, don't need to grasp the difference between passing to functions by value, by reference or by address. they don't need to differentiate between data structures and pointers to data structures. Not normally interactive.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           GOOD: Attention to detail and to algorithm, gives good understanding of the hardware. drives home the point that data and code are the same thing, simply placed in different memory locations. NASM is free.
        </li>
        <li>
           BAD: Goto statements are unavoidable. might give bad first impression (ie: OK to use all the time). high level could not really be taught at the same time. there is a lot of 'overhead' teaching that needs to be done before student can do interesting things. hard to grade assignments (TA's tend to hate it). Not interactive. No safety net.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Assembly was a lot cooler and easier to learn on the early micros like the </em><a href="AppleTwo.html">AppleTwo</a>. There's no monitor on a PC.<em></em>

           GOOD: I don't know, but it used to be the programming language of choice when it came to teaching programming concepts. Type-strict.
        </li>
        <li>
           BAD: it's not used that much anymore, and it doesn't have the magic that C has in term of syntax. Not interactive.

        </li>
        <li>
           BAD: It's too easy to write code that just crashes mysteriously, and can be <em>extremely</em> difficult to debug. Not interactive (<em>I've heard rumors of an interactive C, "ICC" ...</em>)

      </p>

        </li>
        <li>
           BAD: Unpopular. No safety net. Few good textbooks. Learning postfix doesn't carry to other languages.

For instance calculus - diff(a*x^i+b*x^j+c*x^k,x,Dx) which by the way has sat untranslated in <a href="PythonTranslator.html">PythonTranslator</a> for some months.

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
           BAD: None. :). <em>Whitespace is syntactically significant.</em> This is an advantage for teaching a consistent coding style. [You can teach consistent coding style even without [[And you can stay warm without using a sweater . . . .]]]

        I think students should learn one really high-level language (smalltalk, LISP, etc.) and one lower-level one (perhaps C/C++) in parallel. However, to get a job they will probably need Java or C#, which are kind of in the middle.

Now throw stones at me, but it's more concise than C / C++ any day, easier to learn than C#, and the Java tutorial has insofar provided me with 98% of the reference material I need for my college assignments. Plus the job demand is rather good, due to the bandwagon, and the familiar syntax makes for an easier transition for people that've already tampered with C, and thus indoctrinating with OOP is easier. If they haven't seen C, all the better, I postulate people find it easier to learn OOP without having seen procedural hacking before, as they'll try to see the connection to the real world, and not the connection to what they already know.

        <SILLY> I also postulate gay people understand OOP better, from a statistical sample of two people, which is me, and a friend that's the very opposite of a CompSci person - he managed to strike up an analogy of objects to Platonic Forms... </SILLY>

        If we're talking children, I wouldn't go for functional programming - I can't think of "problems" children would want to solve that are modelled well using axioma composition, or complex data structure manipulation.

        As for learning the low-level languages, your mileage may vary, but I'm in my second year of studies, and so far my courses on C never got close to the basic concepts of programming - I only went figure at what a compiler/linker is/does, and how to compile projects -without- the ancient console Borland IDE I have learnt to hate with a burning passion (GCC and GVim get my work done way faster), or Visual Studio 6.0 the school afforded by virtue of a bulk Academic Licence - all the way forgetting freshmen sort of lack the money to pay the still appalling sums of money Microsoft asks even for an academic licence, and don't even get me started of inducing the bad habit of using non-standard proprietary technology right off school.

        Same goes for assembly, yet again I've found more interesting information by myself than from lectures - e.g. LOOP is slow, etc. Also assembly, and languages that don't come with a platform and managed environments, have very specific and comparatively rare applications in today's programming, and for quite a large amount of students they become nothing but academic information.

        For Java, <a href="BlueJay.html">BlueJay</a> is an IDE specifically designed for learning (are there any such for any other languages that weren't designed originally for teaching purposes, or even at all?). It is fundamentally visual, you see all the classes in a project, and inheritance/composition relations displayed in a visual workspace. Also, there's no need to have a wrapper class for a main() method and I/O at all - you can instantiate any object, any time, and those instances also appear visually on a workbench, and you call their methods directly via a context menu, inspecting the results. It hardly gets more interactive than that, and you can teach/learn OOP concepts and programming fundamentals without having to digress into API / support platform calls for a single second.
