        Embrace Sql
      </h1>
      <p>
        Rather than converting back and forth between SQL and the app language, or twiddle with complicated wrapper/mappers that need dedicated experts; perhaps the industry should build an open-standard language that integrates well with it. PL/SQL and other vendor's competitors sort of do this, but they are highly proprietary, somewhat outdated, and do not have a dynamic/free-typing variation for those who enjoy loose typing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> (TOP) thinking, most of the complexity of an app is in tables and to a lessor extent the queries. Simplifying table usage and querying is more important than simplifying app code if TOP is done right, or if it's for a data-centric task. "Bloat-ified" query syntax (<a href="ExpressionApiComplaints.html">ExpressionApiComplaints</a>) gets in the way of this goal. I agree the repetitious parts of queries can be simplified via helper API's and tools, but don't try to bury entire queries behind goofy, <strong>unnatural</strong> API's.

      <p>
        (Note that I don't believe SQL is the ideal query language. I've even suggested an alternative, <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a>. However, SQL is here to stay for a good while so we might as well learn to work better with it.)

        Okay, what sort of integration are you talking about that can't be built as a DSL inside an existing dynamic language or statically typed functional language? If you're talking about more mainstream languages like <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a>, I would say the answer is that they do no worse at SQL integration than anything else that requires dynamic behavior. --<a href="JesseMillikan.html">JesseMillikan</a>

        <em>Off the top (no pun) of my head:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A type system that matches the DB's type system, perhaps adjusting to the vendor(s) involved. For example, many languages use floating point to represent decimal values, which can create problems. True decimals are not floating point.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Not every environment handles it well. (I frequently wish the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> datetime type matched the <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> datetime type.) However, modern languages have different design forces than just interacting with databases. Most languages <em>do</em> provide the ability to define your own types and use them accurately, and then it's the trouble of library maintainers to do so if they really need to.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Result sets automatically create variables. Perhaps have the option of "regular" variables or mapped variables. Perhaps something like:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        // mapped - error-handling not shown here<br/>
        QUERY TO MYMAP<br/>
        SELECT * FROM addresses WHERE houseID = 7<br/>
        END QUERY<br/>
        print("zipcode: " & MYMAP.zipcode)  <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // variables<br/>
        QUERY TO VARIABLES<br/>
        SELECT * FROM addresses WHERE houseID = 7<br/>
        END QUERY<br/>
        print("zipcode: " & zipcode)  <br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           (continued)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> and <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> could certainly do this, though it might require compile-time database access. Few of the languages without syntactic macros allow a single-token access to a changeable environment like this, but Ruby would. (The global environment is excluded for sanity.) I don't think it's of high value anyhow.

               Mainstream languages are unfriendly toward any close integration with another domain or tool. If the point is that mainstream languages suck at high-level programming, we all know.

               I'm not sure what is missing here. I work in <a href="AspDotNet.html">AspDotNet</a>, so I'm mostly either databinding (which is bogged down purely by <a href="AspDotNet.html">AspDotNet</a>) or occasionally looping over a set of entity objects, which is as simple as "foreach(Person p in people){..."

        <li>
           Borrow language idioms from SQL, similar to <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>'s "FOR" (same as WHERE) and "TO" clause used on many operations.

           Built-in table system with SQL for local processing.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Putting this in the language would drive the language and environment complexity up wildly. I'm also not sure what situations would call for this local processing where you wouldn't do it on the database server.

               <em>To borrow a Php idiom: "SELECT * FROM venders WHERE venderID = $vid". Here "$vid" is an application variable. Ideally, variables declared as a text type would automatically quote themselves when the conversion takes place. </em>

      <ul>

           Libraries that have commonly-needed operations such as table dump/displays (mostly for debugging, not production display), conversion/export utilities for to-and-from XML, delimited, etc., data dictionary extraction, creation of join clauses or other common or repetitious clauses using data dictionaries or table dictionaries.
          <ul>
            <li>
               I use a library with a lot of that stuff (LLBLGen pro). As for table dump/displays, I do most of my data-heavy work in the database before messing with the app side; that could be a result of working in an environment with no useful REPL.

               <em>But custom libraries result in a lack of standardization. Each shop reinvents their own and the developer has to learn a new set with its own oddities.</em>

            <li>
               Is that different outside of libraries for talking to databases?

            <li>
               <em>I don't understand the question. We want this new language to encourage a common way to perform typical DB-related tasks so that a developer who knows it can walk into a new shop that also uses this language and see the same operations and idioms rather than start over.</em>

           A parser that can optionally recognize and flag embedded SQL. This would also allow one to take inventory or do global substitutions more easily; SQL wouldn't have to be treated only as strings.
          <ul>
            <li>
               It is an annoyance to have that stuff spread out everywhere. I would want to have this right in the DBMS client, with better support for creating stored procedures, functions and views without "leaving the zone" to work in a poor environment. I think the weakness should be fixed at a level where all clients of the database benefit, not just users of one language or environment. (That does lead to a discussion about <a href="VendorLockIn.html">VendorLockIn</a>.) 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Perhaps </em><a href="DatabaseVendorLock.html">DatabaseVendorLock</a> is more appropriate. I generally disagree with the "scatter" complaints. SQL *is* a key app language, not something to hide a way in a dark corner.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               I don't think the trouble is that you have to do it one way or the other; the trouble is designing an environment that can really be built, used and supported. How, for instance, do you support (or not support) different SQL dialects if this support is built into the non-database IDE? That's why I would say take the simpler route - put SQL in a place where it can be realistically handled well.

        In <a href="DatabaseAbstractInterfaceDiscussion.html">DatabaseAbstractInterfaceDiscussion</a>, influenced from <a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a>, I've been kicking around a "section-based" syntax that may fit SQL well. Here's an example: -t
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>query</strong> name="qry", foo=7, bar=flip, zog="trag",<br/>
        flig="nab", grog=firb:<br/>
        SELECT * FROM sample<br/>
        WHERE X=47 AND Y=$thing<br/>
        <strong>noResult</strong>:<br/>
        PRINT "You see this if no rows returned"<br/>
        <strong>colHead</strong> auto=yes:   // column headings<br/>
        <strong>eachRow</strong> rowvar="r":<br/>
        PRINT "Name: " || name || ", Rank: " || qry.currow.rank  // short and long name<br/>
        // Alt: PRINT "Name: $name, Rank: ${qry.currow.rank}"<br/>
        // Alt2: PRINT "Name: $r.name, Rank: ${r.rank}"  (uses rowvar)<br/>
        // Note: Brackets in ${...} are optionally used to prevent <br/>
        //       ambiguity between var names and literals.<br/>
        <strong>footer</strong>:<br/>
        PRINT "End of list. Count: " || qry.rowCount<br/>
        <strong>error</strong> log=no:<br/>
        ? "Bleep happened: " || qry.errMsg   // ? is short for PRINT<br/>
        <strong>end query</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I would normally add spacing between sections, but this wiki has a space bug. ( <a href="http://www.mckenna3d.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6:space-bug&catid=5:2d&Itemid=3">http://www.mckenna3d.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6:space-bug&catid=5:2d&Itemid=3</a> )
      </p>
      <p>
        The order of the sections wouldn't matter such that "noResult" could be put at the bottom if we wanted. An "eachColumn" section is an optional idea to also consider so we can loop for each column within each row. We may also want an "eachHeadColumn".
      </p>
      <p>
        Query info and results would go into a "map tree" structure. Example:
      </p>
      <code>
        qry.text  // text of the query, usually sql<br/>
        qry.textExpanded  // sql with variable substitutions (if any)<br/>
        qry.rowcount  // number of result rows<br/>
        qry.errorMsg<br/>
        qry.1.columnA  // "columnA" on first row (see caveat)<br/>
        qry[1].columnA // same thing, longer format useful for variable-based map indexing.<br/>
        qry.currow.columnA // columnA of current row<br/>
        qry.dbType.columnA  // Database type of columnA (such as VARCHAR).<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that drivers/options that return cursor-based results (one row at a time) will not necessarily have position-indexable rows such that "qry.1.columnA" may not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realize that languages such as Ruby may be able to create a <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a> kind of like this, but it would probably either be punctuation-happy or produce cryptic error messages for many syntax errors. Hard-wired DSL syntax tends to (potentially) produce friendlier syntax or structural error messages, whereas a Ruby error message would require knowing Ruby's syntax to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that with enough programming you might be able to make Rudy give meaningful error messages, but you are essentially inventing an interpreter and doing almost as much work as <em>would</em> be done making an interpreter written in C, which improves portability and speed over Ruby.
