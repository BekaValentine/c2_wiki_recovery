        Why Program
      </h1>
      <p>
        Why do we program?
      </p>
      <p>
        I program in order to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          learn something new
        </li>
        <li>
          build something new
        </li>
        <li>
          get deeper insight into phenomena
        </li>
        <li>
          simply because it's fun to do!
        </li>
        <li>
          in order to MakeMoney
        </li>
        <li>
          to solve an imediate problem (solving matrices, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
          to create a new tool, to have new means for comminication with machines
        </li>
        <li>
          to avoid something else I have to be doing
        </li>
        <li>
          to build a tool to help me with a problem I have been stymied by
        </li>
        <li>
          to debug the tool I built last time I had the above problem (with women ;-)
        </li>
        <li>
           for the aesthetic ecstasy
        </li>
        <li>
           because programs are the only prayers that actually work.
        </li>
        <li>
           as a CognitiveExperiment
        </li>
        <li>
          to ImpressWomen
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        that's it for now...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How well is it working on the women?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, not <em>too</em> well! Today, I tested this in our SchoolCafeteria, using the infamous pickup line,
        "Hey, you have a lovely smile. Wanna come see my new <a href="SuperCollider.html">SuperCollider</a> routine?" From the reaction, I have a feeling it could work out better leaving only the first sentence there.
