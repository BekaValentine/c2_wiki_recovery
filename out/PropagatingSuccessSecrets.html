        Propagating Success Secrets
      </h1>
      <p>
        PatRobertson, the DalaiLama, <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a>, StevenHawking, TigerWoods, and <a href="GeorgeBush.html">GeorgeBush</a> were sitting at a bar.  They were talking about what it takes to become "number one" in a field of human endeavor.  They decided to write down and pass on a collection of their secrets of success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accustomed to being the best, they decided to produce the most effective AND most widely propagated collection of success secrets in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How do we do this?", they asked each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Easy", they decided.  "Being experts ourselves, we'll find a fellow expert to help us."
      </p>
      <p>
        "An expert in which field?", they then asked themselves.  "What profession knows the most about capturing and conveying information to the masses?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well", they decided, "probably each individual profession knows the most about capturing and conveying its own information".  So now they asked themselves "Which profession deals in, or studies, or manipulates success secrets? Which profession considers success secrets part of its domain of knowledge?  We'll ask an expert in that field!"
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Obviously the fashion industry.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Or perhaps the banking industry.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>self-help</strong> industry.
        </li>
        <li>
          The joke-writing industry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Religion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Politicians
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Where's the punchline?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This story started on a page about memes.  It is a feeble attempt to investigate the question "Who amongst us (humankind, not wiki-posters) are experts at idea propagation?"  You get to fill in your own punchline.</em>
