        Herb Caen
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="HerbCaen.html">HerbCaen</a> was a gossip columnist for the <a href="SanFrancisco.html">SanFrancisco</a> Chronicle.  
      </p>
      <p>
        He coined many new words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of his columns were collections of scraps of stories -- often just one sentence each.  Each column had scores of items.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the rest of his columns were lengthy reminiscences about San Francisco's history.
