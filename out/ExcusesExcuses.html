        Excuses Excuses

        I'm not getting anything done. I could try to tell you why, but it would just be a list of excuses.
      </p>
      <p>
        People say "Excuses, Excuses" when all they hear is excuses. And for good reason!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a lesson that I'm trying to teach myself: <em>Never</em> think about <strong>why you can't</strong> do something. You'll always be able to find reasons if you look for them. You'll drive yourself nuts trying to address them all and get around them. <a href="OrsonScottCard.html">OrsonScottCard</a> invented a character in one of the Ender novels who at one time had to do a lot of complicated gyrations just to get through a doorway. To avoid putting yourself in the same state, don't attempt to answer or rebut your own excuses. Ignore them. Think instead about <strong>how you can</strong> do something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next thing you know you'll be doing it.

        This is usually true, but sometimes a hard problem can completely stump you.  I sometimes find it helpful to list all the excuses and analyze each one in detail.  The flawed excuse is the answer to the problem.
