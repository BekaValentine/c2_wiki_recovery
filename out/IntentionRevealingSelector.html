        <em>I think the pattern name is a misnomer.  The pattern, as given above, is good.  But "what the method does" is not necessarily its "intent", but its "essence" (for a lack of better word).  The </em>what<em> must not be confused with the </em>why<em>.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor should the <em>why</em> complicate understanding of operations within the method. The <em>why</em> can often be transient or abstract, changing with time or in application. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps such things as overriding and overloading can be useful in illustrating the difference.
