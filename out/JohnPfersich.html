        Describe <a href="JohnPfersich.html">JohnPfersich</a> here.

        Not too much to describe.

           I've been programming since the early seventies. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Said to be a ranting old fool by some of his co-workers.

        I use Smalltalk frequently. I use <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> and Squeak quite regularly (multiple times in a week). Been a smalltalker since the eighties. It's still the best language to use, IMHO. I just wish I could work professionally on more Smalltalk projects. A percentage approaching 100 sounds good to me.

        How to do Software Engineering. Most of the people that I work with know how to program at least fairly well, but most of them do not know the first thing about engineering software. 
      </p>
      <p>
        (Well, I got a programmer that was a definite exception to the [know how to program at least fairly well] attribute. He had developed an object in Java called MiscFunctions. I guess one should never expect much from a VB scripter.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The basics are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Having a design to code against.
        </li>
        <li>
           Doing more than cursory testing.
        </li>
        <li>
           Documenting the work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The worse part is that trying to teach them software engineering is like pulling teeth from an alligator. They don't want to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S. I'll have to expand upon this subject in the future.
