           <a href="WikiSlow.html">WikiSlow</a> advocates to spend more time in understanding the edits of others than trying hard to make others understand your edits.

           EditSlow is promoted by asking the other <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a> why they did certain edit in certain way before one changes this edit and rather communicate about one edit on the <a href="UserPage.html">UserPage</a> of the editor in question than communicating by editing in the article. This requires edits not to be anonymous. It is not feasible to discuss with an IpEditor.
