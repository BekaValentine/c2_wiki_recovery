        <strong>What happens when "rules" don't work?</strong> Our group of exploration professionals including 4 geologists, 1 cook, 1 helicopter pilot, 
        and the essential "chopper mechanic" were about to finish a 4-week spell in the Alaskan bush. The day in question was the last day 
        before a scheduled 3-day break and the team was geared to completing the last tasks "on time and within budget." We really didn't 
        care so much about the time and budget issues, but we were keenly looking forward to a hot shower and/or bath, a couple nights sleep in a real bed and the "forgotten" pleasure of sitting in a chair, not perching on the edge of a large wooden supply box. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While collecting soil samples some 60-km from our field camp base I was "investigated" by an adult Grizzly Bear. 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>RULE 1:</strong> Make a strange noise (use your referee whistle) to scare away the bear. Bears don't like strange noises. </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        I blew on my referee's whistle several times and sure enough the bear didn't charge. The bear simply continued to stare at me as if nothing was wrong. 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>RULE 2:</strong> Do not run away from a bear. If you try to run away, the bear will likely chase you down for a closer look. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>RULE 3:</strong> Bears are territorial and when alarmed will move into the centre of their territory. Walk 300 paces directly away from the bear and call in the helicopter. </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        I walked a very straight line away from the bear. However the "walk away" plan didn't work because the bear didn't abide by the rule. Instead it followed me slowly, but steadily across the hillside. 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>RULE 4:</strong> Don't fight with a bear but lie still and hope he/she goes away. </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        When we met up again the bear came in for a closer inspection. Our "discussion" lasted another 10 - 15 minutes during which time I was sniffed, snorted on, taste-tested, pawed and clawed. I never gave a moment's thought to fighting as the fear factor had produced both mental and physical "paralysis." The bear finally departed when it spotted the field crew's helicopter circling above us at treetop level. My injuries were not life threatening although a bit of corrective surgery was required.

        As fertile analogies for Wiki or XP customer interaction go, this one could be great. --<a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        So it may be that "playing 'possum" and sticking one's head in the sand are not evolutionary dead ends.

        What bothers me is that the rules had clearly not been tested sufficiently. Remind me, how do you regression test with a bear? [statistical testing with standard deviation measurements. we're looking for volunteers!] -- Anonymous 
        Why do you say that? He survived. Had he run away, fought back etc it might have been worse. (Also I think the "don't fight" rule imples some experience of the other rules failing.) -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        Yikes! I'm glad that the risks in software are not as great as Alaskan Grizzly Bears.

Ron was the customer and Robert was the developer. When Ron dug into Robert, asking if he could decrease his estimates, Robert just stood there and didn't say a word. After a few moments of silence, Ron moved on to another question. Kent yelled out "perfect answer!" and we all had a good laugh. -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

        You bet it's the right answer. I've had some stupid people shout their heads off. And I was only trying to quieten them down. -- <a href="AlaskanGrizzlyBear.html">AlaskanGrizzlyBear</a>

        More like a WikiCuffOnTheHead. In my dealings with humans that has dealt with the mind-body problem pretty neatly. -- agb

        By popular request then, I've recovered the page as it seems the first <strong><em>wiki aware bear</em></strong> and others did 'enjoy' the read. --<a href="DaveSteffe.html">DaveSteffe</a>

        Might this page be considerably shortened by replacing the <a href="DaveSteffe.html">DaveSteffe</a> action list with the use of a .50 AE Desert Eagle or similar tool?

        Well, it's possibly the first <strong><em>wiki-aware grizzly bear</em></strong>, but the mascot for <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> is also a bear, named TinyTed.  However, he's not capable of applying <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> to a programmer.
