        Np Complete

        <em>The class of all problems that can be solved in polynomial time on a non-deterministic computer (ie. infinite # of processors running infinite # of threads and taking no time to spawn a thread), but merely exponential or worse time on a deterministic computer (ie. all the ones you have handy).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not quite...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rigorous technical definitions:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>P</strong> is the set of all problems that can be solved in polynomial time on a (deterministic) <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NP</strong> is the set of all problems that can be solved in polynomial time on a nondeterministic Turing machine (NDTM). Because deterministic TMs are a subset of NDTMs, P is a subset of NP.
      </p>
      <p>
        A problem is <strong>NP-hard</strong> if an algorithm to solve it in (deterministic) polynomial time would make it possible to solve all NP problems in polynomial time. NP-complete is the class of problems which are both NP-hard and themselves members of NP.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Okay ... so you're saying there are, at least conceptually, problems that are NP-Hard but not NP-complete? What kinds of beasts are they?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           NP-hard problems are <em>at least as hard</em> as NP-complete ones. Consider this problem: <strong>solve <em>every</em> minimal graph-coloring problem of size n.</strong> Clearly, solving this problem in polynomial time would also allow one to solve the <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> minimal graph-coloring problem (and thus all NP problems) polynomially. However, the problem given is not itself a member of NP (it is too hard), so it is NP-hard but not <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           The distinction can be made (even?) clearer by pointing out that the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> is NP-hard.  Certainly it's the case that if you have a program that can solve the HP in polynomial time, you can solve any NP-complete problem in polynomial time.  Of course, you could also grow wings and build a perpetual motion machine if you had such a program. --<a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        NP-complete problems have the property that any one of them can be reduced to any other in polynomial time. Thus if I can solve <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> problem A in polynomial time, I can also solve <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> problem B in polynomial time by first converting it to an equivalent instance of problem A in polynomial time, and then solving that problem. (Also, to prove that a problem is NP-complete, it is sufficient to show that it is polynomial-time equivalent to some other NP-complete problem.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, any NP-complete problem can be solved by a TM in time no worse than O(2^p(n)), where p(n) is the number of steps used by an NDTM for the problem. This is possible by just simulating the NDTM.
      </p>
      <p>
        An equivalent definition of NP is the set of problems for which a proposed solution can be verified or rejected in (deterministic) polynomial time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I may be remembering this wrong, but I thought that a condition for NP completeness is that there exists a validation function which can determine in polynomial time that a given solution is a valid solution for an NPComplete problem. No? -- </em><a href="AnthonyLander.html">AnthonyLander</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a validation function that runs in polynomial time is what the sentence above your question is talking about. For NP completeness, every other problem in NP must also be reducible (in polynomial time) to an instance of your problem.  So yes, having a validation function is a necessary condition for NP completeness, but it is not sufficient. For example, the problem of factorization has such a validation function, but it's most likely not NP complete.

        <em>So far no one's proved this set has any members, but popular opinion is it sure seems to have a slew.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, there are quite a lot...
      </p>
      <p>
        The real open problem is whether P == NP. That is, can all NP problems be solved in polynomial time? A single polynomial algorithm for <strong>any</strong> <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> problem would show that P is equal to NP. It seems very possible that no such algorithm exists (many modern ciphers actually rely on P != NP for their security), but no one has proven or disproven this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Wouldn't that be</em>
        all
        <em>modern ciphers?  They're implementable in a smallish amount of hardware.  Reduce to satisfiability. (Are you sure you don't mean all public key algorithms? (Either reducing a number to prime factors, or inverse logs in a discrete field (not sure about the last one, something akin is Used in </em>ElGamal))
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many known NP-complete problems. The first problem proven to be NP-complete was the satisfiability problem, which asks whether a statement in boolean logic can be made true by some combination of values for its variables. Since this was proved, a large number of other problems have been shown to be NP-complete, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Three-Satisfiability (satisfiability restricted to formulas in conjunctive normal form with three variables per clause)

           Integer linear programming
        </li>

        <a href="QuantumComputer.html">QuantumComputer</a>s have a very restricted form of nondeterminism, but it doesn't have anything to do with the number of qubits.  The problem is one of observability: when you look at a quantum register which is in a superposition of states, you only get one of those states, and you destroy the superposition in the process. Quantum computers have not been shown to be able to solve any <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> problem in polynomial time. They could be used to factor integers in polynomial time, but factorization is not known to be <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they <em>are</em> ever shown to solve <em>any one</em> <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> problem in polynomial time however, they could be used to solve <em>any</em> <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> problem:  any <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> problem could be reduced to the solvable problem in polynomial time, and then solved.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <a href="RogerPenrose.html">RogerPenrose</a>'s conjecture about the reduction of the quantum state is correct, then that would mean that there's a practical upper limit on the number of qubits one can have.

        Computer scientists will sometimes use "X-complete" to denote a problem whose solution would imply solution of all problems in some domain or class X.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: some researchers say that natural language processing is an "<a href="AiComplete.html">AiComplete</a>" problem. That is, it will be solved (in their estimation) if and only if the entire problem of strong AI is solved.  [Can someone please suggest a good reference on this view?  Thank you.

        Whatever the agreed upon solution for P=NP is, if you can find it there is a $1Million dollar prize being offered (one of the Millennium Prizes - see <a href="http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/baez2000problems.html).">http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/baez2000problems.html).</a>

        When confonted with some tedious programming problem, I will often dub it NpAnnoying. Sadly, solving it does not solve all such problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's because you got the analogy around backwards. If it is in the class of 'annoying' problems, it should be an Na problem. If it reduces to all others in a (subclass) of Na, it will be Na-complete. The holy grail is then to show how to solve an Na-complete problem in a reasonable amount of time, then automate it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But NpAnnoying is funnier. If we're serious about it though, NaComplete doesn't really say it either. <a href="NpHard.html">NpHard</a> or <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> (or harder still, ExpTimeComplete <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXPTIME-complete)">http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXPTIME-complete)</a> are all sets of problems of a given complexity. How can we classify problems by annoyingness? It seems that certain annoying problems (e.g. text parsing) cease to be annoying or become much less annoying in a BetterProgrammingLanguage. Would the <a href="IdealProgrammingLanguage.html">IdealProgrammingLanguage</a> make all annoying problems easy, or are some problems (e.g. <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a>) intractably annoying? <em>Not to belabour the point more than it has been (did you really think I needed an outline of what Np is? interesting); anyway if you think about it a bit more you will realise  you  can't define Na-complete without a rigorous definition of annoying (Although you might get away with Na). Anyway, it is stretching a bad analogy too far... but I find N-annoying "more" amusing (not very) than the cognitive dissonance in </em>NpAnnoying (what's the p for). YMM-obviously-V.<em></em>

        P == NP since around 1965, and will continue to be equal for quite a while (<a href="EndOfMooresLaw.html">EndOfMooresLaw</a>).
