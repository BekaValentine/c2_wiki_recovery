        Serious Versus Scripting Languages
      </h1>
      <p>
        Why do people accept <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a>, <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>, <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and now <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> as <em>serious</em> commercial programming languages? What makes people call <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> and <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> <em>scripting</em> languages? Where do <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, DOS command language or <a href="MatLab.html">MatLab</a> fit into this? Or HTML and XML?
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggested what I considered a thought-provoking and helpful definition of the difference in <a href="FutureOfJava.html">FutureOfJava</a>. It is also obviously wrong. Any better ideas? -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sure. For a start, try </em><a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>. There's no good reason to build systems in the "serious" languages any more. Build your system in a soft language, profile it, then replace the bottlenecks with "serious" snippets. The result is something that is vastly more flexible and maintainable, but which performs exactly the same.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>"serious" just means "more work". A program can be written in less time, that does the same stuff, in a scripting language. Machine Code is the ultimate "serious" language.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Serious languages take more work to get something simple done. Compare the code to get a message out of a "scripting" language vs the code to get a message out of a "serious" language. Just off the top of my head, it seems like all the "scripting" languages I can think of just need one line of code to get a message out, but the "serious" languages seem to require 4 more lines of incantations. I know getting a message out is a trivial example, but I think it's true for many larger tasks as well (classes in Perl being the glaring note against this in my mind).
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe people consider things "serious" when it takes more work to do something.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's truth in that, and isn't it even this particular something that's the main point? Scripting languages (as distinguished from non-scripting languages, rather than "serious" ones) are languages where the file system, I/O streams, and command-line arguments are directly available to the programmer, using features in the base language. The price paid for this historically has included difficulty in describing and using new data structures or control flow mechanisms. That price need no longer be paid.
      </p>

        <em>scripting languages are glue</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely the point of a scripting language is that it is intended to provide either an easy mechanism for gluing together other pieces, or a mechanism for extending something more substantial? They're not supposed to make up the body of the system. Of course, things get out of hand (or people see sense, depending on your view) and folks build entire systems out of Perl or Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've built large (hundreds of KLOC) "serious language" systems for over a decade, so I think I know where you're coming from, but I believe you're missing the point. </em><a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a> is just good engineering practice. I don't think anyone much cares what is "supposed" to make up the body of a system, except for those technical managers who believe what they read in the trade journals.<em> -- </em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        <em>interpreted vs compiled ... ultimately an irrelevant tangent</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What is a <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>? I'd have said a script language is usually a language whereby the <strong>source</strong> is directly interpreted, rather than compiled. Thus Java and VB aren't, but Perl and an [VB|J]script are. I don't know enough abut Python. Does it go through a compiler, or do you just run the source? -- <a href="AlanFrancis.html">AlanFrancis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, Python and Perl compile to bytecodes the first time you run them. Python's bytecodes persist and are re-used after they're compiled, so that puts it in pretty much the same camp as Java and VBA. Actually there is a very nice beast at </em><a href="http://www.jpython.org">http://www.jpython.org</a> that will compile python into java bytecodes. I think it's fair to say Perl is a bit more interpretive - it compiles once every time you run.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        sh, csh, and friends are fully interpreted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>bash and its friends (let's not talk about csh, that makes trouble) are also in the windows world. Check out </em><a href="CygWin.html">CygWin</a>. For the use prescribed in <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a> it's fair to say perl and python scale better. For simple tasks I still turn to sed/grep/find/*sh instead. The language in the bash world that is dead for me now is awk; perl exists.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But this is moving off our subject. Java, and before it C++, and before it C, fill the same serious-language niche. The real question is, are there any advantages to building large systems in these languages that the scripting languages can't match?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people would argue that you need <a href="InterfaceEnforcement.html">InterfaceEnforcement</a> to build large systems, and that scripting languages don't support that by definition. I feel pretty skeptical about that argument these days. -- <a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that Tcl has had byte compilation since 8.0 (first released in 1997, current release is 8.3). Prior to 8.0 it was fully interpreted, but now scripts are compiled on the fly (a procedure is compiled into persistent bytecode upon the first call). -- Jeffrey Hobbs

        <strong>no source is a <em>feature</em> </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In my work, one of the features of a <em>serious</em> language was that the customer did not get the source, and therefore could not alter the source to create a nonstandard, unauthorized version. From a support stance, this is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>, because the customer <strong>never</strong> tells you that the code has been modified until <strong>after</strong> you've spent 3 days looking for the bug that was introduced. -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           We digitally sign all files that are left with the customer. Are you honestly telling me that people leave behind source files for scripting languages and have no way of checking whether they've been changed?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From the <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> mailing list one can conclude that hidden source code is a commonly requested feature. Maybe scripting language creators should take this into account from the start?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If your customer changes the code, causes a bug, and requests support without telling you that the code has been changed, your choice of language is not really the problem you need to address.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You cannot predict in advance that a client may change your code, cause a bug and try to get support pretending they "didn't do anything". And even if you could, you would be throwing away 90% of your business refusing customers who might do that. What exactly problem do you think needs to be addressed if not choice of language?
      </p>
      <p>
        [What about customers who hex-edit or third-party patch your application? (Stupid) People use no-cd cracks on pirated games and still expect support. The barrier is slightly higher if it's a compiled application than if it's a bunch of text files, that's all. But there's even workarounds for this in many scripting languages, like py2exe for python and similar packagers. That gets you at least as much security as Java has. I think the problem is that if you're paranoid about this sort of thing you need either need to take active steps to solve it (which apply equally to any type of language), such as digital signatures and/or encryption, or you need to take a step back and consider why you're so paranoid, if it's justified, and what you can do about your customer relationship to solve it. If you write your support contracts properly, and are up front with your customers, the very worst case is that you'll lose a some time and charge them a bunch of money.]

        <em>The points here are valid. Nevertheless I'd like to share the converse (</em><a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>): vendors who obfuscate their code in an effort to hinder analysis and drive up delivery and maintenance costs for customers. I work for a subsidiary of a large corporation.  In my shop we have Engineers, Computer Scientists and others with the skills that allow us to do our own development - in fact we are set up like a 'mini' IT department to support the operational side of our business. Because we are small, we also engage vendors for some projects. We have found many of our vendors incompetent in various areas including - obfuscating open source versions of various languages and LDAP - ostensibly to create 'proprietary' applications, which turn out to be nothing more than wrappers over renamed libraries (when we determined this little subterfuge, we diff'd their libraries against the originals and found minimal changes - mostly attribution changes - they couldn't simply inherit and extend existing libraries - probably fearful that we would see how simple the 'difficult/complex' application solution they were hawking really was, and not justifiable of the outrageous price tag).  Vendors also used extraneous and overbloated libraries and frameworks they did not fully understand, to build applications that did not scale as advertised - and required refactoring and rewriting by us (e.g. instantiating java objects in endless loop - breaking garbage collection and causing virtual memory leak when memory usage hit high water mark; not noticeable with small traffic volumes, very noticeable with heavy traffic volumes. Implemented in a Perl script that now gets the job done, and is capable of being maintained and extended easily). Without access to source code, we would not have been able to identify these issues. Another tactic that is more difficult to deal with is binary frameworks written in ancient languages (from 'strings' we can determine that we are dealing with a framework implemented in pascal, and another in a defunct Sun tool that is no longer in production).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In an effort to fend off these threats (to call BS when it is due) we now require vendors to provide source code - for which we take ownership - for all purpose built applications in our system. In my experience some of the biggest names in the enterprise software consulting business hire a mixed bag of developers that more often than not, are a detriment - particularly if you have in house capabilities - given the patience (to wait for existing schedules to clear), or will (to change the work priorities) to make it happen without flushing large amounts of cash down the drain.</em> -- <a href="AnonymousCoward.html">AnonymousCoward</a>  - I hope this provides another viewpoint that shows this issue does not have a simple black or white answer. My gut reaction is companies that do not have knowledgeable technical staff are at the mercy of unscrupulous consulting companies at worse, and suffer with incomplete or malfunctioning applications at best. I have yet to see consulting firms specialize in iterative development without a hefty price tag. I think I've come to the conclusion that I am in the wrong line of work...

        <em>make easy things harder and hard things easier</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        IMHO, serious languages, relative to scripting languages, make easy things harder and hard things easier. Perl is famous for its one-liners; there are no one-liners in java (typically, you've got at least three lines - package, class signature, method signature - before you even get going). On the other hand, I can't imagine writing anything big in Perl - but I don't know Perl very well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can't see why the features that make serious languages serious (namespaces, encapsulation, etc) couldn't be added to Perl without taking away the ability to write one-liners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps it's not what the language lets you do that matters, but what it <em>doesn't</em> let you do. Serious languages are more restrictive. <em>See </em><a href="BondageAndDisciplineLanguage.html">BondageAndDisciplineLanguage</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        WADR, that's kind of missing the point. If we are talking Perl, OK. Perl has namespaces; I can't imagine CPAN working without them. Perl supports both functional and object-oriented abstraction, even if one could quite justifiably argue that its OO system is a kludge. Python and Ruby support features of orthogonality, maintainability, etc. even better, in many respects. In Ruby, it is true that you can finagle with a class at any time, such that private members become public, and in C++ you can just pull a cast. But in Java, private <strong>means</strong> private. So I think this distinction of 'scripting' vs 'serious', at least in this case, is meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the difference between dynamic and static typing is a bigger and more meaningful issue. I don't really think that static typing buys much in terms of reliability, but there are obvious speed advantages - important for something as 'serious' as a kernel. <a href="LushLanguage.html">LushLanguage</a> mixes both approaches, and, if I'm not mistaken, so can <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>. Given that Lush can compile to optimized machine code and incorporate C code, there is no reason one could not write a kernel in the language!

        Does any flavor of SQL (PL/SQL for example) count as a "serious" language by the definitions discussed here?
      </p>
      <p>
        Regular SQL isn't a programming language, so the serious/scripting distinction doesn't apply to it (any more than it does, to, say, XML). PL/SQL is basically SQL with Ada, so it's serious.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is PL/SQL </em><a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any dialect of PL/SQL that supports unbounded looping is trivially <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>. Create a two-column table where each row corresponds to a cell of the <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>'s tape, using one column for a sequential ID and the other for the cell's contents. Encode the internal state machine as a big CASE...WHEN expression. Loop until the state machine says to halt, doing SELECTs and UPDATEs on the tape as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plain old <a href="StructuredQueryLanguage.html">StructuredQueryLanguage</a>, on the other hand, is definitely not Turing-complete. The reason is that the same sequence of statements will always execute in the same order; that means that at any point in the sequence, quantities like the total number of rows in all of the tables are finitely bounded. Even a statement of the form "INSERT INTO table SELECT ..." has an upper limit on how many rows it can insert, and therefore how many computations it can carry out.

        I have named Python and Ruby '<a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>s' before, and people have frowned me upon for it. But lately I've thought of a reason why Python and Ruby, (or other non-typed 'scripting' languages for that matter) can make life harder in the long run. Imagine building a class Matrix. Seeing you don't have to specify parameter types in method definitions you can't overload functions. But take, for example, the operation '*'. This is a completely different algorithm for multiplying with a float or integer, or for multiplying with another Matrix. This means that we'll have to revert to such ugly practices like:
      </p>
      <code>
        if param.is_a?(Matrix)<br/>

        Isn't one of the clues about what makes a language a scripting language in the name. 'Script' means a bit of text. Serious language have their roots in languages designed for engineers to manipulate numbers with and they tend to be good at that, but lousy at handling text. Scripting languages are good at handling text and that's what most of non-engineering computing is all about which is why scripting languages are so easy to use. They're fit for purpose. Of course, numbers are the serious hard facts, text is just the soft stuff round the outside. -- <a href="StephenHutchinson.html">StephenHutchinson</a>

        Builtin numerical support is arguably better in Ruby and others than it is in, say, C, at least feature-wise. Ruby features standard support for matrices and bignums, for instance. The only difference is speed. If one were to introduce mathematicians who knew nothing significant about programming to a programming environment, odds are they would quickly lean towards something robust and interactive. (I know a few who did end up going that way.) Python, Lisp, and Ruby all come to mind immediately.

        <em>This is a holy war. It is irrelevant what language you use, provided it is the most efficient means of accomplishing your project. By that I mean you know it well enough and presumably have automated all of the drudge parts of it out with well crafted tools (ideally created by you and your team - and reused from project to project). I measure efficiency based on several criteria: a) can I create a prototype quickly? b) can I refactor the application quickly as the project evolves? c) can I embed and extract the documentation from the code itself? d) is the language hardened (not brittle)? e) is the language easy to recall as I compose, or am I constantly referring to reference material? f) does the language avoid </em><a href="BondageAndDisciplineLanguage.html">BondageAndDisciplineLanguage</a> problems? g) can I easily maintain and extend the application after my customers begin using it?<em></em>

        <strong>which actually works best in the field?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When I worked for <mature, large, hospitality-related corp> we had apps of three classes: those we used internally to do cool, ad hoc stuff, those we shipped as binaries to clients, and those we made available as server-side scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The local in-house stuff was about evenly divided between "serious" (compiled) languages and "scripting" (shell, perl, awk, etc) languages. The coolest stuff was often a short script or set of scripts that did magic things. The customers never got to see these.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stuff that shipped as binaries was often written from a scripted model of something from our ad hoc apps stable. It got all kinds of rigor and formality, went through the ReleaseEngineer and QA to customer testing and acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The server-side scripts that we made available on internet and intranets were less rigorously tested.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stuff that gave us the least trouble was the in-house ad hoc scripted stuff. The most trouble came from the formally released stuff.

        If you work in C, you ultimately get an executable file that you can just give to users. If you work in Python, you don't - you have to get your customers to install a python runtime, and you have to figure out some way of running the thing.

        VB doesn't really require installation, as Windows comes with the necessary stuff installed, and the system knows how to run it. Java's an interesting example - in fact, java <em>didn't</em> get deployed widely until there were easy-to-use (and redistributable) JREs, executable JARs and so on.

        distutils can be used to create an installer for C and C++ extensions to Python. py2exe can be used to make "executable JAR" equivalents. The Python interpreter itself qualifies IMHO as an "easy-to-use (and redistributable) JRE" equivalent; the Windows version is available as a straightforward installer, and thereafter, Python scripts are double-click-to-execute. You can't drag to them, which I find somewhat annoying - however, I've worked around that with an additional Python script and a batch file. (The batch file reads its own name and tells the interface script what script to call and what that script should do; the interface script then dynamically imports the needed script and feeds to it the files that were originally dragged onto the batch file.) -- <a href="KarlKnechtel.html">KarlKnechtel</a>

        The claim is made above that C developers get to have, at the end of the development process, a stand-alone executable that they can just give to end users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is inarguably true in some cases, particularly for small utility programs. But the fact is that a C application of any volume will have scads of dependencies to external resources, including DLLs (see <a href="DllHell.html">DllHell</a>), configuration files, databases, images, etc., etc., etc. For this reason, C developers more often than not need to give their end users a self-extracting executable with an installation program. Installation programs can and do handle the task of transparently installing interpreters for scripting languages along with the application program. (There's something to be said about <a href="GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a> here, but I'm not sure what it is).

        I'm not sure there <strong>is</strong> a distinction between "scripting" and "serious" anymore. I've worked with C interpreters and lisp compilers and all sorts of weirdness. I maintain a simple categorization in my head:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A "scripting" language lets me say what I want done, but not how. 90% of the time, this is incredibly useful.
        </li>
        <li>
           A "serious" language forces me to say how I want things done, and the what must be divined from the sum. When you're working very close to the metal, say in the operating system, this is a big win. When you're not, it's very painful.

        People have already mentioned <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>, and this is really where it's at. People get attached to their favorite tools and may be slow to embrace others, and thusly they try and fit square pegs into round holes. Even the rabid Lisp-Lover, <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a>, has admitted to using C in his work. Probably, because it was the best tool for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did he do that? Doesn't he know there are a number of Lisp/Scheme dialects that translate into C code, hence machine code? I really don't see what's so special about C, because even C is meaningless to a computer. There is exactly one programming language: machine language. Everything else is fluff.

          C maps pretty well to most machine architectures allowing pretty efficient optimizing - while C obviously is automatically translated to machine code and lisp can be automatically translated to C the process is usually less efficient (in terms of the outputed code) then a human doing it so this isn't always an option - the rest of the stuff i couldn't possibly comment on, other than to direct you to <a href="EasternWuss.html">EasternWuss</a> ;)

Granted, there will probably be some piddling differences between the Lush-generated code and the hand-generated C code in some cases, but, as they say: after a certain number of decimal places, nobody gives a damn. Scheme, for instance, has proven that it <strong>is</strong> possible for something like tail recursion to be optimized to a goto, with some consideration on the programmer's part.

        It may depend on the task at hand. Scripting languages are effective if a business has to be quick and nimble. Compiled languages tend to be a better choice for expensive critical function systems such as life support and bank calculations. The latter projects are prepared to absorb the extra cost of development in order to have a more robust product. I like scripting languages, but would not want to use them for medical equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compiled languages can catch more problems up front, but at the expense of more coding and slower testing cycles. It could be argued that the quicker turn-around of scripting languages gives one more time to develop unit tests. That may be true, but thorough unit testing has not been accepted into many organizations. Plus, in scripting languages there may be more to test. In a compiled language typically you don't have to check to make sure a parameter is a number instead of a string or mal-formed number, for example. The compiler enforces that up front. (The upside is that the scripting language is not verbosified by type declarations, reading more like pseudo-code.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The rule of thumb is that if <strong>getting sued</strong> is a bigger fear than keeping on budget and/or keeping up with change, then go with compiled. This may be what they mean by "serious". However, the implication that scripting is for "amateurs" is misleading.

        -- top
      </p>
      <p>
        "Getting sued" and "compiled" are orthogonal. "Getting sued" instead correlates with strict development processes and "compiled" correlates with performance requirements, regardless of implementation language chosen. Thus, even though you might implement higher levels in a scripting language, you will also have created and reviewed in detail the requirements, design documents, and unit tests for that code, and the code itself would be under the same strict change management as everything else in the project. Scripting languages would be a great choice for the non-performance critical layers because whole classes of bugs go away (memory management, for example) and the code density is higher, resulting in less code to review and fewer places for bugs to hide. -- <a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Oh my, but "memory management errors" and "compiled" are also orthogonal. Also, would you consider Lisp a scripting language? I don't think so. But it isn't (necessarily) compiled and it's still not used for throwaway scripts. It also has a higher code density than most scripting languages. Hell, Ian, the world doesn't consist of C and Perl only!</em>

        I was only disputing that <em>Compiled languages tend to be a better choice for expensive critical function systems such as life support and bank calculations.</em> Language is not the issue, process is.

        Shouldn't this be an easy distinction? ScriptingLanguages emphasize quickly writing one-off programs; serious languages emphasize writing long-lived, maintainable, fast-running programs. That makes C the classic serious language and Sh the classic scripting language. Java is obviously serious, VBA is obviously scripting (and VB is its bastard child with delusions of being taken seriously).

        [What does any of that have to do with writing long-lived, maintainable, fast-running programs?]

        <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> is sometimes used to replace features found in Apache or IIS; basically a kind of roll-your-own web server, or at least an application that has web-server-like qualities to it.

I'm not saying that such is always bad, but it's dancing at the smelly border of unnecessary reinvention of infrastructure.

        [So… it indeed has nothing to do with writing long-lived, maintainable, fast-running programs. Great. Back on topic, Node's obviously geared toward long-lived programs, being intended for writing Web-app serversides. Whether it's maintainable is open for debate, but the proliferation of large, useful, and regularly-maintained applications written on Node (the <a href="CoffeeScript.html">CoffeeScript</a> compiler being a prime example) is pretty good evidence. And as for performance, there's non-blocking I/O, plus Node uses the heavily-optimised V8 <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> runtime.]

        I'm not sure what you mean by "long lived". I interpreted it as meaning software used for many years, but it now seems you meant not using the event-driven style typically used for web apps.

      <p>
        [I didn't introduce the term "long-lived"; based on previous contributors' discussion, especially the "Long-lived? No, lives until you click a link." part, I assumed it meant that a particular application instance stays running for a long time, contrary to older client-side scripts that unload as soon as the user navigates anywhere. (I say "older" because these days, a lot of client-side scripts are used to pull together single-page applications, and those scripts stay running for as long as any other client app would.) If "long-lived" instead was meant to refer to the application itself being used for years, that property doesn't really relate to anything else in a language or platform design apart from the question of maintainability (which was also mentioned as a separate point).
