        Can Of Worms
      </h1>
      <p>
        A can of worms is a can you do not wish to open, especially if you are obliged to eat the contents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus to 'open a can of worms' is to invite pain and detailed unpleasantness. Usually used to avoid doing something.
      </p>
      <p>
        As in: <strong>It is possible do it with </strong><a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a>, but that would be opening a whole new can of worms.<strong></strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The way I first heard this expression had nothing to do with eating the contents(!); rather, the essential element was that once a can of worms is open, the worms squiggle about and getting them all back in to the can is nearly impossible.  Hence one should hesitate before opening a <a href="CanOfWorms.html">CanOfWorms</a>.  Opening a <a href="CanOfWorms.html">CanOfWorms</a> means that you might not be able to make the resulting unpleasantness go away.

        <em>We use </em>PandorasBox for that version of events. Either way, it's not good.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="CanOfWorms.html">CanOfWorms</a> is the same thing, just not as bad - it's impossible to close PandorasBox, but cleaning up after opening a <a href="CanOfWorms.html">CanOfWorms</a> is simply unpleasant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can - open.  Worms - </em>'everywhere!<em></em>'
