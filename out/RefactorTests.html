        Refactor Tests
      </h1>
      <p>
        So let's say you <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a> for a long time, and you have this problem of <a href="MegaExtremeProgrammingAcceptanceTests.html">MegaExtremeProgrammingAcceptanceTests</a> that take days to tell you anything useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, we gotta have tests for the <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> so we can start to <a href="RefactorTests.html">RefactorTests</a>. Happily most <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>s, courtesy of <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>, come with their own tests right out of the box.
      </p>
      <p>
        First step is not refactoring, but optimizing. We have to profile all our tests and see where they're taking the most time. Then fix any obvious bottlenecks - rewrite in a hard language, use <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s instead of live data, that sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next step is making the tests only run when necessary; sure a <a href="SmokeTest.html">SmokeTest</a> might take a long time to run, but we don't need to run the whole thing just to work on a small section of the source. Only the tests that build dependencies tell you are relevant should run by default when you're actually working on the codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, if all that doesn't deal with the problem, you're going to have to look for redundancies in the tests themselves and refactor so they're <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do all that and you still can't test fast enough to <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>, you're going to have to scale the <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s back - you're certainly big enough to hire a separate QA group, so bite the bullet and let them worry about it ...
