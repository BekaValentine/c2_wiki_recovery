        A wise man sees two men head-butting a brick wall and making plaster fall. He says "There is another way". He leaves with the wall's gratitude while watching two men head-butting each other.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>This plan fails in in four ways:</strong> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           no longer does plaster and the wall fall.
        </li>
        <li>
           they are now working against each other instead of with each other.
        </li>
        <li>
           they physically instead of mentally their heads are using.
        </li>
        <li>
           they follow the <strong>not so wise man</strong> who feels he has received gratitude from an inanimate wall incapable of giving it instead of real gratitude from two men who could have been served with real wisdom.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There were three who involved themselves in a <em>not so wise</em> instance of <a href="ThereIsAnotherWay.html">ThereIsAnotherWay</a> who in failing illustrated the importance of identifying goals which lead to winning strategies and actions.
