        The project's inception is based from a pattern <a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a> authored that was workshopped at <a href="PlopConference.html">PlopConference</a> in August 1998.  Feedback and multiple beer conversations inspired the idea of creating a <a href="ComponentDesignPatterns.html">ComponentDesignPatterns</a> language that captures recurring themes in <a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a> and presents them in a language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, there was an interesting discussion about authors who write patterns books without exposing them to the patterns community (and/or performing adequate research) in the <a href="OrgPatterns.html">OrgPatterns</a> mailing list.  This helped create the idea of having the formative stages of our project based on the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In September 1998, <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a> started contributing interesting experiences to patterns like <a href="ContainerIndependence.html">ContainerIndependence</a> and <a href="AcidCommand.html">AcidCommand</a>, and even went as far as adding a <a href="ConnectionFlyweight.html">ConnectionFlyweight</a> pattern to <a href="ConnectionPatterns.html">ConnectionPatterns</a>.  After much coercing and desperate begging ;-), <a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a> persuaded him to continue contributing to the project as an author.  Kyle's a Senior Java Architect at IBM, an author of <a href="DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion.html">DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion</a>, and currently working on <a href="CrossingChasms.html">CrossingChasms</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also in September, <a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a> started proposing a few patterns loosely related to his <a href="AbstractSessionPattern.html">AbstractSessionPattern</a> workshopped at EuroPLoP 97.  Nat is finishing his PhD at Imperial College in the UK, and is primarily focusing on distributed component models.  His focus on lower level systems -- mechanisms on  dynamic transport protocol selection for inter-component bindings, and complex component interactions on them -- further complements the team with emphasis on bleeding edge CBD research.  And his extensive Java (Nat's also a regular on <a href="JavaIdioms.html">JavaIdioms</a>) and COM experience has been valuable to the language's evolution as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that point, Nat, Kyle and Philip continued exploring existing and new ideas for patterns that seemed like they might fit into the language, and much valuable feedback and discussion continued to occur on Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, in early December, <a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a> visited a group of consultants at a Wall Street consulting firm called MicroModeling Associates [1], who hold weekly patterns meetings, to discuss <a href="ComponentDesignPatterns.html">ComponentDesignPatterns</a> (slides can be accessed here: [2]).  The problem and forces the language was attempting to resolve were discussed.  <a href="LayeredFrameworks.html">LayeredFrameworks</a>, <a href="CookbookApproach.html">CookbookApproach</a>, and <a href="CautiousBuyOverBuild.html">CautiousBuyOverBuild</a> were discussed in detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around the same time, after proposing a Hot Topic on <a href="ComponentDesignPatterns.html">ComponentDesignPatterns</a>, it was accepted into ChiliPLoP'99, and a call for participation [3] went out mid-December.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In late January, while RFPs for the ChiliPLoP'99 conference were being collected, <a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a> held a discussion at the <a href="LondonArchitectureGroup.html">LondonArchitectureGroup</a>.  They addressed the similarities and differences between objects and components, and object and component frameworks.  In addition, <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a>, <a href="LayeredFrameworks.html">LayeredFrameworks</a>, and <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a> were discussed.
