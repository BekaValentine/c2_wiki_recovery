        One Hand Clap
      </h1>
      <p>
        I don't get it. I can clap with one hand against my desk and it makes a noise... what's so bad about one hand clapping?
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this phrase mean that you clap in the air with one hand and it can't be heard? What about clapping your hand on your knee? is that cheating? Is that not one hand clapping?
