        Is Wiki Constructivist Learning
      </h1>
      <p>
        Is a wiki an environment for <a href="ConstructivistLearning.html">ConstructivistLearning</a>? What are its uses as an educational medium?

        <em>Refactored from the original page text to make a link to </em><a href="ConstructivistLearning.html">ConstructivistLearning</a> and make the question clearer (I don't think <a href="PossibleUsesOfWiki.html">PossibleUsesOfWiki</a> was what the original poster meant). Now, as to the question, I have no idea. Off the top of my head, the answer is "it depends on what you do with it". Wiki is a technology for recording and sharing knowledge. It's about as much of a constructivist learning environment as is a bulletin board or a journal.<em> --</em><a href="MattChaput.html">MattChaput</a>
