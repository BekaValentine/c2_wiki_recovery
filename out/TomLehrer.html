        The best: During the <a href="HighTemperatureSuperconductor.html">HighTemperatureSuperconductor</a> episode of <a href="PbsNova.html">PbsNova</a>, to illustrate the hunt for the right chemicals to mix, they played "The Elements":

      <p>
        All of this goes to what Lehrer calls "a possibly recognizable tune", namely that of the "modern Major-General" song (from "Pirates of Penzance.") and <strong><em>not</em></strong> the admiral's song (When I Was A Lad - from "HMS Pinafore.")

        "The Elements" is funny, but 'the best'? Nah. There is much more in "National Brotherhood Week" and "I Wanna Go Back To Dixie", just to mention two. --<a href="OleAndersen.html">OleAndersen</a>

      <p>
        "My Home Town", "Oedipus Rex", "Silent E", "The Vatican Rag", "I'm an Aardvark" and "Poisoning Pidgeons in the Park" are also the "best". But when I wrote "The best:" with a colon on the end I was introducing the best known use of a <a href="TomLehrer.html">TomLehrer</a> song on <a href="PbsNova.html">PbsNova</a>; it's just an interjection to provide a topic break. --PCP

        <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>: OCS is short for Officer's Candidate School; the route by which enlisted men/women in the US military get promoted into the officers corps; one can also become an officer by attending one of the service academies, or by battlefield promotion (fairly rare these days).

        Hey, I did my dissertation the same way Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky did his. --<a href="EricJablow.html">EricJablow</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Lobachevsky did important work (all above board, as far as we know) in <a href="NonEuclidean.html">NonEuclidean</a> geometry. Lehrer chose the name because it sounded nice.  <em>For those wondering what this is about, Lehrer's song "Lobachevsky" suggests that the aforementioned mathematician (long dead, and unable to defend himself) engaged in plagiarism.  While the song is intended as a joke, and not a serious charge against (or criticism of) Lobackevsky, some find the use of a real mathematician in such a context to be a tad on the offensive side--especially given how seriously plagiarism is taken in academia.  Of course, lots of what Lehrer wrote is offensive, which is why it's frequently so funny.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be noted, though, that many people (including Bolyai, Riemann if you are considering positive-curvature geometries also) seem to have independently proposed non-Euclidean geometries at about the same time. -ajb

        [On "whimsy"] Huh? Lehrer's classic comment on the <a href="NobelPrize.html">NobelPrize</a> in 1973 was meant seriously and is still worth thinking about seriously (as are many other things that he said or sang). ChristopherHitchens writing about the period just last year would I'm sure agree with that. Meanwhile I only learnt that Lehrer said this from Wiki a few months ago. As a naive fifteen year old something really bothered me about the whole business. As a naive forty four year old it was cool to know that help was at hand, if only I'd known where to look. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        Heard the "Lobachevsky" song for the first time. Obviously wanted to know what the comments attributed to Pravda and Izvestiya were. Being Russian myself I was able to decipher one and part of the other and did an internet search to fill in the rest. Here is what it says:
      </p>
      <p>
        Pravda: "There lived a king once and with him lived a flea". -- according to some pages where it was found, this is a line from Goethe's "Faust".
      </p>
      <p>
        Izvestiya: "I am going where the Tzar himself goes on foot" -- This is a Russian saying meaning "to the outhouse".
