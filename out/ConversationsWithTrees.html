        Conversations With Trees
      </h1>
      <p>
        I attribute the fact that I actually managed to hold on to most of my sanity during my growing-up years to the influence of trees on me at a very early age. I did in fact talk to trees and spent even more time listening to them (up until the age of about 10.) It was some of the most peaceful time I have ever spent, and I can (and do) go back to it in my mind when life gets really stressful.

        I have never planted a tree (or had a child, or written a book). Hmmm. Maybe it's time for me to wake up, huh?

        The original poster did go on to WriteaBook, or books, and did plant a tree. See <a href="LifesTooShort.html">LifesTooShort</a>. He arrived at a DefiningMoment and found the TimeToWakeUp. Behaviour worth copying, don't you think?

        There is definitely something to be said for <a href="ConversationsWithTrees.html">ConversationsWithTrees</a>, for speaking and hearing the sound of what one has to say, without interruption, and then listening to hear what response comes from the trees. But of course there are times when we have <a href="ConversationsWithTrees.html">ConversationsWithTrees</a> because we want to think about it, and not be confused by the replies others may have about how ItllNeverWork, or that it's a CrazyIdea. Some of the <a href="WorldGeniuses.html">WorldGeniuses</a> have found little need for response, and take great encouragement from the SoundsOfSilence.

        William Wordsworth's <em>Prelude</em> discusses in part how he learnt morality from Nature as a child. It seems rather contrived to me, but that's just his experiences.

        <em>Each of us learn and value things in different ways. That should come as no surprise. The point is this - reflection can change both values and behaviour, which the poster demonstrated in deed as well as word. Some would say it's </em>ResultsThatCount.<em></em>

        I drove 1.5 hours east of Stockton, CA and went to Calaveras Big Trees State Park. There I spent the afternoon with the Sierra Redwoods. I had no idea how wonderful these redwoods are. The largest standing ones are about 20 feet in diameter and must grow to be 200 feet tall. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But these redwoods were not just trees; they seemed to be wise old creatures of the forest. Their bark is soft and alive. I kept putting my hands on the trees; I guess I was hoping they would speak to me or something. The smell of the redwood fragrance was incredible.

        There were only 8 people I ran into while I was there, so I could really be alone with these old spirits. At one point I just sat on a bench and tried to take it all in. I felt almost like I was in a cathedral; I didn't want to leave. It was so quiet with only the sound of squirrels running around.

        You're a blob of meat.  Why would someone talk to <em>you</em>?

        I talk to sets, not trees. Trees are so 90's.
