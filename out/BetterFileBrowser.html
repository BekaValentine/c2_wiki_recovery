        Better File Browser
      </h1>
      <p>
        Can anybody recommend a better file browser for Windows? Windows Explorer is annoying, and I'd like some customizing. Possible features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Separation of folders from content in the main panel: 3 total panels instead of 2, one vertical and two horizontal (at least for default layout).
        </li>
        <li>
           Scripting control in a "familiar-acting" language, like C, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, or heck even BASIC?
        </li>
        <li>
           Folder-specific settings (MS's seems to randomly forget them every gibbous moon or something)
        </li>
        <li>
           Tree inheritance of above folder settings
        </li>
        <li>
           Custom tool-bar buttons and short-cut key mapping (map to both built-in options and scripts)
        </li>
        <li>
           Knows how to "read" and use the Windows association lists
        </li>
        <li>
           Non-stupid text and content searching/filtering (MS not friendly to non MS products)
        </li>
        <li>
           Works on Linux also 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
