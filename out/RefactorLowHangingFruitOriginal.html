        Refactor Low Hanging Fruit Original
      </h1>
      <p>
        The dialog that opens <a href="RefactorLowHangingFruit.html">RefactorLowHangingFruit</a> has been changed. The original version is worth preserving. There is considerable discussion about the issues raised here, though, so see <a href="RefactorLowHangingFruit.html">RefactorLowHangingFruit</a> for some provoking of thought.
