        Luna Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        New interface, available in <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Main point is to simplify the user interface. The idea is that a typical window will have a list of useful commands in the left 1/3 and a bunch of things to click on in the right 2 / 3.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking on an icon changes the commands available.

        What disturbs me as a <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> user, is the freakin' inconsistency of the UI. Seems like <a href="FrogDesign.html">FrogDesign</a> didn't help much.

        Anyone know where I can see some screen shots of this? A search at MS revealed not much. I _did_ see a screenshot of an Explorer window with a bunch of tasks at the side:

        <img src="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/images/bizmydocsbig.jpg" />
      </p>
      <p>
        If that's what it means, I _really_ hope that there's a way to go back to a simple "Details" listing... That clutters up the interface too much for my liking. I don't want to have to maximise my Explorer windows just to dive through my filesystem. -- <a href="RobertWatkins.html">RobertWatkins</a>

        The interface is not meant for expert users like us. But it seems pretty reasonable for people who really don't want to know what extension represents a MS Word file or how many bytes it is. Apparently it's a continuation of the MSN Explorer theme. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yeah, just look at what they're working on: Contract, Proposal, Presentation - who would want to do crap like that?</em>

        The interface also features "thumbnail" views, so if you have a folder full of pictures or movies, you'll see them in the icons.  And the traditional list and detail views are available for those who don't like the dumbed-down views. --<a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

      <p>
        The thumbnail views already existed in WindowsMe. Are they more widespread in <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They were even in Windows 98, IIRC.</em>
      </p>

        I've gotta say I like the interface, even if the default theme feels like it was designed by an art school dropout.  And this is coming from a <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> hater.  Bring the interface on over to Windows 2000, where I'm not required to have stuff like <a href="WindowsMessenger.html">WindowsMessenger</a> installed, and I'll be a happy man. :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You </em>'can<strong> not install Windows Messenger. When you install Windows, it asks you what components to install. Just deselect it. You can also uninstall it later by going to add/remove Windows components. Strangely, though, after doing just that, the exe is still there. I wonder why. --</strong><a href="DorKleiman.html">DorKleiman</a><em></em>
