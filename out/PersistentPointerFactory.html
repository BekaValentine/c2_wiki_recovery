        BASIC IDEA
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic idea is to provide a smart pointer class PersistPtr such that if you replace pointers in your classes by this smart pointer, your classes automatically paged between memory and the disk. There is no need to write serialization functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paging to disk has two advantages:
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) When your program stops, all its internal data is automatically on disk. You can re-start the program again from the point where it stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Since you have a control over how the data is paged between memory and the disk, you can use this arrangement as a very fast database where all the data resides in memory or, if the data is large, you still access the data in an efficient manner.
