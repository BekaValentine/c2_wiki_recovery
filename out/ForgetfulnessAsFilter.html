        Forgetfulness As Filter
      </h1>
      <p>
        One possible way of extracting the essence of a system is to use it
        for a while, go away from it long enough to forget some of the
        details, and then try to duplicate what you've remembered as
        important. Do you end up with only "essentials" or do you end up with
        just the "memorable details"?

        With c2.com down due to local weather, I attempted this exercise with
        the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> server itself. My result was about 400 lines of perl
        code (17 subs) that is a standalone http server implementing something
        wiki-like. The results of the above conjecture are not yet clear...

        I've once heard it said that 
        "experience is what is remembered after all the details have been forgotten".

        Exactly the same is done with neural nets: 
      </p>
      <p>
        If the net has too many neurons, it starts learning the training data "by rote" instead of extracting useful generalizations. To counter this, the number of neurons and/or connections between them can be cut down ("pruned"), until the net only remembers the useful abstractions, instead of the details/noise in the training data.

        One of the signature features of critical phenomena is a loss of scale at the critical point.
