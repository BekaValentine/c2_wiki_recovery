        [It's perhaps worth noting that any non-trivial <a href="ActionScript.html">ActionScript</a> code will use higher-order functions, because it's an ECMAScript dialect much like JS and, also much like JS, uses first-class functions for event listeners. PHP has also had a crude approximation of higher-order functions for a while, and it gained closures more recently. -DavidMcLean?]
      </p>
      <p>
        The most natural event syntax looks something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        event (attrib1=foo, attrib2=bar) {<br/>
        event_code_here();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

In fact, I've done that bit for you. Use these: <a href="http://gigahard.mine.nu/~dani/eval_timeout.js">http://gigahard.mine.nu/~dani/eval_timeout.js</a> We're quite willing to ignore that the implementations of setSInterval()/setSTimeout() use higher-order functions, provided your eval()-based Brady Bunch example doesn't use any itself. -DavidMcLean]

        [Your complaints appear to be tied to language-specific syntax issues, rather than to the general question of whether higher-order functions work as a natural event-listener specification mechanism. The syntax you offer is entirely achievable with higher-order functions, just not in standard <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. Examples below. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn't dispute that they were achievable with HOF's; that wasn't the issue. There may be a lot of ways to implement event code. I don't really care about the implementation, though, whether it be HOF's or gerbils under the hood (as long as I don't have to clean up their droppings). And see the "syntax error" issue near the bottom of <a href="WhyWeHateRuby.html">WhyWeHateRuby</a>. (And I don't claim to hate Ruby, it's just a specific issue I'm referring to.) Further, a language that's too flexible in inventing syntax invites excess creativity of the kind described in <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Your fascination with gerbils is odd. What's up with that? As for there being lots of ways to implement event code, yes, there are. An optimal design for event-listener implementation will however avoid introducing more <a href="NonOrthogonalLanguageFeatures.html">NonOrthogonalLanguageFeatures</a>; if the language already has functions, then introducing a new non-function thing that represents a block of code (to be run when the event fires) is non-orthogonal, so an optimal design will use the language's existing functions as event code blocks. Closures aren't strictly necessary but are certainly very convenient and, in a language that already has <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>, not providing closure support violates the <a href="PrincipleOfLeastSurprise.html">PrincipleOfLeastSurprise</a>. If your hard-coded event syntax doesn't use regular functions as event-listener blocks, it's non-orthogonal; if it doesn't capture variables from the surrounding scope, it's inconvenient. If it does both of those things, you've effectively hard-coded the higher-order function design. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Full-out <a href="NonOrthogonalLanguageFeatures.html">NonOrthogonalLanguageFeatures</a> leads to something like Lisp, so we are right smack back to <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>: lather, wash, rinse, repeat. Ruby is just over-complicated Lisp with more syntax dingle-berries to play with.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Which would be a problem if a <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a> existed, huh? -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        [See, here's the thing. You say "The above style is optimized for the event <strong>writer</strong>, not the event engine <strong>implementer</strong>. You have it backward because your kind focuses too much on guts, gears, and bits instead of typical developer <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>." But I <em>am</em> an event-writer, not an event-engine implementer, and I'd still choose higher-order functions for registering event listeners, with absolutely no hesitation. The orthogonality in features it affords, along with the consistency and flexibility of <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a> closures, renders this method the cleanest and most capable way to handle such things.]

           You are thinking in terms of re-use of concepts for <em>other</em> things or perhaps meta programming. I'm focusing on how to make events and only events as simple and strait-forward as possible for typical usage, not conceptual generic reuse. The market seems to prefer domain-specific or aspect-specific languages, as described in <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>. Can you admit at least there is a trade-off between optimizing syntax for specific patterns versus being generic?

           Ruby-like DSL's are not as "tight" as dedicated DSL's.

Anyhow, let's put that claim aside for now and assume your Ruby-built event block and related errors are all just dandy and it works as expected.

           However, we could swap that implementation (HOF) for a different implementation, such as objects, and in theory the app writer wouldn't know the difference.

If we built up an event-specification DSL in Ruby based on the above syntax possibilities, it would by necessity be made of higher-order functions, and we couldn't swap them out for a different implementation because event specifications by necessity must be constructed from code blocks, and we cannot create functions, like "event" above, that accept code blocks yet are not higher-order functions. We certainly could replace the use of <a href="BlocksInRuby.html">BlocksInRuby</a> with <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s, but we <em>can't</em> do that without changing the syntax; and, again, a language with sufficiently sugared syntax for <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s is a language with higher-order functions. -DavidMcLean]

        You are focusing on the implemtation first. I tend to focus on the interface first, and then work backward. I'd start up by drafting an interface resembling:
      </p>
      <code>
        Name:  <input name="myTextBox"  simulsearcher="mysearch"/><br/>
        <simulsearch name="mysearch" driver="foo" minchars=3<br/>
        refreshrate=2.5 maxdisplayrows=12 cussfilter="yes"/><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is a very declarative interface in that I ask for what I want and don't have to worry about how it's implemented. Your approach is too low level, making one worry about function order, streams, etc. Now behind the scenes the implementation may use HOF's up the wazoo, but that shouldn't matter to the user of the service (app developer).  Even if we are not or cannot use XML, Ideally one would only have to pass a list of attributes like the above and not have to worry about HOF's or call-backs or method chaining order, etc. The <strong>lower-level guts are showing</strong>. The interface should be entirely attribute-driven unless an imperative need is identified. And if one was identified, it could be defined like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        <simulsearch name="mysearch" onclick="myevent" etc="etc" /><br/>
        <event name="myevent" param1="blah" param2="blip"><br/>
        <!-- event code and/or markup here --><br/>
        </event><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I agree that implementation may be easier if we skip developer interface issues, but that doesn't necessarily mean we should skip interface issues.

           It should be part of the standard GUI markup kit. If not, then perhaps add-ons should be permitted such that custom attributes can be added to predefined tags, both permanently and for a "session", depending and need/usage. If there is a potential conflict between vendors or kits, then a "driver=..." attribute perhaps can be available. An alternative is to define a standardized way to "register a service" on a given tag:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        <!-- SAMPLE service-123 --><br/>
        <input name="foo" ... ><br/>

        <service source="<a href="http://asdfasdfasd/blah.svc">http://asdfasdfasd/blah.svc</a>"><br/>
        <targetTags="foo,bar,naz"/><br/>
        <eventsWatched="onClick,onChange,onTab"/><br/>
        <etc><br/>
        </service><br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [We do have a way to "register a service" on a given tag. It's called an event callback function. As for search-as-you-type being part of the standard GUI markup set, sure, you could do that. But can you really feasibly identify <em>every single</em> element of a graphical user interface that might ever be required by anyone ever? It's invariably better to provide generic, composable components from which features such as search-as-you-type, infinite scrolling, and so on may be constructed. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The above addresses the case where it wouldn't be built into the standard kit. And clarity/intuitiveness versus "generic" gets right back to the heart of the <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>. I haven't looked lately, but there used to be an extensive catalog of plug-in Visual Basic widgets. A search-as-you-type widget could be a variation of a text box that you drag into place. You then fill in a various attributes ("properties") such as refresh rate, and select from a pre-set list of search source-types, such as database, CSV file, XML file, web service, etc. XML can generally give us the textual equivalent of such. If the attribute-driven approach wasn't sufficient, then the widgets also tended to include API's to customize the search more. It's kind of a hierarchy of high-level attribute-driven app developer interface with incrementally lower levels exposed/available if needed for more lower-level adjustments or customizations. You have the low-level interface/API up front that forces the app developer <strong>into the deeper guts too soon</strong>. HOF's in the lower-level are okay with me, but shouldn't be default app dev interface. Objects are plenty sufficient for the API and better understood by most app dev's. It may make the kit implementator's job a bit harder, but so be it.

      </ul>

           [Okay, so we hard-code as many patterns as we can manage into the standard set. Now what happens when we want to build something that's outside that standard set? This kit's apparently only providing a low-level API, and without tools for abstracting out that low level (FRP being one example) we'll end up with loads of <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a> in implementing our custom widget. -DavidMcLean]

        <li>
           [Misinterpreted, perhaps. By "hard-code as many patterns as we can manage", I was referring to your reference to the "extensive catalog of plug-in Visual Basic widgets"; we'd want the standard set of Web widgets to encompass as many GUI patterns as we can manage, no? -DavidMcLean]

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ideally we'd want our standard web GUI engine to either handle a wide set of typical GUI activities, or pre-define easy ways to plug in semi-common GUI needs. However, we also should consider and XML interface for hooking up <em>unanticipated</em> custom plug-in's/widgets (both lasting and temporal), and perhaps standards for getting into the deeper guts, maybe JS and DOM, for deeper control. The idea is to only go outside of XML for the portions that cannot be done in XML and its GUI widget and hookup conventions. None of the widgets in that VB addon catalog were anticipated up front, but VB's architecture defined a way to add such into VB and use VB's approach to specifying attributes and events/call-backs without having to deal with low-level code except for the parts or time where you need fine-tuned customization. You only peel to the core of the onion(s) only if you really need to. If designed right, only portions would typically need to farm out to mid or lower-level code, not the entire widget. The widget authors may define say 10 different events for dealing with search-as-you-type, and you'd only need to redefine/override those events that are at issue (perhaps with an ACTION or EVENT tag in our sample XML here) because the defaults and/or attributes make most of it automatic or have satisfactory defaults.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        [As for imperative-versus-declarative, my code is almost entirely declarative. There are exactly two sections that are imperative: -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <code>
        results.onValue (res) -> ($ '#resultText').html res<br/>
        ongoingSearch.onValue (show) -><br/>

        ($ '#resultText').toggle !show<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I don't find that very intuitive. Why does the service user have to concern themselves with toggle-ness?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Because the way the service user chooses to represent the fact that there's an ongoing search depends on what interface the service user has designed. As the documentation noted, ongoingSearch just produces a true or false value; it's up to the developer to wire that Boolean value back into the view. It could easily indicate an ongoing search in some other way if desired, of course. -DavidMcLean]

        It should display a default spinner out of the box without intervention. One only has to adjust such IF the default is not sufficient. I'd probably define controlling such with something like the following Mark-2 example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Out of the box? There's no box. I just coded that thing from scratch, and it <em>does</em> display a spinner without further intervention because I coded it to. Obviously, without any code to display a spinner, it's not going to display a spinner, so I can't just remove that code. I could perhaps have hidden away the spinner-displaying calls to some extent, since for some reason you don't like them, but I think keeping them clearly delineated and visible is preferable, since it's easier to find what you need to change if you do need it to work differently in some way. -DavidMcLean]

      <ul>
        <li>
           So you <strong>put all the guts on the outside</strong> <em>in case</em> one needs to change them? That's bad interface design in most cases. If you put some guts on the outside and some on the inside, what rule do you use to make that determination? It seems pretty clear to me that ideally there is a default spinner out of the box: the kit user shouldn't have to do anything or read through odd code to get the default spinner. However, if they want to control it themselves, then offer two events to define/override: turning it on and turning it back off, similar to the Mark-2 example. (Some middle-ground attributes could also optionally describe where the spinner goes and which image(s) to use for the spinner. These wouldn't require defining events, only attributes, and the attributes only relate to "what", not "how".)

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Again, <em>there is no box</em>. There cannot be a default spinner out-of-the-box because there is no box; that's all the code involved in implementing the feature, so it  must somewhere include the code to configure the spinner, and those calls are the code that does that. I could've exposed separate spinner-on and spinner-off events, like you suggest below, but no matter what events or interface I expose the fact remains that I will still need the code somewhere for the feature to work. -DavidMcLean]

        <li>
           There are or should be ways to hide that snippet of code if one wants to use the default spinner. Yes, the implementation of the spinner must exist somewhere, but shouldn't have to be in <em>typical</em> setup code used by the app developer. Put the guts on the inside unless there's no other choice or as optional plug-in spots.

The same is true of the "tops_brand" version; the "blended" version has spinner details wrapped up inside but allows one to replace them if needed. -DavidMcLean]

        Note that sometimes events may need to interact with the service, such as returning values:
      </p>
      <code>

        <!-- markup and/or code to deactivate a spinner --><br/>

        Services/addons would all follow the same style of interface for consistency. One then doesn't have to remember the proper method chaining order, whether to use HOF's, dollar signs, square brackets, or donkeys except for the relatively rare parts or times where one needs very custom adjustments. The interface would be nice and standardized as such:

        [So am I right in thinking that the crux of your argument is that <em>actually implementing</em> stuff is always much too low-level? I provided an actual, executable implementation of a search-as-you-type feature; it's based on <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a> streams and operates at a much higher abstraction level than an implementation based solely on callbacks would. I could've abstracted the stream-building into a function, like this <a href="http://gigahard.mine.nu/~david/instant/docs/refined_instant.html">http://gigahard.mine.nu/~david/instant/docs/refined_instant.html</a> , as well, but doing so has minimal effect on the parts of the code relevant to my FRP-demonstrating example.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [You seem to think we can prepackage all these things and therefore never concern ourselves with their implementation, but the fact remains that for search-as-you-type to work <em>someone</em> has to implement it. Arguing that tools for abstraction in implementation code aren't valuable because you don't think you should have to work with implementation code is absurd in the extreme; if we're going to imagine an environment where search-as-you-type is already implemented, why not imagine an environment where the <em>rest</em> of our application is already implemented and we don't need to program anything at all? If programming isn't needed, then obviously <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a> isn't going to be of much use either; in reality, however, we do still need to write code to do stuff. -DavidMcLean]

      <p>
        I made no assumptions about it already existing in the later samples. And I am not sure what the rest of your statements are about. Implementation and interface are generally two different concerns. True, one can dictate the other, but when designing the app programmer interface, we first focus making the best interface possible. <strong>The implementation in theory shouldn't dictate the app dev's interface</strong>, other than the features available. You seem to want to make the implementors' job easier at the expense of the app dev's, making their interface be a lower level or uglier. Perhaps there's a trade-off involved, but we should be aware of the trade-offs and understand their implications rather than tell the interface user to go to hell or the implementor to go to hell to make the other side simpler.
      </p>
      <p>
        [App devs need to implement stuff too. Making an implementer's job easier with higher-level abstractions is of use to <em>all</em> programmers, because all programmers are implementers. In any case, the choice of higher-order abstractions involved in implementing a feature doesn't actually dictate the interface exposed for using that feature, so using a given abstraction is in no way a trade-off between making an implementer's job easier and making an app dev's job easier. Criticising my <em>implementation</em> of search-as-you-type as "too low-level" and presenting an <em>interface</em> to search-as-you-type as more intuitive is nonsense; if you don't have a more intuitive or higher-level <em>implementation</em> in mind, you've no grounds to criticise mine. Ideally, you should have a more intuitive, higher-level and also executable implementation. -DavidMcLean]

        What you presented is <strong>poorly packaged</strong> for an application-side developer because one has to know the "how" of it first. Developers don't have time to dwell on and twiddle around in your lovely <strong>underlying</strong> architecture: they want to get in, set the settings needed to get the job done, and get out quick. Maybe a big company with a large web audience for the search page may want to spend the resources to really dig in to fine-tune every bit and pixel, but that's the exception.

        I'm not against being able to lift up the hood of the car and twiddle with the engine, but that shouldn't be the default or only interaction interface. Most just want to get in the passenger seat and drive the damned car using a the standard "dumbed down" dash board controls, not talk about turbo manifolds and multi-transduced fuel pumps. Back in my VB days I used to be able to download trial versions of most widgets from the component catalogs and a good many times get them up and running mostly by setting properties and filling in a couple of events. I didn't have to learn their internal architecture to make decent use of them. (Many were quite buggy, but that's mostly a different issue than developer interface design.) Maybe you haven't seen "interfaces done right" to know what "right" is. I don't know. In short, <strong>Make the common things easy and the rare things possible.</strong>

        Well, I've seen what I consider well-packaged interfaces and poorly packaged interfaces over the years, and this falls into the second category in my opinion for reasons already given, such as exposing the spinner implementation when it doesn't have to be exposed (except as a last resort option). If you insist it's great, well, we'll just have to <a href="AgreeToDisagree.html">AgreeToDisagree</a> and leave it at that.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an exercise, give the feature list and ONLY the feature list to a skilled developer interface designer, and ask them to design an interface for it. They shouldn't have to see the implementation or the internal framework to do such. <strong>The internal framework dictating the interface is a yellow alert</strong>. It's fine if you have hooks for fancier stuff, but don't make that the default and try to control most features declaratively if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Again, the framework is not dictating the interface. I chose the interface exposed purely because that's the level of abstraction and flexibility I wanted it to offer. I could (quite easily) shift more jQuery-DOM-manipulation calls inside the function too, but I felt doing so would both be mixing unrelated concerns (event-stream transformation, DOM manipulation) and would reduce the flexibility afforded to a user, so I didn't.]

           A "service" has to provide a service, and such may be required to be involved in many different "concerns" to carry it out. Your "unrelated concerns" viewpoint seems to be overdone. It's almost like saying to a home owner who wants a brick wall put up: "I'm sending you a different quote and bill for cement and for bricks because they are different concerns". Optional hooks to control each aspect, fine; just don't make it the default.
        </li>
        <li>
           [Okay, but I didn't implement a service. I implemented a function, simulsearch, which transforms search queries into search results. It quite deliberately only operates on a "behind-the-scenes" level to allow it to be dropped into pages with very different layouts. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
        <li>
           Why not? If we build our GUI standard around services, then we are less dependent on specific client languages such as JS or jQuery and perhaps hook them up to server-based services with only a change in the driver name/ID and/or service reference URL. If we treat everything as a web service, the web service could also optionally be running on the client, I would note.

        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
           [Even assuming your idealistic situation, how would we feasibly implement a search-as-you-type feature without doing so on the client-side? It's not something we can do purely in server-side code, no matter how fancy our markup gets. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
        <li>
           This topic is not really about server-versus-client side except that ideally we want to make such be swappable when needed by programming to an interface instead of an implementation. <strong>Our markup kit should make such easier in part by providing a service standard.</strong> 
        </li>
        <li>
           SAYT can be implemented server-side by sampling the "search box" every N seconds and displaying the current best matches below it, or a "target results panel". Nothing about that is really outside of my markup plan. We've already gone over tags like <event ... repeat="3.2" unit="seconds"> in the "Brady Bunch" examples. The event grabs the current value of the search box, queries the server, and the populates the target search results panel. That's all common gui behavior. The only thing we haven't covered is how to deactivate the service or querying when we are done, but the approach depends on the interface design. I can think of multiple ways.
        </li>
        <li>
           [Polling the server with the current query every N seconds doesn't even slightly provide search-as-you-type functionality, because it has two glaring flaws. The first is that it must by necessity send and receive network data every N seconds, whether the box's content has changed or not; this means that it'll have far more transmission overhead than a <em>real</em> search-as-you-type feature that sends data exactly when the user types and at no other times. The other problem is that it must send and receive data <em>only</em> every N seconds: Unless N is really really small (say, 0.5 seconds), it won't be search-as-you-type, because it'll instead be search-after-you-type. If it <em>is</em> a really really small N, that amplifies the other problem, that of large amounts of strictly unnecessary data being transferred: Since it's sending to the server that much more often, there's that much more data transferred. A true search-as-you-type feature cannot work via this sort of polling; it will only work if a "user has typed" event is employed at the base level rather than a "time has passed" event, and when you have such an event it's trivial to transform it into proper search-as-you-type, as I've shown, so there's little point putting effort into server-siding it. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The server could help by not sending a results refresh if the text is the same. An event could also have a "stopCount" and "noDup" attribute. The stopCount would limit the number of times the event would fire. The "noDup" attribute means that same event cannot be relaunched if its already active. Thus, the search box's "onChange" event launches the refresh event "loop". Subsequent onChange events don't launch any new search events for the given time because of the "noDup" attribute. (The "startCount" is used to delay a bit before first search to give one time to type.) These are reasonable features for a repeating event mechanism to have. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        Search: <input type="text" name="searchBox" onChange="SAYT"/><br/>
        <div name="searchResults">...</div><br/>
        ...<br/>
        <event name="SAYT" frequency=1.5 unit="seconds" startCount=2 stopCount=10 noDup="yes"><br/>
        ...<br/>
        </event><br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Another approach is to have the server shut off the event using a simple delta markup update after a series of sameness, but this requires a reliable server connection.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [But these additions both don't solve either of the problems and are needlessly complex. Neither problem is solved because fundamentally you're still polling every 1.5 seconds, which means you're still sending needless requests; granted, you're sending fewer needless requests now because you stop the "loop" after ten, but the fact remains that they're still needless. Because you're still only polling every 1.5 seconds, it's also still not search-as-you-type, since it'll often only search <em>after</em> you type. I say it's "needlessly complex" because you triggered your polling event <em>using an onChange event</em>, which means you have an onChange event, which means <strong>you do not need to poll</strong>. If you have an onChange primitive event, transforming it into a polling timer event is useless, at least for this particular problem; in fact, a polling timer is only ever useful when you need to check a property for which there is no primitive event, since if you <em>have</em> an event for it it'll invariably be simpler and more efficient to use it. In this case, why transform the onChange event to a timer event, when it's infinitely more valuable to transform the onChange event into a "search results received" event (see my implementation for an example of that)? -DavidMcLean]

           How are you measuring "complexity"? I just have to change a few attributes. Your thing is a screwy mess. You have too many poorly-described claims jammed into one paragraph there. I agree that if we want a well-tuned optimized gizmo, we'll probably have to do or get some client-side programming. But for a quick-and-dirty low-usage situation, such may be good enough if SAYT is not built into the interface/GUI-tool, which it can be. But this digresses from the idea of having a standard way to hook in components without having to use or write app-language-specific code, or at least as little as possible. What of SAYT can be defined via attributes, and what parts could be optionally given events to override or customize behavior when desired?

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Complexity is measured pretty much in terms of parts involved. My design has the following: a stream of search queries, a stream of search results (a fairly straightforward transformation of the query stream), and a Boolean flag indicating ongoing search (a trivial combination of the first two). Yours has the onChange event, which is analogous to my query stream; for some reason, you then trigger a polling timer in response to that event source, which polls the search field at regular intervals, sends the info to the server, and presumably listens for and handles responses. Effectively, you have an extra event source (the timer) for no particular reason, which is more complex than having a single event source. -DavidMcLean]

           That's one of the big problems with code counts: what in the "libraries" counts and what do we define as a "library". Anyhow, this sub-topic is kind of a side issue anyhow.

If you're going to count its lines as part of my app, you really should be counting the lines of code used to implement your GUI markup language as part of yours.

On my sample implementation, I put an initially delay because we don't want it searching when only one character is entered (unless paused on for 1.5 seconds in the sample). That's usually useless. (The first char would trigger the onChange event). Note that JS sometimes acts "jittery" for refreshes under a second on some computers.

I'm getting bored with SAYT implementation discussion. It's not related to my purpose to be in this topic. By the way, JS seems happier on the client-side also if not overloaded.

           There's a difference between implementing it with the existing hypothetical GUI markup features and using a standardized interface of a GUI markup to "call" outside services and/or add-ons. My later examples were only to show it's possible to use existing features, but that may not be the most optimized (assuming SAYT is not built in). The standardized add-on interface approach is illustrated around sample "service-123". How your claims related to such is what I was curious about, whether I made that clear or not. If not, I apologize. Remember, I was motivated by the add-on catalogs of VB, Delphi, etc. in terms of how they packaged/standardized the interfaces to avoid having to "expose the guts" of their add-ons as a first resort.

           Only parts of it have to be implemented on the client-side (if we want it be reasonably efficient). And we should also allow for the possibility of server-side-only SAYT even if it's kind of slow. The ideal I am looking for is to hook up to services/add-ons using ONLY the markup interfaces. Behind the scenes it may be indeed load/run AJAX or what-not, but the app builder shouldn't have to touch JS or AJAX code, staying only with the GUI markup. Occasionally one may have to twiddle with such if the standard interface is not sufficient, but we want to target roughly 80% or higher of actual uses being only through markup.

You <em>can't</em> have server-side-only search-as-you-type because you'll at least need something on the client-side sending the state of the text box to the server and handling the server's responses.

           I don't want to get bogged down in definition issues here. In my experience most "search servers" could not properly handle the load or turn-around time of keyboard-speed SAYT and must be throttled to some extent. I'm thinking in terms of what would work reasonably well using typical servers as found in the wild. Maybe you are assuming client-side or client-loaded lists?

It obviously doesn't make sense to load the entire search space onto a client, especially when it's significantly huger than the size of the search results, sure. However, there aren't any search-as-you-type systems under discussion here that <em>do</em> load the entire search space onto the client: My implementation and Google's both leave the search source on the server and merely query it through AJAX. -DavidMcLean]

Again, a tool "similar to" what you are calling SAYT would best be <em>practically</em> served by having throttling options. If adding throttling options changes the damned name of it, so be it. Call it a <strong>Biffledorf</strong> if need be, I don't care. I want well-functioning stuff over stuff that fits definitions if these two goals conflict.

Because you <em>do</em> have a primitive event here, there is absolutely no value in polling the field. <em>Throttling</em> is a different thing, however, and it's something that doesn't impact the search-as-you-type-iness of your Biffledorf: My implementation has mild throttling, yet is still a search-as-you-type implementation.

In that case, if the poll rate is too slow it annoys the user by appearing to "jump to life" at arbitrary intervals unrelated to keystrokes.  If the polling rate is fast enough to overcome that -- and you're only sending content if the search string has changed -- then you're essentially rolling your own keystroke trigger but with a power-consuming continuous polling loop which is bad for battery life on mobile devices. So, if it's available, you might as well have used an onKeyUp (or whatever) event.  In short, to avoid swamping the server with continuous polling messages, you either wind up with something that's annoying to the user or you create something equivalent to keystroke-triggers but with more code and bad battery life.  Either way, polling loses.  It's only an option if no more specific event is available.</em>

           "as long as the page is active" is false. I put a "loop limit" on the poller (stopCount). (It's re-triggered by a key-stroke in search the box.) As far as the ideal poll rate, that's a tricky issue either way, and there are different approaches to managing that dynamically, both server-centric and client-centric. And if it's an intranet application intended for desktop users, then phone battery life is a very miniscule concern. Again, a more optimized one would indeed more careful programming.

           Are you suggesting sending an HTTP GET for every keystroke at keystroke speed? If the query takes 5 seconds to process a typical query, then such may flood the processing queue unless special programming is done.  As far as "needless complexity", it uses existing features of the GUI markup without JS. It knows to turn off the poller because the number of cycles is pre-limited, as already described. Yes, with enough programming on either side we can optimize the network traffic, but sometimes one is asked to get something up quickly and/or has a full in-box at the time. Tuning can come later. My approach wouldn't require any JS and a basic GET query with only the ability to ignore N cycles of the same query string from the same IP/session if the SAYT hidden value flag is set.

In this case, we already have a native keystroke event, so there's no need to emulate one with polling. Triggering a polling loop every time the keystroke event fires, which then polls for query text and sends it, is needlessly complex because we can simply use the keystroke event directly instead. As for "sending a GET for every keystroke"… take a look at my implementation.

Maybe you have <a href="FastEyes.html">FastEyes</a> or can absorb new API documentation quickly. I've met some people like that. If you are one of those, good for you, you get a gold star on your forehead. However, most developers want something easier to digest to save time. Further, in many cases developers just want to try out different widgets to see which works best or to generally explore (trial versions).

If you're arguing not for markup specifically but merely for attribute/event-centric interfaces… well, the vast majority of interfaces exposed by <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> libraries are event-centric already, since that's an optimal way to express GUI code, and there's no reason JS couldn't be attribute-driven (a lot of it is!). -DavidMcLean]

        <li>
           I'm putting standardization over expressiveness. Yes, JS API's can be attribute and event based, but they have many different ways to specify such. Merely having that capability does not by itself standardize the way in which it's expressed. For example, one can use parameters, arrays, and/or object properties to specify attributes in JS. And you may use "regular" JS or jQuery style. And the order that one sets up events and attributes can matter and be many different ways in JS.  In the catalog style, order usually didn't matter (because they are referenced by name). The catalog way allows one to specify them in a "linear" table/chart style. I don't have to learn where or how to specify them differently for each different service/addon. The chart alone is usually sufficient. It's paint-by-numbers. Yes, one could standardize JS calls in such a way, but if they were properly standardized, then one could put an XML wrapper around it anyhow.

           [In presenting a dichotomy between standardisation and expressiveness, you presume that XML is less expressive than <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. It's not. XML encodes arbitrary trees; it's possible to express every single <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> style you mention, and with many XML designs order is still meaningful. In addition, you can't ensure that the interface to any given service is standardised simply because it's expressed as XML: As noted below, there's not actually anything in XML that can enforce that different implementations, even of the same service, expose the same interface. -DavidMcLean]

        You demonstrated an (allegedly) flexible <em>implementation</em> kit for SAYT, but ignored user-friendly (user is app dev). We appear to be right back to <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a> were digestibility battles with flexibility.

        [I showed a simple, clear, and absolutely (not allegedly) flexible way for an app dev to implement search-as-you-type. I then went on to show how you could wrap it up in a less-flexible interface (the latest one I posted) if you actually believe my initial versions aren't developer-friendly (I maintain that they are). In what ways does my most recent revision bother you? -DavidMcLean]

        I agree there may be a trade-off between "simple interface" and implementation flexibility. But I also pointed out that in theory one can still "get under the hood and monkey with the bolts" if the simple or default interface is not sufficient. Thus, it's a false dichotomy. (An exception may be if we want implementation swappability.)

        [There is no trade-off between a simple interface and a flexible implementation, so you don't agree with me; as I've pointed out repeatedly, implementation does not in any way dictate interface. There <em>is</em> a trade-off between a simple interface and a flexible interface, however, hence why the "narrowed", simplified interface I offer in the most recent revision is also less flexible than previous revisions. It's no false dichotomy, because if you're going to make the interface more flexible it will by necessity be more complicated, whether or not the implementation has changed at all. You can certainly have an interface which allows you to ignore bits of it, deferring to defaults, or make use of the more complex options when required, though, of course. See <a href="http://gigahard.mine.nu/~david/instant/docs/blended_instant.html">http://gigahard.mine.nu/~david/instant/docs/blended_instant.html</a> , but note, however, that that's hardly a simple interface: It's actually rather more complex than any of the previous iterations. Fortunately, however, that complexity arises from being liberal in what you accept, in that you're free to use callbacks, simple strings, or leaving it to use only defaults; in short, a more complex interface actually affords simplicity to a developer using it. -DavidMcLean]
