        So anyway, there I was packing the house for the move, and I kept finding other things to do (since packing gets pretty tiresome pretty quickly). One of the things I ended up thinking about was how I wanted to set up my own web pages on a hosting site, and so I'd better get on with writing that database driven engine for it I'd been thinking about for the last couple of years.

        Having discovered <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> a year or two back, I naturally wanted to include something of the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> in my own web pages, and so sat down with my trusty libraries (that I've been dragging around with me for a number of years now) and thought "Let's try to make a wiki".
      </p>
      <p>
        I've put some thoughts about the process on <a href="WritingMyOwnWiki.html">WritingMyOwnWiki</a> if anyone is interested in (yet) another <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>.

        Where can someone see more about this?
