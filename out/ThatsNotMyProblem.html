        Sometimes, a party to a negotiation will attempt to use an <a href="AbsentProxy.html">AbsentProxy</a> (or some other external circumstance) as a constraint on the negotiation.  For example, "we can't afford to pay you that much--we've just had a bad quarter", or "I'll get fired if I don't make my quota".  If you hear that, one thing to do is to respond <a href="ThatsNotMyProblem.html">ThatsNotMyProblem</a>--your only legitimate concern is to get the best deal for <em>you</em>.  Certainly, the HR guy at a prospective employer, or the finance guy at the auto dealer, is going to be unconcerned with <em>your</em> financial situation.

        (Plus, if the other party truly is in difficulty, then a) it might be better to walk away--no sense taking a job at a company headed towards bankruptcy, or b) this might give <em>you</em> an advantage if the other party is desparate).
