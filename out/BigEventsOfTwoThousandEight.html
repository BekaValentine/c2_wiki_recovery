           October 2008: Computer manufacturers come up with a plan which allows you to subscribe for a computer. You pay a monthly fee which allows you to use the computer you first buy at a 90 % discount for two years and at that time replace it (free) with one with state of the art hardware and software (when you sign up again for the next two years). This would include three different platforms: Home, Business, and Enterprise. If you choose not to upgrade you keep the computer as is, and no longer pay a subscription fee monthly. (When the automobile industry hears this, they announce a similar plan which include auto and gasoline at a fixed (discounted) rate and fixed maximum mileage.  You pay pump prices for gasoline beyond the maximum and receive a rebate for gasoline not used) This scheme is announced under the buzzword name of HolisticFinancing.
