        Continuous Refactoring

        Why has no-one commented on <a href="ContinuousRefactoring.html">ContinuousRefactoring</a> which some people think is a core practice of XP?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Probably because they called it </em><a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>. Not that <a href="ContinuousRefactoring.html">ContinuousRefactoring</a> is a bad term, but <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> strikes me as more "ear-catching".<em></em>

        [Someone set the <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> to <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>.  But they are not me.  It's not that I disagree with what they're saying.  They just don't happen to be me.  -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>]
