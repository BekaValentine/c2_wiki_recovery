        Today you use either touch-tone ("press one to buy stock, press two to sell stock") or directed dialog speech recognition ("do you want to buy or sell stocks?") to access these services. I am working on the next generation of artificially intelligent agents that will allow you to converse with these robots using natural language ("I want to buy 200 shares of IBM at the market" or, "get me the cheapest flight to Boston tomorrow morning").

        My interests are programming languages, specifically symbolic/mathematical/array languages such as APL (<a href="AplLanguage.html">AplLanguage</a>), J (<a href="JayLanguage.html">JayLanguage</a>), and K (<a href="KayLanguage.html">KayLanguage</a>). My favorite language is J, which I use in all of my research into expert systems, artificial intelligence amd natural language understanding. I have developed a Matrix Language History page at <a href="http://home1.gte.net/res057qw/APL_J/,">http://home1.gte.net/res057qw/APL_J/,</a> where I have placed several seminal papers describing the historical development of APL,the mother of the symbolic languages developed by <a href="KenIverson.html">KenIverson</a>, and it's newest dialect, J.
