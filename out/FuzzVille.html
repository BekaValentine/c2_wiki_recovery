        The result of a mudified fuzzification; a village in Confusionland.

           I didn't give it a whole lot of thought when I made a wiki link. I planned on going back through it later to decide if to keep. Wiki = quick. What's the Hawaiian word for "ponder carefully"? :-)

           Further, a non-contented wiki link does not necessarily mean an intent to create a new topic. It could be a suggestion <em>to others</em> to create another topic only if they are compelled.
