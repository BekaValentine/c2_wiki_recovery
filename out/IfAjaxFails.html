        If Ajax Fails
      </h1>
      <p>
        Business users are clamoring for web-apps that can behave more like client-server/desktop applications. The current hope seems to be on <a href="AjAx.html">AjAx</a>. But because <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is not a systems language, and because <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> will probably not fix IE <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> problems if it risks their desktop dominence, Ajax has a fairly good chance of failing, I hate to say.

        What would come next in order to obtain better GUI's? Some possible scenarios:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A new standard GUI-centric protocol
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Expanding sales of prioprietary tools such as Flash forms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Tools like <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> and Delphi will be rebuilt like a browser in their own right with potential for automatic updates, just-in-time domain code transfer, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="JavaApplet.html">JavaApplet</a>s will be given a second try.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Web applications will be written in a new way and then machine-translated down to the current hodgepodge of web technologies.
        </li>
      </ul>
