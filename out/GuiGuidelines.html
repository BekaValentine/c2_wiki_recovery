        Gui Guidelines
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are books out on how to follow one company or another's <a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a> guidelines, and some people have even started to try to formulate one or another theory of operation here (see <a href="BertrandMeyer.html">BertrandMeyer</a>'s <a href="ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction.html">ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction</a>, <a href="TheoreticalBasis.html">TheoreticalBasis</a> principle).
      </p>
      <p>
        So I thought rather than collect a bunch of rules of thumb, it may be wiser to collect some principles and truisms ("the obvious is a good place to start" -- <a href="TimOttinger.html">TimOttinger</a>) and see what patterns further develop. Also, I think this is a good place to start collecting links to patterns about GUI design.

        A problem I have is that this is much easier to say than to do, especially the <a href="KnownRepresentation.html">KnownRepresentation</a>. I think that most GUI toolkits (<a href="HammerTruism.html">HammerTruism</a>) make it really hard to build meaningful representations for data manipulation. I can't find any satisfactory UI kits with Internationalization/Localization support. MFC in particular is horribly broken.

        What is really required to build <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a>s this way? 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A couple of questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Once we have <a href="SpartanUserInterface.html">SpartanUserInterface</a> where the customer likes it, should we build a <a href="DynamicUserInterfacePattern.html">DynamicUserInterfacePattern</a> so the experienced user can change it?
        </li>
        <li>
           Aside from copying button images from Microsoft or some other industry (bully or giant, hard choice), how do we decide on which <a href="KnownRepresentation.html">KnownRepresentation</a> is right for more abstract concepts (print preview, chat, etc)?
        </li>
      </ol>
