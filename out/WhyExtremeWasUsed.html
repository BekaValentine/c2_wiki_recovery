        Why Extreme Was Used
      </h1>
      <p>
        Are you curious to know why the word <strong>Extreme</strong> was used in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>From the Preface of </em><a href="ExtremeProgrammingExplained.html">ExtremeProgrammingExplained</a>: "So why the "extreme" in the name? Because XP takes commonsense principles and practices them to extreme levels."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In Kent's words: "When I first articulated XP, I had the mental image of knobs on a control board.  Each knob was a practice that from experience I knew worked well.  I would turn all the knobs up to 10 [i.e., to their extremes] and see what happened."</em>

        Some view the use of "Extreme..." as a now-dated use of a prefix that was <strong>very</strong> trendy at the turn of the century (the book was published in 2000). Here's a choice sample of some "extreme" things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           www.extreme.com
        </li>
        <li>
           Extreme sports
        </li>
        <li>
           Extreme Dating
        </li>
        <li>
           Extreme Ironing
        </li>
        <li>
           Extreme Makeover
        </li>
        <li>
           Extreme Pumpkins
        </li>
        <li>
           Etc (you get the picture).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It shows a danger inherent in titling a book or concept -- names that are hot, new and exciting at the moment (to attract attention and buzz) are quickly cold, old, and dull after the moment has passed.
