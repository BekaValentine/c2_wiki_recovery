        Why Firefox Is Blocked
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WhyFirefoxIsBlocked.html">WhyFirefoxIsBlocked</a> is a web site which is angry because <a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a> allows the <a href="AdBlockPlus.html">AdBlockPlus</a> add-on, which blocks advertising from web sites.

        <strong>The Case</strong> (extracts from the web page)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Software that blocks all advertisement is an infringement of the rights of web site owners and developers. Numerous web sites exist in order to provide quality content in exchange for displaying ads. Accessing the content while blocking the ads, therefore would be no less than stealing.</em>

        There is some related comment at <a href="http://courseblog.cs.princeton.edu/spring05/cos491/?p=145">http://courseblog.cs.princeton.edu/spring05/cos491/?p=145</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        What is being argued is that it is unfair to create a <em>derivative work</em> by blocking out the advertisements.

        A brief look around on the <a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a> site has found no comment from them.

        There seems to be nothing either at the Adblock site <a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org/index.html">http://adblock.mozdev.org/index.html</a> though I think this is an old site as it does not refer to current versions of Firefox.

        I propose taking it further - <a href="AdUnBlockCommunities.html">AdUnBlockCommunities</a>  allowing communities to select which ads they see - moving the control from content provider to consumer, fostering consumer activism, and fund raising using adblock in the negative --<a href="JaysenNaidoo.html">JaysenNaidoo</a>

        The most appropriate response, assuming one can get through to them, is "This is not a Windows machine. There is no IE to run."
