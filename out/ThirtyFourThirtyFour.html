      <p>
        This is the illustration of the different ways dynamic languages could potentially interpret this statement:
      </p>
      <code>
        writeln("34" + 34);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The purpose is to demonstrate all the potential different ways it could in theory be done, yet be an otherwise "normal" looking language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Language #1</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The language (interpreter) looks at the type tag of the right to determine the "assumed type" of the entire expression. In this case the tag is "Number" (or similar) because the expression has no quotes. It thus sees if the left side can be interpreted as a number (via parsing, not tag analysis), converts it to 34 internally and does arithmetic addition to get 68.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Language #2</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The language looks at the type tag of the left to determine the "assumed type" of the entire expression. In this case the tag on the left expression is "string" because the expression has quotes. It thus assumes string concatenation, converts the right-side number to the string "34", and the result is "3434".
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Language #3</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A language looks at the type tag of the first operand, and sees "String" (since it is enclosed in quotes). It then looks at the 2nd operand's type tag, and sees "Number" (because it has no quotes). In this particular language, the tags must be of same type (same tag), or an error is thrown. Since "String" is not "Number", an error is thrown.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Language #4</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A language looks at the type tag of both operands. The first is "String" and the second is "Number" (per above). This particular language has a rule-table like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        Oper A | Oper B | Assumed Type<br/>
        ---------------------------<br/>
        String | String | String<br/>
        String | Number | String<br/>
        Number | String | String<br/>
        Number | Number | Number<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Since it matches the 2nd rule row, String is assumed, and thus concatenation is assumed and the result is "3434".
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Language #5</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A language parses both operands. If both can be interpreted as a number (irregardless of tags or quotes), then addition is assumed. If either side fails to parse as a legitimate number, then string concatenation is assumed. In this case both sides "pass" and the result is 68.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Language #6</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A language sees if the first (left) operand is parsable as a number (irregardless of tags or quotes). If it passes "numberness", then addition is assumed, else concatenation. However, if the second operator cannot be converted to a number (including via parsing), then an error is raised. In this case it's already a number such that the result is 68. (Note that "34" + "34" would also return 68 because parsing would be done if the second operand was not a "native" number.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Language #7</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The language performs the operation on the operands interpreting "+" as addition being that it has operators for concatenation. In the example case, the result would be 68. Languages in this category take the view that if anything is passed to a process it is appropriate to the requirements of that process - i.e. there is no error. If there is in fact erroneous data then the process should fail gracefully. Concatenation is a different operation and would be something like 
      </p>
      <p>
        writeln(concat("34", 34));
      </p>
      <p>
        which would produce "3434"
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> believes that any variable or constant with a tag (primary type) of "string" is parsed to see if it's a number. If it cannot be converted into a number, then an error is raised. In the example case, the result would be 68. If the first operand was "3A" instead of "34", then parsing to a number would fail and an error would be raised. And well that may be true for some language unknown to me, but I reckon the process just fails when it tries to add a string to a number. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are thinking of variation number 8. Variation #7 attempts to "interpret" the operands as numbers. (I should clarify that for the 2nd operand also.) And what you do mean by "languages in this category"? And I'd appreciate it if you don't delete my text if you disagree with it. I put your original at the bottom of this page instead of outright delete it, and expect the same courtesy. (Granted, I should have put a marker in the original place describing the move. My bad on that.) -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I added variation 7 - somebody else added 8. 7 and 8 are the same, so I would delete 8. I won't in case you wrote it. You should since you agree. And I deleted nothing of yours. I respectfully if a little reluctantly (since it is nonsense) copied your text and placed it below the original, rather than leaving it where it changed what I described as variation 7. You deleted my text, not the other way around. Are you deliberately trying to obfuscate it? And why, if so?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There seems to be some confusion here. I'm pretty sure I created #7, but rather than fight over that, maybe we can find a mutual description. My intent is that #8 checks the equivalent of Php's getType() operation on each operand (tag check), and if either one is not a numeric type, it raises an error. #7 would run the equivalent of Php's is_number() on each operand (value check), and if either comes back False, then an error is raised. Otherwise, both operands are parsed/converted to numbers and added together. Essentially #8 must have "native" numbers but #7 will accept foreign born converts "number-able". (Php's "+" is overloaded with concatenation, but the hypothetical language for #7 and #8 is not.) -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Note:</em> Since some do not like my usage of "tag", for this example when I say "tag", you can interpret it to mean the "type" that the quotes indicate. Thus, if a value (constant) has quotes, its tag is "string", but "number" if it does not have quotes. In the tag model, most dynamic languages will set the "tag" based on existence or absence of quotes. (Other syntactical elements may also play a part, depending on the language, but we'll put these aside for this example and just consider "number" and "string".)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Language #8</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This language doesn't do any type conversion (such as parsing to "interpret as") for this operator (unlike #7), and "+" means addition and it has a different operator for concatenation (no overloading). The code as given would trigger an error because the tag of the first operand is not a numeric type, per tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Tags? Both languages 7 and 8 describe a type-handling style which, to me, describes dynamic languages in the context of conventionally typed languages. In dynamic languages, ("true" dynamic languages?), the type of each variable or literal is implicit, not in the definition of the variable, but in the context in which the variable is used. If a function is used, it expects the caller to have passed it valid data. If the data is not valid, the function used would either trigger an exception, or happily use the erroneous data. There are times when this can cause difficult to find errors - for example, say a process had an error which allowed non-numeric data to be passed, say, say to an addition process. I would expect an exception to be raised. However if this data were, coincidentally, a representation of a floating point number, like a product code of "123E05", the addition process would not fail and you could have a subtle (difficult to see) problem within your system.}

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>You're guessing about how languages work.  I describe how they work, without guessing about it.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No. I'm ignoring implementation tradition, per below. I'm only considering the possibilities, and <strong>worrying about implementation later</strong>. If you can prove that one is not possible or too confusing to most programmers, then I'll revisit it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>It's quite evident you're guessing, without knowledge of how operator dispatch is typically implemented.  You appear to want to call that "ignoring implementing tradition", but that's obviously not your motivation.  And it's definitely confusing and certainly doesn't reflect real languages.  "Rule-table"???  Checking to see whether there are quotes???  In a peculiar and highly distorted stretch of reality, you could perhaps argue that these things exist or happen, but you gain no explanatory clarity or power by creating such fictions given what really happens is so simple.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Again, I am NOT cataloging implementation. Thus "knowledge about how they are typically implemented" is meaningless. Nor am I trying to educate regular programmers about "actual" implementation. (At least it's not a top goal.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Then what are you trying to do?</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Illustrate all the possible "processing" variations dynamic languages can have, and possibly serve as a baseboard for future examples.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>You wrote (for example) "A language looks at the type tag of both operands."  That sounds like a description of implementation, rather than a description of behaviour or "'processing' variations".</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's a shortcut for "acts like" it has a tag. We've been over visualization already I thought.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The phrase "has a tag" implies an implementation strategy, because "a tag" is otherwise undefined.  A phrase like "is an integer" or "is of a given type" does not.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "is an integer" doesn't tell us anything specific enough to predict output or form models. It's a fuzzy head notion. As pointed out before, operations like typeName() may seemingly contradict "isNumber()" in terms of "is an X". Thus, they are NOT CLEAR by themselves. And "tag" is something internal to the model: it does not have to be defined in general, just in terms of the model: just like "epicycles" in the epicycle planet model (which technically can be made to forecast accurately, by the way.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What does "is a tag" tell us that "is a type" or "is an integer" does not?  Why would we use epicycles instead of orbits?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Outside of a model, perhaps nothing (clear) in either case. And I am not saying epicycles are "better than" other models, only pointing out that they have meaning WITHIN the model. They are a part in the model's construction and may not correspond to anything outside of the model. Yet a model with <a href="PrivateLanguage.html">PrivateLanguage</a> parts can STILL forecast accurately. Thus, <strong>external meaning of parts is not necessary for a model to forecast accurately</strong>. As I've stated before, I'll take clear internal parts over fuzzy external parts. --top
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>If the "internal parts" aren't defined, they're not "clear"; in fact they're much fuzzier than any "fuzzy external parts."</em>

           <em>I'd hardly expect you to find your own model unclear.  It's unclear to us because parts of your model are undefined and not mapped to the real world.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't know what you would consider "complete". I'd need a reference sample from some other issue in software to see what you have in mind. The PDF you gave is far too large and difficult to serve as an easy-to-digest model for typical programmers. And again, there is NO "real world". Programming languages are abstractions in the head. The closest thing is their input and output. That's what I measure, not actual implementation, which can change in theory without affecting I/O, and so is not a stable reference point. (Plus, it often has efficiency artifacts that are not necessary for other purposes.) If YOU want to model actual implementation, that's fine, but it's not my (main) goal. Knock yourself out. (As a reminder, I include source code of app as "input".)

        <li>
           <em>"Complete" would be explaining the majority of type-related language behaviour in typical imperative programming languages, such that the model would effectively answer common questions that typical programmers are likely to ask about typical languages.

But enough deviation:  Please complete </em><a href="TopsTagModel.html">TopsTagModel</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you mean explaining how typical dynamic languages behave <em>overall</em>, that's not really the job of the tag model. That would take up too many pages and defeat the stated purpose and goals. Instead I give typical and common examples based on such languages for "type related" issues. How expressions are evaluated in general is outside of its scope. But if the programmer has the patience to isolate issues to single operators and simple tests similar to those in <a href="TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion.html">TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion</a>, then the model and related tests should be strait-forward for typical programmers to apply to tease out common type-related behavior of a given language. Thus, if you want a "complete" model interpreter, I'm not going to build one. One would have to build a separate one for each and every language, which is asking too much. Common sense language-specific adaptation is thus required (based on tests and possibly the manual).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>No, I wouldn't expect you to explain typical dynamic languages overall.  Just explaining variables and values or expressions -- at least to the extent done at the top of </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> -- would be reasonable.  For a model intended to be simple and illustrative, particularly for programmers having difficulty with the conventional explanations, requiring that "typical programmers ... tease out common type-related behavior" sounds considerably more difficult (and error-prone, and frustrating) than simply providing an appropriately comprehensive and easy-to-use model.  Indeed, if your intent is genuinely to help programmers experiencing difficulty with conventional explanations, wouldn't it make more sense to help them understand conventional explanations, rather than try to replace them with a whole new model?  Wouldn't it be better to create an explanation of imperative (dynamic) programming language <a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a> behaviour using familiar terminology and concepts -- but clarified and disambiguated -- that meets your standards of clarity, un-ambiguity, and un-fuzziness?<em></em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           As I have repeatedly stated, the existing usage is fuzzy. If I could find a nice way to work existing terminology into the model without problems, I'd do it. So far I haven't, so avoid the problem with "types" by using a diff term. And it seems we both believe we have been clear with our descriptions yet dislike the other guy's description/writeup. I'm getting tired of playing "I'm not fuzzy, you are, no you are fuzzy, no, it's you who's fuzzy...". We are stuck at an impasse. I say let the reader choose the model that best fits their <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>If the existing usage is fuzzy, un-fuzzify it.  Explain it and clarify it.  You add no clarity by merely replacing it and then not defining the replacement.

At least that would give the reader a fair shot at choosing the model that best fits their <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I cannot unfuzzy it without creating contradictions with existing usage. It's just too overloaded for me to fix. Or at least I'm not smart enough to fix that if a solution exists somewhere in the "math of the universe". Your dancing around the cfArgument "type" overlap issue is an example. As far as <a href="TopsTagModel.html">TopsTagModel</a>, I'll leave comments about that under that topic.

      </ul>
      <ul>

        <li>
           "Intended", perhaps, but they fail short of their goal. "Types" is a vague word. Attempts to define have either utterly failed, or have to be limited to a specific domain/language/model and are only clear within that specific model.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When YOU talk about "types", it sometimes doesn't jive with your model's use of it, the cfArgument example being one such case.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>How does cfArgument not "jive" with our model's use of "types"?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your model does not use the part called "type" in your XML representation to model the processing of cfArgument and it's "type" attribute. This makes it confusing to users. The part called "type" in your model has nothing to do with the part called "type" in cfArgument. Further, you say they are somehow all still the same concept, but your model doesn't demonstrate that. They are not the "same concept" <em>in</em> your model. -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>No, it's the same concept.  In Category S languages, strings of characters are parsed during </em><a href="LexicalAnalysis.html">LexicalAnalysis</a> to identify their type.  In Category D1 languages, strings of characters are parsed during <a href="LexicalAnalysis.html">LexicalAnalysis</a> to identify their type.  In Category D2 languages, strings of characters can be parsed at run-time -- using cfArgument -- to identify (via a true/false response) their type.  The fact that in all three language categories, strings of characters can be parsed at run-time to identify (via a true/false response) their type means the mention of cfArgument at the top of <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> is unnecessary -- as it's not a distinguishing characteristic -- but it is notable as being a means by which explicit <a href="TypeChecking.html">TypeChecking</a> can be implemented in Category D2 languages.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Again, it's not the same in your model as described because your model does not use that part to explain cfArgument. That's a true statement. Being a "distinguishing characteristic" is irrelevant to name overloading. Also consider the fact that a D1 language could also posses something like cfArgument that also parses. Thus, being D1 or D2 is not the issue. (D1 languages often use a mixture of parsing and tag analysis, depending on operator etc.)

           That's right: each language can do it differently. But for the illustration we can at least state our assumptions, such as quotes setting the type tag of a var or constant to "string". I've created a specific data structure (XML) to "hold" that setting (tag) in the model so that we don't have to use fuzzy language like "associated with". It's a visual representation of "tag", not a verbal one, which makes it clear that there is only one and only one tag per variable, something verbal modelling can't do very well.

           The XML tells me: 1) It's "stored with" the variable (it's in the var's structure) so that it likely has the same scope and duration as the variable, 2) There is one and only one tag/type attribute because that's the rule of XML.

However, x ---> y is <strong>not</strong> the same as "stored with", because "stored with" implies an implementation structure that does not necessarily exist.  It's also bizarre to call a type a "tag", and you've still not answered my question about what happens to your model if we replace "tag" with "float, boolean, date, integer, etc."  Are you going to answer it?<em></em>

      </ul>

        <li>
           It's "acts like it's stored with", not necessarily actual implementation. Remember, equivalency is allowed in the model as long as it matches I/O. If it came and went independently of the variable, then it would be best to use some kind of indirection in the representation, along with a statement concerning the semi-independence. Without such indirection, it's reasonable to assume they are born and die together (unless stated elsewhere). That's normally how XML is used: you don't jam independent stuff into the same XML tag or tag group.

           The most thorough descriptions involve transforming the XML representation. The other ones are more general (and make no sense to me with your blunt substitution). That's been my goal: to describe the model in terms of "mechanical" changes to a data structure representation that we can all agree on, or at least be familiar with. This is <strong>to avoid excess reliance on English</strong>. "Ignoring the XML" pushes us right back into English Soup.

           Well, to use an IT analogy, one could replace "tag" with "Type ID", which is like a pointer or subscript index to the "current" type. If you stick the entire list in the same context (cell), then it changes the nature of the reference. The closest reworked fit I can think of is, "Type ID where the ID has to be one of the following: float, boolean, integer, etc.".

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Nothing significant. It just seems to me that "ID" is a bit too specific and implies some kind of look-up table. It may be a "type name". Either generally works for modelling since the programmer usually cannot see the "ID" itself. In tests, one can only see the name usually (as output), not internal ID's, such that it's simpler to model most languages via type name to prevent a mapping step. (We don't really care about efficiency and space for this modelling.)

           <em>So you could replace "tag" in your model descriptions and illustrations with "TypeName", and nothing would change?</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It may cause confusion with functions/methods called "typeName" in some langs. "Type ID" would perhaps be a better choice.

        <li>
           I believe so. I haven't found a flaw with the idea so far, but then again, we could call it a zopmiff and the model would still do its job. The main concern is to not have the model user confuse it stuff outside of the model, which is a weakness of your model (if I understand it correctly).

           cfArgument only ensures that a variable passes a numeric "parse test". That's all we can say about the pass/resulting var since CF lacks ways to test for the tag (such as a typeName()-like function). In tagged dynamic languages, there are two possible ways to "implement" parameters specified to "be" a given type: 1. They simply pass a parse test but their tag is not changed (typeName(x) could return "String" for "123", yet let it pass thru and still be "string" per typeName.), 2. The tag is changed to be "integer" (or "numeric") in the function after parsing. (In both cases, an error is thrown if there is no way to convert to a number.) Actually, there's a 3rd option: Don't allow the variable unless its tag is already a numeric type, but this is rare in practice, for it reduces dynamicness.

        </li>
      </ul>

           Two programs producing the same output doesn't necessarily mean they are equivalent. "print('4');" and "print(2+2);" produce the same result, but most would agree they are not equivalent. And we've been over the word "do" already. You haven't defined it clearly enough so far. Note that I could call what CF is "doing" to be "parsed-based run-time parameter validation". The C version does not check at run-time. We could test this by reading a value from user input and passing it to the function.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>"Do" is what happens when a program runs.  Why does it matter whether </em><a href="TypeChecking.html">TypeChecking</a> is "parsed-based" or not?  It's still <a href="TypeChecking.html">TypeChecking</a>.  Why does "run-time" matter?  True, the C version does not perform type checking at run-time, but if it did, it wouldn't (by definition!) be a statically-typed language.  Doesn't that mean you're actually saying that <a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a> is dynamically typed and C is statically typed?  If so, that does nothing to contradict the fact that <cfargument ...> in <a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a> is using a statically-typed (that's the "type=" attribute) parameter declaration (that's the <cfargument name="..."> tag and 'name' attribute) to perform <a href="TypeChecking.html">TypeChecking</a> (i.e., it fails if the argument does not match the type specified in the "type=" attribute) on function arguments (which is why it's called <cfargument ...>).<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The issue is not whether "type checking" took place, but whether both code samples are "semantically equivalent". 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Further, in dynamic languages, the operator tends to determine what a "type" is, not the value. Some ops look at the tag (if there is one), some parse. See <a href="DynamicTypesAreQuantum.html">DynamicTypesAreQuantum</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I don't know what "the tag" means, but it's certainly true that operators can interpret values how they like.  That's true in every language.  For example, in C, I can write a function called isOdd(int v) that returns 'true' if an integer is odd.  I can then write a function called printIfOdd(int v) that uses isOdd() to (say) halt the program if v is even so it only accepts odd integer values.  In that case, the operator is determining what a type is, not the value.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That contradicts "I define "type" as a set of values and associated operations." Or perhaps I'm no clear on what you mean by "associated".

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           We've been over this already. Everything in the universe is potentially "associated" in some way. Without some objective way to measure associated-ness, it's just a fuzzy head notion that varies per head. Further, associations should affect the I/O of the model or probably be discarded since they may end up distracting the reader. If it serves a purpose, then demonstrate it serving a purpose in your model, else toss it.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>We've been over what "associated with" means: "x is associated with y" is shorthand for "given x, we know y" or "given x, we can answer questions about y".  For example, "a variable is associated with a type" means that given a variable, we can answer questions about its type.  That does </em>'not<em>' mean everything in the universe is potentially "associated" in some way.  Given my cat's name, for example, you can't answer questions about tomorrow's weather because they are not associated.  Now:  What part of the above contradicts the definition of "type" as a set of values and associated operations?  Remember, "associated" means "given a set of values, we can answer questions about its operations."</em>

      </ul>

           But it leaves too many unanswered questions. I made a list of questions it does not answer by itself somewhere. You suggested that your English sufficiently answered all of those, but it did not and you were wrong. I'll see if I can find the list.

           The "data definition" is a representation of a "reference". "Reference" is a high-level abstraction (largely "in the head"), and "data definition" is a mid-level abstraction. (Specific byte layouts etc. would be the low-level). Thus, they are not mutually exclusive. And again, I'd like to avoid the word "type", or at least de-emphasize it, because of the overloading with parsed-value-based "types". I can fairly safely use "tag" by itself in descriptions, but not "ID". "Tag" is also a nice visual metaphor in that it's "attached" to the variable in a spot we know where to find, yet is not the primary part. The shirt is visible to the public, but not the tag (normally), yet we know right where to look to find out what's on it. (New-fangled clothing often prints directions on the inside of shirts such that there is no little white square anymore. Thus, in 50 years the association may not make sense. But in 50 years, Ceylons will be doing all the programming anyhow.)

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What do you mean by "[t]he 'data definition' is a representation of a 'reference'" and "'[r]eference' is a high-level abstraction ... and 'data definition' is a mid-level abstraction"?  A reference generally means a pointer or a unique identifier.  What it points to or identifies could be a "data definition", and that generally means a concrete specification of data elements.  For example, a 'struct' in C may be considered a "data definition", but it's a rather archaic term.  It's been largely superseded by more specific terminology.  I get your "tag" metaphor, but it's meaningless without some indication as to what's printed on the tag, and why.  That's fully implied by "type"; completely evaded with "tag".</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Sorry, you lost me. "Concrete" values of the tag (the set of all possible "type ID's") depend on the specific language being modeled and are obtained by reading the manual, observation, and hopefully experimentation. Same with your model. There are gazillion ways to model/emulate an interpreter for a given language, and for our purposes they are ALL "correct" if they predict I/O accurately within an acceptable time. On can use C struc's, gerbils, Legos, paramecium, and horses.

        <li>
           <em>Without some indication of what a "tag" is, it's not clear what connection it has to the real world, and I thought your model didn't rely on "reading the manual."  We don't use the term "tag" in discussing </em><a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a> behaviour in popular imperative programming languages, so its use is confusing.

           Not the "real world" debate yet again. Sigh. Again, how do we measure "connection to the real world"? If you say your ass is more "real world" than my ass, how do we objectively measure that? Is there a machine we can put our asses into and get a reading on dial? (TSA?)

           "Reference" is an abstract fuzzy head notion. "Data structure" is a notational or binary convention to "encode" or solidify that abstraction in a way that readers can relate to and use. I'm sure people spoke of "adding" before written math was invented, but the notation of math made it easier to share such common notions. But remember, <a href="TheMapIsNotTheTerritory.html">TheMapIsNotTheTerritory</a>; there are many different ways to encode "adding" and math in general.

           <em>There's nothing "abstract fuzzy head notion" about a reference.  In Java, for example, "String p = new String()" means p is a reference to a String, which means it exhibits certain predictable and consistent behaviour.  How is that an "abstract fuzzy head notion".</em>

      </ul>
