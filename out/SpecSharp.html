        The Spec# programming system is a new attempt at a more cost effective way to develop and maintain high-quality software.  Spec# is pronounced "Spec sharp" and can be written (and searched for) as the "specsharp" or "Spec# programming system".  The Spec# system consists of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Spec# programming language.  Spec# is an extension of the <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> language <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a>.  It extends the type system to include non-null types and <a href="CheckedException.html">CheckedException</a>s.  It provides method contracts in the form of pre- and <a href="PostCondition.html">PostCondition</a>s as well as <a href="ClassInvariant.html">ClassInvariant</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>
           The Spec# compiler.  Integrated into the Microsoft <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> development environment for the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> platform, the compiler statically enforces non-null types, emits run-time checks for method contracts and invariants, and records the contracts as metadata for consumption by downstream tools.
        </li>
        <li>
           The Spec# static program verifier.  This component (codenamed Boogie) generates logical verification conditions from a Spec# program.  Internally, it uses an automatic theorem prover that analyzes the verification conditions to prove the correctness of the program or find errors in it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A unique feature of the Spec# programming system is its guarantee of maintaining invariants in object-oriented programs in the presence of callbacks, threads, and inter-object relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Spec# programming system is being developed as a research project at Microsoft Research in Redmond, primarily by the Programming Languages and Methods group.
