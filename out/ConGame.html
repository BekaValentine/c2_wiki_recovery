        A con man sold the Eiffel Tower to a couple of Japanese industrialists. He said the French were fed-up with it and they wanted to sell it to scrap. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And the Japanese bought the Eiffel Tower along with the schemer's story! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Well when they went to get the Tower the next day, their welcome was not as sweet as they had expected!

        A salesperson for TLA, Inc comes up to you and says he has a terrific product that will solve all your development problems. Because it's near the end of the quarter and he's looking to make his number, he offers you a one-time deal, $3500/seat.  You buy ten.  You get back to the office, open the box, and inside is a CD filled with software you could have downloaded off the Internet for free, but it includes a fancy TLA-brand installer and gui administrative tool. You just paid $3500 for an install script and a web page.

        Salesperson tells you that this product is really great, but could you please send $400 more for the support toolkit. And $1500/month for "maintenance".  Just a few hundred dollars more and we'll give you an upgrade that solves some of the problems you're having.  And so on. -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>
