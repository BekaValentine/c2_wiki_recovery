        Programmer Type
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> about Programmers as a people pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have friends who are not programmers, but have association with programmers (e.g. partners), they may tell you a story about the <a href="ProgrammerType.html">ProgrammerType</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stereotyped programmer is constantly charged with adrenalin, perpetually stressed, and typically narrow minded.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would argue that <a href="ProgrammerType.html">ProgrammerType</a> is just plain folks who are more stress tolerant than the average person. However the constant stress do create emotional outbursts that do not help their image. 
      </p>
      <p>
        These people are incredibly focussed on their work and interests, and can therefore give the impression of narrow-mindedness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ProgrammerType.html">ProgrammerType</a> need the other types of people to mingle with, even on a <a href="ProgrammerType.html">ProgrammerType</a> wiki.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I suggest this topic be moved and changed to ProfessionStereotypes. Every profession has a stereotype(s) associated with it. For example, sales people are assumed to be manipulative and untruthful.

        <em>Programmer's don't need non-programmer social interaction on a programmer's wiki(they need technical info). For human contact, The </em><a href="BigBlueRoom.html">BigBlueRoom</a> is the way to go.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please examine <a href="WelcomeVisitors.html">WelcomeVisitors</a> again. It has been refactored by many people. The second paragraph refer to focus on <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> in <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>. The word People comes first. Within the <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> the first paragraph ended with Be kind and use understanding. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, when we talk about people historically there are writers, managers, psychologists, thinkers.... Of course programmers are there as well.
