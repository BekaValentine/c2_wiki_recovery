        Sometimes it is useful [in <a href="RiskManagement.html">RiskManagement</a>] to make a <a href="RiskTree.html">RiskTree</a>, decomposing risks you encounter down to a level where they are easier to manage. This can help target <a href="RiskReduction.html">RiskReduction</a> resources. We found too that some very different risks had similar or identical reduction strategies. That was sweet since doing one set of risk reduction helped in reducing multiple risks. --<a href="DaveVanBuren.html">DaveVanBuren</a>.....
