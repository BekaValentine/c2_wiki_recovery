        Homoiconic Language Drawbacks

      </p>
      <p>
        Well, maybe this is the problem. Other languages may not have as a good syntax-to-structure design, but by not trying they make it easier to use structures themselves, i.e. datastructures not bound to syntax structure. There seems to be a cost lisp pays to keep the syntax simple enough to be close to the internal data structure, which is mainly that everything must be built as nested lists. Lisp's attempt at easy swappability between syntax and structure requires crippling the data structure power to some extent. <strong>I would rather have powerful structures than simple syntax-to-structure swappability.</strong> In designing a language, I would rather start with datastructures first and work backward toward syntax compatibility. <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a> is too grand to sacrifice. If an easy one-to-one translation cannot be provided, then give up the easy swappability goal. (BTW, I don't "hate lisp". I just think it is oversold.) Text is one-dimensional, and to represent anything more complex (or richer) than trees, your text gets ugly simply because a 1D structure has inborn representational limits. -- top

           Not true at all, and a random misinformed opinion by Top (who does <strong>not</strong> grok Lisp) surely doesn't need to be enshrined for posterity by moving it to its own page.

        <li>
           The central problem here is the assumption that Lisp is paying a cost, and that the cost is "crippling the data structure power to some extent". That is simply false. Lisp has a rich variety of data structures, for one thing, and secondly, it is widely understood to be a <strong>good</strong> thing about Lisp that one can prototype most things using only lists if one desires, because that vastly simplifies prototyping. And nothing then prevents later optimization of the prototype to use data structures other than lists. Or one can use non-lists right from the start if one wishes.

      </p>
      <p>
        As to how homiconicity and halting problem are related, they aren't in general, except when it comes to program transformation.  A function  "instrumenter: s-expression -> s-expression" will not be able to decide which part of the input tree is code and which part of the tree is data. The same goes about a TCL program, which you claim to be homoiconic, but instrumenting TCL programs is just as unfeasible. In general, even if you modify the interpreter (which was not part of your example), you won't be able to quantify the dead code in the program because there's no algorithm to separate what is code and what is data. And I'm not talking here about self-modifying programs, I'm talking here about purely functional programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>All true. And the same applies to any system that generates code dynamically, which is a larger class than what "self-modifying" usually refers to. Pragmatically, however, this would be solved by modifying the code generator, or the eval, or add tags to the quoted code-as-data, or something, to force the instrumentation to happen in the right places, since obviously it would be hopeless to attempt to solve the general </em><a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> in the course of implementing instrumentation.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is not a flaw of homoiconic languages nor of code generation systems, however, since after all the only way around it is to remove the ability to manipulate code dynamically. It </em>'is<strong> an example of the </strong><a href="PrincipleOfLeastPower.html">PrincipleOfLeastPower</a>, and why it is sometimes better to use e.g. XML than e.g. Lisp; the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> doesn't arise in XML.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, ok, maybe there's a case to be made for it being a flaw. Hmm... No, it's like I said, the point is merely that one would need to modify eval to do the instrumentation. The confusion here would seem to arise from the implied thought that "you can't statically change source code in a homoiconic language in order to add instrumentation", but that problem arises in non-homoiconic languages that do anything with generated code, too. So instrumentation of dynamic code must be done dynamically, by eval, by a code generator, whatever. That's all. -dm</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I do see what you are getting at. If instrumenting conditionals, how do you decide whether quoted lists starting with 'cond' or 'if' are simply data (a list of keywords, say) or code blocks that might be evaluated later? When <a href="CodeIsData.html">CodeIsData</a>, there are some corner-cases you need to account for. This kind of thing doesn't happen when instrumenting C code (reminiscent of the difference between <a href="VonNeumannArchitecture.html">VonNeumannArchitecture</a> and <a href="HarvardArchitecture.html">HarvardArchitecture</a>). -- <a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a>

      <p>
        The supposed flaw in an instrumentation function's ability to handle eval is not a problem. Here's the original code:
      </p>
      <code>
        ((if (halting-question?) eval length)<br/>
        '(if #t (cons (proc1) (proc1))<br/>
        (cons (proc1) (proc2))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If this is the body of a function, and the task is to time each expression that makes up the body of the function, then it's a single expression and no further examination of subexpressions is necessary. This may seem like a cop-out, but it's actually the most natural interpretation of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the task is extended to require timing each subexpression lexically present in the function body, then there are nine  additional subexpressions to be instrumented (assuming Scheme, where the first argument of an expression is treated as a subexpression):
      </p>
      <code>
        (if (halting-question?) eval length)<br/>
        '(if #t (cons (proc1) (proc1)) (cons (proc1) (proc2)))<br/>
        if<br/>
        quote [implied by ']<br/>
        (quote (if #t (cons (proc1) (proc1)) (cons (proc1) (proc2)))<br/>
        (halting-question?)<br/>
        eval<br/>
        length<br/>
        halting-question?<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The arguments to QUOTE are of course not evaluated, so none of them constitute subexpressions that need to be timed. Again, no problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The notion that you have to worry about what's handed to eval would only arise if the requirement were to also instrument every expression in all called functions, which seems unreasonable. In the more general case, the data handed to eval may not even be a part of the function being evaluated, it might be data passed in as an argument or taken from a symbol value. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if eval were treated as a special case in the requirements, just to force the point that someone is trying to make, well, even this can be handled fairly trivially. The instrumented body of the function could take this basic form sort (assuming my recollection of Scheme is correct):
      </p>
      <code>
        (let ((system-eval eval))<br/>
        (let ((eval (lambda (code) (system-eval (instrument code)))))<br/>
        ... instrumented code ...))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Feel free to correct the above code fragment if it needs it. :) This would probably need to be embellished to omit the instrumenter's execution overhead from timing of the intercepted calls to EVAL.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main point seems to be that an instrumenter "...will not be able to decide which part of the input tree is code and which part of the tree is data". I disagree. From the point of view of a particular program fragment, it seems that it's always decidable based on lexical information. If a Lisp-family instrumenter can examine all the code in the function being instrumented, it can always determine which is the case <em>from the point of view of the function being instrumented</em>. An instrumenter, like most code-walkers, may of course have to include special handling for special forms (e.g. QUOTE -- but note that EVAL is not even a special form). The shift of viewpoint from data to code occurs <em>inside</em> EVAL; the situation within the lexical scope of an eval-calling function is unambiguous.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd love to see a true counter-example.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could force the issue further by requiring that you instrument every s-expression lexically present in the target function that will <em>eventually</em> be treated as code, but not s-expression which are <em>not</em> lexically contained in the target function. That would seem to be the interpretation of the requirements that makes the example relevant. But this is an impossible problem no matter how you slice it, and is not related to homoiconicity. Even if the instrumenter examined all called functions, decisions on whether a literal fragment is eventually treated as data or code could depend on user input or states outside of the call tree being examined.

              It doesn't piss me off now, it didn't piss me off then, but I consider a waste of time to discuss with people who take the liberty of rewriting somebody else's code which is integral part of the argument, not a refactoring challenge. And in particular after a previous paragraph that was in response to Ian, explicitly referred to "the second if in the example below" was rendered illogical by a modification that no other person that I know of would have undertaken. You just don't do it.

            <li>
              Nevermind that if you paid attention to the if or not it's completely illogical to provide rewritten code because even if the new code produces the same result (which it didn't), path coverage can be wildly different.

        Ah, I confused this with the earlier request, my apologies. However, I don't think that it materially changes the argument. Before putting much more effort into this, I'd like to know what this has to do with homoiconicity. If nothing, then determine if it's interesting in and of itself, and if so, move this to a different page for that topic (whatever it might be -- <a href="LispCodeWalkerChallenges.html">LispCodeWalkerChallenges</a>?).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, you need to clarify the requirements. Add instrumentation to all if statements of <em>what</em>? A single function? All code in a given source file? Any data in such that might eventually be interpreted as code? Or ...? "Program" is ambiguous; it can refer to a single function or expression in <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>. In your example, the list (if ...) is clearly data -- and thus not part of the program's code, except as literal data. So you really seem to want to instrument if statements that appear in data, which is a different problem, very difficult unless calls to EVAL (and perhaps related functions, such as COMPILE) can be intercepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made an error in the above, in that the rebinding of eval is lexical, not global. In <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, one might have to operate on all relevant code and replace references to EVAL by references to a replacement function's symbol. This, of course, can fail to work with particularly tricky types of code, unless the interpreter has special knowledge of certain built-in functions. Perhaps this can be more easily solved in Scheme?

        To make a long story short here's a C program:

        return table[0](0);<br/>
        }<br/>

        ((eval (cdr (assoc 0 table))) false)<br/>

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I'm fairly certain the above doesn't qualify as a 'drawback' of Homoiconic languages, any more than it is a 'drawback' that gcc and gcov can't handle calculating which 'if' conditionals will run when the core is written as an evaluator over complex data.
      </p>
      <p>
        A comparable Scheme program would be:
      </p>
      <code>

        (define g (lambda (x) (if x 1 0)))<br/>

        Is it right to say that this is somehow a real Drawback of <a href="HomoiconicLanguages.html">HomoiconicLanguages</a>?  I'd argue that you can't call something a <strong>drawback</strong> until you have a strong position from which to <strong>draw back</strong>.  C can represent data, but makes doing so far more difficult than Scheme, to the point that casually describing 'table' as was done in the argument above is a headache in the making.  C, however, is turing complete; providing an equivalent program to the original Scheme representation and eval is certainly possible.  Asking that the Scheme instrumenter be able to perform a more complicated task than the C instrumenter is reasonable if it is easier to do... but calling a failure to do so a drawback of any sort is quite dishonest.  If Scheme's instrumenter can handle the same cases as Cs, and can be written with greater ease, that's an advantage, not a drawback.  --DB
