        Who am I?  Googler, developer, co-creator of Dagger 1.x and 2.x, the Truth testing and assertion framework, and a variety of smaller things or changes to existing things in the Java open-source space.

        I've done Agile for large chunks of my career, and done a test-forward approach, whether acceptance or unit (or both, as relevant).  My old consulting firm is to be found at <a href="http://www.israfil.net/,">http://www.israfil.net/,</a> though I am now working for Google.  I've also worked for Sun, Oracle, Deloitte, and a host of banks and financial institutions.
