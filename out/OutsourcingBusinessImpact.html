        Besides language, big cultural gaps exist in "value systems", legal matters, organization cultural mismatches.

        Even between people who work in the same building, speak the same language, grew up in the same local area, and meet face to face several times a week, it is easy to have miscommunications about desires, specifications, timelines, and such.  These problems can only be compounded if contact is limited to the telephone or email.
