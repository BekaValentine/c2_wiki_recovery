        Oop Debate Meta Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        The large volumes of pros/cons in the Great OOP Debate have generated controversy about how and where to organize and put them. Let's work something out and reach a consensus rather than get caught up in another placement <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> (such as the one that erupted around Dec. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
        I propose we isolate common themes, such as reuse, project/app size, duplication reduction, mapping to mental models, encapsulation, etc., and put the pros and cons under each of those topics. Perhaps sub-topics in pages such as <a href="OopArgumentsDebatesAndDiscussion.html">OopArgumentsDebatesAndDiscussion</a> can be spun off if they reach say 4 screens worth?
