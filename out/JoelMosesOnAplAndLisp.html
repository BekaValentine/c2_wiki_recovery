        Joel Moses On Apl And Lisp
      </h1>
      <p>
        "APL is like a diamond. It has a beautiful crystal structure; all of its parts are related in a uniform and elegant way. But if you try to extend this structure in any way - even by adding another diamond - you get an ugly kludge. LISP, on the other hand, is like a ball of mud. You can add any amount of mud to it and it still looks like a ball of mud." -- <a href="JoelMoses.html">JoelMoses</a>

           Nobody bothered answering this question.  After some Googling around, I found out that the diamond character 'â—‡' allowed multiple statements per line of text; it was APL's semicolon. --SamuelFalvo

        <em>One of the characteristics of APL was its use of weird characters not available on a typical keyboard.  A diamond would be quite appropriate.</em>

        Was that intended as a compliment or a criticism of LISP[1], or perhaps a back-handed compliment?
