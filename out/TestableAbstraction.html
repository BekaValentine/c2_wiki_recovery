        One dependency breaking technique that I'm having trouble naming goes
        like this:

        You have a class with many dependencies.  Only part of it needs to be
        under test to make the changes you need, so extract a superclass that
        contains those features and make it abstract by suppling only
        protected constructors.  Then make a concrete subclass of it with a
        public constructor.  Test that class.  I learned the technique from
        JacqueMorel, but we haven't come up with a nice name for it yet.  By
        its mechanics, it is very similar to '<a href="ExtractSuperclass.html">ExtractSuperclass</a>' but the
        intent is different.

        Interesting.  I encountered a similar situation today while teaching a <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>
        class.  I vote for "<a href="TestableAbstraction.html">TestableAbstraction</a>".
