        Proposed Plop Policies

        PLoP is a Trademark of the <a href="HillsideGroup.html">HillsideGroup</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original motivation for trademarking the name was to
        be able to guarantee some uniform Quality to these forums.
        So far the Quality has been upheld largely by the overlap
        in membership from <a href="PlopConference.html">PlopConference</a> to <a href="PlopConference.html">PlopConference</a>.
        That would have been the ideal way to sustain
        the Quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The community has grown and there are details that
        both matter and that elude a common base of understanding.
        The example that elicited the creation of this page was
        a repeated instance of authors submitting a paper to
        PLoP, enjoying the benefit of shepherding, and then
        declining to attend the conference.
        There was a common understanding that submission
        to the process implied commitment to attending
        the conference.
        But I'm not sure it's a policy that is universally
        understood across the pattern community.
        There is no explicit incentive to adhere to this
        policy (if it is indeed a policy) nor disincentive to
        violating it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's just one example. There are more.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I propose here is a <em>minimal</em> set of policies
        for the <a href="PlopConference.html">PlopConference</a> community.
        I'm hopeful that <a href="HillsideGroup.html">HillsideGroup</a> can take over ownership of
        these and use them as a consideration in granting
        the use of the term <em>PLoP</em> to aspiring groups.
        These policies can also help unify the administrative
        superstructure of the existing PLoPs.
        It can give PLoPs the teeth they need to
        guide participants from outside the pattern
        community into the practices of our community.
        And it provides a forum for these values and
        practices to evolve as we learn from each other,
        both within our community and otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of these policies should not be to homogenize
        the PLoP culture;  each <a href="PlopConference.html">PlopConference</a> is unique.
        However, the pattern community builds on hitherto
        unspoken principles.
        It would be a good exercise to evaluate our
        common principles and to articulate them.

        If you're a member of the <a href="PatternCommunity.html">PatternCommunity</a>, please
        join in here.
        Please keep it minimal.
        Let's try to capture the <em>essence of PLoPness</em> rather than a set of rules.
        Keep recommendations to simple and direct
        English without legalese: phrases that are easy
        to understand, easy to follow, and to which compliance
        is easy to judge.

      <ol>
        <li>
          	PLoP attendees expect authors of PLoP papers to join them at the PLoP to which the paper was submitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          	When resources (such as lodging) are limited, attendance priority belongs with authors of accepted works.
        </li>
        <li>
          	Every author has a right to EffectiveShepherding.
        </li>
        <li>
          	Every author has a responsibility to do DutifulRevision.
        </li>
        <li>
          	A <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a> participant commits himself or herself to attend all sessions of that workshop unless granted leave by the workshop.
        </li>
        <li>
          	A <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a> participant has a responsibility to study the submissions to that workshop in advance, preferably before the conference.
        </li>
        <li>
          	No author may have more than two works submitted to a single PLoP. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               What about a person who is coauthor on 2 papers? In theory this doesn't dilute the workshop too much. Coauthoring more than 2 would seem to be too much. I think this also depends upon how many other authors are at the plop. But we can be pragmatic: do we have enough papers at PLoPs? If so, we can forbid coauthorship :-)
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Being coauthor on two papers does not violate the policy, and I think such cases should be allowed.  We should encourage co-authorship! But it leads to a pragmatic consideration that all the papers be handled in a single workshop, by policy #5 above.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          	No work may be under consideration for acceptance at any venue other than PLoP between the time it is submitted and the time the author submits the final version for publication in the PLoP proceedings.  (alternative option to consider: until after the paper is workshopped at the PloP). 
        </li>
        <li>
          	In the event that no paper authors are able to attend a PLoP, the paper will not be workshopped at that PLoP.  Authors may resubmit such papers to  subsequent PLoPs: however they <em>must</em> notify that PLoP's chair that this is a submission of an unworkshopped paper  from another PLoP <em>before submitting the paper</em>.  The subsequent PLoP's chair has absolute discretion to reject the paper outright, to accept the paper to a workshop without shepherding (assuming it has been shepherded before) or to accept the paper into shepherding as normal.
        </li>
        <li>
          	Authors are expected to give back to the community by becoming shepherds themselves. They should attend shepherding training, which should be provided at each PLoP. [<em>While this is a </em><a href="GoodIdea.html">GoodIdea</a> that we should encourage, I don't know if it's a policy we should enforce.<em> </em>Well, the proposed policy says "expected", not "required". Making it a policy instills it into the culture, which is where we need it.<em>]</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          	Shepherds should bear credentials. One of several qualifying credentials is that they have published at least two pattern works. [<em>Maybe this could be put on a </em>ProposedShepherdingPolicy page.<em>]</em>
