        Real Deadline
      </h1>
      <p>
        As opposed to an <a href="ArtificialDeadline.html">ArtificialDeadline</a>; a <strong>Real Deadline</strong> is one that really matters from a business perspective (i.e., profitability, competitiveness, contract commitments, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some deadlines should be ignored or at least mitigated (but not to the point that your job is at risk). These are the <a href="ArtificialDeadline.html">ArtificialDeadline</a>s. The real ones should be respected. Sometimes the difference between the two is not so obvious.

        Real Deadlines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The new toy or game must be ready for Christmas sales.
        </li>
        <li>
           The spacecraft must launch by this date, or we'll miss <some opportune and relatively infrequent planetary alignment>.
        </li>
        <li>
           If it's not demo-able by <a href="JavaOne.html">JavaOne</a>, that would be bad.
        </li>
      </ul>
