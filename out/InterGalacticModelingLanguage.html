        Inter Galactic Modeling Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        The IGML (<a href="InterGalacticModelingLanguage.html">InterGalacticModelingLanguage</a> ) is a modeling language with one element:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Line
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using The Line, you can make Boxes and Labels. For further information, see the <a href="GalacticModelingLanguage.html">GalacticModelingLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My nano-bot friends on the far fringes of the galaxy claim to use a set elements that's even simpler - The Point - for a truly </em>UniversalModelingLanguage.  (They just put together an infinite number of them to build the more complex elements.  ;-)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually there is only one point. It doesn't matter how many copies you have - unless you have at least a line to cover with 'em, there is only one.
      </p>

        <em>My boss has two points.</em>

        Are there already code generators available that generate C++ from IGML? I mean non-human ones. -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are code generators that do it the other way round ...</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Now, take away <em>The Point</em> and spend the next day really listening to the users stories.  When the software designer is ready, the UML will appear.

        <em>Spending time listening to user stories is a good way to find the point...</em>
