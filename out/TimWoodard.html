        Just started out with XP...
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been suprised at the response of the team here.  Everyone is signing up for it.  Sure, there are the normal questions (like, "where's the documentation", etc), but these pages have been very helpful in answering those questions to the satisfaction of us developers.

        I will continue to update this area with the results of our adoptation of XP.  So far, so good...

        Things have been slower going than I had expected.  This has partly been a result of people being in and out of the office.  It's hard to get the ball rolling without everyone present.  How do you do an iteration planning meeting when a fourth of the team is gone?

        Until now, we've mostly been doing <a href="DeveloperOnlyXp.html">DeveloperOnlyXp</a>.  Yesterday, one of the VP asked, "What are all these cards about?"  So soon we (the team) will be presenting XP to the <a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a>s :)  I am anticipating mixed reactions, but the VP is a sharp guy who has been a part of the BigMethodology way of doing things and I think, from the brief conversations that we've had, that he understands the ideas and objectives of XP.

        One problem I've been trying to deal with is not having an <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a>.  We're working on more of an R&D project, and the people that we're working for don't seem to be too interested in being that involved with what we're doing.  So we've had to do our best (with some help from management) at identifying user stories and business value.  I know this isn't the best way to do things, but I don't know what choice I have.

        REALLY been a while since my last update.  I still work at <a href="DiamondVisionics.html">DiamondVisionics</a> by the way.  Over the last number of years, we have floated in and out of consistently applying <a href="AgileProcesses.html">AgileProcesses</a>.  I am now the Director of Engineering, so there is obviously more management buy in... :)  Now we are using the <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a> and it is working quite well for us.  It has helped to provide a greater level of visibility of the team's progress to everyone in the company.
