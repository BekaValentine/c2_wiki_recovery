        Technical talks given at Google (by Googlers or invited speakers) and made available to the public on video. Many of them are not strongly related to computing, and some are in fact not very technical. Talks at Google which aren't classified as Tech Talks appear as TalksAtGoogle (or AtGoogleTalks ) on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AtGoogleTalks">http://www.youtube.com/user/AtGoogleTalks</a> and the appropriate sections of <a href="http://video.google.com/googleplex.html">http://video.google.com/googleplex.html</a> . The talks appeared first on Google Video, then also on <a href="YouTube.html">YouTube</a> after Google bought it up. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-friends/browse_thread/thread/2711ef5fe7d25570">http://groups.google.com/group/google-friends/browse_thread/thread/2711ef5fe7d25570</a> appears to be the original Tech Talks announcement.

        The quality of the talks varies widely, and for many of the better ones the same talk (or something very similar by the same author) has also been recorded and publicly released by others. But that's fair enough for what is basically an omnibus or fire-hydrant of many or most of the general talks given at Google.
