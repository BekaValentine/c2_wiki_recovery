        Definite Payoff

      <p>
        Requirements can be regarded as a gamble. You bet a certain amount of resource, and if you figure the odds right you get paid. Even when you're salaried, you get a type of pay - business continuity and the trust of your boss and/or client. So you need to think about the odds. In general it's much better to build something with a <a href="DefinitePayoff.html">DefinitePayoff</a> than something that just <a href="MightPayoff.html">MightPayoff</a>. But better still if it's an <a href="ImmediatePayoff.html">ImmediatePayoff</a> ...

      <p>
        A <a href="DefinitePayoff.html">DefinitePayoff</a> is a statement that <a href="YouAreGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAreGonnaNeedIt</a>.  This judgment should be made with caution.  Is there an explicit <a href="UserRequirement.html">UserRequirement</a> for this feature, or is it only something you think you need.  Beware of assuming <a href="TheCustomersAreIdiots.html">TheCustomersAreIdiots</a>.
