        Slow Learner
      </h1>
      <p>
        When I was very young, the school system informed my parents that I was a "slow learner." As I grew older, they said just the opposite. I really wasn't doing anything different, so which categorization was more correct?
      </p>
      <p>
        Surprise, surprise, they were dead wrong both times. No, in fact it's obvious that I'm a <em>non</em>-learner. I can prove this. How many opportunities have I had today for learning. Dozens? Hundreds? Now multiply that by the number of days that I've been alive. And how many experiences have I actually <em>learned</em> from? You see my point.
      </p>
      <p>
        But wouldn't it be great if I <em>could</em> be a slow learner. If all of my experiences gradually improved my awareness and my character. If listening to someone's beliefs was never a waste of time. If I viewed learning as a process rather than a goal. If I always sought perfection but could be pleased with mere progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I could be a <a href="SlowLearner.html">SlowLearner</a>, that would also imply that I:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Remember the things I've learned and integrate them into my actions
        </li>
        <li>
           Have patience to devote the time necessary to really learn a subject
        </li>
        <li>
           Seek out the experts on a subject and absorb everything I can from them
        </li>
        <li>
           Find value in many different sources 
        </li>
        <li>
           Am not afraid of being called slow, freeing me to learn subjects that don't fall within my natural talents
        </li>
        <li>
           Accept advice graciously
        </li>
        <li>
           Take time to understand another viewpoint whether or not I agree with it
        </li>
        <li>
           Am better able to help others learn; I'd be more aware of the steps of the learning process
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course, there's such a thing as being too slow. Look how many years it took me to realize that I want to try to be a <a href="SlowLearner.html">SlowLearner</a>. Hey, I might <em>be</em> one by now if I'd realized this sooner! Oh wait, it's not about being, it's about becoming, isn't it :)

        Or could it be about being, and becoming is describing an expectation?

        Cool! I had no idea. Upon investigation of this book, one quote from the Introduction struck me in particular: 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Do not underestimate the shallowness of my understanding."</dd>

        There is also value in forgetting.
