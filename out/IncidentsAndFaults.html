        Incidents And Faults
      </h1>
      <p>
        It should be a given that the same bug can cause different apparent problems to different users. It is also possible that a single reported problem may be traceable of multiple different faults.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Several reported failures that arise out of the same fault should be tracked together. Consider splitting a single bug with multiple causes into a bug for each fault, and relate them as above.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The bug tracking software must support the ability to associate bugs as duplicates of and dependent on other bugs. Splitting a single bug or otherwise tracking related bugs without good support from the tool requires too much manual overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do we have two entities here?  When I worked at a </em>BigCompany, our tracking software had separate record types for bug reports and the underlying issues that caused them.  Just a suggestion.<em></em>
