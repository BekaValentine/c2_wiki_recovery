        I am interested in a softwares position that embraces my skill as a problem
        solver and encourages group work, egalitarian coordination, close customer 
        contact, and many values of Extreme Programming. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I will also consult on the implementation of XP, collaborative methods and 
        automated methods.

        <strong>Experience</strong>
        June 2000 - August 2002. <strong>Developer.</strong> <a href="ThoughtWorks.html">ThoughtWorks</a>, Inc., Chicago, IL
        I was a founding member of the Collaborative Development Group. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My consulting clients included BP Integrated Supply & Trading in London; 
        Dana Commercial Credit; the financial markets industries; Input/Output, a 
        manufacturer of oil exploration systems; a web portal company; and 
        Seismiq, a leasing ASP.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been involved in the successful implementation of Extreme 
        Programming in several environments. My experience during this time 
        included Java: JSP, Servlets, ODBC, SQLj; C++: Cross-platform development 
        using GNU Autotools and GCC simultaneously with Microsoft Visual Studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am most proud of the work we did on the QuickFIX FIX engine 
        (quickfix.thoughtworks.com). I also was instrumental in applying practical 
        methods derived from XP to save a data conversion project that had poor 
        software, waning morale, tense client relationships, and a dismal outlook.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience in providing leadership after gaining respect for my 
        pragmatic approaches and problem solving skills.
