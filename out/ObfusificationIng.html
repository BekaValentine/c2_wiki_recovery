        It's time for <a href="ObfusificationIng.html">ObfusificationIng</a>!

      <ul>
        <li>
           Find some code that is simple, clean, and requires no comments to understand
        </li>
        <li>
           Copy and paste the code (See also <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Write some completely unrelated textual comment
        </li>
        <li>
           Modify the code in some unobvious way so that it does almost the same thing <strong>most</strong> of the time
        </li>
        <li>
           Modify the original so that it gets out of sync with the copy
        </li>
        <li>
           Repeat until someone starts looking
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

           Modify the code in some unobvious way so that it does the same thing <strong>most</strong> of the time unless parameter three is less than 5

        Here's how you <strong>really</strong> do it:

           Find some code that is simple, clean, and requires no comments to understand

           Modify the original so that it gets out of sync with the copy
        </li>
        <li>
           Look for any tests that might be testing the code in question and apply <a href="RemoveTest.html">RemoveTest</a>.
