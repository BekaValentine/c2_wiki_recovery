        Unix Time
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most unix kernels measure time in seconds since TheEpoch, usually the first moment of 1970 in GMT
      </p>
      <p>
        As a <a href="DateStamp.html">DateStamp</a>, that is 19700101.000000000000000000000000000000000
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Unix systems on the internet synchronize to the millisecond, although they may count many more subintervals -- a Gigahertz machine should know which nanosecond some interrupt happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        ThirtytwoBitTime when treated as a SignedInteger counting seconds since 19700101.000000 rolls over and becomes negative at 20380119.031408 resulting in a date early in the TwentiethCentury 19011213.204552
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently Eight<a href="LeapSecond.html">LeapSecond</a>s intervened between those two dates -- as far as Unix Knows Today
