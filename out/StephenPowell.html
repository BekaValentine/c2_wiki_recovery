        My working life started out as an Engineering Geologist from which, after 3 years, I decided to move into a career in education. I have taught in a Technology College (age range 11-19) for six years, initially as a geography teacher moving on to becoming the college's Special Educational Needs Coordinator.

        More recently I have worked for 18 months on a nationwide (UK) schools' Internet project that enabled school children of all ages to communicate to the world the results of their investigations about their local communities. I am currently developing online communities for school leaders, a UK government funded project called Talking Heads.
