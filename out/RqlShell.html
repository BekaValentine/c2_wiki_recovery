        I am creating a <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> dialect called RQL.  It uses <a href="ReversePolishNotation.html">ReversePolishNotation</a>, and is a cross between LISP and Forth. Parentheses only delimit stacks.  Arrays are another core datatype; they are very important.  We also have LISP-style macros.  Functions are first class entities.  There are 6 data types -- arrays, stacks, hashes, numbers, functions, macros
        -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>First, RQL was a </em><a href="RelationalLanguage.html">RelationalLanguage</a>.  Then it was a <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>.  Today it's a <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>.  Tomorrow, who knows?  Stay tuned and see!<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It will be a combo of all 3.  It will combine the best of all 3.
