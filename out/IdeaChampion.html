        <em>Hi there, and welcome to </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>. I don't know if you've been here long, but you seem to be creating a cluster of pages without any links in or out. This is usually referred to as a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a> and is frowned on.<em></em>
      </p>

        <em>If your intention is to put information here and connect it to the rest of </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> then you're very welcome, and many here would welcome the chance to assist. If you were putting up what amounts to a self-contained sub-wiki then you might want to think again.<em></em>

        It might be handy to note that the above comment isn't directed to the average reader of this page...I've never created a single page here much less a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a> (I have read the definition of it however), I just clicked on a link here from the <a href="TruckNumberFixed.html">TruckNumberFixed</a> topic. Especially weird since there is no other content here to call a "<a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>."
