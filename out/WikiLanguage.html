        Wiki Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A new programming language to be created by all the participants on this wiki. In the spirit of <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>, if you don't like any feature of this language you can always delete it, edit it, or <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> it. The intent is to achieve a language in which the <a href="ShortestWikiContest.html">ShortestWikiContest</a> is won by a program consisting of a single line of code.

      <ul>
        <li>
           There are no functions. There are only binary operators. This is to enforce good factoring. If you need your operator to take more than two arguments, you'll need to do some encapsulation. For syntactic sugar, A(B) is equivalent to [0 A B]. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Any operator can be made overloadable by using square brackets or <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>. Hence  1 + 1 evaluates to 2, but 1 [+] 1 is undefined until + is overloaded.
        </li>
        <li>
           Operator definitions are persistently stored in a versioned database. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Operators can be namespaced by applying the A(B) syntax. Hence 1 MyNamespace(+) 1 can evaluate differently to 1 YourNamespace(+) 1
