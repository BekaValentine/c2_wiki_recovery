      <p>
        Wiki is the only kind of jungle i like to get lost in.

        [It can also be a bit like an evil black forest at times too, with witches, warlocks, vampires and werewolves, who can jump out at unexpected and inappropriate times.  But, mostly it's good.  Biggest trouble comes from power struggles, from those that are inclined to strangle the life out of Wiki.]
