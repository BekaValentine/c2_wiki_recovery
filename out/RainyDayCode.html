        Rainy Day Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some programmers seem to be saving up carefully crafted functions and classes for a rainy day.  There is no other reason for this code to exist.  It was never used in the past.  It has no immediate utility.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what makes it different from plain old dead code.  For code to be <em>dead</em> it had to be <em>alive</em> at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           needlessly overloaded constructors
        </li>
        <li>
           utility functions that were written purely out of inspiration and not necessity
        </li>
        <li>
           select/switch cases for things that won't happen
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The last one is tricky, because there are lots of places where you <em>should</em> be careful.  I'm talking about a special kind of case handling here, where the API documentation specifies that it will never happen, but the case to handle it is there just in case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I've seen elaborate catch blocks where operations like <em>assignment</em> or <em>returning</em> are wrapped in try blocks.  The catch will absolutely never execute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Really, can you imagine what would need to happen for:
      </p>
      <code>
        int x = 4;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        to throw an exception?
