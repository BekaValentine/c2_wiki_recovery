        I had the great pleasure of working with Ward in the 80's in 
        <a href="TekLabs.html">TekLabs</a> (<a href="http://www.bytesmiths.com/Publications/stitl/s031.ssi)">http://www.bytesmiths.com/Publications/stitl/s031.ssi)</a> (AKA "The Great Smalltalk Consultant Spawning 
        Grounds").

      <p>
        Now I search the world for companies in search of 
        objects.

        Since forming Bytesmiths in 1991, I've worked on trading systems on Wall Street (who hasn't!), built a telecom management system  in Switzerland, and a network management system in Canada, among other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm particularly interested in the impact of Smalltalk on 
        the development process, and I wrote a column in The 
        Smalltalk Report (<a href="http://www.bytesmiths.com/Publications/9506ManagingDocs.html)">http://www.bytesmiths.com/Publications/9506ManagingDocs.html)</a> and give conference presentations (<a href="http://www.bytesmiths.com/Publications/stitl)">http://www.bytesmiths.com/Publications/stitl)</a> on 
        the topic.

        Coming back to the theme of this site, I'm interested in 
        "patternizing" human collaborations. (Of course, shrinks 
        have been doing this for decades...) What kind of person 
        makes a "natural Smalltalker," whatever that is? What kind 
        of person never "gets it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DonOlson.html">DonOlson</a> has a great collection of these <em>people patterns</em>, to which I'd like to add to <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> the case of <a href="TheLoaner.html">TheLoaner</a>, a person you don't want to meet on a late project!

        Update: I'm no longer doing professional software development. Instead, I haul my photography around to art festivals, where lots of people admire it and don't buy it. :-)

        So now I'm strictly an amateur (from Latin "to love") hacker. Visit my new (as of 2002.09.11) Wiki at <a href="http://www.bytesmiths.com/wiki.">http://www.bytesmiths.com/wiki.</a>

        Reinventing myself once again, I'm now in the process of developing an "ecovillage" with a number of other like-minded individuals. We have a wiki at <a href="http://www.EcoReality.org.">http://www.EcoReality.org.</a> To prevent referrer spam, it's closed, but send me a note about your interest in the topic, and I'll add you as an editor.

        Also possibly of interest: "Veggie Van Gogh" is my vegetable oil conversion of a diesel step van. We also have an '89 Dodge Cummins diesel, '85 VW Jetta diesel, and an '82 VW Vanagon diesel -- all running on biodiesel. We're pretty much fossil-fuel-free!
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to the topic at hand: I have a bunch of info about Veggie Van Gogh on a wiki at: <a href="http://www.Bytesmiths.com/Van.">http://www.Bytesmiths.com/Van.</a> It's closed-editing -- let me know if you want an edit account there.
