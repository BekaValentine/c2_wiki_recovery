        Putting your personal name on the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page instead of your host name is now a feature of the Wiki system.
        See the <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> page, which explains how to set your Wiki "user name," for display on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.

        I don't see why as part of the <a href="EditPage.html">EditPage</a> there isn't a textbox where we can enter our WikiUserName. If left blank, the system can simply do what it does now (i.e. put the DNS there). --<a href="DrewMarsh.html">DrewMarsh</a>

        Because you could lie. Or, more likely, you can change the tag to be a real advertisement. I, for instance, could put "BackDoorProtectionism" to red flag that some capitalist pig was writing on that page. Or whatever.

        <em>True. How about the DNS always being there and the wiki </em><a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>, if left blank, defaults to <a href="AnonymousCoward.html">AnonymousCoward</a>?<em> --</em><a href="DrewMarsh.html">DrewMarsh</a>

        This isn't <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> and no one is being prompted to sign their name, especially so condescendingly. In fact, there's a debate over whether you should sign your name or not. You're still not immune to the blatant advertising that will go on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> which will wreck the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> of it.

        <em>I recently played a bit and changed my cookie to read </em><a href="DevilsAdvocate.html">DevilsAdvocate</a>. Then I realized how stupid that was and changed it back to my domain. It's stupid for two reasons: 1. It would be frowned upon by other people; 2. I rather not live my life in the pointless hacking of Wiki, something I don't have any inclination of doing anyway other than just playing a bit. Wiki works because it has no security. Shouldn't forget that. -- your anonymous interlocutor<em></em>

        RE: <em>The domain on </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> itself:<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Would it be possible to have a <a href="RecentChangesSignature.html">RecentChangesSignature</a> without using <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> if you had control over reverse lookup for your IP address?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes:  If you control the domain name of your host (which could be a PC), you could make your name "</em>MyWikiName.companyname.com", for instance.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What would the point be anyway except to advertise yourself? However, since you cannot carry a message with the advertisement, you will be doubly judged on your editing efforts. I smell smoke. I think something is back firing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A host name that conforms to Wiki page naming conventions will display as a link on </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.  People could click on it to see your advertisement.  This could be a good way to "take responsibility" for all your posts.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I assume that (changing your host name) would be lost for those of us behind firewalls.

        See <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> page for a reasonable alternative.

        Why, when I update from home, does no domain name show?

        My Wiki builds <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> each time by looking at the page database, so <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> doesn't "exist" as a page and is therefore not editable.  No edit = no problem.  
      </p>
      <p>
        By default I  return the last fifty pages, but I plan to make this user-configurable by a parameter /servlet/changes?number=xx or something --[[Alan Francis]]
