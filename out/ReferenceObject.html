        Reference Object
      </h1>
      <p>
        Examples of reference objects might include: Customer, Account, Telephone Switch, and the like. They are often complex and large and may be referred to in lots of places. They usually have a rich state and any change from any place needs to be visible to other objects that refer to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reference objects are compared based on their identity, although you may see identifying attributes. You don't usually see multiple copies of the same <a href="ReferenceObject.html">ReferenceObject</a> in one address space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reference objects typically will have the following attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The <a href="EqualityOperator.html">EqualityOperator</a> is the same as the identity operator (two reference objects are equal if and only if they are identical)
        </li>
        <li>
           Will have <em>mutator</em> methods
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also known as "entity".
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare to <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>.
