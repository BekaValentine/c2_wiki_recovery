        Modelling Trap

        This used to drive me up the wall: I used to be a member of a team called the "Modelling Team" (as in propagation modelling), and at a <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> shop too, so there was a lot of modelling (as in OO) going on too. Could we convince our (US sourced) document preparation system that we wanted two 'l's? We could not. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the U.S., "Modelling" would be pronounced Mo-del'-ling, whereas we want Mo'-de-ling. So we don't double the consonant as we want the accent
        to stay on the first syllable. Is this different in "British" (or "Commonwealth") spelling countries?

        <em>Apparrently so.</em>
