        I was fortunate enough to be a member of the Xerox Learning Research Group during the development of the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, and was involved in several implementations including the Dorado, the Note Taker, and a Norwegian system called the Mycron-2000.  I still wish I could be programming in Smalltalk, but for now Objective-C will have to do :-)  I also was one of the original designers of the Apple Macintosh, responsible for the Finder, the Resource Manager, and other parts of the Mac OS.  A few years at <a href="CarnegieMellonUniversity.html">CarnegieMellonUniversity</a> resulted in a CS Ph.D. and the opportunity to meet a lot of tremendous people.

        Sometimes, I feel like I know or have met everybody in CS, thanks to my tenures at <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a>, CMU, and <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a>.  Like the degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon.  If I don't know X, I know someone who does :-)

        I think that the wiki is one of the coolest things I've seen in a long time.  Thanks,  <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>!
