        Refactoring Rails
      </h1>
      <p>
        Am I alone in thinking <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> is horribly factored? I mean, yeah, it is a truly wonderful framework with several truly excellent ideas and, hey, cool we get to program in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> and so on. But:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Why have the controller in one directory, the view in another, and the layout in still a third? Does one view actually have anything to do with the other views under app/view? Does one layout? If so, how come there is a /shared?
        </li>
        <li>
           Could someone please tell these guys the difference between a <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a> and a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>? Okay, so what's in a name? Well, what's in it is rails "integration" tests don't have the power of <a href="FitLibrary.html">FitLibrary</a> despite the fact that all their examples are subsets of functionality of <a href="FitLibrary.html">FitLibrary</a>. And when you want to actually do a fit-style test, hey, you're on your own - figure out where to get the magic assigns hash and go peeking in there to find what you want. Time for <a href="FitOnRails.html">FitOnRails</a>?
        </li>
        <li>
           Partials ... why the hell can't I just treat any old view as a partial? Then I could use <a href="CompositePattern.html">CompositePattern</a> on my views ...
        </li>
        <li>
           Scaffolding ... ugh! Okay, great, you can whack up an app by inferring <a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a> elements from the model. This is ExCellent. But why can't you keep on inferring? Just let me add a few static declarations to my model and regenerate the damned app! Why am I mucking around in the guts of all this machine generated hokum? And don't tell me I should just replace my controllers/views wholesale - at least don't tell me that and still call the thing "agile"!
        </li>
        <li>
           RJS templates. Why the Sam Hill don't you just compile a subset of <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> into <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>? Then the bloody things would just be partials.
        </li>
        <li>
           Oh, and while we're on extensible ... I want to derive views. Because I wanna. Because they're goddamned classes fer cryin' out loud!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Well, that's <a href="BlackHat.html">BlackHat</a> energy for you. These things should be tickets on the rails trac.

           1. IT TAKES THE RELATIONAL OUT OF RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (Joel's caps)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>can't you bind to a View instead of a Table?</em>
            </li>

           Well, it turns out that webserver rebooting requirement really sucks when you're trying to, um, Rapidly Application Develop. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>can you add a Bounce command, and hit 'lynx </em><a href="http://localhost/app/Bounce'">http://localhost/app/Bounce'</a> from your test script, to bounce the server automatically?<em></em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Rails has no manual.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>we wouldn't read it anyway...</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em></em><a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> didn't used to. Is <em>Agile Development with Rails</em> by the PragmaticProgrammers any good?<em></em>
            </li>
          </ul>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Remaining rants just mean that Rails needs more breadth. And please note how easy Ruby makes cobbling together Rails-like things, regardless how polished they can eventually become.
