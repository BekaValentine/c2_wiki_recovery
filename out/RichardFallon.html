        I have been working using <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> for just one year and have already been overwhelmed by the fact that XP is the only way to work, or maybe I was just underwhelmed at the thought of DUFBusting for the rest of my years.  I much prefer the open plains of XP than the cosy cubicle of earlier dilbert days.  I would never want to work without XP again, its that simple.

        I recently did a Masters in Computing and became very involved using Neural Networks to solve problems.  I couldn't get them to solve all my problems but luckily I did have some success applying this to the task of Speaker Recognition.

        I am now working for <a href="KnowledgeManagementSoftware.html">KnowledgeManagementSoftware</a> on a large EJB project.

        My main hobby is drumming and somewhere along the line I got sidetracked from being a popstar to a programmer.
