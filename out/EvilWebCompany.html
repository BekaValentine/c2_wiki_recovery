        Evil Web Company
      </h1>
      <p>
        At <a href="EvilWebCompany.html">EvilWebCompany</a> you will work with several of the smartest programmers/people whom you have ever met. You will help them with their english and explain that Beijing pop played at top volume is truly nervewracking and not conducive to good work. You will find out that these smart hardworking people are earning less than a tenth of what you are being paid even though you have less experience and work fewer hours, you will watch your coworkers get shafted by some shyster who is supposedly bankrupt from his condo in Aspen. You will be surprised to come in on a monday morning and find that you are the only person who has any clue as to what's going with three different database driven websites, because everybody else who knew what was going on have left in disgust. You will discover that the vigorous entrepreneurial guy who hired you in the first place is actually a pathological liar. You will wonder if he is delusional regarding the various business arrangements he is always talking about. You will discover that people who worked for him in another state, (the ones who built the web management tools you thought were cool when first hired) were fired weeks before their stock options were due to vest. You will figure out why it's not good to work for a company whose principals are lawyers. You will quit in disgust. Your now ex-boss will call most of the people who might hire you telling them that you left him in the lurch and can't be trusted.

      <p>
        At <a href="EvilWebCompany.html">EvilWebCompany</a> your manager will talk endlessly about how empowered you are and yet refuse to let you make any decision he doesn't understand (most of them). He will talk proudly about the <em>team spirit</em> in the office and regard any gathering of more than two people as a plot against him.
