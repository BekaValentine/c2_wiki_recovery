        Let Hot Pages Cool
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="LetHotPagesCool.html">LetHotPagesCool</a> is a Wiki editing guideline.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> pages can grow very quickly. That can be a good thing (e.g. <a href="BrainStorming.html">BrainStorming</a>). However, <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> argument often generates <a href="MoreHeatThanLight.html">MoreHeatThanLight</a>. Such pages can degenerate into noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong>, let hot pages cool before contributing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wait a little while. Write your contribution in a text editor and hold onto it for ten minutes, an hour, a day or maybe a month. Wiki lives in the <a href="LongNow.html">LongNow</a>. After that, come back to the page, reread it, and decide whether your contribution (a) still merits adding, (b) hasn't been said by someone else, and (c) follows <a href="GoodStyle.html">GoodStyle</a>. If it satisfies these criteria, post away.

        <strong>Dealing with Insults</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="LetHotPagesCool.html">LetHotPagesCool</a>, or something similar, is also recognized at other sites like <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>. The link at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Staying_cool_when_the_editing_gets_hot">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Staying_cool_when_the_editing_gets_hot</a> has good advice for people who perceive they have been targeted for unwarranted insults.

        <em>There is "hot" in a conversation that's progressing rapidly, and there is "hot" in a heated argument.  I think the two are different, and that </em><a href="LetHotPagesCool.html">LetHotPagesCool</a> applies to the former while <a href="CoolingOffPeriod.html">CoolingOffPeriod</a> is more suitable for the latter - it's not the page that needs to cool, but the authors.  Asking people who need a <a href="CoolingOffPeriod.html">CoolingOffPeriod</a> to <a href="LetHotPagesCool.html">LetHotPagesCool</a> is unlikely to make much difference.  Mix or split the concepts?<em></em>

        I've found that this has merit when contributing to cool pages, too. The time between writing and posting reveals the gap between what I <em>want</em> to say and what I <em>almost</em> said.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Letting hot pages cool also gives others a chance to contribute.</em>

        Most wikis have a "minor changes" button that keeps discussion threads off <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, where they might pick up additional combatants.  For this purpose, Japanese-stype anonymous BBSes like 2ch allow you to reply to a thread without bumping it to the top by typing "sage" in the email field.
