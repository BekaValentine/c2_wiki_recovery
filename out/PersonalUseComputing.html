        This is a trend which will continue through the next one to many generations of computer systems available.

        In an answer given to a person over 30 years ago, when interest was expressed as to what <br/>
        I would need or use a computer for, I replied: "Any and everything I want". <br/>
        I envisioned then, as I do now, that the personal computer is a tool which "extends" <br/>
        personal capabilities and lends its strengths to the over-riding thoughts, ideas and<br/>
        interests of those who will be found using them.<br/>

        It is, and perhaps always will be, in the toolbox of individual personalities to be <br/>
        used where they may desire, for themselves, about themselves and significant others.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Fortunately, that toolbox also includes means of personalized, custom applications <br/>
        making what we do both better and easier than previously. This through applications <br/>
        people use for their own benefit, unhindered by prohibitive costs or restrictions. <br/>

        Included are such things as ways and means to communicate with others, including <br/>
        friendships and associations not based on physical proximity but upon "connectivity"<br/>
        In addition, personal use includes the ability to record and maintain valuable artifacts<br/>
        through creation and retention of images, sounds and documents which are of interest <br/>
        either to the individual, or his or her associations with family, friends, peers and groups<br/>

        The coming years will see increasing availability of computing artifacts aimed at furthering <br/>

        Artifacts and their Artifactories which will make life better, more interesting, more <br/>
        satisfying and complete for the individual.<br/>
