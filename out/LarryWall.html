        and an absolutely fascinating guy. See for instance:

        for a recent talk titled "Perl: the first postmodern computer language". A very interesting (and funny) talk with lots to say about programming (not directly about patterns or anything, but with a little thought the connections will become clearer).

      <p>
        Quote: "Perl is the Cliff Notes of Unix."

        I think this is an interesting talk even if you're not a Perl user, for a variety of reasons. For instance, concerning the title: I had always been somewhat bemused by the term "postmodern", and was a little unsure what it meant in any area (compare "hypermodern" in chess), except that in literature it seemed to be associated with deconstructionism, which is associated with belief systems in the humanities that I despise (see the famous <a href="SokalHoax.html">SokalHoax</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading Wall's talk above got me thinking about Modernism (in any area, including computer languages) being a reaction to all of previous history, and about <a href="PostModernism.html">PostModernism</a> as the inevitable wave after <strong>that</strong>. What happens when a subculture is aware of all previous styles and experiments and history, when apparently everything deeply original has been done to death already? That is western culture today, whether you're talking about architecture or, in Wall's case, computer languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not doing justice to his talk; this is intended for people who absolutely would not have read it otherwise, to give a little flavor of it.

        However, like <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a>, he obscures where the technology ends and the self-indulgent <a href="CultOfPersonality.html">CultOfPersonality</a> manipulation begins. For example, Perl 5 was long anticipated as a re-write, with a new parser, better <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> support, etc. Perlers eagerly waited to read its source.

I would think, to the contrary, that a near-complete lack of other comments in the code would be damaging for one's esteem.</em>
