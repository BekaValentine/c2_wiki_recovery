        One picture is worth a thousand lies. Even the most cursory perusals of Kinesis' offerings ought to show that the Evolution isn't ergonomic. At all. Nice picture though.

        As a devoted Evolution user for years now, I can assure you the Evolution is extremely ergonomic and comfortable to use.  The keyboard panels tilt and swivel along all three axes; the position shown in the above picture is not how one would be set up for actual use.  With a little adjustment it is possible to position the panels so that the stress on the wrist and forearm is almost nil.

        The Evolution was expensive ($500 for the chair-mount version), but I'm still a bit sad they stopped making them.  On the other hand, the two I have (one at the office, one at home) have been very reliable.  With luck they will keep working for a long time.  -- Scott L. Burson
