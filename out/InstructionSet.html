           The instruction set, also called instruction set architecture (ISA), is a part of the computer that pertains to programming, which is basically machine language. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The instruction set provides commands to the processor, to tell it what it needs to do. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The instruction set consists of multiple pieces, including addressing modes, instructions, native data types, registers, memory architecture, interrupt, and exception handling, and external I/O.
        </li>
        <li>
           An example of an instruction set is the x86 instruction set, which is common to find on computers today. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Different computer processors can use almost the same instruction set, while still having very different internal design. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Both the Intel Pentium and AMD Athlon processors use nearly the same x86 instruction set. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           An instruction set can be built into the hardware of the processor, or it can be emulated in software, using an interpreter. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               The hardware design is more efficient and faster for running programs than the emulated software version.
            </li>
