        An absolute demonstration of eval()'s insufficiency and the power of closures is <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a>, a platform for server-side <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. The genius of Node is that every single I/O call is non-blocking; rather than returning its result directly, it takes a callback function, reminiscent of <a href="ContinuationPassingStyle.html">ContinuationPassingStyle</a>. For example, reading from a file looks like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        fs.readFile("path/to/file.ext", function(err, data) {<br/>
        // do stuff with file data in here<br/>
        });<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Because every call is non-blocking, like the above, Node essentially has concurrency <a href="ForFree.html">ForFree</a>. It's a fantastic way to write all sorts of applications, especially servers. And it's absolutely 100% impossible for any eval() system to achieve this kind of evented structure (at least, without actually being a closure system in disguise).
      </p>
      <p>
        To show exactly why eval() can't possibly do this, here's a code example from a simple Node server:
      </p>
      <code>
        http.createServer(function(req, res) {<br/>
        <strong>res</strong>.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});<br/>
        withImage(function(img) {<br/>
        <strong>res</strong>.end("<img src='" + img.url + "' />");<br/>
        });<br/>
        }).listen(8000);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Notice that the bolded variable is accessed in both the outer and inner scopes. Without <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a> and proper closures, that variable would be gone by the time withImage() fetched the image and called the inner callback. <em>With</em> those two things, this code works perfectly and is quite natural.

        <em>I almost never had a real problem with concurrency for web apps or client/server architecture. If it becomes an issue, then I rewrite it to use the concurrency-handling capability of the database, such as ACID and transactions. You appear to be using a file system for data "storage" when a database would perhaps be more appropriate. If you need to store content such as photos with concurrent uploads, then generate a unique ID first in the image or article tracker or record (usually article ID), and use that as part of the destination file name to avoid user collisions. (It's also possible to store images directly in a database, but that's not always an option. There are other approaches, but I'd have to see the the domain details to recommend something specific.) It's common for us CBA developers to rely on the concurrency engine in the RDBMS for concurrency needs. Why do you HOF fans keep trying to sell refrigerators to us Eskimos? -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ah, figures. The fact that I mentioned files at all clearly means I advocate them over databases for all data storage. I merely selected the file-read function to demonstrate in a simple way the callback-oriented I/O; in retrospect, this was a very bad move considering to whom I'm talking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Node's non-blocking I/O doesn't just apply to files. It works equally well with any kind of I/O, <em>including databases</em>, and it does so using the exact same callback design. That withImage() function actually fetches an image URL from the Google Images API, for example, not from anything on the local filesystem (unless your local filesystem just happens to be a Google datacentre).
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, given what I've seen of <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>, I think Node would be an excellent fit for it. TOP clearly is full of database queries. You know how whenever you make a database query there's network overhead? When you use Node, that network overhead is put to good use. While it's waiting on the results of a query, your app is free to receive other requests, perform other computations, and so on. Node's weak point is stuff that requires a lot of processing directly in-app, rather than through I/O, since its magical concurrency design doesn't inherently include threads. Because TOP involves having the database do as much processing as possible, Node's weakness is dodged nicely.

        <em>Re: "While it's waiting on the results of a query, your app is free to [do other things]". That hasn't been a common (explicit) need for the web-apps I've worked on. But it can possibly be handled with "hidden" frames or iframes. Web pages make it pretty easy for the user to "spawn" other pages if they want while waiting. One can put up a page that says, "While waiting for your request to process, here are some other articles/topics you can peruse". In-line ads already do this pretty much. Just make sure to set "target='_blank'" so the original "waiting" page is not wiped out. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On client-server apps, one typically makes the long process spawn a secondary process and "status screen" that says something like, "Your query/report is being processed, please wait...". When it's ready, then a notice and a "View Report" button comes up on that secondary screen.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You send a request to your database. There is some delay, due to the time taken to deliver the request and response across the network. You receive a result from your database. Network overhead. (Also, there's overhead in the DBMS itself, especially as queries grow more complex. There's plenty of overhead in the whole process for Node to exploit.) Under most platforms, that network overhead slows down your app, as synchronous code has to block while it waits for results; under Node, overhead gives your app the chance to get some work done, processing events from the queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        You say there hasn't been an <em>explicit</em> need for concurrent behaviour in your Web apps, but in fact all Web apps need to be concurrent, because they will inevitably receive requests from more than one user. The "explicit" part, I think, highlights that you've missed the point a little: Why should you have to be explicit? It's a Web app; of <em>course</em> you're going to want decent multiuser handling. Node's evented structure means that you get multiuser concurrency in your app server implicitly, without needing to give it special consideration.

           <em>The database and related API's handle that. That's ACID and RDBMS Transaction Handling 101. It grew of age in the client/server era and has mostly lasted into web development and has served us relatively well. If a "transaction" (set of related queries) cannot complete itself due to multi-user contention, such as two people editing the same row at the same time, then the app can "catch" the transaction failure and handle it various ways ranging from "quick and dirty" to "fancy-lots-of-options", usually depending on how often collisions typically occur. Many forms of "roll-back" are even handled by the RDBMS, depending on the how queries are set up. See </em><a href="TwoPhaseCommit.html">TwoPhaseCommit</a> for some examples. (Specific RDBMS often offer even more options in their proprietary API's to entice orgs away from generic standards, such as ODBC/JDBC.)

Using asychronous callbacks doesn't require completely abandoning transactions; that would be idiotic, especially considering that the two things are totally orthogonal. A sophisticated Node application that interacts with a database will use both asynchronous I/O, improving its own performance, and transactions, ensuring data integrity. The async I/O design is another tool in the toolbox, which improves the response time of your application itself. It's not a <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> that replaces every single other tool you've ever used. Because, like you've said, tossing that stuff is dumb. -DavidMcLean

        While I cannot condone using frames to implement asynchronous Web-apps (you do know what AJAX is, right?), the client-server technique you describe is a sane one. However, the idea of offloading complex processing to a separate process is the crux of Node's nimble event-loop, so that design automagically works in Node without much special server setup! The platform makes it extremely natural and clean to set up many concurrent situations, including the one you describe.

        You'd like a specific scenario? Okay. Here's a simple example:

      <code>
        var db   = require('db');<br/>
        var http = require('http');<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        var s = http.createServer(function(req, res) {<br/>
        res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});<br/>
        db.query("SELECT * FROM tweets", function (err, rows) {<br/>
        for(var i = 0; i < rows.length; i++) {<br/>
        var tweet = rows[i];<br/>
        res.write("<p class='tweet'>" + tweet.text + "</p>");<br/>
        }<br/>
        res.end();<br/>
        });<br/>
        });<br/>
        s.listen(8080);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The above code, based somewhat on an example program from the book Node Up And Running, implements part of a Twitter clone in Node; the design is fairly conservative so as not to distract from the following explanation of the eventing process (a production version would almost certainly use some HTML templating system, rather than generate HTML directly inside the query callback, as this example does, for instance). This basic code concept would be perfectly applicable to report-writing business applications, among others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at how the above code is processed, under Node. When the application starts, practically <em>all</em> of the code shown above is run almost immediately. This "first pass" in Node usually does very little actual processing; in this application, the first pass sets up some callbacks and tells Node to listen on port 8080. After the first pass completes, in any Node application, Node will stop and wait for events to show up in its event queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now our server is up and ready to use. Let's have client A make an HTTP request.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Client A makes an HTTP request to the Node server.
        </li>
        <li>
           Client A's request becomes an event, event A, which is pushed onto Node's event queue.
        </li>
        <li>
           Because right now Node isn't doing anything else, it can immediately process event A from the top of the queue.
        </li>
        <li>
           The callback we passed into http.createServer() functions as an event listener. Let's call it callback F. Event A triggers callback F, passing into it information on the HTTP request (req) and an object used to form an HTTP response (res).
        </li>
        <li>
           The code inside callback F executes, building up an HTTP response for client A.
        </li>
        <li>
           We reach the call to db.query(). This happens to be a non-blocking call, so Node sends the query to the DB, and without waiting for any response it goes on with the rest of the current function. Nothing inside the db.query() callback (callback G) is executed yet.
        </li>
        <li>
           There's no more code in the current function, so Node has nothing else to run. It goes back to event-listening.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now, one of two things can happen next:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Client B makes a request. Node goes through all of the above steps for this new client, too: The request becomes event B, event B is processed, and a database query is made.
        </li>
        <li>
           The result from event A's database query arrives. In that case, the following happens:
          <ul>
            <li>
               The query result is received by Node, and it becomes an event. Let's call it event C. Event C is pushed into the event queue.
            </li>
            <li>
               When event C reaches the top of the queue, Node can process it. To process this event, Node needs callback G from db.query(): The results of the database query are passed into callback G.
            </li>
            <li>
               Callback G's code is executed. It builds the rest of the HTTP response for client A, concluding with res.end().
            </li>
            <li>
               Client A's HTTP request is complete.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That about covers the Node eventing model. The most important point is that the only time Node isn't <em>doing</em> something is when there is <em>nothing to do</em>, when there are no events waiting in the queue to be processed. Node never stops to wait for a database query, or file read, or call out to a shell script, or any of those things. It's essentially always getting something done.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be apparent from the above example why Node has such good concurrent performance, as well as why it's weakened by applications needing significant processing directly within Node rather than through external processes.

It doesn't address the actual/typical bottlenecks. It would be roughly comparable to bridge toll booths. We can make the highway going up the the booths wider (more lanes, say 12), but if we only have 6 booths actively processing (the database), then the same number of cars are still coming out the other end per minute (after they pay their tolls). We are not noticeably reducing a person's trip time. The wider feeder highway is mostly a waste of space and tax money.

The bottleneck is within applications designed to work serially:  They wind up waiting for apparently unrelated parts of themselves.  This is exemplified by having to wait for content A to load before you can work on unrelated content B, where users are typically forced to stare at some irritating spinning "please wait" icon or irrelevant substitute content.  It's because all the application's processing is serialised, thus forcing the user to perceive the cumulative effect of various inevitable small delays.

           I have no idea what you are referring to. If you mean commercial websites, it's usually the browser that goes out and gets the various resources, some of which arrive slower than others. If I request "graphic 7" from server X, and server X is slow to respond, there's nothing I can do at the client side nor the "main" web server side to speed that up. (Larger sites typically host content from multiple servers.) The bottleneck is beyond the "main" developer's control. So is the nature of the Web. If I remember correctly, browsers typically launch roughly 4 sub-processes to independently retrieve different portions of requested web pages. One can increase this number via the browser settings, but there are trade-offs. Now there are plenty of poorly-designed sites in which the designer/developer made other portions depend on a specific thing, but this is just stupidity, not lack of HOF's. Note that in some cases it's purposely done to <strong>prevent ad-blocker</strong> or pop-up-blocker software. It does this by making sure the client fully loaded an ad before it allows the browser to load the rest. The <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> may sample the contents of the ad at it's ID and unless the read content matches the content template (image sample), it keeps looping, holding up the rest of the page. Thus, if one is running ad-blocker-ware, they can't see most of the page. This problem is caused by the profit motive, not lack of HOF's. It's been <strong>intentionally serialized</strong>. If you want to argue that HOF's are better at making greed-ware, be my guest.

        You must be doing something weird. In my typical biz web apps, the database is usually the bottleneck. <strong>If I comment out the database portions, the rest runs in a snap</strong>. I do this frequently when tuning page esthetics. Browsers already have built-in parallelism and speed short-cut mechanisms and one can leverage this. Your parallelism <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> is a waste of programmer time. (There are other ways to speed up perceived and real web-page rendering without JS and HOF's, but we are wondering off topic here.)

           [The fact that "if [you] comment out the database portions, the rest runs in a snap" is <em>almost exactly</em> why non-blocking IO gives such a huge boost to concurrent performance; critically, that the database portions are by far the slowest means that your task is "IO-bound" (as opposed to "CPU-bound", in which the slowest sections are calculations or other algorithms run in your app process). Freeing your app from blocking on IO-bound operations means that your app is "open" to perform other processing <em>significantly</em> more often, which in turn makes handling a large number of requests from one or many clients significantly easier. -DavidMcLean]

           Yeah, who needs data? Fill the report cells with happy faces and pink ponies; data is so old school. Solutions!

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [No, that's obviously stupid. The fact that commenting out the database access makes the rest of the application so fast doesn't imply that commenting out the database access is the solution. Rather, it implies that most of the application's time is spent in a busy-loop, simply waiting for the database access to complete, and that's CPU time which could far more effectively be put to better use. Because the non-database-access parts of the application are so comparatively speedy, the application genuinely doesn't have to <em>do</em> much on each request (aside from waiting around); with a non-blocking model, the app can do the little it has to <em>as fast as possible</em> and immediately get back out to the main eventloop. This implies that the app can far more easily do the small amount of stuff it has to do <em>many many times in quick succession</em>, such as if it receives requests from a large number of clients simultaneously. The data from the DB is still used, but it's efficiently served out to far more clients at a time. Naturally, concurrent handling of multiple requests can also be handled by spinning off a thread or worker process for each request, as Apache does, but both of those solutions typically involve significantly more memory and processor overhead than a single-threaded, non-blocking approach; in addition, threading brings up more complicated questions of race conditions, synchronisation, etc., whereas an asynchronous single-threaded model guarantees that all code sequences run atomically with a few very obvious exceptions (obvious both syntactically and semantically), which is a great deal easier to reason about. -DavidMcLean]

           You don't seem to understand how typical web servers work. If the app (process) is waiting for the database, the CPU is not being wasted because it switches to processing other users' requests. It's not a "busy loop". A CPU (core) is not dedicated to a single user.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [You don't seem to understand how reading works, because <em>I addressed that</em>; as noted, the classical Web server model involves spinning up an individual thread or worker process for each request, which does indeed permit servicing multiple requests concurrently. Also as noted, however, this implies processor and memory overhead (especially memory overhead) that an asynchronous, single-threaded model does not. This is precisely the reason evented, single-threaded Web servers such as nginx and lighttpd are recognised as far more performant than thread-per-request Web servers such as Apache, especially when receiving many requests from many clients simultaneously. In addition, threading is a form of preemptive multitasking, which while valuable also greatly increases the likelihood of race conditions and other concurrency bugs that single-threaded async neatly avoids entirely by its cooperative-multitasking design. -DavidMcLean]

           Exactly what does this have to do with the statement that started "The fact that "if [you] comment out the database portions..."? I've tried to get explicit specific scenarios out of you, but you just keep slipping back into Brochure Mode.

      <ul>
        <li>
           [All this ties into the original "comment out the database portions" statement through the first point I made, at the start of this subthread. To reiterate: As you point out, if you comment out the database portions, the rest runs extremely quickly. This means that the application process can get the non-DB stuff <em>done</em> extremely quickly, and hence manage to do it <em>many many times</em> in quick succession with minimal latency, which in turn means that the app can service a large number of requests at once (since each request takes up so little of the application's time). We have indeed drifted off of that point to a degree, due to the following: After my first point, you then went off on a tangent apparently presuming that I was advocating <em>actually</em> commenting out the database portions and ignoring the data in the DB entirely merely for a performance boost, which I addressed at length and with a complete recap of the relevant concepts. After that, you went off on another tangent by only responding to a small part of my previous response, namely the assertion that the traditional blocking model for Web servers leaves the CPU in a busy-loop while waiting on I/O; this concept, along with the fact that this is traditionally solved by using separate threads or worker processes, along with the downsides of such approaches, was in fact already discussed many times on the page before <strong>including in that very same paragraph you objected to</strong>. None of this is brochure talk. I've been speaking only of definite, technical properties of thread-per-request and non-blocking evented models for implementation of concurrent server applications. -DavidMcLean]

      <ul>
        <li>
           If I want off on an alleged tangent, it's because your writing is not clear and I answered a different issue than one you intended. And I've seen no evidence that the CPU is being significantly "wasted" waiting for a database result, if that's what you are getting at. When I look at CPU monitors, typically it pretty much flat-lines while waiting for the DB in single user tests. (Assuming the DB is on another server or core.) Thus, there is plenty of processor resources available for OTHER USERS if they are using the same server. If you claim there is CPU usage waste, please be clear on exactly where this waste is.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Yes, exactly: The CPU monitor flat-lines while waiting for results. <strong>That's waste of CPU time.</strong> However, any application model claiming to support multiple requests ensures that the CPU sees actual use during that timeframe, whenever it can be put to use, including the traditional thread-per-request model. Thus, it's not so much CPU-time waste that arises from thread-per-request models, unlike a single-user approach; there <em>is</em> processor overhead even with a thread-per-request model, because spawning off new threads consumes some CPU, but by far the biggest overhead problem with thread-per-request servers is in memory. On a smaller scale, <strong>each thread's</strong> CPU time and other resources could be considered: A thread stuck in a busy-loop, waiting for results from some I/O-bound request, is wasting resources, since it's consuming (a small amount of) processor time and (a comparatively larger amount of) memory, even though it's doing absolutely nothing. A system under a non-blocking model, by contrast, isolates itself in a single thread and hence produces minimal overhead-per-request. -DavidMcLean]

        <li>
           You need to be more clear on what you are comparing to what. Clarity! Details! Specificness! Say it over and over. It's NOT a "waste of time" as you claim because there is no magic given by you to speed the DB up. HOF's don't have fairy dust. Remember, the CPU only flat-lines IF there are not other server users. I'm just describing it in a test of CPU usage under conditions that make it easier to check (and describe to readers), <strong>not as a normal circumstance</strong>. If there is only a single user on the server at the time, what "non-wasteful" things would a HOF-centric design be doing instead while waiting for the DB? Knitting a sweater for the grand-kids? As far as RAM usage, it may be possible to not load the DB-results-handling modules until after the DB results come back to save some RAM, and sometimes I've done that. However, that's rarely a significant issues these days because app code is small compared to data and drivers most of the time. Whatever alternative you are talking about, it's likely <strong>incremental</strong> improvements at best. I don't what to bicker over crumbs yet again. Come back when you have huge improvements to present.

           [Whenever the CPU is doing nothing, there is a waste of CPU time. This is perfectly straightforward. Both threading and eventing allow you to free up the CPU for doing worthwhile things, instead of simply waiting. If there is a single request, there is nothing worthwhile to do, under both models, so CPU time is still wasted in those circumstances (unless one has tasks in the app that are not dependent on a request, such as a scheduled backup). Thus, there's trivially only a very minimal improvement on resource usage when there's only a single request; of course, a concurrency solution shouldn't be expected to improve non-concurrent scenarios by a significant margin. The important scenarios are those when there are many, many simultaneous requests, specifically in the thousands or tens of thousands. Each thread individually has only small overhead, but this accumulates very quickly when there are several thousand threads; meanwhile, evented servers simply "work harder" in their single main thread, which affords the ability to service a much larger number of concurrent requests due to the significant reduction in total overhead. -DavidMcLean]

           "Whenever the CPU is doing nothing, there is a waste of CPU time." -- Agreed 100%, but so far you haven't shown a scenario where a traditional web server MUST waste CPU while NodeJS doesn't. In practice it's usually not worth it to tune traditional web servers for such mass concurrency because the database is usually the bottleneck in such situations, as I keep pointing out. Why bother to tune web servers for 1000 users or requests per minute if the database cannot even handle 100? Thus, your "complaint" may have technical merit but not practical merit. It may matter in say a mass chat-room app where the conversations are not kept and not searched, but that's a niche usage pattern and indeed NodeJS may shine for certain niches like that.

           [A threaded server wastes much more in memory than in CPU, as previously mentioned, when there are many concurrent requests, although there's some processor overhead. As for the crux of your argument: I believe you're assuming that, since database access is trivially the slowest part of your application, <em>the database</em> is the slowest part of your application. Typically, it's not; the slowdown lies primarily in network overhead, rather than in the database management system itself. The average database management system can without difficulty cope with high numbers of requests, provided there's an application capable of sending them. At the extremes---for example, as your scenario approaches the ten-thousand simultaneous client problem---this may eventually demand replication and other database-parallelism techniques, but in general the DBMS can wrangle requests sufficiently well that there's no real bottleneck produced by sending it more simultaneous queries. DBMSes <em>are</em> heavily optimised, after all. With that in mind, affording the application server more efficiency in servicing requests can enable much higher concurrent user count, even without needing to turn to replication. -DavidMcLean]

           In my experience, the DB side <em>is</em> usually the bottleneck. Yes, with a huge budget the DB side <em>can</em> be made to scale better, but that also applies to the web-server side. In most the projects I work on, though, the org <strong>does not want to spend that kind of money on the DB etc.</strong>. I've never worked for Google, Yahoo, etc. such that my experience and/or specialty may not be those big-co high-volume primary-public-interface applications/sites, but rather internal support or business-to-business business. "Features" and flexibility and low-cost is deemed more important than raw speed. Different niches/projects require different resource trade-offs and have different bottlenecks. You seem to be trying to solve a problem that I do not see as a significant problem. If staff has to be tossed or retrained for HOF-heavy app design to solve an issue that is not really an issue, it's considered a wasteful effort in the eyes of most business owners. Overhaul staff for REAL problems. -t

           ["If I comment out the database portions, the rest runs in a snap" proves nothing about the performance characteristics of the database itself. It hardly takes a huge budget to apply usual DBMS scaling techniques---replication setup is mechanical, for instance---but such things generally become necessary only at volume far higher than that a threaded server can typically process, so until concurrent access does approach extremes a greater boon to efficiency will be afforded through optimising the application than through optimising the database. As noted, evented concurrency is also a great deal easier to work with and comprehend than threaded concurrency, since by design it avoids the most common concurrency bugs, so although training may be necessary it isn't a particularly daunting issue and certainly will be more straightforward than similar training for working with threads. -DavidMcLean]

           Web servers have "extra box" scaling options also if they become the bottleneck, which they typically don't because usually the DB is bottleneck, despite your repeated insistence otherwise. I will agree that typical web servers have <em>less</em> options, or more difficult-to-install options, for such compared to most RDBMS, but this is largely because there is insufficient practical need for reasons I already gave. They don't max out often enough. The industry solves actual problems, not made up problems like starry-eyed fan-boys do. I believe we've discussed this already; we are going around in circles. What's an example of a "common concurrency bug" that NodeJS prevents?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [First up, the problem of scaling Web servers is widely recognised ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem</a> for instance) and much work has been put into addressing it. As for concurrency bugs, the <a href="RaceCondition.html">RaceCondition</a> is perhaps best-known; the simplest example of race condition is a statement like "x = x + 5", because in a preemptive multitasking environment such as threading provides, there is no guarantee that both the addition (x + 5) and the reassignment to x will complete atomically, before some other thread happens to change x. Therefore the value of x could end up in error, if the threads happen to clash. This is addressed using synchronisation tools like mutexes and <a href="CriticalSection.html">CriticalSection</a>s to <em>make</em> certain parts of the code run atomically, without interruption from other threads. However, there is often much complexity in ensuring that sufficient synchronisation has been applied; using too many locks and synchronisers will dramatically slow down the application, since threads get "stuck" waiting for locks to be freed, while too few fail to guarantee correctness. A cooperative multitasking environment, such as that provided by a single-threaded evented concurrency system, guarantees by design that all "simple" code runs atomically, without requiring synchronisation logic, since no other threads exist to interrupt in the middle of a codepath. Only I/O calls break up the codeflow, and they're easily recognisable syntactically and semantically so it is not difficult to ensure race conditions do not form across these boundaries. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The vast majority of applications don't face the C10k problem, nor do they need to run x=x+5 concurrently. Any inter-user value, such as global counts, would be in the database, not the app. I don't know what kind of odd/niche apps you work on, but they don't resemble mine. You are selling refrigerators to an Eskimo here. If you are talking to other readers in other niches, that's fine, but you are not solving MY SHOP'S problems, focusing instead on scenarios that are foreign to us here and now.

        And parallel algorithms are in general more difficult to debug because the order can be different on each run. It's like trying to do science in which you cannot isolate one variable because the other variables keep changing upon each test. <a href="HeisenBug.html">HeisenBug</a> risk. We can limit these problems by some extent by making certain assumptions and sticking to certain rules, but we are then accepting down-sides to gain the benefits. If the benefits are small for a particulate situation, then the down-sides are not worth it. Even in theory if two processes/events should be "parallel safe", clients (browsers & GUI engines) are often buggy such that events can cross-effect each other.

        <em>I think you'll find the database isn't the bottleneck in your applications. </em>'Waiting for<em>' the database is. If you use an event-driven concurrency system, you never wait for the database, because there's more important stuff to do. As for difficulty in debugging, the callback-oriented structure means that coding under these systems is actually very similar to coding purely serial code. (Because they're still single-threaded, you don't have to worry about thread safety; many threading-related issues vanish when using single-threaded concurrency, partially because closures keep state encapsulated and local.) However, in evented-callback systems, you can be sure that any particular piece of code is only delayed by the things it specifically depends on; if a query is needed to show page A but not page B, then page B won't be delayed by attempts to construct page A.</em>

      <p>
        <em>Heck, even constructing a single page can have fewer delays. Suppose page A requires several database queries (Plus maybe some other external source. Perhaps some HTML sourced from the Google APIs?). In serial code, you'd make each of those queries in sequence, one by one, waiting for each query to complete before making the next one. With concurrent code, you can make all of those queries at once; databases themselves can easily handle multiple queries at once, so you'll get your results much faster than if you made the queries one by one.</em>

If I as a user click "View Report", I don't want to see Honey Boo Boo because I didn't ask for Honey Boo Boo. The button lied. (Don't need HOF's for that anyhow.)

        At least in <a href="HofPattern.html">HofPattern</a>, the multi-panel real-time status monitor scenario was something of utility.

I'd like to get a way from GUI-intensive scenarios if possible because the trade-offs depend heavily on the client technology being used or available, which greatly complicates the comparison. A GUI of some sort is fine in a scenario as long as it doesn't become the focus point of the differences. If HOF's are mostly about making GUI's/UI's "better" in CBA, then perhaps we should spawn a more narrow topic on that alone.

        <em>Because they're multiple threads in the first place, which raises concerns of thread safety, race conditions, and so on.

        <em>Bam. Two queries performed in parallel, used to construct one report. Tidy and intuitive. It'd be impossible to provide nice libraries like async.js if Node's concurrency didn't use handy things like higher-order functions. -</em>DavidMcLean<em></em>

        Usually an SQL JOIN or UNION is done to "combine two queries". The RDBMS can potentially parallelize multiple sub-queries. Also, multiple different techniques can implement a parallel "makeQuery" function. Bam! Granted many existing web frameworks and languages don't make doing such very easy, but that's likely because the need is not very common. The few times I can recall when I couldn't use JOIN or UNION to get the database to do it, the queries had "lopsided" profiles such that parallelizing them would not double the speed. For example, one may take 500 milliseconds and the other take 50 milliseconds. A non-parallel version would then take 550 ms and the parallel version would take 500 ms (under ideal conditions). That's hardly enough savings to bother in most cases. Optimizing the graphics on the page would probably give the app more of a boost per time spent, and keep the code simpler. Further, if the server is taxed, it may not be able to parallelize them anyhow, and/or they could end up competing for the same resource, such as disk or network I/O such that they end up waiting on each other anyhow. A lot of circumstances would have to line up just right to get a noticeable boost. If you look at the math in context of real systems and real bottlenecks, parallelism is often over-rated for CBA. I vaguely remember one profiling expert saying that as a rule of thumb, in production you get about 20% to 40% of the theoretical maximum of the savings. Thus, if "unstacking" two queries of the same size could in theory boost the speed from 2000 ms to 1000 ms, then the typical actual average would be something like 1700 ms (1000 + (1000 - 30% * 1000)). Spending that unstacking time tweaking with the query statements or indexes may give more speed per programmer time.

        What else is it going to do during that time? If the user asks for Report X by pressing the Report X button, then the app has to run the necessary query(s) for Report X before delivering Report X to the user. Thus, either the user waits for the database to complete its job, or pressing Report X does something else besides (in addition to) deliver Report X, which would make the button a liar. Thus, it's either Lie or Wait.  There is no 3rd option known to mankind. Maybe it can run Seti@Home while waiting so that aliens can answer that difficult question. (Seti@Home is a different app, but maybe you mix and match in weird ways such that your vision of "application" differs greatly from mine.

           [A common idiom in modern custom business applications is to allow the user to queue up a set of desired reports, which generate in the background whilst the user is allowed to interact with the CRUD screens in the foreground.  When the reports are available for viewing, appropriate status messages or indicators appear.  Of course, you can achieve the same functionality with multiple frames or multiple browser sessions, but the user experience is awkward compared to a single, seamless application.

           Some vendors provide packaged report managers for such things to balance the load. But generally this is actually not a very common arrangement because a single or few users can <strong>over-load the database server</strong> when they suddenly request a bunch of reports. Smarter throttling is needed. Parallelism maxes out quickly because such requests are often competing for the same data and disk resources. If there are a large volume of reports, then the bigger ones are often batch-scheduled at off-hours (night or weekends), and then the user is given a menu of pre-generated reports (usually in HTML or PDF format). A related technique is to pre-summarize data at off hours for the common or slow report or set of reports such that the interactive part of the app mostly is just a formatting service keying on say location or product lines and runs sufficiently fast via "typical" programming. It's roughly comparable to the pre-digestion a parent bird does for food given to hatchlings so they can digest it easier. It wouldn't make sense to have a check-mark selection for such because the ordering of the output may confuse the user: just deliver the report clicked on directly. 80% of the users may get the hang of it, but ticking off 20% is often not the best strategy. Think about it. <strong>Keep the UI simple</strong>. There are ways to make the interface more friendly to such activity, but it involves more programming. When your request box is full, you don't want to go around <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> every little report menu. Even if you did, HOF's may not be the best/only way to do the <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a>. And the "old fashioned" way doesn't preclude running multiple menu items (reports) in parallel anyhow: you can often just right-click to open the web app/page in a new window. Show it to the antsier users. (If every user did it, then we may be back to the over-whelm issue again.) Now I do agree such may be a good sales gimmick: "Look, you can start all these reports at the same time to save the user time" when it practice DB bunching happens anyhow. But one might argue that the domain is actually the act lying, then its a CBA, even though the DBA may murder you. But that's not my personal style.

           Okay, but what else is it going to typically do? Remember my Honey Boo Boo video comment that you didn't like, yet didn't fill in the "correct" activity in place of Honey Boo Boo? Remember, we don't want a button that lies about what it does. Thus if button "A" says it will run Report X, and Report X needs a resource/process that we cannot speed up from the client or (non-query-portion of) app, then we MUST wait. That is the laws of physics. We cannot do anything more to the RDBMS from the client or app side other than submitting the query; it HAS TO go through its paces. There is no other alternative without lying on the button title. Why do I have to keep pointing this out? I don't get it.

           <em>You have to keep pointing that out because you're not listening when we answer you. An evented I/O system, once it's sent out a query, returns to its event queue and begins processing the next event. These events are things like "a client has requested report A", "the query we need for building report C has returned", and, when you get clever with libraries like async, "all of the requested parallel queries we need for report Q have returned". You'll notice that there's an obvious course of action for all those events, usually along the lines of "send out queries needed to build the report" or "use the query results to construct the report"; this course of action is represented in code by associating a callback with each event, representing the action the app should take to handle the event. Processing the event amounts to executing this callback, passing in any query results or other dependencies that've been fetched. The only time the system does nothing is when the event queue is empty, i.e., there's nothing </em>'to<strong> do; if the system has only made one query and only needs the results from that one query, then the event queue will be empty until the query returns, so in that case the system will in fact wait. However, it's overwhelmingly likely that a concurrent platform like Node will be used in a situation where it can receive multiple report requests at once, whether from separate users or from a single user through a queuing feature in the app as suggested above. The fact that Node keeps watching for events instead of blocking to wait for a single query, which any database-query call not using callbacks must necessarily do, means that it can handle many requests simultaneously, despite being single-threaded. If your app only ever has one request, ever, then you're going to have trouble seeing the value in evented I/O concurrency precisely because it is </strong>concurrency<strong> and therefore is useful only when multiple requests are going on. However, any application that needs to handle multiple requests, including the vast majority of Web apps, can earn a huge benefit from evented non-blocking I/O. -</strong>DavidMcLean<em></em>

           You appeared to be <strong>assuming I was using a single-threaded web server</strong>, which is not the case. Web servers can process multiple requests from both the same user (such as a diff web page) and different users at the same time and have been doing this for almost 2 decades. If user X requests report Y, and report Y takes the database (at least) 7 seconds to process the query of report Y, there is not much that can be done to make the total wait less than 7 seconds. The web server (non-DB app part) typically will take a tenth of a second to process (and much of that is often network latency), such that the total time will be about 7.1 seconds if the servers are not heavily loaded by other processes/users. Even if you found a mega-efficient replacement for the web server (which I'm skeptical), the user is not going to notice a difference between 7.1 seconds and 7.03 seconds. My time as a developer is better spent tuning the database portion of this or another app, not shaving off of 0.07 seconds from report Y's app side. It's not a good allocation of developer time. As a general rule, you spend time tuning/fixing the bottlenecks, not the NON-bottlenecks. That's a newbie error. It's rarely economical for developers to spend time on non-bottlenecks. (Query and database tuning is another topic.) Also note that maintainability & readability often should override minor speed enhancements. <strong>Making report Y's app and/or query code into spaghetti code just shave say 10% off its run-time is not smart</strong> unless it will be used heavily or by a good many users.

           It's not clear to me whether you propose changing the architecture of the web server or web applications, or some combo of both. I would note that it's fairly easy to cluster/divide web servers if one box is not sufficient. The shared-ness bottleneck is the database and possibly "permanent" files and source code (if used heavily by the app). User "sessions" can be split between multiple servers by random allocation and/or geographical/IP-range splits. Thus, even if you are right about servicing bunches of users with a <em>single</em> box being a problem, it's mostly moot because <strong>one does not have to stick with one box using traditional web servers</strong>. However, for most CBA apps, one is using a database (or something equiv) such that it becomes the bottleneck again. I still say you are solving the wrong problem. Web-based apps that don't save and don't share anything lasting are not very useful to most businesses, except maybe some kind of trivial game or shared multimedia "event" where persistence and reliable sharing are not an issue. It probably exists somewhere, but fairly uncommon.  The "app RAM/exe" side is just plain not the bottleneck I encounter. The bottleneck is coordinating the sharing and saving of info between and among users because that's where the contention for single or few resources is going be. Non-persistent per-session info can be scaled out to multiple boxes because those temporal resources are not shared. It's just "working memory" of sorts and can be "stuffed" just about anywhere.

You can split the parts of the cake up and have 100 different kitchens baking the parts of the cake, but when it comes to assembling the final pieces together for the final cake, then we have a bottleneck because only so many cooks can fit near the cake to assemble the pieces. Databases are kind of like that because any shared piece of info has to be keep in a single bin or "cubby hole". Only so many people can be accessing that bin at the same time and the computer has to manage multiple read/write requests for that one slot. (Replication is available, but creates it's own set of trade-offs.) Anything that doesn't have to be shared can usually fairly easily be scaled out to multiple machines.

Extra points if they work with existing web apps and the web server can run multiple languages (like PHP, Java, C#, etc.). Databases are more difficult to split up than web servers, especially if they have a high transaction rate and have ACID active because all those transactions and related state have to be kept in sync across servers, which often means that the different boxes end up waiting (blocking) on the same things more or less anyhow. Work some samples on paper and you'll see how sticky it can get to parallelize high-transaction DB's. It's one reason why Oracle is trying to make DB-centric <em>hardware</em> because throwing multiple off-the-shelf servers at the problem has not worked out very well.

For reporting, as we've been discussing for the most part on this page, databases are easy to distribute across multiple servers because a report only requires selecting existing data from the DB; there's no worries about concurrent editing, locking, and so on when access is read-only. When ACID and transactions are involved, the database does become harder to distribute, of course.

           <em>It's true that Nginx alone doesn't work that well for dynamic content, compared to Apache, by the way. This is because it's not possible to make existing app code magically non-blocking; Nginx's built-in static file serving is non-blocking, hence its utility for static content. However, Nginx is great at reverse-proxying to app servers without sacrificing its non-blocking nature; for traditional apps, the app server can run Apache. Newer apps might also use a non-blocking model to gain the same benefits for dynamic code as Nginx provides for static files. -</em>DavidMcLean<em></em>

You know I am not going to be satisfied unless the "improvement" is shown with a semi-realistic CBA scenario, so please stop claiming you "did it" until you have satisfied that step. Otherwise it looks like a solution in search of a problem. And I believe you to be naive about databases and parallelism; however, this topic is not about database performance and I'd suggest you start a different topic if you wish to talk about database performance in particular.

An application built on event-driven I/O can launch a query and immediately return to responding to user input.

It certainly does rely on metaprogramming techniques, because it effectively builds up embedded domain-specific languages for describing models, views, and controllers; this fact has minimal impact on the app designer, though, who's never exposed to the metaprogramming tricks and techniques involved in setting all this up (unless the app designer happens to become a Rails framework developer, of course). -DavidMcLean]

           As far as scaling databases, the transaction level varies per report and database design, and even if a report is only reading, it still has to contend with transactions taking place during the reads. If it wants a clean snapshot, then the transactions have to be consistent such that we don't have "orphan" info, link mismatches, etc. that ACID normally helps prevent. A one-to-many relationship may cause blocking on 2+ machines such that read transactions are waiting for that same transaction set on both machines. Even if it is a low transaction table/DB, most reports on the same data will be looking at different aspects. If we partition the data by location, then it may not help time-based queries as much. In some ways splitting can even slow things down because rows may have to join ACROSS machines, which is usually slower than same-machine joins. A web server will generally partition by session and/or user and doesn't have to worry much about cross-user references (cross-user info usually goes into the database side). Essentially a single splitting aspect (user) can be found for web servers that works well in most cases. Databases not so much because its relationships have more dimensions/aspects. As a general rule, splitting up machines by a given aspect will make activities that are limited or partitioned on that given aspect faster, but activities that are split/shared on a different aspect will be slower because then the processing has to hop between machines instead of find everything on one machine. There are techniques to reduce these crossing problems, but they are non-trivial and may have other side-effects. Our universe is limited to 3 physical dimensions, which limits the number of aspects that can be "put next to each other" for speed. The virtual worlds that we keep our data in may have many dimensions. A typical sales DB will have store/customer location, warehouse/supplier location, time, product type, legal categories, total inventory, and marketing trends such as by age, gender, salary, religion, political affiliation, etc.

(Maybe it uses HOF's under the hood, but the developer doesn't necessarily have to see that implementation detail.)

This is because, by necessity, non-callback I/O must return its results, which means the function must block until it </em>'has<strong> the result. Separate, mutually non-blocking windows are in most GUI toolkits handled using threads, which are still an important concurrency tool but don't actually solve the problem of unnecessary blocking. Suppose you made a database query in the same thread as runs the report window; now the report window can't refresh itself until the database returns, because the query has blocked the thread.

           How exactly would it speed it up on the server side? You keep claiming otherwise, but my experience strongly tells me that the <strong>database is usually the bottleneck</strong>. If you are doing 10K loop cycles in your app software, then you or the DBA are probably doing something wrong. Your focus on in-app optimization is misplaced.

           <em>I've explained in depth at least twice that the bottleneck isn't tbe database, but the fact that your application code has to sit around and wait for database results while doing nothing. Perhaps that phrasing didn't appeal to you? What if I say it like this? Yes, the bottleneck is the database. However, if you use evented I/O, you </em>'don't let that bottleneck slow down your application<strong>. Your application doesn't block when it makes a database query, so it's free to perform other processing while waiting for the query to return; this processing is in the form of handling other events in the event queue, and events-with-callbacks represent any and all tasks your application needs to address, so handling those events amounts to getting work done. This means that whenever there is any work to be done (events in the queue), your application is active doing that work. It's never just "sitting around" waiting for a database query to return, unless there are no other events in the queue, which translates to there being no other work to do. This is a benefit nothing but non-blocking I/O can provide, threads included, because each individual thread in a normal threaded arrangement must still block on I/O calls. If you need any of those points explained in greater depth, scroll up. -</strong>DavidMcLean<em></em>

           Again, in most web-apps I work on, the bottleneck is the database. As far as your claimed benchmarks, that's something that's difficult to test here. I'm more interested in something that makes code easier to create and maintain. Performance tuning is usually most economically done by isolating the bottleneck and tuning that. Customers usually don't want to increase maintenance costs by shaving a few milliseconds in speed. If they ask for speed, then I will focus on such more, but at the expense of other features and/or cost to the customer. Sometimes it's the customers own fault. For example, they may want to stuff the public-facing web-site with all kinds of cutesy graphics and animation, which results in loading lots of fat <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> libraries to get eye-candy. Given of choice between snappy and eye-candy, such customers opt for the eye-candy. A fast server won't change the performance of that kind of mess.

           Why does that need HOF's, or even multi-threading? Multi-threading may jam up the DB from other users. Have a report queue table; the report processor can grab the next one from the queue and process it. We can have 1, 2, 3 etc. processing "lines" working on the queue, but have to keep in mind that the DB is the usual bottleneck and that others may be currently using it. Thus 2 processing lines may be the maximum realistic, and 1 is often good enough. But they don't need HOF's. If they are long-running reports, then perhaps use email to notify the user when they are ready. If short-term, then the client can poll the queue table for notification. Note that there are existing commercial reporting tools that handle such report queuing. (Like I said, for the more resource-intensive reports, a nightly or weekend process typically pre-digests the data and puts the semi-results in separate "summary tables" to make them runnable in real-time during the work day and also offload queries from the production tables. This is yet another way of not overloading the DB.) -t

           They are harder to "x-ray" and track, as described below. Pointers are fuckers to debug and trace. And you can't share the queue with multiple languages.

With just a few lines of code (about four, fairly simple lines), cluster will spawn separate processes for each core/processor.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Our receptionist will first represent "normal" I/O, serial and blocking. She's at the receptionists' desk, and an employee comes along. "Where can I find the foogarbles?" he asks, and she directs him accordingly. "Oh, they're in room 3131," she says. The employee wanders off toward room 3131. Now, the receptionist now just <em>sits there</em>. When another employee comes along to ask her something, she waves a hand and mumbles "I'm helping this other gentleman; please wait a moment." A queue of people slowly form, all needing the receptionist's help, but she's ignoring them all. In fact, she refuses to do any work until the first employee gets back, at which point she asks "Did you find the foogarbles alright?", to which he says yes. <em>Then</em> she gets to work on the next employee.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Now our receptionist will represent non-blocking evented I/O. The employee comes along and asks for foogarbles. She directs him, and then she goes <em>right back to receptionisting</em>. Another employee arrives, and she helps that employee out as well, perhaps telling him where the bazfangles are located. She just keeps working, even though she's waiting for that first employee to get back. When he <em>does</em> get back, she still asks "Did you find the foogarbles alright?", and he confirms that he did. However, there isn't a huge queue of employees to handle after that, because she's been helping those people while waiting for the first employee to find foogarbles.

        <li>
           Obviously it's a good trait in a receptionist, but whether it's good for common CBA, I'd have to study useful and common app scenarios. Generally it confuses the average user if a given application does more than one thing at a time. Further, a thread waiting does NOT necessarily hold up the CPU and other computer resources such that your analogy breaks down. The hardware can still work on other problems even if a given thread is waiting for something. Essentially each visitor coming to the reception desk can launch their own "receptionist" application, and generally they do want it to only "care" about them.  -t

           I didn't mean the analogy to be all-encompassing. It was intended to illustrate a specific point about roles, not model all of CBA.

I do believe in the benefit of road-testing (<a href="RaceTheDamnedCar.html">RaceTheDamnedCar</a>) and want to avoid the "Greek Mistake" (<a href="EvidenceEras.html">EvidenceEras</a>) of accepting that sitting in a corner and merely thinking about general solutions is sufficient. If you accept ancient-Greek-style evidence as-is, then we'll just have to agree to disagree in terms of what we accept as evidence. If it's clean logic in your head, then it should pass the road-test anyhow. I just feel that you are intent on selling refrigerators to this Eskimo. It's quite possible that the combo of existing techniques available to a typical CBA cover the vast majority of "needs" that you keep suggesting without explicit HOF's. If you cannot think of CBA's to illustrate your point, I don't know what to say. It's not my job to bring you your evidence. I would help if I could, but I just cannot find much use for those kinds of patterns so far. We dump some of the concurrency/parallelism issues off to the web server, some to the DB, some to client, some to scheduled services, etc. There are <strong>plenty of choices</strong> such that at least one is probably going to be generally sufficient. -t

           Where did I exclude report writers? I just said you are doing them wrong by letting users jam up the queue too easily, not that report writers were bad. And I don't know what kind of "waiting" you are referring to. I focus on the bottlenecks if there are speed/performance issues, and I don't see such as a magic fix. The bottlenecks are usually trace-able to the database. (Sorts and joins and non-indexable table scans are the usual suspects within queries and are inherently resource-intensive). I keep insisting this and then you guys come back and un-insist without giving realistic biz scenarios. You only came up with one realistic scenario, the "self-rolled join" (two query) scenario. But such occurs with noticeable effect maybe one in a hundred queries for the reasons given, but could be solved with the "parallel" construct I sketched up. But at least it's a start: your lumbering sick horse has at least left the gate. If you could come up with maybe 10 more scenarios that are too much for the "parallel" construct, then you'd be reaching about 10% of queries (assuming similar average frequency) and we may start getting somewhere. I've been doing CBA's for more than 2 decades; I know where the usual fricken bottlenecks are and you guys seem to be missing the target, over-focusing on the app processing for reasons that escape me. Maybe there's somehow a lot of hidden improvement in the NON-bottleneck areas, which comes across as very odd. Dark Matter? Dark Energy? Dark Time? If you could rewrite RDBMS somehow to speed up their sorts and joins and table-scans with your favorite doodads, THEN we're talking: you'd THEN be addressing the bottlenecks that I ACTUALLY encounter and detect in the field. If you "fix" something that the customer never noticed was broken and won't notice after the fix, then the customer won't buy your product. The database is where the customer (CBA devs) does notice slowness; so why not focus there? I notice the car tires wearing out often, yet you keep replacing the rear windshield, insisting it's the real problem. -t

Without Node.js (or equivalent evented I/O support), the DBMS can be the bottleneck.  Using Node.js, the DBMS is not the bottleneck.  In simplest terms, without Node.js, the user must wait for her sales report to finish before she can edit an order for a customer waiting on the phone.  If the customer insists on not being put on hold, our user can probably open another tab (or whatever) and edit the record, but that's awkward and implies an infrastructure that could allow users to launch an uncontrolled number of simultaneous report generations.  With Node.js (or equivalent), reports can always be queued and <em>never</em> interrupt real-time editing, the application can present a seamless, fluid and well-engineered interface, and the application can easily control how many reports actually run concurrently.]

If HOFs are "a fad and lots of bullshit", then I guess 'for' loops must have been "a fad and lots of bullshit" back when 'while' loops were good enough, right?  Has there ever been a new feature in programming languages, or a language paradigm outside of procedural programming, that you didn't regard as "a fad and lots of bullshit"?]

           The queue-ness came from a library function, not inherently from HOF's. There are other RAM-based queues. And I described weaknesses of your approach which you just plain ignored. Admit you've been beaten. And another weakness: power goes down and your HOF-based RAM lists are gone: POOF. But the table queue is still there, with the rockets' red glare. A RAM queue is often just a poor idea, HOF's or non-HOF.

           [Why are you assuming the report queue is strictly RAM-based?  It's trivial to have it fully controlled, managed, and processed by the application, have it seamlessly integrated into the user-interface, and persist it in a database table, all using Node.js or equivalent.  Your apparent claimed "weakness" is that it's difficult to debug, despite the fact that it's been often pointed out that HOFs are no more difficult to debug than any other function.  Therefore, I ignored it, as there's little point in making exactly the same points over and over again.]

           No it's not. You just claim it's trivial. I can claim I'm Napoleon. I have the arrogance to prove it, no?  And why have it in HOF's if it's in a database table? Why have the master queue be in two places? First you reinvent the web server, and you are now going to reinvent the RDBMS. Good luck with that. And you ignored the multiple language issue. If we use URI's and URL's in the queue table, then we can have it launch any tool or language we want to generate the reports. Didn't we have a similar discussion with the "scheduler" scenario? You guys got your cabooses kicked on that one also. He who doesn't learn from history is doomed to repeat it.

Last I heard, you were trying to dismiss scheduling as an example of an indivisible algorithm requiring customisation because you weren't familiar with it.  Anyway, I'm not sure what you mean by "reinvent the RDBMS" or "have the master queue be in two places", as the server side of the application is undoubtedly <strong>already using</strong> the RDBMS.  If we can use it to store customer data, we can use it to persist queued report requests, no?  Of course, that queue representation is entirely orthogonal to using HOFs and/or evented I/O.  Why do you seem to think it's HOFs vs RDBMSs?  Furthermore, why the focus on "any tool or language"?  My original requirement statement was very clear -- I don't recall mentioning any need for multi-language support.  In fact, overall, your response is so confused that I can only assume you've long ago stopped trying to understand our responses, or even read them except to use them as a handy source of keywords to drive your rants.  This has ceased to be a discussion; it's us patiently explaining, whilst you stick your fingers in your ears and shout ignorance and abuse.]

      <ul>
        <li>
           We discussed a process or application scheduler somewhere, similar to an OS scheduler. I'm not talking about employee scheduling. If the primary queue is in the DB, then where do the HOF's fit in? The value of multiple languages and tools is that we are not stuck with any one application language. The queue app can launch Java, C#, Python, Crystal Reports, etc. to generate reports. It should be clear that's advantageous to having to have all the reports be generated by a single language.

The computer(s) can still run gajillion other processes/threads. It's not a Commodore 64. The user interface for a given application, or even sub-application, is generally easier for <strong>users to "digest" if it's linear</strong>.

A million threads waiting for the same database are not going to be faster than 10.

There's only one thread under the evented I/O model I'm assuming (which is the one Node uses), not a million or even ten; single-threaded evented models like Node's do make it easy to avoid overloading the database server by controlling how many queries activate concurrently, which is much harder to arrange under a totally-independent one-thread-per-activity model. -</em>DavidMcLean<em></em>

           <em>"implement" may have been a poor choice of word on my part there, and I apologise for that. So, to clarify: This discussion is currently about designing the interface of an evented system; there are several ways to do this, not all of which require higher-order functions. However, using callback functions, which </em>'does<em>' require higher-order functions to exist, is a very good way to provide an evented interface with minimal syntactic overhead, such that it's a capable enough design to be used for writing complex logic in an evented fashion without too much confusion. Make more sense?</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           Are you talking about designing the client tool, such as a competitor to <a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a> browsers or Visual Basic? That may indeed be an interesting discussion (and has existing topics), but is outside the scope of CBA, for that would be a <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> issue. There are some key decisions to be made in such a tool about how events are specified and how it "connects" to a given app language, but the options/tradeoff-profiles are so wide open that it would be a very looooong topic. Note that in my opinion, such a tool shouldn't be tied to any one app or scripting language and thus shouldn't assume or heavily depend on any one feature of a given language. Eventing scope can largely be defined declaratively (attributes) such that we don't need the GUI system to depend on imperative setup info. The more that's defined declaratively, the less we have to worry-about/learn/connect-to specific app languages to use the GUI kit/engine. (In practice, it may need a default language to serve as a reference implementation.)

           <em>I am indeed talking about the design of things like the client-side tools. However, I'm not talking about it in terms of how those things are implemented; I'm merely talking about the interface they provide to application developers, which is absolutely something custom business developers must be concerned with.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In my opinion, a declarative interface similar to the "timer" example in <a href="HofPattern.html">HofPattern</a> would be a nice way to make it app-language-neutrual. The actual implementation under the hood could use or create HOF's, use Eval for languages lacking HOF's, etc.

        if foo.setting < 4 then<br/>

      <ul>
        <li>
           In many cases it could perhaps use the markup language's own features:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        <event name="event_flip"><br/>
        <namespace name="foo"><br/>

        <panel name="my_panel" visible="true"><br/>
        <button name="my_button" title="Flip the Thing"><br/>

           Well, regardless of your classification, maybe it's a good thing. XML is attribute-friendly, which is important for GUI's in which we want a lot of default behavior and optional options (redundantly redundant). Most mainstream languages suck for optional attributes and named parameters. It's one of the few bright spots in MS's recent languages (VB.net/C#), actually. And I'm not sure we need to have conditionals and loops as part of it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Named parameters are indeed a useful feature for GUIs; most languages I've seen do provide some way to cope with them, though (with the exception of Java in which one usually works around it with </em><a href="ArgumentObject.html">ArgumentObject</a>). However, getting back to the subject of events in general, how exactly do the following two code samples differ?<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        <event name="event_flip"><br/>
        <!-- display the panel, and change title of its button --><br/>
        <panel name="my_panel" visible="true"><br/>
        <button name="my_button" title="Flip the Thing"><br/>
        </event><br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        events.flip = function() {<br/>
        // display the panel, and change title of its button<br/>
        my_panel.visible = true;<br/>
        my_button.title = "Flip The Thing";<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>They do exactly the same thing in basically the same way, except that the second sample is valid </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and therefore is already executable. What advantage does your language offer over JS if the code is only trivially different between the two languages?<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This particular example doesn't show the value of named parameters because there are too few of them used/shown. Another problem is that relying on JS allows too much "creativity" (same thing done different ways). We need a standard, and this also implies discouraging creativity. Markup syntax reduces such reinvention. Some of this philosophy was discussed in <a href="StandardToolDependancy.html">StandardToolDependancy</a>/StandardToolDependency (currently under an <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> with GV).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The only way restricting syntax can truly reduce reinvention is if the provided syntax set covers a sufficiently broad range of patterns that code outside those patterns is practically never required, which is a tremendous task on the part of the language designers. Otherwise, the restricted syntax </em>'increases<strong> reinvention. With a language restricted so, whenever a more complex pattern is needed its implementation in low-level constructs must be written out in full; in short, the pattern is reinvented every time it's used. In an less-restricted language, higher-level patterns may be implemented once and wrapped up in libraries. -</strong>DavidMcLean<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If the language contains sufficient <em>base</em> primitives, then one can use a scripting or app language to generate the "missing parts" using the markup as input or output. Over time when the need or pattern proves common and useful, it can be added to the markup standard. The <a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a> doesn't even have a strait-forward way to draw a diagonal line, let alone address it for mouse clicking. Those kinds of primitives should be any GUI kit. The <a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a> makes Frankenstein look well planned. But I digress.

           <em>Frankenstein was a scientist; you may be thinking of Frankenstein's creation. Back on topic, you're suggesting that an app language should be used to generate code in your new XML-based language, which as I've pointed out is also an imperative language.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I never said anything about compiling XML. There appears to be a misunderstanding.

           That's akin to Oracle using C to build its RDBMS, Microsoft using Pascal for their RDBMS, IBM using Java for theirs, etc. We still (generally) write to the SQL standard and not assume that under the hood SQL is using HOF's or CASE lists or Eval's or C or Pascal or Java, etc.

           No, there are at least 4 ways to compete with HOFs: Databases (such as SQL sub-clauses), CASE/conditionals, Eval's, and OOP subclassing. Which one(s) are used depends on the circumstances of the app.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Come on now, HOF's are not a magic solution for everything. Sometimes they are excess indirection. And they tend to be harder to debug because they have no name. Things with names are all else being equal easier to debug and trace. And you cannot store them in the database (same DB app is already using). Sometimes a CASE statement is just simpler and more familiar to staff programmers.

           <em>Obviously higher-order functions aren't a magic solution for everything.

           <em>Is that because you never implement reusable algorithms?  Or, is it because the languages you're using don't support HOFs, so you've become so used to the alternatives that the alternatives seem preferable?</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           Many CBA's are not versed in HOF's such that using them may confuse teams.

           <em>This seems based on the presumption that HOFs are obscure, complex and difficult to understand.  The degree to which they've been embraced in Javascript suggests that is not the case.

           But in general you guys are going to have to find <strong>realistic CBA scenarios with coded samples</strong> that demonstrate their advantage in something clear or measurable (count something with numbers) if you want to sell HOF's. "Trust me, they make software more flexible and magic" is not going to cut it, at least for those who lived through a <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> era or two. Many were burned by the OOP-everywhere/GOF hype, or perhaps the CASE-Tools or the Lisp/AI hype of earlier eras (including Lisp HOF claims). I'll say it again: <strong>CODED REALISTIC/REPRESENTATIVE CBA EXAMPLES</strong>. Talk won't cut it. I've said it like 30 times already, but it's just not sinking in.

That's not a code organization issue, that's a client design-specifics issue. (And we could use mostly Eval's there also, as described already).

        <em>No, there's a third option, which I've explained already. The app handles other events in its queue while it's waiting for a particular one to return; all tasks that a Node app must perform are represented as events with callbacks, so handling other events amounts to getting other work done. This might include accepting new requests, finalising older requests, or perhaps handling some sort of deliberately-deferred action. Basically everything you'd want your Node app to do will be represented using events, so having Node process events rather than waiting around is extremely useful and provides a great performance boon for many applications. -</em>DavidMcLean<em></em>

        Okay, but what specific spot of code or functionality is being improved? Yes it can do the same thing, but that's not the issue. I want to see the production-like code behind something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's your app on HOF's:
      </p>
      <code>
        Hello World!<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here's your app on non-HOF's:
      </p>
      <code>
        Hello Wo~ %6 ` $k~[ z& j&^^<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>It's a little hard to know how to address your above request, because the claim we've made is for evented I/O, which in general is something that's only </em>'possible<em>' using callback functions or specific alterations to language semantic. I can't show a non-HOF version because evented I/O not using higher-order functions simply doesn't exist.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For the sake of completeness, by "alterations to language semantic", I mean adding a new keyword, like this:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        async users = db.query(query here...);<br/>
        async posts = db.query(query here...);<br/>
        res.write(reportUsing(users, posts));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>This would function equivalently to:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        db.query(query here..., function(users) {<br/>
        db.query(query here..., function(posts) {<br/>
        res.write(reportUsing(users, posts));<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>This is a useful way to tidy up very simple callback-oriented code.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>However, this keyword would be close to worthless if provided as the </em>'only<strong> option for implementing evented I/O, simply because it's not very flexible. An async keyword is indivisible and cannot be used to construct fancier, cleverer asynchronous logic; with a keyword like that, writing async.parallel wouldn't be possible.

        <li>
           <em>I'm not quite sure which part of this example makes you think it's the same as a previous example, but it's definitely different. It's for demonstrating the "other option" of providing special asychronous keywords instead of a generic higher-order-function-based framework. And the actual code example works differently, because it's making queries in series rather than parallel---and, more importantly, it shows that with such a keyword alone there isn't a </em>'way<strong> to make queries in parallel.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I described above already why the occurance would be rare in practice. But even for the rare cases where we might want to un-stack the two queries in the app code, ideally the code/language would look something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        // example "fern01"<br/>
        users, posts: recordSet;  // declare<br/>
        parallel a {<br/>
        users = db.query(fooSql);  // thread "a"<br/>
        } b {<br/>
        posts = db.query(barSql);  // thread "b"<br/>
        } onError(info)  {<br/>
        raiseError("Problem: " & info.msg & " in " & info.threadName);<br/>
        } // end parallel block-set<br/>
        io.write(reportUsing(users, posts));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The "parallel" block-set is syntactically kind of like a CASE statement (not C's, it sucks badly). Such a language would NOT need (exposed) HOF's to give us something like this. Why would HOF's be an improvement on this for this kind of use? -t

        You seem to want a gate-way kit into fancy-land with concurrency/parallelism. I'm only looking to give my niche some <strong>basic constructs for the rare occasions</strong> where it's needed. KISS for the rare stuff. Besides, if you go fancy-land, it's harder for the company to find and hire programmers who can read the code. It's one of the reason why Lisp never caught on in paid development: it's too easy to re-invent your own language in the language, making it a <strong>write-only code-base</strong>. Everybody reinvents their own "clever" FOR-loop and such. It's like people who like the smell of their own farts. Maybe I'm a grumpy fogey, but so be it.

           No, you have not provided "justification". You are thinking technology first, and practical solutions last. A common feature of newbies: coolness over utility. I don't know whether the languages I use have them, but I do know HOF's are over-hyped of late.

           <em>In what ways is your parallel construct, which enables exactly one form of concurrency and as a built-in language construct is difficult to manipulate programmatically (unless your language also has </em><a href="LispMacros.html">LispMacros</a>?), of more utility than the versatile and flexible facility that is first-class functions? First-class functions are a simple feature from a language-user's perspective (they can be a little complicated for compiler writers to handle in some cases, if <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a> hasn't been implemented properly already), yet they afford a broad spectrum of uses, ranging from <a href="InternalIterator.html">InternalIterator</a>s to resource management to <a href="EmbeddedDomainSpecificLanguage.html">EmbeddedDomainSpecificLanguage</a> opportunities to event callbacks as are discussed on this page already. On learning how to work first-class functions, programmers gain the ability to use a wide range of powerful patterns. The parallel construct doesn't appear to be that complex for programmers, either, although it's not really specified and so I'm not sure. However, when a programmer puts effort into learning how to use the parallel construct, all the programmer learns is how to run stuff in parallel in this specific language; it doesn't have nearly as big a payoff, because your suggested construct has much less utility than first-class functions. -DavidMcLean<em></em>

      <p>
        I have to disagree. In some ways programming languages do indeed <strong>"herd" developers</strong> to use certain patterns and conventions, and this is generally a good thing with teams and staff turn-over. It's difficult for the average developer to master 15 different ways to do concurrency/parallelism (and lots of other important topics also). It's somewhat comparable to standardization of equipment parts so that one can mix and match them without custom fiddling and filing (as in sand-paper) for each one. The industry wants <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a> whether a given developer personally wants that or not. My prior comments about Lisp apply here also. It's all a matter of weighing tradeoffs: learning time, stuff replacement time, the cost of app performance problems, etc. Many developers tend to obsess on some feature or aspect and want to go hog-wild with it (like Tables maybe? :-) Limiting the language reduces the damage done by wild individual tendencies. In CBA, being cheap to create and easy-to-maintain is usually given priority over software speed, except high-use applications or features, and these can usually be improved without HOF's. If you do the economic number crunching, your techniques don't hold water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every now and then a project comes along that may indeed need high-end concurrency/parallelism control and the owners may opt to hire a specialist on that subject. However, they know or should know that it's going to limit their ability to hire/rent somebody who can maintain it. Or, just buy top-end servers and use mediocre c/p programmers.

        [Are you suggesting that improving the fluidity and concurrency of business applications -- which potentially has a direct effect on application usability, and therefore (often) profitability -- is being done at the expense of correctness, reliability and maintainability?  Actually, libraries like Node.js make it easier for developers to meet certain requirements (like: make sure our users can keep editing whilst their reports run, but don't open more tabs because users lose track of them and we can't control how many reports are generated at once) without having to worry about the technical complexity of implementing concurrency, which allows developers to focus on correctness, reliability, and maintainability.]
      </p>
      <p>
        You haven't demonstrated "correctness, reliability and maintainability". You've reinvented GOTO spaghetti, but as HOF's instead of noodles.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A strong claim, and one you haven't made in this discussion previously. How do you plan to back that accusation up? -</em>DavidMcLean<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Next year. This year we focus on your claim that HOF's make common CBA's objectively better.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've never made that claim, but it's so general that it's evidently true, and I'll make it now. Higher-order functions do make common custom business apps objectively better, in terms of code re-usability, maintainability, and readability. -</em>DavidMcLean<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You cannot objectively measure "readability". It can be done, but I'm sure you don't have the resources. <a href="http://geocities.com/tablizer/goals.htm#base">http://geocities.com/tablizer/goals.htm#base</a> has some suggested numeric metrics for maintainability that you can apply to a CBA code base example. (See also <a href="CodeChangeImpactAnalysis.html">CodeChangeImpactAnalysis</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Okay, I'll provide a (probably) objective metric: Code with fewer elements not pertaining directly to the specific problem being solved is more readable. Do you find this metric reasonable? -</em>DavidMcLean<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you including or excluding "completely unrelated"? How is "directly" versus "not directly" measured?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If something is completely unrelated, by definition it doesn't directly pertain to the problem.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How are we measuring "different"? There may be many ways to skin a cat. That can easily be a sticking point. The continuum between a parameter change and a complete algorithm change is quite wide open.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>A parameter change and a complete algorithm change can actually be the exact same thing. Regardless, my original post talks about different problems, not different solutions.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           That's even harder to measure objectively. If you gave examples of what you are trying to get at in a general sense (outside of concurrency/parallelism), I may be able to offer suggestions to create a less open-ended definition or metric.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No, it's not reasonable because the more generic a thing becomes, the more it tends to resemble a programming language, and thus you can get a really high score by reinventing a <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Uh… we're talking about programming languages. Already. That's what we're doing.

        <em>Okay, I'll try to clarify as to the point here. The kind of metric I'm looking for is one that measures the amount of boilerplate needed to perform a given task.

      </p>
      <code>
        int count = 0;<br/>
        for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {<br/>
        count += i;<br/>

      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Twenty-four tokens. If we allow types to be dynamic or inferred, we can cut down the tokens by two. In Ruby, the same code looks like this:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        count = (1..10).inject :+<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Ten tokens, plus it's more apparent that the code is operating on the range 1-to-10. "inject" is not a very descriptive method name, I'll admit, but it's a Ruby idiom and would be recognisable for Ruby programmers. Now, we can express the same thing like </em>'this<em>' in Haskell:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        count = sum [1..10]<br/>

      <p>
        <em>Eight tokens now. More importantly, this is almost a direct description of the problem, except with some punctuation instead of words. "let </em>'count equal<strong> the </strong>sum<strong> of numbers </strong>from one to ten<strong>". sum isn't a higher-order function (although it was defined with one), so this isn't an example of code concision attained from higher-order functions.

      </p>
      <p>
        But we can have a similar <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>/API using a "plain" Algol/C-like language:
      </p>
      <code>
        count = sumList(rangeList(1,10));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here, rangeList creates a list starting with the first parameter and ending with the end parameter. "sumList" adds up all the elements in the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        I anticpate you are going to argue that one can use HOF's to inject an arbitrary operation on all elements of the list, similar to the "sorter" with an arbitrary comparing operation in the <a href="ArrayDeletionExample.html">ArrayDeletionExample</a>. However, this pattern doesn't happen that often at all in CBA (or at least nobody has found a way to convert biz apps to use such a pattern with an improved overall result).

           [It was me that agreed you are unlikely to need HOFs, but don't read more into that than it deserves.  It appears you work in an area of custom business application development which focuses almost entirely on data-entry, straightforward reporting, and coding focused around software integration.  As a result, you can almost certainly avoid HOFs and it won't matter much, though (as I've mentioned before), I suspect the languages and environments you're using will eventually support HOFs simply because they are of such value to other areas of software development (including other areas of custom business application development) that their future presence is almost inevitable.]

           I disagreed with that characterization, but I'll let the original address that. It's even possible that enough bad-apple HOF-spaghetti coders will give JS such a bad reputation that future languages will avoid them so as not to be tainted with the same reputation.

        Here's an <strong>example of a "business need" </strong> using the "two query" scenario(s) proposed above: Because of a recent corporate merger, the product description and price information currently comes from an Oracle RDBMS while the sales tallies from regions come from a Microsoft RDBMS (using product ID). Because they are different databases from different vendors we cannot join the two table sets on the database side, and probably must do it in the app. We want to speed the app up by allowing the app to query both the Oracle and Microsoft DB's in parallel in order to obtain RAM copies of the two table sets. It's a legitimate scenario. I rate it about "D+" on a commonality/frequency scale for reasons already given, but at least it's something we can explore from both the business needs side and the technical side. -t

        <strong>Limiting Concurrent Access to a Scarce Resource</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, using <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> or other single-threaded eventing environments it is trivial to wrap your database such that the server can only make a given number of concurrent queries. I recently had the opportunity (the need, really) to implement a similar setup; the scarce resource involved was not a database but RAM, due to running a RAM-expensive PDF-generation process. However, the solution, it turns out, is capable of being applied to <em>any</em> scarce resource without much complexity. Here's how. (The version I actually used in production is designed to work on Q promises <a href="http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/">http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/</a> rather than on (err, res) callbacks; I've made this one use callbacks since we're mostly talking about core Node in this page, but the details are pretty much the same between both versions.)
      </p>
      <code>
        limitSection = (n, f) -><br/>
        running = 0<br/>
        return inner = (args..., cb) -><br/>
        if running >= n<br/>
        return process.nextTick -> inner args..., cb<br/>
        ++running<br/>
        f args..., -><br/>
        --running<br/>
        cb arguments...<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        # example usage<br/>
        # to run a maximum of five queries simultaneously<br/>
        db.query = limitSection 5, (sql, cb) -><br/>
        makeTheQueryWithTheSqlGiven sql, cb<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The reference-counting (in the running variable) might be a little silly, but the limit decorator as a whole is short and <em>very</em> simple. Once implemented, it'll work on absolutely any async call you want. Thus, as stated above, it is indeed trivial to wrap the database (or any other asynchronous call) such that only a particular number run concurrently. -DavidMcLean

        My attempt at a <strong>summary</strong> of this topic, from my perspective: I have not seen any frequent and realistic scenario where NodeJS would significantly help typical apps that I see. There is no <em>major</em> "blocking problem" to be solved on the app side (and minor ones can be solved without HOF's). The bottleneck is usually with the DB, not the app code. Perhaps NodeJS can make <em>slight improvements</em> to the app-side speed/responsiveness, but at the expense of code readability to average developers, similar to what is described in the heated topic <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>. Any big improvement should be easy to demonstrate with a code sample and scenario, which didn't happen here, except in reality-deprived lab toys. Slight improvements could be harder to demonstrate because they are only noticeable in aggregate or in subtle areas. Maybe there is something at the "slight" end of benefits, but again, probably at the expense of code readability. Either way, it's difficult to present the "slight" case here. -t

        <em>The comments at the bottom and the link to the </em><a href="StackOverflow.html">StackOverflow</a> thread are interesting.  Obviously, <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> isn't for everything, and I don't think anyone here claims that it is.  You write, "I have not seen any frequent and realistic scenario where NodeJS would significantly help typical apps that I see."  I agree; I'm sure you don't, and with good reason: Conventional data-in/report-out applications and their serial UI model (i.e., enter data, choose report, wait for report to generate, rinse and repeat ad infinitum) won't benefit.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Here's a business-oriented case: Imagine that all your reports need to be displayed concurrently, in a scrollable executive dashboard of live graphical thumbnails that show live KPI summaries based on up-to-the-second OLTP data, with UI controls to filter and select data in real-time, and the thumbnails can expand into pop-up dynamic detailed 3D graphs as you pass your finger (touch-screen, of course) over them whilst the other thumbnails keep updating in the background.  For that kind of dynamism, </em><a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> and other event-driven, non-blocking toolkits make development relatively easy without the concurrency-management complexity of classic multi-threading.  If you don't create applications like that, then you don't need <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> and its kin.  If you do create applications like that -- and such "big data" visualisation executive toys are becoming increasingly popular, so some of us do create applications like that -- then <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> and the like are helpful tools to know.<em></em>

        There are multiple ways to skin the cat and the devil is often in the details (specifics of the scenario). That being said, I won't challenge such usage of NodeJS for now. However, I would point out that the decision probably heavily depends on the nature of the GUI system(s) involved and perhaps the network technology used to gather the info.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed, there are many ways to skin the cat, and the specifics of the scenario may well define the specifics of the solution.  When the specifics of the scenario require a client/server approach with a responsive, multi-tasking user interface, then </em><a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> is a tool -- one of a number of such tools -- that may make it easier to build.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The best solution would probably be something that allows multiple (optionally) independent applications to run "in" their own sub-window with their own process regardless of the language of the app and/or of the "monitoring" sub-window, such that JS and HOF's are not really an issue, other than perhaps a nice side option to have. (And I would hope it didn't have the memory leak like your <a href="BradyBunchGridDiscussion.html">BradyBunchGridDiscussion</a> example did.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That might be the best solution to one problem, or even a category of problems.  I've no doubt someone will eventually create such a tool and put it on </em><a href="GitHub.html">GitHub</a> or <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>.  Indeed, someone may have done so already. It might use <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> and/or HOFs internally, so that you don't have to see them.  However, frameworks like <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> and language constructs like HOFs are general-purpose and intended to solve the broadest possible range of relevant programming problems.  If you never encounter such problems, you may have no use for them.  If you do encounter such problems, and a tool exists that solves your problems (by, perhaps, using <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a>'s evented I/O or HOFs internally) then can use it and never see them.  However, if you do encounter such problems, and no tool exists that solves your problem, then evented I/O (e.g., <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a>) and HOFs may help.<em></em>

           But if you carry around certain kinds of extra features "just in case", it invites misuse and confusion. We've had this debate in <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>.  What if we are attacked by a giant green gorilla? Should we all walk around with green gorilla guns?

That sounds just as speculative -- and as insulting of the abilities of programmers -- here as it does in <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>.  If we accept that argument, we should all -- independent of ability or inclination -- be programming in a safety-padded version of structured COBOL, lest someone misuse a pointer, reference, goto, class, container, object, or any other programming construct either popularised since 1983 or misused before it.  Like your giant green gorilla, your concerns are imaginary.  Programming capability evolves, and programmers evolve with it.

           It's speculative either direction. Nobody has solid studies. If my opinion on average programming staff is "insulting", I don't know what to do about that. I call it as a see it, and if some are bothered by my view of reality, that's life. I observe programmers and their programs over time in many different org sizes and types and come to conclusions. If I am stupid or biased or delusional, I'm not aware it. A self-check is not returning an error code. And if it can happen to me, it can happen to you. Human brains are imperfect. I don't see a significant roll for HOF's in those work environments. Objects and other techniques can handle similar things for occasional needs just fine and the need is simply not frequent enough that code size is impacted much. We don't need 2 kinds of monkey wrenches in our already-crowded tool kit.

           When fads come, the fads are often added to languages and tools so that they <em>look</em> competitive in the market. In the short and medium term, fads often dictate tool features, but in the longer run high-brow features either disappear or fall out of use. (As far as OOP, it tends to be used by architects to design API's for the low and medium-level programmers, who are generally consumers of classes and otherwise don't create new classes unless that's the convention for a certain kind of common framework or "thing", such as a Page class or Screen class for each web page or screen.)

Many languages now provide libraries or other facilities to support XML generation/parsing, <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> consumption or provision, and operating systems now have pre-built "cloud" versions.  In other words, they've resulted in features that are available as a matter of course and used without controversy, and have additionally spawned and incorporated useful successors like (for example) YAML, JSON and REST.

           FP had a surge already in the mid 80's during the AI/Lisp bubble. Remnants would have stuck from them if they had perceived lasting general market value. Clipper (<a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> dialect) even had HOF's.

        <li>
           <em>Clipper had function references, akin to Pascal's 'procedure' parameters or C's function pointers.  Notably, Clipper's function references didn't close over their calling scope, which significantly limited their utility as HOFs.  Anyway, what we're discussing here is not what languages have lived and died, but what </em>'language features<strong> have lived and died.  Clipper might have died -- and I'm sure HOFs weren't what killed it -- but HOFs are alive and well.  Whilst there was an AI bubble in the early 1980s and an </strong><a href="AiWinter.html">AiWinter</a> thereafter, the language capabilities that AI promoted have continued to be incorporated in various Lisp implementations, and in Haskell, and in other <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> languages.  What died out were <a href="LispMachine.html">LispMachine</a>s -- for various commercial, market-related, and technology reasons (not the least of which was that commodity PCs made dedicated Lisp machines pointless; you could simply install Lisp on your PC) -- but their language capability "remnants" have most certainly stuck, flourished, and exist today in popular languages like Lisp (as always), Clojure (more Lisp, really, and growing in popularity), Haskell (increasingly popular), F# (increasingly popular), and Javascript (inescapably pervasive.)  Even more significantly, we're seeing the addition of <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> facilities in C# and Java, and I know no developers (present company, i.e. you, excepted) who argue that this is a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>, and many consider it a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>.<em></em>

           Whether languages include them or not is mostly a different question over whether they are used or not in practice.

Again, only time will tell whether we are in a FP bubble or up-trend. In twenty years or so we can revisit it and the winner can beat the loser with a cane or bed pan.

I know YOU strongly believe there is a trend; you don't have to keep stated that belief. I will agree that HOF's are found in more general purpose development languages (as a language feature) than in the past, but in general the feature sets have increased, perhaps due to more horse-power or more open-source compiler/interpreter-building tools.

Maybe that branch will become commoditised by tools that wrapper up the HOFs and other higher-order facilities, so marginal developers don't have to use them.

           You are partly right because the database and web server takes care of a lot of parallelism and concurrency issues already, and I'm happy to dump a lot of those issues off onto their little silicon asses. However, the bottleneck <em>should be</em> managing, tracking, verifying, communicating, and negotiating the custom business logic, not so much diddling with bits and threads, and the fanciest of programming probably won't make the biz logic aspect go away.

           <strong></strong>NodeJS is roughly analogous to assembly language<strong> in that one can squeeze more out of the machine by "coding to the metal". </strong>NodeJS allows one to "code to the concurrency/parallelism metal" (or at least closer to or at a finer granularity of C/P). There are niches for such, but in general most orgs find it more economical to use higher level tools, often throwing hardware at the problem if there is a performance issue rather than throw programming at it. Assembler programmers similarly used to try to justify wider use of their skills by selling the speed and reduced hardware costs. The industry, however, decided that (extra) hardware was cheaper than programming expenditures, including skill headhunting (HR).

        <em>By the way, the </em><a href="BradyBunchGridDiscussion.html">BradyBunchGridDiscussion</a> example (<a href="http://shark.armchair.mb.ca/~dave/hofajax/)">http://shark.armchair.mb.ca/~dave/hofajax/)</a> didn't have a memory leak.  It ran flawlessly on IE, Android Web browser, Safari and Chrome.  It was <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a> (version 28?) that had a memory leak, something that is quite well known.  Google "firefox memory leak" and see (for example) <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/998289''">http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/998289''</a>
