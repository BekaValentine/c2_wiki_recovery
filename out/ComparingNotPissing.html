        Comparing Not Pissing

      <p>
        Guidelines to prevent a language comparison from turning into a <a href="LanguagePissingMatch.html">LanguagePissingMatch</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Never dismiss a feature just because you don't see a use for it. Other people might use it all the time. Examples: <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a>, Closures, ...
        </li>
        <li>
           Never state that a construct seems preferable without explaining why it seems preferable.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use <a href="EprimeLanguage.html">EprimeLanguage</a>. That's to say, try to stop yourself from saying things like "<a href="ComIsLove.html">ComIsLove</a>". Explain instead what seems lovely to you.
        </li>
        <li>
           Another useful technique is to expose one's lack of understanding.  Like "I don't understand how one implements polymorphism in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>", or "I don't see how X works better than Y."  Others will be glad to enlighten you.  (Be sure to avoid <a href="BrutalSarcasm.html">BrutalSarcasm</a>, however--it rarely works in writing.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Try to avoid 'league tables'.  (e.g. 'More shrink wrap apps are written in Language A than Language B'.)
        </li>
        <li>
           If you are debating a non-technical issue (e.g. extent of penetration into a market) try to remember that it may have nothing to do with technical merit.
        </li>
        <li>
           Question your motives.  What do you want out of the discussion, do you want to learn? win? comfort yourself that you will still have a job in 5 years? decide which language to go for next in order to still be in a job in 5 years?  
        </li>
        <li>
           Do you feel angry when you read criticisms of <em>your</em> language?  Do you feel undermined?  Better work out why; these things are just not that important.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you are debating to score points make it clear up front and put Advocacy in the page title!
        </li>
      </ul>
