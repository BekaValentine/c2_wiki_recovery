        Proprietary Source
      </h1>
      <p>
        Not <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>. This includes not only <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a> (where the code is not available
        at all), but any case where software does not qualify as <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> according to the
        OpenSourceDefinition <<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php</a>>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em></em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> has a precise definition, but the opposite is not Closed--it's proprietary.  For example, Microsoft has shipped the source code for <a href="MicrosoftFoundationClasses.html">MicrosoftFoundationClasses</a> for over a decade.  It's not <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a>, but it's not <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, either.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn't that the point?  "And some non-Opensource software has no source available to you at all.  That is <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a> software."  Proprietary could be closed source, but it doesn't have to be. Proprietary is definitely not open source.  Closed source howver is always proprietary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Correct, but I think this point argues for proprietary as the correct inverse of "open".  I don't believe there is software that is neither </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> nor Proprietary; there is, however, software that is neither <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> nor <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a>.<em></em>
