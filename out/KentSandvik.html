      <p>
        Kent Sandvik (INFP programmer, believe it or not) is currently working for EXcite@Home doing software design and implementation of broadband portals. He recently installed <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> for keeping track of the design patterns for the next version of the broadband portals. He did <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> by mistake at earlier project assignments, didn't know the term but used the techniques as they make sense.
