        Symbolics Machine
      </h1>
      <p>
        Symbolics was a manufacturer of <a href="LispMachine.html">LispMachine</a>s.  Still highly collectible, and easy to buy for under $1000USD.

        Symbolics was a maker of Lisp Machines. They are still selling a software emulation running on DEC Alpha systems. The emulation is called <a href="OpenGenera.html">OpenGenera</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The operating system is called <a href="GeneraOs.html">GeneraOs</a>. Genera is completely written in Lisp - networking, graphics, device drivers, applications - everything. Some systems are still running on the Internet. The operating system provides for example TCP/IP, DNS client and server, mail client and server, X11, and many more Internet-based services. In fact the company Symbolics was the first organization ever to have a domain name - symbolics.com in 1985. A popular application is CL-HTTP, a web server written in Common Lisp. The author of CL-HTTP is John Mallery from the MIT AI Lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was another operating system for Symbolics' Lisp Machines called Minima. It was developed for real-time systems like AT&T's ATM switches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Symbolics built their own microprocessor - the Ivory - specially optimized to run Lisp software. Ivory-based machines were for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           XL400, a workstation with a VME bus and a megapixel console with mouse.
        </li>
        <li>
           XL1200, a workstation with a VME bus and a megapixel console with mouse. Symbolics also created high-end graphics cards for the XL1200 called FrameThrower.
        </li>
        <li>
           XL1201, a pizza box workstation with megapixel console.
        </li>
        <li>
           UX400, a VME bus card for SUNs.
        </li>
        <li>
           UX1200, a VME bus card for SUNs.
        </li>
        <li>
           MacIvory I, a set of <a href="NuBus.html">NuBus</a> card for Macs.
        </li>
        <li>
           MacIvory II, a set of <a href="NuBus.html">NuBus</a> card for Macs.
        </li>
        <li>
           MacIvory III, a <a href="NuBus.html">NuBus</a> card for Macs. One very large Nubus card (plus a daughter card) had space for the Ivory processor and 8MW of memory. 
        </li>
        <li>
           NXP1000, a pizza box machine without console. Used via X11.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Typical applications for these machines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           large and complex <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> software development environments like KEE or KnowledgeCraft.
        </li>
        <li>
           AI applications like the credit card transaction checking software from <a href="AmericanExpress.html">AmericanExpress</a>, Cyc, Metal, ...
        </li>
        <li>
           documentation authoring with Concordia, the first large-scale commercial <a href="HyperText.html">HyperText</a> system.
        </li>
        <li>
           3D graphics with the S-Graphics suite. Used in computer games, movies and tv spots. Later S-Graphics has been ported to SGIs and NT machines. IZWare sells a system called Mirai, which is a rewrite.
        </li>
        <li>
           3D CAD applications like ICAD.
        </li>
        <li>
           ECAD systems for chip design.
        </li>
        <li>
           ComputerAlgebra with Macsyma.
        </li>
        <li>
           Image Processing with Scope.
        </li>
        <li>
           Neural Network development with Plexi.
        </li>
        <li>
           Frontends to super computers like Thinking Machine's Connection Machine. 
        </li>
      </ul>
