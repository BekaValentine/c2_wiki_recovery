        Extra Legs On Toa Swan
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ExtraLegsOnToaSwan.html">ExtraLegsOnToaSwan</a> is a way to describe the experience of running parallel codes using <a href="ScaLapack.html">ScaLapack</a>.  The code is replicated on a number of processors, which each make the same call to a subroutine (sorry this is FORTRAN) all together.  This looks to me (the user programmer) like one call to a library, but it is actually a call which will cause the processes to all work simultaneously on different parts of the data to get the result. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When all is well the swan glides smoothly, 9 or 16 or even 25 processors working together in harmony. Sometimes this is not the case. The swan's legs get tangled and back comes an error code.
