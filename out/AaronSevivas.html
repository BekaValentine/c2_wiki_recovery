        <em>Hi Aaron. I'm visiting Norway (Bergen) for a conference in a few week's time.  no doubt I'll have no time to socialise, but I was wondering if you could help me.  I'm looking for a simple text written in Norwegian.  A children's book would be ideal, but it must be simple.  On-line would let me access it immediately, but I'm willing to pay postage for something suitable.  Do you have any suggestions?  Thanks in advance.</em>

        For what purpose? Can I have some context as to why you would want this?  I assume its for learning the language, and is certainly a good idea to start with children's books; but if your stay is short, I would say at least 80% of the population speaks English.
