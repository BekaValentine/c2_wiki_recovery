        Hot: Single-page Web apps<br/>
        Not: Websites<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Remember when URLs pointed to Web pages filled with static text and images? How simple and quaint to put all information in a network of separate Web pages called a website. New Web apps are front ends to large databases filled with content. When the Web app wants information, it pulls it from the database and pours it into the local mold. There's no need to mark up the data with all the Web extras needed to build a Web page. The data layer is completely separate from the presentation and formatting layer. Here, the rise of mobile computing is another factor: a single, responsive-designed Web page that work like an app -- all the better to avoid the turmoil of the app stores.</em>

      <code>
        Hot: CSS frameworks<br/>
        Not: Generic Cascading Style Sheets<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Once upon a time, adding a bit of pizzazz to a Web page meant opening the CSS file and including a new command like font-style:italic. Then you saved the file and went to lunch after a hard morning's work. Now Web pages are so sophisticated that it's impossible to fill a file with such simple commands. One tweak to a color and everything goes out of whack. It's like they say about conspiracies and ecologies: Everything is connected. That's where CSS frameworks like SASS and its cousins Compass have found solid footing. They encourage literate, stable coding by offering programming constructs such as real variables, nesting blocks, and mix-ins. It may not sound like much newness in the programming layer, but it's a big leap forward for the design layer.</em>

        ---<strong>Stack Engines</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        Dev Ops - the Stack Engine consists of a "management mesh, which provides discovery and visibility for containers across an organization. <br/>
        "As containers come up and down, when they're running, stopped, or paused, they have total visibility in a distributed way across all of <br/>
        the container environments." Visibility includes the containers and the hosts they run on -- whether a VM, bare metal, or an Amazon EC2<br/>
        instance -- as well as the dependencies between the containers and their respective hosts, such as whether more memory is needed. It is <br/>
        deployed as a Docker container being a mix of open source and commercial software. A free version, designed to get users up and running, <br/>
        is aimed at a developer audience; the more professional, for-pay version increases in cost depending on the scale of deployment.<br/>
