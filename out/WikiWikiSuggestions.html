        I moved some suggestions for <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> that seem to have been taken care of, but still have information value, to <a href="WikiWikiSuggestionsResolved.html">WikiWikiSuggestionsResolved</a>. I was pretty conservative, so there are probably more suggestions that should be moved.

        <strong>Wiki Name Inheritance Schemes</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my wikis provide an inheritance scheme for name scoping. I've explored single-inheritance. I imagine a multiple-inheritance approach would be a win.
      </p>
      <p>
        One Wiki per subject. New wiki are created with a back-pointer to the wiki from which it was spawned, so we have a tree of namespaces. These are searched in last-to-first order. For Lispers, a name space looks like a Lisp "environment". I define a CommonWiki that has all the usability pages. Individual Wikis inherit the common pages.

        <strong>Implementation Details</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of suggestions...in <a href="WikiBase.html">WikiBase</a> you use $&. I don't know which version of Perl you have but there are performance penalties for using that - much better with recent perls (it used to add about 50% to the running time, now its about 10%) - anyway it still helps if you bracket your regexp and use $1 (say) instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my own <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> I used [a-z]{3,}: as the protocol pattern - you'll find that (for example) 'https', 'ldap', 'javascript' and 'about' links don't work on this Wiki instance, and the above stops you worrying about the ever growing list of url protocols.

        <strong>Caching details</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It'd be great if some kind of 'Last-Modified:' HTTP-Header could be added to the pages. This would solve most problems with webcaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's not quite that simple. For one, most web servers don't honor the "If-Modified-Since" HTTP request header for CGIs. And if they did, there's another issue: If you base the last-modified date on the underlying database entry or file, you risk missing other transitions that effect the visual representation of the page, such as an embedded Wiki link transitioning from inactive to active.</em>

        Set up an email list server for <a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a> and other ephemeral content. Put a link at the bottom of every page that says something like: "Send comments to list" and opens a new mail to the list with the page name as the subject. The link could also be on the edit page. We'd also need a link in order to (un)subscribe to the list, perhaps on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.

        <em>It might eliminate a fair amount of noise here. There are certainly conversations that go on that would be better suited to email.</em>

        Change the implementation of making <a href="FullSearch.html">FullSearch</a>. Currently, all titles are linked to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch,">http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch,</a> which is unfortunate. They should instead be linked to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?PageName,">http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?PageName,</a> and this has several reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The BrowserCache in opera gets messed up. The <a href="OperaBrowser.html">OperaBrowser</a> does not try to reload the page because it assumes it already has the page in the cache.
        </li>
        <li>
           I cannot do a <a href="FullSearch.html">FullSearch</a> from another page about a category. <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?CategoryCategory">http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?CategoryCategory</a> would be useful. [<em>Just do </em><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?search=CategoryCategory.'']">http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?search=CategoryCategory.'']</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           The usage of the RefererHeader is <a href="InMyHumbleOpinion.html">InMyHumbleOpinion</a> a hack.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I don't have any references ready, but I don't think opera has a bug when caching the page. Furthermore, I think a <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a> does not have to send the RefererHeader.

        <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>s answer on this on the page <a href="WikiWikiSuggestionsResolved.html">WikiWikiSuggestionsResolved</a> is: <em>The search uses HTTP_REFERER. If you block this then it won't work. I use this obscure mechanism because it keeps dumb spider software from issuing zillions of searches. -- Ward</em>

      <p>
        In this case, you should define <a href="RobotsDotTxt.html">RobotsDotTxt</a>.

        Here's one I wasn't able to find here already -
        A lot of pages are book/movie references without much discussion. It would be nice if they could be collected several to a page, but that would require a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> that referenced an anchor in a page of another name. Perhaps a CompoundWikiName would work? -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        Being a <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>, I think the personal home pages (<a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a>) should be filtered out of, or put in a separate block at the end of the quickChange pages. -- <a href="AlainRavet.html">AlainRavet</a>

        This python <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> to implement wiki italics is itself mauled in display by Wiki's text formatting.

        Recently (in the last month or so), I've been unable to reach c2.com, after sitting down this afternoon and trying to figure out why, it appears the firewall between here and there sets the "TypeOfService" bits for TCP's SYN packets. There is a firewall between here and c2.com that drops packets with the TypeOfService bits set. As I can reach nearly every other website except c2.com, I presume that it's close to c2.com. I've fixed my end not to set the TypeOfService bits at all when sending to c2.com, but how many other people are having the same problem? -- <a href="PerryLorier.html">PerryLorier</a>

        Adding accesskeys (<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/accesskeys/)">http://www.alistapart.com/stories/accesskeys/)</a> to all the different links on a wiki page would be handy. We could then access <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> with Alt-E, <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> with Alt-Q, <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s (the title) with Alt-B and the <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a> with Alt-F. There are still a few browsers out there that do not support accesskeys, but they would just ignore the attribute. -- <a href="JohannesGijsbers.html">JohannesGijsbers</a> (incorporated comment by <a href="VickiKerr.html">VickiKerr</a>)

        What I think missing in a Wiki is an easy way to create inner links (anchors).
        (<a name="#...">; <a href="#...">) <em>For a kludge suggestion, see </em><a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        All inner links should result in a list at the top of the page. This feature is absolutely necessary in creating good access to larger pages!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My take on this is if a page is long and there's a clear subtopic worthy of an anchor, it's probably time to </em>ExtractPage.<em></em>

        I respect most of you old farts, but I understand most of you aren't around any longer.

        Furthermore, this wiki is still very much alive, and we should celebrate that by acknowledging precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
        By precedent in these terms, I mean, we near to incorporate a date/time stamp into each additional comment produced.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think at first thought that the benefit of having a time stamp on each subsequent comment far outweighs the possibility that any dildo can produce a comment that is completely irrelevant and may, for dexterity, not be eliminated as is the current, wonderful setup.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I peruse these snippets of wisdom from the ages, I relate this experience to case law. And as much as I'd love to see some precedents vanish and others thrive, dates can be important in considering the weight of comments and the history of computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't want to see a reddit jackass scenario, but I think if this is thrive and prosper and be relevant to future nerds, then we must do this. That is all.
