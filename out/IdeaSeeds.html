        These are starts of ideas.  They are not fully developed ideas, but they should be developed more in the future.  <a href="IdeaSeeds.html">IdeaSeeds</a> tend to have a risky start in life and have a high probability of being refactored out.  Like this entry might.  -- <a href="BenThomasson.html">BenThomasson</a>

        I like to use the term of "notions" for starts of ideas. I like seeds as a figurative notion that out of "<a href="IdeaSeeds.html">IdeaSeeds</a>" (notions) grows ideas, and then to take it beyond, out of the ideas grows the implementations or applications. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
