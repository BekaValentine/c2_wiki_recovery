        Ordering Intervals

        <em></em>'Assuming that you have a "<a href="DateRange.html">DateRange</a>" class, containing a start and end date, is there a sensible way to order instances, sort them, or to test if one date range is "less than" another?<em></em>'
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this page is cast in terms of <a href="DateRange.html">DateRange</a>s, it's really about ordering intervals, and the fact that it's using dates is essentially irrelevant.  Issues specifically arising from dates have been left on <a href="OrderingDateRanges.html">OrderingDateRanges</a>.  For the remainder of this page, assume we're working in a single time zone.

        Almost all of the discussion below is covered by the ideas of a "<a href="PartialOrder.html">PartialOrder</a>" - see that page for more details.
      </p>
      <p>
        With intervals in general there are several obvious partial orders that you might want to consider.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           [a,b] <= [c,d]  iff  b<=c.  (In other words, if the two ranges are disjoint, or only overlap on the boundary).
        </li>
        <li>
           [a,b] <= [c,d]  iff  a <= c <= d <= b  (In other words, if one range includes another)
        </li>
        <li>
           [a,b] <= [c,d]  iff  a<=c and b<=d
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        None of these is a total ordering, each is justifiable, and there are many more.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to define a total ordering on an interval there are several you can choose from.  The ordering you choose should remain transitive and non-symmetric, and there are several pitfalls.  Note that one person's "obvious" total ordering will almost certainly be counter-intuitive to someone else.  Any total ordering chosen should be "obvious" from the context in which it's used, otherwise its existence will probably do more harm than good.

        <li>

        As for degenerate date ranges...
        Points, squares, triangles, and rectangles are degenerate polygons.
        <em>But that's probably not a very efficient implementation strategy.</em>
        (And circles...  Would you like to put an infinite number of points in that polygon?)

        <em>Funny question.. what is it in algebra when you have < and =, but not(a < b) and not(b < a) does not imply a = b.  Um, besides a mess?

        Yes, if your definition of date range is that it does not include the end date/time, then a "date range" where start and end dates are equal is an empty set:  Technically, it does not contain any date at all.
        Yes, you can "interpret" start and end being equal as a special case, but then your formal logic gets messed up, and you'll find yourself forced to code the "special case for equals" logic lots of places in your code.

        I think the official math formulation for complex is that you don't have <. I think you are supposed to have transitivity with <, but I could be wrong, I frequently am.
      </p>
      <p>
        - The problem with an order on the complex numbers is not that it couldn't be transitive. We could just order by their magnitudes. Also, the problem of (z1<=z2 /\ z2<=z1) not implying z1=z2 is just a minor one (Technically, it would be a preorder). The <em>real</em> problem is that any defined order on the complex numbers (and there are infinitely many such) doesn't "interface" right with + and *. The usual laws connecting <=, + and * on the reals cannot be maintained in C. <em> -- </em><a href="BjarkeEbert.html">BjarkeEbert</a><em></em>

        Sets can be "ordered", i.e. for all a, b in S, either a < b or b < a or a = b. They can be partially ordered, where for some a and b, none of the above hold. And they can be unordered, with no relation < at all. My recollection is that the complex numbers are unordered. Their magnitudes, i.e. the real numbers, of course are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ah. The reason the complexes aren't ordered is, as Michael says above, you're supposed to know that if not (a < b) and not (b < a), then a = b. This wouldn't work for complex. And would it for <a href="DateRange.html">DateRange</a>? -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

      <ul>
        <li>
           Actually, the <a href="ComplexNumbers.html">ComplexNumbers</a> <strong>can</strong> be ordered completely.
          <ol>
            <li>
               Use the canonical representation of a*e^(i*theta) with theta the smallest non-negative, and then say that if the magnitudes are different then that determines the order, otherwise the angle determines the order.
            </li>
            <li>
               Use the canonical representation z=x+iy and say that is the <em>x</em> values are different then use that, otherwise use the <em>y</em> value.

        A date range be plotted as a point in 2 dimensions, but what can we do with that? Does the area defined by that point, the start/end axis, and 0,0, mean anything?  Is the slope of the line from 0,0 to start,end meaningful?  Is there a relationship between two points, start1,end1 and start2,end2, such that we can mathematically determine if the ranges overlap or have other interesting properties?

        Yes, dates and times offer fertile ground for class creation:
        When I say "June 27th," I'm usually referring to the whole day, not just the first millisecond of it.  (...as is assumed with many Date/Time classes.)
        I've seen patterns for such things as "every Tuesday and Thursday from July 14th to September 10th of 1999."
        And, there's the concept of "3 hours, 2 minutes long," independent of start and end dates/times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hmmm...  This is the opposite assumption:  Using a single date/time value as if it were a date range.  When my Date variable has the value "exactly midnight at the start of January 1st, 2001," which of the following does it represent...</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That instant of time only.
        </li>
        <li>
           That millisecond only.
        </li>
        <li>
           That first second or minute.
        </li>
        <li>
           That day -- 24 hours, starting at that point.
        </li>
        <li>
           That month.
        </li>
        <li>
           That year.

        "January 16th, 2001" is a date.
        Is "January 2001" a date range?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it is -- it's the range "[2001-01-01, 2001-02-01)".
        Now inside my "O<strong>'neMonth" date class, I might <em>store</em> it as "month 01, year 2001," or as "month starting at date/time "2001-01-01 00:00:00.000," or as "</strong><a href="DateRange.html">DateRange</a>(2001-01-01, 2001-02-01)" (with or without "zero times").
        But the great thing about classes is that I can encapsulate those implementation decisions -- my class conforms to the <a href="DateRange.html">DateRange</a> interface, and callers don't need to worry about how I accomplish it.
