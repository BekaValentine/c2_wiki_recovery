        Most Frequently Used
      </h1>
      <p>
        Whenever I analyze and design, I ask the user what he does the most frequently. The process that user does most frequently is to be automated first. Then next frequently etc. And I find that it applies to every other aspects of software design.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Automate most frequently executed process.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make efficient implementation of most frequently used code.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make it easier for the user to use most frequently used functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
           Provide flexibility and simplicity to the most frequently used code.
        </li>
        <li>
           Standardize most frequently used protocol.
        </li>
        <li>
           etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So, put maximum efforts where it is used most frequently.
