        Looking to find consulting opportunities that take advantage of my business experience and non-technical skills (see <a href="http://www.stephensawyer.com/content/SteveSawyer_SkillsList2.pdf),">http://www.stephensawyer.com/content/SteveSawyer_SkillsList2.pdf),</a> though I still love applying technology in my work.
