        Especially when discussing social issues, evidence is important in the pursuit of truth.

        People can invent truth by abstracting away its context. For example: <em>"Some XP advocates argue you don't need to design."</em> What XP "advocates"? Is there an official body of self-policing XP advocates who punish each other for saying foolish things?

        If a simple hyperlink or in-context quote were supplied, people could have an enlightening discussion. Perhaps all could see that this particular XP advocate is an internet kook, and people should stay away from him. Or perhaps the quote was an exaggeration intended for humorous effect, leading to a profound point.

        But as it stands, claiming <em>"Some XP advocates argue you don't need to design"</em> is a way to claim truth without requiring messy evidence.
