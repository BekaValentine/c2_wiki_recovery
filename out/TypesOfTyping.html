        <em></em><a href="TypingQuadrant.html">TypingQuadrant</a> seems to be about classification of languages; <a href="TypesOfTyping.html">TypesOfTyping</a> seems to be about defining the terms.<em></em>

        Actually <a href="TypingQuadrant.html">TypingQuadrant</a> was meant to be about defining the terms through the classification of languages. And if you're looking for good definitions there's always <a href="LucaCardelli.html">LucaCardelli</a>'s paper on the subject: <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cardelli97type.html">http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cardelli97type.html</a> See <a href="CardelliTypeTerminology.html">CardelliTypeTerminology</a>

        No one seems to be able to completely agree to what they are or how they are defined.  But here's a stab at it, trying to be simple:

        <dt>NominativeTyping</dt>
        <dd>Types of values are differentiated by programmer-specified names (two differently-named types which are arrays of 5 ints are differert types).</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt><a href="StructuralTyping.html">StructuralTyping</a></dt>
        <dd>Types are defined by the structure of values (two differently-named types which are arrays of 5 ints are the same type).  See <a href="NominativeAndStructuralTyping.html">NominativeAndStructuralTyping</a>.</dd>
      </dl>

        I do not think that upcasting constitutes a change of type, but downcasting certainly does.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Huh? This would require some strange rules for type (in)equivalence, or it could be argued that with B-(up)->A-(down)->B the two B-s end up with different type. (The type of A is equal to the first B but different from the second B.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> is a separate issue; like optimization I'd consider it a compiler feature rather than a language feature. <em>Type inference is definitely a language issue, since it dictates where type information must be written or can be elided in the source text.</em> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> as an optional compiler feature, but more often <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> is a feature of a language; pure functional languages like Haskell <strong>cannot</strong> be implemented without it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Huh?  There are dynamically-typed functional languages, such as <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>.  Plus, I'm sure one could write a functional language with <a href="ManifestTyping.html">ManifestTyping</a>, though I'm not sure one would <em>want</em> to.  <em></em><a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> is not a pure functional language.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Um, there are typeless pure functional languages, such as the pure lambda-calculus, so the claim about the necessity of <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> is obviously false.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are three axes here: static-dynamic, strong-weak and nominative-structural.  You can choose to look at each as boolean (either types can be changed or they can't) or a continuum.  When considering whether a language has any of these attributes, it may be most productive to consider not just what is possible in a language, but what is encouraged.
