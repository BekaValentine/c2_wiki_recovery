      <p>
        A workspieces problem has two parts, the workpiece and the operator.
        The operator is a person using a computer to control the workpiece.  
        The workpiece is something inside the computer that changes only when the operator changes it.
        Some examples are a spreadsheet, UML diagram, or word processing document.

        programming is used for all kinds of <a href="ProblemFrame.html">ProblemFrame</a> s, it is most natural for this one.  -<a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>
