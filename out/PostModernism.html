        Post Modernism
      </h1>
      <p>
        A style and school of thought that rejects the dogma and practices of any form of <a href="ModernIsm.html">ModernIsm</a>. In architecture it contrasts with International Modernism, featuring elements from several periods, especially the Classical, often with ironic use of decoration.

        A couple of good books about post-modernism:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Developing Information Technology in a Post-modern Era
        </li>
        <li>
           The Postmodern Explained, by Lyotard; ISBN 0-8166-2211-6  (maybe ISBN 0816611734, by Lyotard, was intended)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        also,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Intellectual Impostures</em>, by Alan Sokal, Jean Bricmont; ISBN: 1861976313
        </li>
      </ul>

        Pretty thoroughly debunks several leading French <a href="PostModern.html">PostModern</a> gurus in as far as their use of scientific/mathematical words/concepts/notations is shown to be meaningless. For a more humorous debunking, see:

      <ul>

        Part of the <a href="PostModern.html">PostModern</a> heritage is that contradictions between various fields of study are allowed to exist, making the <a href="SearchForTruth.html">SearchForTruth</a> utterly futile, as there is not OneTruth, but many.

        Some of us are extremely skeptical of this <a href="BuzzWord.html">BuzzWord</a> known as <a href="PostModernism.html">PostModernism</a>...  Basically it's the same as saying "the future". What comes after modern day? The next day after that, which is the future.  Everything on the entire planet is preparing for the future (except conservative bible thumpers, like Larry Wall, who still hold their old <a href="PreModernism.html">PreModernism</a> beliefs).

           In the context of <a href="PostModern.html">PostModern</a> Modern doesn't mean present day, it means something like the 1950s.

        This is described in the very good (though unsympathetically titled) paper <em>On the simulation of postmodernism and mental debility using recursive transition networks</em>, <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/pub_search?104+1996+bulhak+Postmodernism">http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/pub_search?104+1996+bulhak+Postmodernism</a>

        I always thought that Perl was the first <a href="PostModernistProgrammingLanguage.html">PostModernistProgrammingLanguage</a>. <a href="LateCeePlusPlus.html">LateCeePlusPlus</a> was the second one that mattered. <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a> and <a href="MultiParadigmDesign.html">MultiParadigmDesign</a> is really <a href="PostModernProgramming.html">PostModernProgramming</a>. -- <a href="JamesNoble.html">JamesNoble</a> (opinion, not fact)

        See <a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a> for a terse pr√©cis of, and pointer to, a very interesting <a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a> talk about <a href="PostModernism.html">PostModernism</a> and how it relates to computer languages - in his opinion, of course.

        Lisp is more <em>modern</em> in that it offers all-encompassing grand solutions. Perl is postmodern in that it favors local solutions - terse solutions to common problems - over grand schemes.

        <em>It sounds like </em><a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> should be considered PostStructural more than <a href="PostModern.html">PostModern</a>. But maybe PostStructuralism is a subset of <a href="PostModernism.html">PostModernism</a>. It's all French to me (pun intended).<em></em>

        The recent 'remodernist' or 'stuckist' art movement has been attempting - in their view - to move art away from the media driven postmodernism back towards an art form.
