        Observables Need To Be Consistent
      </h1>
      <p>
        [refactored from <a href="ObserversThrowLocalExceptions.html">ObserversThrowLocalExceptions</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose I have an observer pattern in my code that deals with state. This means the following: I've got an object A, observed by objects B1, ..., BN and, depending on the state of A, B1, ..., BN do stuff. E.g. something like MVC. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What I don't want is operations on A that throw long-lived exceptions. 
        Suppose I call 
      </p>
      <code>
        A.foo()<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and it partially changes the state of A and then, before notifying the observers, wonks out with an exception that travels through 17 objects 
        (because I used <a href="ThrowDontCatch.html">ThrowDontCatch</a> in my design). 
      </p>
      <p>
        All of a sudden, my views on the model are out of date. I need to deal with
        this. In advance if possible. The tentative conclusions are: ObserveSimpleThings and ChangeComplexObservablesUsingTransactions

        Leaving an object in an inconsistent state is a problem for any object, not just observers.  Cf the <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> approach advocated by Eiffel. Meyer says that a routine either fullfills its contract, in which case it returns normally, or else it fails, in which case it cleans up and throws an exception. It doesn't half-complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cleanup is easiest if the exceptional condition can be detected before any changes are actually made, of course - this leads to exceptions being thrown only for what we might consider violations of the pre-condition. Immutable objects plus garbage collection also make cleanup easier. We can just drop the half-formed object on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, this doesn't mean Observables can't throw exceptions. It can throw them before it has made any (externally visible) state changes. Or, sometimes, a big change can be broken into atomic parts that stand or fall alone. Thus:
      </p>
      <code>
        doPart1();<br/>
        try {<br/>
        doPart2();<br/>
        doPart3();<br/>
        }<br/>
        finally {<br/>
        observers.notify(); // At least part 1 got done.<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
