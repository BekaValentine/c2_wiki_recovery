        Applied Bigotry

        I was driving home tonight, turned a corner and found myself behind a dodge pickup jacked up on huge tires, with a 10 ft cb antenna. It was covered in confederate flags/ etc. I spontaneously found myself holding a one-way discourse with the driver, which mostly went like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        I know you. (generally speaking)
        I would not hesitate to kick your ass for no reason whatsoever. I would almost bet my life that you are not the cultured, open-minded, intelligent and well spoken individual that I aspire to be. You are the antithesis of my ideals.  
      </p>
      <p>
        You represent many of the wrongs in this world. People like you have prevented this world from becoming what it could be. For this reason, I would not hesitate to use violence on you.  
      </p>
      <p>
        But I do not hate you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather, I am ashamed of you. I feel like less of a person, knowing that you lay claim to my title: that of human. I choose violence not out of hate, but out of a wish to change you.  
      </p>
      <p>
        But can you change a man? Is it even possible to introduce a major change into a person's personality, to efface some obnoxious part of their worldview? A child's values can be shaped, as this man's undoubtedly were, and some rare children are taught how to be themselves. But is it to late to change a man, even while using the most drastic of measures?  
      </p>
      <p>
        And it occurred to me, while I was writing this, that I, more than anyone else, could not hope to change this man. For I am the same as he. I aspire to be open-minded, but my evaluation of him was not. My only evidence of character was the exterior of his vehicle. I am the same as he.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I cannot be ashamed of him until I am no longer ashamed of myself. -- <a href="AndyColligan.html">AndyColligan</a>
