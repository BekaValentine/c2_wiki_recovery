        What do people think of HP's PA-RISC workstations?
      </p>

        Well, being somewhat a collector of architectures, I have two of them and like them very much (well, the hardware anyhow. HP-UX (see <a href="HpuxOs.html">HpuxOs</a>) leaves something to be desired).
      </p>
      <p>
        My machines are 50MHz, and even at that speed they seem to be quite fast for CPU oriented actions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The actual instruction set is quite interesting, it consists of many "composite" instructions such as Compare Immediate and Clear that perform two actions in (I assume) one clock cycle. A good optimizing compiler can do wonders with that instruction set. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The hardware quality depends on the model you get. While my HP 710's are almost indestructable the HP 712 workstation is filled with foam to hold all the pieces together.

        I hear they are porting <a href="MkLinux.html">MkLinux</a> to it, but I haven't seen any progress on that yet.

        At an old employer we used HP 9000 series servers and found them very reliable. Their field service is excellent too.

        HP Labs comes up with some very interesting stuff.

        <em>Or used to.  July 21, 2005: HP closes four of their research labs, laying off 15000 people, including </em><a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> and <a href="XwindowProtocol.html">XwindowProtocol</a> gurus Jim Gettys and Keith Packard.<em></em>

        <em>Moved from HewlettPackardCompaqMerger</em>

        The votes are in, the proxies are being counted, HP is claiming victory over Walter Hewlett in the bitterly fought proxy contest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching Carly and Walt tarnish the HP name was sad to watch. Lets hope the mudslinging is over, no matter which way the final vote goes. --<a href="AndrewQueisser.html">AndrewQueisser</a>
        Maybe the long proxy fight was even good for something: The planning time in the clean room was much longer than for most other mergers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The votes are now counted and the result is made public: Compaq is merged with HP. After defeating a court contest the merger became finally legal. The Compaq brand will stay only in the are PC's, everything else is rebranded to HP.
        The day one celebrations featured the slogan "We are ready."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I dunno.  The company has been in the proverbial handbasket for quite a while now --- the merger is just the latest low</em>
