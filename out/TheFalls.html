        The Falls
      </h1>
      <p>
        PeterGreenaway's first film. 4 hour ersatz documentary about 27 people affected by some worldwide unspecified catastrophe. All subjects have names beginning with the letters "F A L L" - Fallsworth and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some subjects merely develop a compulsion to drive around roundabouts for hours. Others speak in tongues. Two little girls develop a language that no one but themselves understand. Still others develop avian characteristics. Several of the short descriptions given fit subsequent Greenaway films, especially DrowningByNumbers.

        <a href="TheFalls.html">TheFalls</a> is difficult for many people to watch, but wonderful for folk who enjoy <a href="PhilipGlass.html">PhilipGlass</a> music and <a href="JorgeLuisBorges.html">JorgeLuisBorges</a> books.
