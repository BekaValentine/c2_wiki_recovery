        Unified Front
      </h1>
      <p>
        Children are smart.  They see differences in parenting style.  They seek to use those differences to their advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Present a <a href="UnifiedFront.html">UnifiedFront</a>.  Agree with each other in front of the children.  Discuss differences, and how to handle them, when the children are not present.  Allow your children to help bring you closer together.
