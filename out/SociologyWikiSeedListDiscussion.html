        Sociology Wiki Seed List Discussion

      <p>
        <em>This page is a discussion of the contents of the </em><a href="SociologyWikiSeedList.html">SociologyWikiSeedList</a>, a list of pages that some think should be moved to a new wiki.<em></em>

        These don't deal with <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> politics. I can't think of any good reasons to include them, though several bad ones come up. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Um, then you have to ditch the libertarian stuff, and </em>FightClub, Rawls, <a href="StarshipTroopers.html">StarshipTroopers</a>, and a whole bunch of similar. Why exclude the u/dis topians?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The utopians/distopians listed above all deal with politics in its generality, as it applies (or should apply) to the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>, even if they use the format of fiction. If you look at <a href="StarshipTroopers.html">StarshipTroopers</a>, you'll see how much that page talks about the book's relation to the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>, even if the book doesn't. That's why I included <a href="StarshipTroopers.html">StarshipTroopers</a> and not <a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a>. OTOH, to get <a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a> included, all someone has to do is accuse him of being a Fascist on that page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> seems to deal with the internet, or draws itself most heavily on it, <a href="WikiStoneSociety.html">WikiStoneSociety</a> even more so. The particular application of politics and economics to the software industry is much more relevant to a forum that concerns itself with the software industry than to one that discusses politics in its generality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I see nothing in the </em><a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> that confines its application to the internet. Indeed, it appears as abstract a system as the ones described by Marx and Rawls, both of whom should go too. <a href="WikiStoneSociety.html">WikiStoneSociety</a> is medium-specific, so ought to stay here. As to Heinlein, it seems sensible to include him both on the Sociology wiki and here, by means of the <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a> links.<em> --</em>KingOfTheRoad

        Wonderful list!  Thanks to the uncookied user who came up with this.

        Some of the pages which I authored already exist on <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> like ClassStriation. I would be comfortable with them being deleted from here instead of moved elsewhere. The <a href="VotingPatterns.html">VotingPatterns</a> I'm ambivalent on. While I wrote most of them, I didn't have a very good reason to do so. I'd rather see them deleted. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I also thought them more appropriate to <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> than to a <a href="SociologyWiki.html">SociologyWiki</a>. Do you have other concerns?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not really. I'd be tempted to let some things I wrote move over--like the </em><a href="VotingPatterns.html">VotingPatterns</a> which are more or less anonymous--provided I wasn't attributed to them, as I'm always very hesitant to let something I've signed be moved to a site I don't know about. Actually, the <a href="VotingPatterns.html">VotingPatterns</a> are kind of funny, because I wrote them while I was quietly deleting almost everything I had written previously. Now I'm willing to let them go too.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Good luck. -- </em><a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a><em></em>

      <p>
        That is funny.

        Doubly Thanks.
