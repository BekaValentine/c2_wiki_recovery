        <a href="CommunityExpectations.html">CommunityExpectations</a> change over time. I have read in a separate page on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, that made an excellent analogy of this place to a coffee shop. So if your contributions, or mine in this post, got deleted in part/whole by other parties, then it is <strong>'just karma</strong>.

           but if you back up your own edits on a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>, you are helping yourself when fate does extend you a welcoming smile.

        There are things you can do to increase the chances of <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>s taking a <a href="TolerateOffTopic.html">TolerateOffTopic</a> view:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           make sure you are a known personality here, as there are lots of one-off/short-term visitors who left material that nobody else care about.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Set up a proper <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> and use a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> in your posts would help.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Hopefully you are known for some collaboration in <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages.
        </li>
        <li>
           Very helpful if you are known for helping out other new comers who share similar general principles, it would be good.
        </li>

           If you model your behavior after a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>, your <a href="GnomeFee.html">GnomeFee</a> may come in the form of extra tolerance for your own interests.
        </li>
        <li>
           If your <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> interests are not controversial (generate more heat than light), that would stand a better chance to being left alone.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you do post <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> material, please do a small test page first. Survival rate is much better if there are other people here with similar interests.
