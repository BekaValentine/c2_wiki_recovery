        Accidental Complexity
      </h1>
      <p>
        The term <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a> was introduced to me by <a href="DougSchmidt.html">DougSchmidt</a>. It stems from the complex code resulting from ugly designed interfaces of system routines. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Ugly interface design is a trend that I observe with the current Java platform processes. Many people contribute new ideas and functionality in the form of specifications and packages without being the victims of their own work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that <a href="GreatAbstraction.html">GreatAbstraction</a> and <a href="StableInterface.html">StableInterface</a> stem from the fact, that their creators are also the most important users of these abstractions. 
        (<a href="GreatAbstraction.html">GreatAbstraction</a>s come from creators who "eat their own <a href="DogFood.html">DogFood</a>".)
      </p>
      <p>
        One example of <a href="GreatAbstraction.html">GreatAbstraction</a> and <a href="StableInterface.html">StableInterface</a> for me are the UNIX file system calls. <a href="EverythingIsaFile.html">EverythingIsaFile</a> is the <a href="GreatAbstraction.html">GreatAbstraction</a> invented by our Unix super heroes. open(), read(), write(), close() in its today POSIX incarnation is  ubiquitous and still viable (though some people would mumble about ioctl()). 
        As a <a href="StableInterface.html">StableInterface</a> they allow for polymorphism behind the scenes without the client code using the interface recognizing. A simple program like cat using this interface is now capable of playing music on a Linux PC which is a thing I believe the original inventors couldn't dream of at the time of the invention about 30 years ago. That is ReUseInAction that really pays off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thompson, Kernighan, Ritchie and the others created a system for their own use. They were not only inventing but also suffering from their invention. This is how <a href="GreatAbstraction.html">GreatAbstraction</a> is created by bright people and also how we can learn how to become better framework developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, they invented it for their typesetters, and they got most of their ideas from Multics -- their suffering came mostly from losing access and having to make do with an abandoned PDP-7 in the basement.  And </em><a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a> is the most important user of Perl, which is a rather UnGreatUnAbstraction.  So basically what we have here is a drooling hero-worship just-so story that has very little connection with reality.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They omitted some type safety (TypeSafeInterfacesConsideredHarmful) allowing for a great flexibiltiy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They omitted things because they couldn't fit them into a 28,000 byte address space, not for any of your silly post-facto just-so reasons.</em>

        Might Fred Brooks have been inspired by <a href="MrAristotle.html">MrAristotle</a>'s idea of "accidental properties"? See Wikipedia entry: <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_properties">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_properties</a>

        <em>Yes, that's what he was referring to.  He said later that the term "</em><a href="IncidentalDifficulty.html">IncidentalDifficulty</a>" might have resulted in fewer misunderstandings.<em></em>

        "Pretentious complexity" would be an appropriate term in a lot of cases. You could think of that anthropomorphically: the complexity seems ("pretends to be")
        necessary, but isn't. -- <a href="DagfinnReiersol.html">DagfinnReiersol</a>
