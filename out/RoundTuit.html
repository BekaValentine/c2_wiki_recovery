        Round Tuit
      </h1>
      <p>
        An incredibly useful item.  The round ones are particularly rare.

        Now that they are available everyone who was unable to start some task without one need wait no more. --<a href="AlanFrancis.html">AlanFrancis</a>

        <em>My wife keeps a supply handy at all times, to make sure things on the 'honey-do' list get done.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Can somebody please explain the background of this extraordinary item.
      </p>

        <em>Phonetically, the following are very close:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>When I get around to it.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>When I get a round tuit.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Thus it's a pun referencing the list of tasks that most people know they'll have to do sometime but keep putting off. The idea is that a supply of tuits (round ones) will be required before the task can be done. Since tuits don't exist, this may take some time.</em>
