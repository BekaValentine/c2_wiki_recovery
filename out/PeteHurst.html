        It's been a while since I've been around <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, and to be honest I wasn't here long in 
        the first place. I do, however, consider it one of the more interesting corners of the web
        I've found so far.

        Lately I've been teaching myself <a href="AspDotNet.html">AspDotNet</a>.  I've developed an interesting little 
        WikiIsh project but I don't generally want to show it to anyone until I've worked on 
        it a bit more.

        Forgive me if this introduction is a little short; perhaps I'll add more detail in the course
        of things.
