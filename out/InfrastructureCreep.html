        Infrastructure Creep
      </h1>
      <p>
        The process by which sensible thinking ahead turns into techie playtime as the designers/builders add yet another feature to the infrastructure/framework because it's "sure to save time later," rather than get down and build the application.  -- <a href="TomAyerst.html">TomAyerst</a>

        A variant of <a href="FeatureCreep.html">FeatureCreep</a>, where the features are all internal?

        Any extreme is bad. More of what I see is no infrastructure and every
        subsystem doing things their own ways. This leads to a system with
        no LeveragePoints and makes the system very hard to evolve. It's not often that programmers will brave the social risk of creating and
        advertising something that can be reused.

        I guess in 18 years I just haven't seen this very often. I usually see
        the reverse. The drive to make schedules causes all thinking to be
        truncated in favor of "many little rivers flowing to the sea." Maybe
        in larger companies this is more common. But in Silicon Valley I have
        to say it is far less common because the time pressures have been so
        great. Where architecture has been emphasised it has worked very well.
        I don't really see something like "to make this string class we'll have
        write our own OS." And some of the XP discussions of infrastructure 
        strike me as very naive. One XP guru's idea of a database infrastructure was to use the native API from a database vendor. When the inevitable happened and the API failed them, the fault was infrastructure. The fault was really theirs for horrible system design. -- Anonymous
