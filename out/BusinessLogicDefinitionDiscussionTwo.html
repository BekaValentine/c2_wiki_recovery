        This is a description of a sample sales lead tracking system for a hypothetical civil engineering firm. It's a "composite character" of some apps I've worked on. The organization hears about potential projects (customers with needs) and the marketing team contacts them to ask questions and butter them up.

        Yes, most of such would be run-of-the-mill CRUD and reporting, but usually various "business rules" creep in over time, such as: send email notices for open projects that have had no contact for more than 4 months.

        --Mr. Top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is classic data entry and reporting.  There's good coin to be made churning these out, and building them successfully requires extensive general business and domain knowledge and analysis skills, but they're almost entirely presentation logic:  The essence is that data goes in at one end and is reported at the other.  Business logic -- which computes and records costs, taxes, schedules, timetables, bills, routes, plans, payrolls, etc. -- is generally absent.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But "computing taxes" affects output also. If nobody sees the computation results then it doesn't need to be done. Just about any app is like that: the user only ultimately cares about the output because they don't "consume" the internal workings. I see no useful reason to make a distinction between logic that adds two numbers together versus logic that uses the value of one number to determine if the second one is displayed under a given circumstance, for example. Again, you are giving Boolean computations a lower-class (or different class?) status than numeric computations. Partitioning by calculation result value type on a large scale is utterly silly and arbitrary; of no discernible economic value. Would you partition the app in two parts, one by integer calculations and one by real/double computations??? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, reports often do sum and average information. True, it usually doesn't "save" such, but you guys have previously said that "persistence" is not the difference maker (plus, it's continuous also). You need to formulate more concise rules beyond "I know it when I see it because I'm [allegedly] smart and experienced". -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps I can illustrate (or not -- it depends on your answer) via the simplest possible example.  Which is the better code?  This...</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        writeln(a + b)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>...or this?</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        r = a + b<br/>
        writeln(r)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Be sure to explain why you answer the way you do.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>. Remember, I use estimated maintenance patterns along with frequency times costs to make most of such decisions. I would need to know more about the context to make such estimates. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And, let's try to separate definition issues from "good design" issues, if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I have no further explanations that can help.  Those who argue that the latter example is better code will appreciate the distinction between business logic and presentation logic, and why it exists.  Those who argue that </em><a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>, will not.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's not very helpful text for those of us who allegedly "don't get it". Is <a href="WesternReductionism.html">WesternReductionism</a> dead?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, but I've got better things to do than debate this.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        All else being equal, less code is better than more code, and the second one is more code. However, the <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> of most humans works better when big processes are sub-divided into smaller sub-processes to <em>some extent</em>: too fine a ratio can be just as bad as no division. (See <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a>) Finding the right balance (division ratio) comes from experience and from estimating how maintainer <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> will likely work, and likely future <a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a>s of the domain requests. (In other words, how likely is a domain need going to come along to make use of a smaller sub-division.) In summary, we have two concerns: "Readability" of the code as-is, and second, will division make future changes easier to make. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A third concern is that the second is probably easier to debug using most existing debuggers. But it may not be practical to write every block/section under the assumption that every one will need to be debugged in the debugger; only a small fraction will. If the chance is large, then it's crappy code and should be inspected more closely before testing via a run.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In short, the second example is better code, unconditionally.  It's better code because the first line -- which exemplifies the essence of business logic -- is separate from the second line, which exemplifies presentation logic.  We can thus change business logic independently of presentation logic, and change presentation logic independently of business logic.  Being able to change components independently is </em>'always<em>' good.</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Obviously, this is a trivial example, but the underlying concept applies to arbitrarily-complex systems.  Conflating business logic with presentation logic -- exemplified by the first example -- complicates maintenance, development, testing and debugging regardless of </em><a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a>s often don't fit our ideal pre-conceived notions or classifications. Over time one gets a "feel" for what kind of changes are likely, but often they vary on a <strong>wide variety</strong> of aspects/dimensions. Thus, "change independently" is a somewhat elusive target. <em>In general</em> I agree with designing/partitioning around <a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a><em></em>'s. I just disagree that "presentation" versus "business logic" is sufficiently clear and a good (change-fitting) separation criteria. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a given "aspect" of business may have a presentation and non-presentation aspect to it (assuming there is such a thing for the sake of argument). The change is on the aspect itself, not the presentation side or the non-presentation side. Let's say it's an activation of a feature. If the feature is activated, then it affects both the presentation side and the non-presentation-side. To make it make it easier to switch on and off, we partition by the feature, NOT it's presentation-ness:
      </p>
      <code>
        // feature X<br/>
        if (feature_X_IsOn) then<br/>
        event foo(...)  // register an event handler<br/>
        presentationStuff(...)<br/>
        end event<br/>
        event bar(...)<br/>
        nonPresentationStuff(...)<br/>
        end event<br/>
        end if<br/>
      </code>

           [Why did you split this example into presentationStuff() and nonPresentationStuff() if you're trying to demonstrate a case under which one wouldn't split presentational logic from business logic? -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Perhaps we need to clarify "split". "Separation" is continuous. I generally assumed each event/function/object would be used at different times, but this was not the main point of the example otherwise. The devil's in the details.

      <ul>
        <li>
           [You have two functions in your example, presentationStuff() and nonPresentationStuff(). They're quite clearly separate functions. One presumes that presentationStuff() contains presentational logic and that nonPresentationStuff() contains business logic, therefore your above snippet is in fact an example of separating business logic from presentation logic. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Like I've said before, sometimes I separate and sometimes I don't. <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>. I didn't say "never separate". And, is a function sufficient "separation"? Neither "business logic" nor "separation" is sufficiently defined (for the context) after 3 topics on this. I'm growing impatient and frustrated with this discussion. "I know biz logic & sep when I see it because I'm smart and experienced" is nearly useless to readers, even if it was true.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Bereft of context, it's unclear whether defining presentationStuff() and nonPresentationStuff() as separate functions is in fact <em>sufficient</em> separation. However, it absolutely satisfies the fundamental requirement that business and presentational logic are delimited from one another and kept separate in some fashion. For example, the nonPresentationStuff() will be accessible to other calculations without dragging in the presentationStuff() since the two may be called independently of each other (as they are in your example, in fact). It's unclear where those two functions have been <em>defined</em>, though: If the project's big enough for multiple modules, then presentationStuff() and nonPresentationStuff() might best also be defined in separate modules. From a <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> perspective, the presentationStuff() belongs in some view or another, while nonPresentationStuff() is probably part of a model (models and views generally live in separate modules). -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Sometimes forcing things to be separate requires reinventing a lot of necessarily contextual information, leading to a <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> violation and/or bloated interface coding. The devil's in the details and the separation question is situational. I'm not going to add bloat JUST to fit some unscientific faddish idealism. I'll go with the simpler design unless there is likely to be a future <a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a> that would benefit from separating something.

        </li>
      </ul>

And you have not provided a clear definition of biz versus presentation anyhow such that "lessening the cognitive load" is not likely to take place. Vagueness increases cognitive load.

           <em>How would your solution -- which appears to consist of overloading a function -- apply to a larger, modular system?  If writeln(x) is representative of a presentation layer consisting of 25 classes and 250 methods, how does your approach work?</em>

           If your design relies on a function or clause or statement style that cannot be re-worked or overridden, it's probably a bad design. Generally if there is a frequent "pathy" module reference, it's good practice to make a local short-cut in case the path changes in the future because long paths are fairly likely to change, and take up a lot of screen real-estate:

           <em>That's not what I meant.  The module path is irrelevant.  You suggested that you can effectively deal with change presentation logic inside business logic, without changing the business logic, via function overriding.  How does that work with modules and classes?  Are you suggesting polymorphism?  You're then coding to an abstract interface, and providing multiple concrete implementations somewhere else.  If so, that's reasonable, but it implies that you've separated business logic from presentation logic.</em>

        There is rarely any ideal partitioning factor/dimension/aspect. Most apps involve a good many cross-cutting aspects and grouping on Factor A de-groups on Factor B, hurting Aspect B change costs. And it also may <strong>vary per app or per domain</strong> such that there is no universal "best" partitioning, only least-evil compromises. Any general or "always partition by X" rule is highly suspect. <a href="SimulationOfTheFuture.html">SimulationOfTheFuture</a> by comparing each candidate grouping is my favorite technique for choosing division aspects for reasons given in the topic.
