        Cooperative Charity
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Cooperative Charity is a useful structure for a user group, aggregating funds and allowing the users to deliberate before releasing them to fund specific <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is, how do you create one? They're very different from corporate charities. You can understand them either as,
      </p>
      <p>
        a cooperative which pays nothing in business taxes, and where membership expires after a preset length of time with no refund of the membership fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or,
      </p>
      <p>
        a non-profit where the board of governors is the entirety of donors, and donations have a floor of X dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have the sinking feeling that cooperative charities aren't recognized in commercial law. So how would one go about emulating it?
      </p>
      <p>
        And how do you solve the problem of having to pay taxes on any leftover funds the charity hasn't released yet?
