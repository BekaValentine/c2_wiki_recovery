        Parallel Class Hierarchies
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you have two set of classes that mirror each others structures. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples occur all over the place in code, typically when you have a catalog of items, and you then have instances of those items used in specific situations. The two class hierarchies are typically Homomorphic, that is they share the same structure. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I have a blueprint for a widget that is made up of a gadget connected to a sprocket. I then make one. I now have a real widget, and in that widget my actual gadget is connected to a real sprocket. Not only are the parts mirrored, but the relationships are as well. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I could say this a bit more formally: Suppose I have a hierarchy, C, of two classes x and y that have a function, f, such that f(x)=y. Now another parallel hierarchy, C', with two classes x' and y' is Homomorphic if it has a function, f', such that f'(x')=y'. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a sneaking suspicion that this could all be said very elegantly in <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>, but I'm not sure how to formulate it.
