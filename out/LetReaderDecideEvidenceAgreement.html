        Let Reader Decide Evidence Agreement
      </h1>
      <p>
        I propose an agreement be made in the "<a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> vs. staff confusion" debates that both sides stop complaining about or demanding evidence about what typical programming staff is comfortable grokking/learning or not comfortable grokking/learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither side has solid research on staff absorbance such that continuing to debate on this staff-related evidence issue or complain about lack of formal studies on it has NOT been productive, leading to <a href="AnecdoteImpasse.html">AnecdoteImpasse</a>s, and is unlikely to be productive without the presentation of formal research.
      </p>
      <p>
        I propose we mutually agree to <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> if a description of staff behavior matches a given reader's shop or not and leave it at that.
      </p>
      <code>
        if reader-agrees-staff-profile-X-fits-their shop then<br/>
        use advice related to profile X<br/>
        else <br/>
        use advice related to profile Y  (or whatever profile fits best)<br/>
        end if<br/>
