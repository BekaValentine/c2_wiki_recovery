        Agglutinative Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        In which several morphemes (some times also called monemes) are added to a noun or verb to denote case, number, gender, person, tense, etc. Words are a combination of roots and stems, to a degree which can be surprising to English speakers. In Turkish you can say "Cekoslavakyalilastiramadiklarimizdan misiniz" which means: <em>Are you one of those that we could not have possibly turned into a Czechoslovakian?</em> (Eek!)
      </p>
      <code>
        Cekoslovak: Czechoslovak<br/>
        yali: -ian<br/>
        lastir: to turn into <br/>
        ma: not (a is just a connection letter here)<br/>
        di: past tense specifier in turned<br/>
        k: "we" specifier for the verb turn<br/>
        lar: plural specifier for those<br/>
        mi: not (i is just a connection letter here)<br/>
        z: "plural you" specifier for could<br/>
        dan: one of (or from, like I'm from Turkey)<br/>
        misiniz: are you? (formally, it's written separately as cek..... misiniz?)<br/>
      </code>

        Ok, I'm exhausted even if I'm a Turk. This is just a possible combination, but we don't daily use that kind of thing. -- <a href="SavasAlparslan.html">SavasAlparslan</a>

        The opposite would be an AnalyticLanguage. No language is totally analytical or totally agglutinative, it is a question of degree. English for example is a fairly AnalyticLanguage but still has agglutinative elements.

           No, actually "opposite" is merely ill-defined here.

        Is <a href="WelshLanguage.html">WelshLanguage</a> considered an <a href="AgglutinativeLanguage.html">AgglutinativeLanguage</a>? Witness <a href="LlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyllLlantysiliogogogoch.html">LlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyllLlantysiliogogogoch</a>.

           No, I believe Welsh is a FusionalLanguage. The fact that a language has very long compound words  does not by itself allow determination of its category; consider the infamously-long compound words in <a href="GermanLanguage.html">GermanLanguage</a> compared with <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a>.

        To me, that seems to be stretching the definition of <em>word</em>. Although there are no spaces, that hardly constitutes a <em>single unit</em> of language - at least to my simple mind. <em>(See </em><a href="CulturalRelativist.html">CulturalRelativist</a>)<em> (But I'm glad you pointed it out. I had no idea how wonderfully colorful the Turkish language is.)</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Oh, has a widely agreed upon definition of "word" finally been achieved in theoretical linguistics? Kindly enlighten us. Or, if you are operating simply on the basis of your intuitions from being a speaker of English, yes, that is simple-minded...or more accurately, very parochial. This kind of complex compound word building is very common in languages world-wide.

           See e.g. ISBN 0521818990 for recent research on what is a "word"; it's a difficult issue.

        Question moved from <a href="WikiNameInRealLifeSyndrome.html">WikiNameInRealLifeSyndrome</a>:
        <em>What is an </em><a href="AgglutinativeLanguage.html">AgglutinativeLanguage</a>? [answered] I take it that it involves the use of compound words, but to what extent do they have to be part of the language before it is considered agglutinative? [not explicitly answered but looks like 'yes']<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This question is too incoherent to answer; please rephrase. However, "agglutinative" and "uses compound words" are not even close to being synonyms, so I think that incorrect things are being assumed even before the question is phrased.

      </ul>

        See also <a href="ConcatenativeLanguage.html">ConcatenativeLanguage</a> (I assume if we translate that concept to natural languages we get things like composita in German: take two any words and join them together to form a new word with a meaning derived from its parts)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's a creative thought. But I don't think any </em><a href="ConcatenativeLanguage.html">ConcatenativeLanguage</a>s do that. Forth, for instance, has been claimed to build <strong>sentences</strong>. Not compound words.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Natural languages are very strange and complex creatures, every single one of them (notwithstanding objections from native speakers regarding them intuitively rather than from the vantage of linguistics). Any and all parallels with computer languages are doomed to be sharply flawed.</em>

        I agree. Analogies are just that: Analogies. You cannot use them to prove anything, but only use them for inspiration.

        The only programming language I can think of that really is agglutinative is <a href="JayLanguage.html">JayLanguage</a>. There are standard symbols you can add to any function to transform it, such as "inverse".  Also the notion of adding '.' or ':' to standard operators to obtain related operators seems agglutinative.  Although perhaps the idea of syntactic <em>sigils</em>, such as '$' and '@' in <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> and <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> are also agglutinative (see <a href="TheProblemWithSigils.html">TheProblemWithSigils</a>).
