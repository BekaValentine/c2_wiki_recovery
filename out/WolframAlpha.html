        It has just (2009-05-17) opened to the public but is still a bit beta. 
        It already provides a lot of 'kurated' information. 
        But contrary to what I hoped it <em>does not</em> allow to interrelate the information. 
        Or I'm too stupid to figure it out. Or that's one of the pay-for ueber features. 
        The Mathematica core should well be able to do it. 
        And very nice interrelations and graphs <em>are</em> produced for some special cases. 
        This is also one of the often repeated wishes in the W|A community boards.
