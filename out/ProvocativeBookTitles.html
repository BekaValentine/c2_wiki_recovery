        Provocative Book Titles

      <p>
        A while back a coworker told me that the online bookstore <a href="FatBrain.html">FatBrain</a> was starting an electronic publishing service called eMatters.  People can write technical papers, poetry, short stories, books or novels, and publish them electronically.  People download them for a fee and the author gets a cut.  
      </p>
      <p>
        We ended up having a rollicking discussion about eMatter titles that would get
        maximum hits.  Then we just started getting silly.
