        <em>Looks cool, so I checked it. I don't know about </em><a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> and other platforms, but a <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> <strong>user</strong> can't use the NConvert tool. Though the site doesn't specify system requirements, NConvert requires a <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> library:<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        [Pongal:~/Desktop/Downloads] elizabeth% nconvert -help<br/>
        dyld: nconvert can't open library: /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib  (No such file or <br/>
        directory, errno = 2)<br/>

      <p>
        <em>It appears that only C++ weenies can use the tool.</em>

        <a href="ItWorks.html">ItWorks</a>, right out of the box, it's fast and supplies a way to navigate your files system, complete with double click execution of non-graphic executable files, and other file types, using the file association mechanism available in <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a>. It is a <a href="PointAndClickDragAndDrop.html">PointAndClickDragAndDrop</a> Application. The browser also provides additional information about the graphics file, including if it is a photo taken by a digital camera, information on size, f-stop, exposure time, ISO film speed setting and many other helpful bits of information.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it with my <a href="PaperPort.html">PaperPort</a> program and my Microsoft <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a>, and other programs in my "essential programs" to manage, transfer, create, insert into pdfs, ppts, Word document, Web Site Pages, and a myriad of other applications.
      </p>

        If you desire, a Development Toolkit is also available, including arrangements which can be made to include in applications developed for commercial use. Private use of the toolkit for personal applications are free.

        Having just taken over 5000 pictures using a Nikon D80 camera in raw and several other formats, I have found it invaluable in easily viewing, sorting and storing the pictures.

        <em>Only the NConvert tool is available for </em><a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> users, and it requires a library which I don't have, presumably because I've never been inclined to clog up my tiny hard drive with the pile of stuff that the OS X "developer" CD installs.<em></em>

        But many users do have Computers with inexpensive large capacity drives and Operating Systems this program works with. My computer is approaching 1Tb of in-machine drive capacity and the potential through the USB of Multiple Terabytes of capacity. I spent less than 600 dollars so far upgrading a used 1 Ghz Dell Optiplex for drives, memory, DvdReadWrite, etc. The next add-on will be a 70 dollar video card with Dual Monitor capacity and S-Video. My Internet connection costs me a paltry 14.95 a month for unlimited use at reasonable up and download bitrates. It is no longer expensive to have computing capabilities, if one does not insist on having the latest and greatest. I do not have any experience with <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>, but I cannot but believe that inexpensive upgrades for hardware and drives exist so that systems need not be "clogged up" with the stuff needed to do what the user wants to do. I downloaded the remainder of stuff from the <a href="XnView.html">XnView</a> site this evening for install in the next week or two. When I do, I will have more to say on this program.

As for "It is no longer expensive to have computing capabilities," I wish my life were that straightforward. I've been physically and neurologically damaged by hardware and software since 1999, so I really can't "afford" to try so-called upgrades to suit my fancy. In fact, I anticipate a life without computers in perhaps five years :-(<em></em>

        Sorry about that.
