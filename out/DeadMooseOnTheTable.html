        Dead Moose On The Table
      </h1>
      <p>
        A consultant is invited to a board meeting at a large company. The consultant walks in and is introduced to the board of directors. He finds it hard to ignore a large, dead moose in the middle of the meeting table. As the introductions continue, the consultant can no longer ignore the sight and the smell of the dead moose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, he says, "Why is there a dead moose on the table?"
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the board members leans over and whispers, "You see it too?"
      </p>

        Another wonders why he doesn't mention the <a href="ElephantOnTheCoffeeTable.html">ElephantOnTheCoffeeTable</a>.

        Another form of <em>The Emperor Has No Clothes</em>.

      <p>
        One of the good reasons for which a company will hire consultants.

        <em>You have a typo in that line. Replace one 'h' with 'f'.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Spoken like a true Luddite. Or do you have the same 35 years of experience that I and my fellow consultants bring to the party?

        Another version...
      </p>
      <p>
        A developer is called into his boss's office to talk about some incorrect code. When he enters he notices a dead chicken on the desk. The developer asks his boss "how did that get there?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The boss says "well we both modified some code, then you remodified it and I remodified it - and now it doesn't work. So I'm not sure if the ChickenOrTheEgg came first - but now there is a dead chicken"
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I liked my version better, where as soon as the consultant sits down he says, "What's with the dead moose?" Not a long time later. --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        Totally, completely <strong>concur</strong>. This is why I am brought in on this stuff in the first place.

        Makes me think of the Ross Perot EDS/GM story on snakes: "<a href="WhenYouSeeaSnakeYouKillIt.html">WhenYouSeeaSnakeYouKillIt</a>."
