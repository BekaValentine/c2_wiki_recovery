        Do programming for a living. Coined the term "<a href="NonIntrusiveMethods.html">NonIntrusiveMethods</a>" some time before the term <a href="AgileMethods.html">AgileMethods</a> became the vogue. Do like Eiffel and the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, none of which I currently use to earn a living. C# takes care of that for the time being.

        At WOOD'97 in Oslo I had the pleasure of sitting at the same table as <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> during lunch. Wow! Autographs to be handed out on request :-)
