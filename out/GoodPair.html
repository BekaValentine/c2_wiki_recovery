        Good Pair
      </h1>
      <p>
        Describe <a href="GoodPair.html">GoodPair</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="GoodPair.html">GoodPair</a> is a pair that works well together for whatever reason.  The causes of forming and maintaining a <a href="GoodPair.html">GoodPair</a> is of interest to anyone interested in adopting <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>.  It can be argued that some necessary conditions include good communication, mutual respect for each others opinions, and not holding onto grudges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some believe that it is mandatory to <a href="PairPromiscuously.html">PairPromiscuously</a>, but <a href="CornFieldEffect.html">CornFieldEffect</a> suggests that <a href="WardAndKent.html">WardAndKent</a> work better together than separately. This provides at least one counter-argument to saying that you must <a href="PairPromiscuously.html">PairPromiscuously</a>, and points out the benefits of leaving good pairs alone for extended times.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best pair is 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A> introvert vs introvert, 
        </li>
        <li>
           B> people free to, uh, express differences of opinion, 
        </li>
        <li>
           C> physically enabled to code without ridiculous hardware impediments, and 
        </li>
        <li>
           D> <a href="PairPromiscuously.html">PairPromiscuously</a>, so nobody gets married.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That just leads to two people who either kill each other, or simply write the same code as a Solo coder would.
      </p>
      <p>
        While a <a href="GoodPair.html">GoodPair</a> that remains together for extended periods of time may become like a married couple do married couples think the same?  So it is highly unlikely that the <a href="GoodPair.html">GoodPair</a> will lead to two programmers writing code the same way a single programmer would.
      </p>

        But see <a href="HowToPissOffYourPair.html">HowToPissOffYourPair</a>, for other strategies to encourage less pairing at your workplace.

        That's why you gotta read the rest of the plot - it's a SMASH CUT. The link is right there.
