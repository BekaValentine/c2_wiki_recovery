        <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> made me think about this (as strange at it would seem)...
      </p>
      <p>
        John Henry was a <a href="SteelDrivingMan.html">SteelDrivingMan</a>. Sure, as the legend goes, he dies after beating the steam drill (new-fangled code-generating case tool), but that's not the point. Sure, he worked in awful conditions (modern day programmer working against unrealistic deadlines), and sure he toiled as a laborer for the railroads (modern day programmer working for large uncaring corporation).
      </p>
      <p>
        But, he practiced <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> (see <a href="SteelDrivingMan.html">SteelDrivingMan</a>) and was an advocate of <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>. He used simple tools with sweat, grit, skill and determination. He became the stuff of legend (see <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/john_henry/story1.html).">http://metalab.unc.edu/john_henry/story1.html).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or did he fall into the trap of <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sure, it's all quite a stretch...</em>
