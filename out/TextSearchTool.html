        Text Search Tool
      </h1>
      <p>
        It occurs to me that all text search functions I've ever dealt with are extremely crapulent ... except for Google. It's such a simple function but it's fairly crucial and routinely screwed up.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want a search function that is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           whitespace insensitive
        </li>
        <li>
           punctuation insensitive
        </li>
        <li>
           case insensensitive always, unless I ask to search for something mixed-case
        </li>
        <li>
           searches through object titles firs, automatically
        </li>
        <li>
           has no backwards option
        </li>
        <li>
           has no useless options or modes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           supports complex logical operations
        </li>
        <li>
           supports the "nearby" predicate
        </li>
        <li>
           supports the "misspelling" predicate
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           can search through a subset of objects
        </li>
        <li>
           can save searches and their results
        </li>
        <li>
           outputs results in the same format as what it operates on
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        by these I mean that if the tool operates on a directory of files then it will produce a directory of files as its results so that the results can be fed back into another search.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also want a system where .song objects come with their lyrics, or can have their lyrics appended, and the search tool knows to search through the lyrics for song objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I REALLY REALLY want is an AI, but I'll settle for the above.
