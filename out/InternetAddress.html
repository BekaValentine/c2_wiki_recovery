        Internet Address is a number assigned to a NetworkInterfaceCard. The form either in the InternetProtocolVersionFour dotted octet quartet format: 127.0.0.1, or in the InternetProtocolVersionSix format: ::1. Any octet cannot be greater than 255 because these numbers represent a 32 bit binary number which is actually the version 4 <a href="InternetAddress.html">InternetAddress</a>.
