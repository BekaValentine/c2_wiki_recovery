        Cpp Heresy
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've been thinking about <a href="ExtremeFormsForCppCode.html">ExtremeFormsForCppCode</a> and am presently trying a little experiment. The details of the experiment are as follows, critical comment invited:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>. Okay, that's not heresy, but it enables the heresy to come. Presently using <a href="PythonCxxModule.html">PythonCxxModule</a> to achieve this while still keeping good <a href="StlStyle.html">StlStyle</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use automated <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing by bolting the <a href="PythonCxxModule.html">PythonCxxModule</a> stuff to <a href="PythonUnit.html">PythonUnit</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use Python to break dependencies between Cpp classes. In fact, begin with python and only refactor to C++ when performance critical profiling or an API <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> results in a real need. In other words, DoAllYourEncapsulationInTheSoftLanguage.
        </li>
        <li>
           Now, since we're breaking header dependencies and separating our encapsulation, we don't need to worry about pushing C++ dependencies into implementation files. Ergo we can <a href="ForgetAboutWritingAccessors.html">ForgetAboutWritingAccessors</a>. Yes, that's right, leave your data members public. If you're XP then your <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s will allow you to <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> just fine without worrying too much about forgetting type dependencies. The compiler will only help you get this right.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you're going to go that far, heck, leave everything public and <a href="UseStructsNotClasses.html">UseStructsNotClasses</a>. No, not C-style structs, these are structs with methods - they're just classes with everything public by default.
        </li>
        <li>
           Let's see, what else is a mess. Oh yes, there's all that drivel where we compose a container and have a method that just calls its methods. Screw that - <a href="InheritStlContainersPublicly.html">InheritStlContainersPublicly</a>. Oh, you think that will break encapsulation? <a href="BloodyOath.html">BloodyOath</a> it would, except that python is doing your encapsulation for you. Well then, what about when you have a class with two containers? <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> it. But wouldn't that result in MI? Maybe not with <a href="StlStyle.html">StlStyle</a>, but even if it does, <a href="MultipleInheritanceIsNotEvil.html">MultipleInheritanceIsNotEvil</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Okay, what's left that's disgusting in cpp? Oh yes, having to write bloody implementation files. Okay then <a href="InlineAllMethodsWhereverPossible.html">InlineAllMethodsWhereverPossible</a>. What, your method is too long or complex to do that? Then go <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> the sucker - <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> any method that's longer than 20 lines, and most that are longer than 10. Oh, and you're worried about compile dependencies getting too big? Don't you remember how <a href="PythonCxxModule.html">PythonCxxModule</a> broke them for you?
        </li>
        <li>
           Be sure to <a href="AvoidConstCompletely.html">AvoidConstCompletely</a>.  Use it when you have to--to interface with libraries that insist on returning a const Foo* or const Bar&.  <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, and numerous other OO languages don't have "const" (final is a different beast) and get by fine--besides, <a href="ConstIsaVirus.html">ConstIsaVirus</a>.

        The result is C++ code that looks strangely like python code. It's all <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. Seems to run just dandy and so far works as advertised. No, I haven't tried this on a large scale yet - just with a couple dozen classes - but I don't see any harm in it, and obviously there's a lot of benefit in <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.

        Dainty? Be a "real programmer" and program your own Python object model in C++. I did it. It was fun and easy. Just snap together as many GoF patterns as you can with ATL-style templated multiple inheritance. Debugging slots that are really objectified wrappers (just to allow <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>) that reside in a recursive hash table data structure is an adventure in job security. You'll love it! -- ss

        <em>I can see I don't have a lock on the </em><a href="CppHeresy.html">CppHeresy</a> around here ;-)<em> --PM</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, I really <em>did</em> do that. If they had given me one day and one good reason, I could have implemented Smalltalk's #become. (Shut up; I had just read the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> book the week before!) --ss
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, if I read you right, I believe I've done pretty much the same thing in the past - at least I reimplemented Perl/Python composite builtins + literals as C++ classes. But that's a different solution to a different problem in a different context to this particular </em><a href="CppHeresy.html">CppHeresy</a>. Here we're trying to make C++ more maintainable and easier to <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a>, not just use Python types per se.<em> --PM</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it's relevant. Either you go through all the work to implement a dynamic layer in C++ yourself - which can be death if you don't grok the language (*) - or you use a dynamic language on top of C++ (<a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>). It's a <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> decision to use a secondary language, though. Microiterative design leads to the C++ cake. That's what happened to me. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Picking the right tools makes the job easier.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Question: what kinds of work are you doing in C++ that requires the ++ part? Why are doing all that stuff that is hard to write in C? Use the higher level language for that. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When I optimize to C++ I don't want spaghetti. Plus read again the C objections above.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (*) I used every keyword in the language to build my object model except "auto" and "register" (which are useless in MSVC++). Yes, I used "volatile" too. Messed up, neh? --ss
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You want messed up, see the use of "explicit" below :-P</em> --PM
      </p>
      <p>
        Which does what for you, exactly? --ss
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are asking what "explicit" does: It tells the compiler not to use the constructor for conversion, only use the constructor if the code "explicit"ly invokes it. In other words, if you define a constructor that takes an int (and do not use the explicit keyword), the compiler will automatically convert ints to your class when necessary. This might not be what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to why it is being used in the example below, I'm still not quite sure... --<a href="BillDavis.html">BillDavis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(Probably because of a rule -- consciously or unconsciously obeyed -- that says "always use </em>explicit<em> when you write a constructor unless there's a good reason to the contrary". Possibly the rule obtained from this by replacing "constructor" with "single-argument constructor" would be a better one, but simplicity has value...)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's a really bad rule. <em>explicit</em> exists to help you <em>not</em> fight the type system when necessary, but overdoing it will just make you fight it in another direction. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think you may not have noticed the words "unless there's a good reason to the contrary". I'd consider "because I want integers to be converted to bignums automatically when I mix them" to be a pretty good reason for not making Bignum::Bignum(int) </em>explicit<em>, for instance. But "because that's what the language does and I didn't think about it" wouldn't be a good reason, and that's probably the commonest reason for constructors not being made </em>explicit<em>. :-)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't found many occasions when using explicit was the right thing to do. Under what circumstances do you think explicit helps you rather than hinders you? -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It was used here because the ctor was getting invoked by a totally unrelated streaming operator. Most unseemly and the only occasion, in more than a decade with the language, that I've ever had occasion to use it. I certainly use no such rule as the one posited - or at least it isn't part of the </em><a href="CppHeresy.html">CppHeresy</a>.<em> --PM</em>

        <em>It's a </em><a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> (BDUF) decision to use a secondary language, though. Microiterative design leads to the C++ cake.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Very interesting to call this a BDUF decision. I know the kind of thing you're talking about (he thinks). But I would never call it BDUF. One of those MinimalDecisionsUpFront that was crucial (or was it?). An <em>architectural</em> decision? (Grimace). <a href="ChooseYourRutCarefully.html">ChooseYourRutCarefully</a>? Can <em>microiterative design</em> ever be wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, it's design up front at any rate. Yes, </em><a href="MicroiterativeDesign.html">MicroiterativeDesign</a> can be wrong because it is only locally optimizing. To find the global maximum, you have to make some non-micro design decisions.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Design up front is not the same as <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>.  Choosing to use a secondary language is no more Big Design than choosing which primary language to use is.  Big Design Up Front is when you make a <em>big</em> set of decisions before you actually start coding -- what all the classes will be, what the methods on them will be, etc. .  Then, during coding, either you don't take advantage of new information you discover (either about the code or about the changing requirements), or you do take advantage of it, and consequently toss out lots of your up-front Big Design.  If, as the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> guys claim, software can be kept cheap to change by refactoring and other practices, then <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> is a losing bet.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Why is <a href="MicroiterativeDesign.html">MicroiterativeDesign</a> only locally optimizing?  Or are all global optimizations not microiterative by definition?
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is a choice of second programming language "Up Front" at all?  Surely a second programming language can be added to a project as easily as any medium-sized third-party code library?  What are programming languages, if not producers and consumers of code libraries?
      </p>
      <p>
        Why couldn't a program be microiteratively (re)designed from being primarily written in language A to being primarily written in language B?  It should be just like any other refactoring.

        <strong><em>If Python is such a great solution to all your OO problems, why don't you just write the entire application in Python?</em></strong>
        If some parts suffer from actual measurable performance problems, you can always rewrite those parts as C++ components, to be used by Python.

      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, but if you DoAllYourEncapsulationInTheSoftLanguage (with emphasis on the "ALL" part), then aren't you really doing practically all the application programming in the soft language?
        I can understand using assembly/C/C++ to build high performance low level tools/components, when needed.
        But wouldn't it be simpler to do all the higher levels in Python instead of a mix?
        What benefits to you get by wedging C++ between your Python modules?

        That is to say that it is an extremely big decision.  Hammer -> Nail and all that.  Choose perl?  Smalltalk?  <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>?  Html?

        You've already made an enormous difference to what people will expect from your creation.

        But that's in a different category than <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> stuff, isn't it? I mean, you look at your goal and say "well, Smalltalk is probably better for this" or maybe you pick perl, and then you code and by coding you work out that your architecture feels like this and like that... Whereas if you're doing <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> you're choosing your architecture first.

        And the language absolutely decides a lot of what can and can't be done architecturally--languages may be <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a> but they're expressive in different ways--but it seems to me that it's like saying "I want to walk to the first <a href="McDonalds.html">McDonalds</a> on Tecumseh St." and then picking a direction to start in, rather than trying to map out every step of the route only to find halfway there that traffic on another route was lighter, and McD's is closed by the time you get there.

        <em>Hmm, what if you work on a large project which C++ is suitable for, and one day you find yourself facing the need to differentiate (or somehow else trasform) a symbolic formulae?
