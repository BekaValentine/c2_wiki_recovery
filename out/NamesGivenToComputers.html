        Names Given To Computers
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here are computer naming schemes that we've seen in real life, or maybe that we think would be good ideas. Most are people, places or things, but there are others. See also <a href="TipsForNamingComputers.html">TipsForNamingComputers</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>People (and People-like Beings)</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Anime Characters - Home computers are named after girls (Motoko, Ruriko, Teletha, Naru, Mizuho), Work computers are named after guys (Sousuke, Keitaro, Duo, Tenchi, Tsutomu)

        </li>
        <li>
           At the University of Georgia, I ran a network whose subdomain was 'franklin'. Of course, the machines got named 'ben', 'aretha', and so forth. 'Ben' was replaced with amuch larger Sun box, which we named 'bigben'. Har.

And hopefully without spoiling any plot let it be said that it would be a particularly bad omen to name a machine "adric".</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>You might hit a snag with "amy" though -- it would almost certainly have to be paired with a "rory".</em>

          </ul>

           Groups of people.  At SUNY--Stony Brook, the math department bought 3 Sun workstations in 1987, and we were trying to decide on a naming scheme.  I suggested mathematicians, another suggested women (as they're so fickle), and the third agreed and nominated <em>fawn</em>, <em>jessica</em>, and <em>donna</em>.  Sorry about the un-PC behavior.  We later added <em>vanna</em> and <em>vanessa</em>.  Fawn was the file-server, of course.  The Apple LaserShredder was attached to her.
        </li>
        <li>
           Hitchhikers Guide Characters - Marvin for the fickle laptop, arthur for the boring server, and Zaphod for the dual processor.

               <em>A local ISP here in </em><a href="PortlandOregon.html">PortlandOregon</a> is called Aracnet; their logo is a smiling spider.  Their shell server, for those who prefer a terminal session to PPP, is(was) called--what else--Shelob.<em></em>

        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
           Monsters - Our servers were all named after Godzilla monsters; Mortha, Gamera, Batra, Anzilla, Gargantua, about a dozen machines in total... until some new IT manager decided to use the very clever naming scheme of mlbint01-mlbint12.
        </li>
        <li>
           Movie characters - lonestar, hathaway, roberts
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
           Pok√©mon. Gengar, Pikachu, Elekid, Marill, ... At 649^H^H^H^H 721 <em>[and this number is only going to keep growing!]</em>, there are enough of these for a medium to large sized network. (I have only the first three).
        </li>
        <li>
           Porn Stars - The first two on the network were ginger and amber
        </li>
        <li>
           Protagonists of Ancient Video Games -- "qbert", "pacman", "mario", ...  Adapt the selection as appropriate to the time period you prefer. See also other video-game and game related names.
        </li>
        <li>
           Minor Video Game Characters/Sidekicks -- yoshi, dalbozz, lola, etc. We once had a firewall named six-armed-purple-beast-alarm-system (from Zork Grand Inquisitor). It was fun asking the ISP to change the reverse lookup on that one!
        </li>
        <li>
           Religious Figures (real or fictional) -- Jesus (my home computer), Nyarlethotep, Jehovah, Shiva, Ganesh, etc. It's not a bad idea to break out figures by type. EG: Egyptian gods for email, Greek for HTTP servers, etc
          <ul>
            <li>
               Norse Gods: Thor, Loki, Odin... Most of them are nice and short.

            <li>
               Ancient Greek Gods.  Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Aphrodite, Artemis, Athena, etc.

            </li>
            <li>
               Indian: Shiva, Vayu (the fiancee decided to name the wireless routerafter the god of winds ;) )
            </li>
            <li>
               Aztec Gods: Quetzalcoatl, Huitzilopochtli, Tezcatlipoca, Tlaloc, etc.  Most of them are long, evil, and have unpronouncable collections of consonants strung together.  Good choice if you think the DNS system is overrated.
            </li>
            <li>
               At Project Rastko, computers are named after Slavic gods: Perun (boss's computer), Vid (scanner, OCR), Vesna (secretary's computer), Veles, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
               Biblical characters: a DNS server named dorcas, the character from the New Testament who wove clothes for the poor and apparently unclothed
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Star Trek -- 1of10, 2of10, 3of10, halfadozenofone,... (Recommended for NT, W2000 machines.  The greatest thing about this naming pattern is how every non-trekkie will need it explained and will then call it really stupid.) One of my disks is called Tiberius (That's the T in James T Kirk :P) [and two others Jean-Luc and LaForge, but those names aren't as obscure :P]
        </li>
        <li>
           Teams of people.  Another place I worked had 3 servers named <em>mo</em>, <em>curly</em>, and <em>larry</em>.  I tried very hard to get the system administrators to fix the obvious typo; I explained that <em>mo</em> being misnamed was the cause of all our network difficulties. Every attempt was rejected.  --<a href="EricJablow.html">EricJablow</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
           Shakespearean characters. See <a href="http://bookshelved.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TheTempest">http://bookshelved.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TheTempest</a> for an example
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Thomas the Tank Engine</em> engines -- has the advantage that each name has an associated number to use as the last part of the IP address. Current boxes are henry (192.168.0.3), gordon (192.168.0.4) and donald (192.168.0.9).
        </li>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="WilliamGibson.html">WilliamGibson</a> characters? - Case, Molly, Armitage, Wilson, Finn, Angie, Mona, 3Jane, Flatline, etc.?<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Arrakis spanish isp</em> consistente naming: Dune, Scytale (IRC bot), Coriolis, Fedaykin, fremen, bene teilax, melange, caladan, etc.. 
        </li>
        <li>
           People who were admins on a mud. This was back in 1993, although the computer named after my mudchar was still around for several years after.
        </li>
        <li>
           Acronym. Many years ago I put together a (sort of) copy of an automated modem test station. I called it MATT, for Modem Automated Test Table. The <em><cough></em> authorities didn't like that name, so I ended up calling it Fred.
        </li>
        <li>
           The Marx brothers.  Harpo, Chico, Zeppo, Gummo, and Groucho.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Famous soccer players: Chengue, Sosita, Lembo, etc...
        </li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Places</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Astronomical Objects -- If you compile this on Jupiter, it won't run in Orion (what does this say about Einstein's 1st postulate, the laws of nature are the same in all inertial reference frames).  <em>We had star names beginning with C.  The file server was </em>CygnusX - which is a black hole.<em>  Also, stars: Aldeberan, Betelgeuse, Capella, Deneb, Enif, Fomulhaut, etc.  See </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arabic_star_names">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arabic_star_names</a> for tons and tons more.
        </li>
        <li>
           Bodies of Water -- Cornell University uses this in one of its CS labs, situated as it is among New York's Finger Lakes (Cayuga, Seneca, Keuka, Canandaiuga, Owasco)...
          <ul>
            <li>
               There's always Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg - if you hate your users.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Countries (host address would contain the international dialling code. "Hello, is that support? I can't get into France!")
        </li>
        <li>
           Hometowns -- <a href="WorldStreet.html">WorldStreet</a> used this scheme and had few if any conflicts.
        </li>
        <li>
           Island Groups (logical and physical) -- <a href="UniversityOfWashington.html">UniversityOfWashington</a> has tahiti, sumatra, fiji, and ceylon
        </li>
        <li>
           Mountains -- everest, rainier, hood, etc. 
        </li>
        <li>
           National Parks -- The [[<a href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/][VirtualRealityApplicationsCenter]]">http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/][VirtualRealityApplicationsCenter]]</a> ([[<a href="http://www.iastate.edu][IowaStateUniversity]],">http://www.iastate.edu][IowaStateUniversity]],</a> formerly ICEMT) has/had banff, moab, denali, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Place Names, Real or Fictional -- "Tibet", "Panama" (a router?), "Trantor".
        </li>
        <li>
           Planets and Moons -- One of our labs had 2 servers, Saturn and Jupiter. Each workstation was named after a moon of either Saturn or Jupiter. (This meant that everybody logged into europa and io, because they were the easiest to spell.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               In the Physics & Astronomy department at my university where I work, we use moons for the names of our servers. Io, Puck, Titan, etc. The best one however is our backup server, named Null.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Shipping forecast zones. E.g. viking, dogger, fisher, shannon, fastnet etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           "tatara-ba" -- My current desktop machine; it's a place-name from a movie, and also has a literal translation.
        </li>
        <li>
           "tacoma-narrows" -- Gateway machine at the college I used to go to. Named after the ill-fated bridge.
        </li>
        <li>
           "Wistah" was the name of a server on the corporate network at Banyan Systems in Westborough, Massachusetts. I think I had been working there for about three years before it dawned on me one day that this was the native pronounciation of "Worcester", a large city just a little west of Westborough. Indeed, it was confirmed when I asked, the server was named after the city.
        </li>
        <li>
           "kickin" and "chicken" after the Kickin' Chicken chain, a popular lunch place at work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Things</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Area of Specialization -- At the HP graphics lab there were names like "transform", "matrix", "raster", "jaggy", "spline", etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Beer --  carlsberg, stella, landlord, guinness, murphys, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Board games (see also video games): monopoly, candyland, chutes and ladders, scrabble, operation, boggle (and not to insult them by comparison with trivial games, but surely chess and checkers, too)
        </li>
        <li>
           Card games (see also board and video games): poker, solitaire (canfield, russian bank...see Hoyles)...
        </li>
        <li>
           Car Brands -- An easy one if you don't want to have think too hard.
        </li>
        <li>
           Cereal -- When MIT first started using workstations heavily, whatever group RMS was in (ummm...project MAC?) used frosted-flakes, cheerios, raisin-bran, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Cereal and other breakfast foods entry 2: cereal, waffle, pancake, eggs, bacon, sausage
        </li>
        <li>
           Cereal (sort of) entry 3: Breakfast Cereals -- entirely by accident, I seem to have begun this theme with the name ``slicedbread<em> (as in ``the greatest thing since sliced bread</em>). I later named a computer ``specialk<em> (was watching a Law & Order episode mentioning Ketamine, a drug which goes by the street name--or so they said--of ``specialk</em>), and so forth...
        </li>
        <li>
           Cheeses -- used in a university in Wisconsin. <em>Also used at Warwick Uni, for the Maths department sun workstations</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Classic video games -- asteroids, pong, breakout, space invaders, frogger, galaga, pacman, ms.pacman, centipede, millipede, battlezone, tetris, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Colours -- which inevitably lead back to Star Wars.  Red One, Red Two... Red Five...  <em>At the University of Utah Computer Graphics lab there were three Apollo workstations in a row called red, green, and blue.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Colors entry 2: there are a zillion color names available for naming (e.g. with X11, see rgb.txt for <strong>many</strong> color names). SeaFoamGreen, Magenta...
        </li>
        <li>
           Drug Slang -- An unnamed startup uses this convention.  The goal was to use names with double-entendre, such as "jones", "jah", "scale".  A particularly well-chosen name was the router, named "cigs" (gateway drug, gateway machine).
        </li>
        <li>
           Elements -- According to one source, MIT's lab machines normally are named simply with a pair of numbers, giving lab and machine within lab.  However, for a prank, they were once renamed to the form "Hydrogen-1", "Helium-1", etc, with the lab number being the quantity.

           Back when Sun workstations typically had 8 meg of RAM, I was at a startup doing a very difficult cutting-edge project that required vast amounts of RAM (128 meg, the most you could put on a Sun back then).

           Ages ago I named a <a href="DataGeneral.html">DataGeneral</a> supermini Cuthbert J. Twillie, <a href="WcFields.html">WcFields</a>' character in <em>My Little Chickadee.</em> None of us noticed that when timeshare users from around the city used a piece of commercial software on the machine, the program listed that name (truncated to 16 chars) as the contact person for support. One day the vice president came storming at me after she answered a call from someone asking for Mr. Twil. So I surreptitiously renamed the machine Egbert Souse ("accent grave over the e"), Fields' character in <em>The Bank Dick,</em> and waited for someone to call up mispronouncing Souse.
          <ul>
            <li>
               I don't get it. Is "twil" a cussword in some country's slang? <em>No, it's just not the name of anyone at the company. And so, if the name I give to the machine is going to show up as the "support" person, I had better enter the name of someone at the company. Considering 99% of our customers were known to us by name and knew our names, we were amazed to receive a call out of nowhere from someone asking for this nonexistent Mr. Twil--around 2 years after I called the machine Twillie. Being incorrigible, I entered another fictitious name (Egbert Souse), one which wouldn't get truncated but would, when mispronounced by someone who doesn't know Fields movies, sound like a reference to heavy alcohol consumption. Then we engineers at the company got our heads together and decided that a call for Cuthbert Twillie (no truncation problem) would signal a call from a clueless person who will probably need a lot of hand holding. Egbert lasted about a week, and we were back to Cuthbert.</em>

           While working at a small non-profit organization, I was entrusted to set up a small, public-access network for sharing a DSL line over some 30 PCs, of which only about ten would be in use most of the time. These machines were divided into three groups of ten - one for a class group which met daily, one for general use among the clients, and one for another specific group whose purpose wasn't very well defined. The first group I named for composers - Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, etc., - the second for inventors - Edison, Franklin, Tesla, etc. When I came to that third group, which were rarely used because of their uncertain purpose, I decided to have a bit of fun, and see if any one caught the pattern. The names I used were Hill, Haywood, Goldman, Spooner, Tucker, Warren, Thornely, Black, Barrow, and Parker... the last two, of course, were ringers, but folklore holds that regarding their motives, they fit in with the rest.

        <em>Do unimaginative naming schemes--like the name of the user, the function of the machine (printQueue4), the serial number or asset tracking number, or some randomly assigned bit of fluff--count?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, they don't count, and as is very well known by now, it is <strong>always</strong> a mistake to name a system after its user. Inevitably, eventually users swap computers, so then user Bob is working on system Jim, and user Jim is working on Bob, and everyone is permanently confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also a bad idea to use something like an asset tracking number, simply because such things are difficult for humans to remember.

        <em>I worked at a place that had the </em><a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> of, by default, naming machines after their users.  Most of the engineers, when receiving a machine, renamed it right away, but the chief engineer was notorious for keeping the old names, which was really annoying since he usually put himself at the end of the "new hardware food chain"--all the old machines ended up flowing through him.  To combat this, one engineer, before giving up his old machine, renamed it "dumpysmurf", thinking that surely no one would let <strong>that</strong> name stand.  As far as I know, it was still named dumpysmurf when the company shut down years later.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I work at a shop where each machine is rebuilt from an image snapshot before it moves from one user to another, in which case naming the machine after the user is not so bad an idea--at least when the machine starts running network-intensive malware, you know who needs to be visited with a cluebat, without tediously looking through various databases (larger companies would just unplug the network jack and identify the user when they complain about not having network access, but we prefer the personal touch ;-).  This ritual cleansing has a number of nice side-effects, such as cleaning out all the Microsoft malware from Windows boxes.  It gets rid of the third-party viruses, trojans, worms, and spyware too.  Of course, now we have the problem of figuring out which of a user's many possible names to use: johns?  jsmith?  john_smith?  john_q_smith?  "John Smith"?  <a href="JohnSmith.html">JohnSmith</a>?  jon_boy?  the_johnmeister?  JohnSmith9?  john_smith_second_computer?

        We encountered a similar problem when we evaluated some software with a floating license server.	We started out with BrandX software, and we named the license server "BrandX" (names changed to remain innocent of trademark infringement ;-).  We now run BrandY software, which has a license server...still named "BrandX."  Apparently we can change all technical details of our license (including customer legal name, billing address, responsible party, and host ID) with a simple phone call or email, but changing our license server's host <em>name</em> would require a nuclear explosion to occur somewhere in the vicinity of BrandY's customer database.  Of course the license manager checks the host name matches the license data...
