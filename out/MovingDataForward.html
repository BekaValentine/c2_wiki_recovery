        I am finishing out the year of 2010 with a continuing project (<a href="NotBuiltInOneDay.html">NotBuiltInOneDay</a> <- use this instead of the old "Under Construction") of <a href="PaperPorting.html">PaperPorting</a> (scanning archival and legacy documents (my AsizePileOfStuff is now at 26 inches 20101109)) as well as setting up a work area in my garage for Windows computers from Windows 3.22 forward (this is not the earliest, but is the first where I can use an ethernet card to read and write files between the systems up to my current wireless VistaLaptop) I want to make all my life's work accessible on a MultiTeraByteStorage system. Much of what I did prior to these systems will be part of NysProject2011. I will have to work out recovery systems and interfacing which will allow me to archive work done as early as my first 4K Trs-80.

        It is part of a larger idea of <a href="MovingDataForward.html">MovingDataForward</a>, which values what until now was considered by most as stuff to throw away. It is to late to capture some of the work done which is on media which is not currently readable, not due to legibility, but due to it having been discarded. So far I have found that a lot of my magnetic media has fared better than some of my earliest Cds, which because of scratches and peeling is no longer useful. In a sense I am creating a <a href="HistoryOfComputing.html">HistoryOfComputing</a> as viewed by a single user. Some of the data to move forward exist in paper copies of code, etc. which is first to be scanned, and if time and technology permit will be digitized so that it might become executable via simulation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have enough work here to keep me busy in this area for several years.  It is part of my overall MovingForwardInitiative which values past, present and future innovations in hardware, software, and techniques.
