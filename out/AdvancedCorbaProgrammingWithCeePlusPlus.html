        [ISBN:0-201-37927-9] This book has become the "bible" for developing CORBA applications using <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>. It is written by two people who have been closely involved with the CORBA standardization process and with the development of widely-used CORBA implementations (Orbacus and Orbix).

        Thankfully, and in contrast to several other CORBA-in-C++ guides, this book concentrates on standards, and the examples do not rely on proprietary features of particular ORB implementations. The only major problem is that the book is a few years old, and therefore does not cover any of the newer features of current CORBA standards.  Even so, as an intro to the basics, there is nothing better.
