        A short article (blog?) in Infoworld describes a curious situation: A technically talented techie who has poor people skills is given a reward if there are no complaints against him for a given period of time. Respondents suggest that this creates a bad precedent. Perhaps everyone should get an award for improving a weak point of theirs, whether it's people skills or something else.
