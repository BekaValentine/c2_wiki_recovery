        Thanks to <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, most people today have heard of Wikis. Depending on your definition, <a href="MojoMojo.html">MojoMojo</a> might be a Wiki. It certainly makes it effortless to create web pages of text, and it can be configured so that anyone can edit any page. It can also be configured so you have to register to edit a page, or you can even disable registration. However, the thing that sets <a href="MojoMojo.html">MojoMojo</a> apart from other Wikis more than anything is its basic structure. Every page in <a href="MojoMojo.html">MojoMojo</a> can have a set of pages below it. In turn those pages can have sets of pages under them as well. This means <a href="MojoMojo.html">MojoMojo</a> supports a tree structure of pages, just like a directory structure on a hard drive.

        We also have a bunch of features you won't find in every wiki, like an attachment system that automatically makes a web gallery of your photos, live AJAX previews as you are editing your text, and a proper full text search engine built straight into the software. <a href="MojoMojo.html">MojoMojo</a> is written in the <a href="CatalystFramework.html">CatalystFramework</a>. It's 100% SQL driven, thanks to the DBIx::Class ORM. This allows <a href="MojoMojo.html">MojoMojo</a> its rich feature set without sacrificing performance and scalability.

        The code running <a href="MojoMojo.html">MojoMojo</a> is Open Source, under the Artistic License, just like Perl. Even though the project was started by Marcus Ramberg, it has a number of contributors from all over the world. The project has been running since 2005, with the first public release to CPAN in the fall of 2007. <a href="MojoMojo.html">MojoMojo</a> was presented at YAPC10 and was the only 3rd party application mentioned in the <a href="CatalystFramework.html">CatalystFramework</a> book "The Definitive Guide to Catalyst".

        It is interesting to compare this with <a href="ZwiKi.html">ZwiKi</a> using the <a href="WikiChoicetree.html">WikiChoicetree</a> as they have many features in common, including the page directory structure. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
