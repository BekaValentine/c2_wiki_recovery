        Video Conference Meeting
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a meeting which takes place between individuals or parties in lieu of bringing the participants into a physical meeting place. It can consist in as few as two, and as many as the technical infrastructure can handle.
      </p>
      <p>
        For visibility of from two to four locales (which may equate to more than one person per locale, I have used Skype quite successfully. It has the advantage of being large, well-developed (continual), inexpensive and having global reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other infrastructures have been employed as well.

        The advantages of this type of meeting
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Does not require the interruption that a trip to a central site by many participants causes and the costs involved.
        </li>
        <li>
           Can be called to order almost immediately (allowing for decisions and directions to be changed to meet fast-changing scenarios).
        </li>
        <li>
           Provides visibility through face-to-face interaction as well as chat (instant messaging) for all to be heard.
        </li>
        <li>
           Gives an ability to relate links and transfer files during sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
           Can also serve, via the historical archiving of the chat sessions, review of content.
        </li>
        <li>
           Can be recorded as video/audio, or as audio, to make the session(s) reviewable. And also so that each participant can have in effect "minutes" of the meeting as soon as it is over.
