        Did you write this whole <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> thing yourself? It is an amazing product/concept. You should license/patent it asap. It is incredible and mind-boggling.

      <p>
        Here is a great application of what you have done. Say I have published a  paper/patterns. I want people to add comments & thoughts about how and where they have used the pattern. The great problem with patterns is that they are 
        one-directional, from author to consumer. Authors need to get the feedback about patterns so that they can refine them.

        I would love to be able to make *some* contribution to wiki. If wiki-like projects can be made to succeed, it could be the greatest boon to civilization since movable type. History strongly suggests that any increase in the speed with which insight and improvements can be distributed to others can result in a dramatic acceleration in those improvements. I believe wiki - or something very much like it - can be such an improvement. -- RichardFleischer

        Wiki is a real find - as my officemate commented, "the signal to noise
        ratio here is waaay too high to be popular" - and so this community can produce a stable discussion, rather than HotWired or any of the mere chat-style collaborations on the web.

        I haven't had much time for Wiki but I think it is a remarkably successful experiment in participatory writing. I spent last week in Austin at the Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy, CFP98. One of the birds-of-a-feather meetings discussed <em>governing online communities</em> and the innumerable problems that arise therefrom. That something as open and vulnerable as Wiki has worked seems a wee little miracle.

        No, but it shouldn't be a surprise. A 24/7 connected Linux box with static IP address and .com domain name can cost at least US$350 per year for <em>entry-level</em> service (the kind with 99% reliability, i.e. it doesn't work 3.65 days every year, and you do all the work yourself). <em>Good</em> service is an order of magnitude more expensive.

        Going to bed this AM, I was playing with my pocket PC (with wireless internet access). I noticed the Python page had a link (and small tribute) to you and your wiki site. I ended up getting sucked into spending 2 hours browsing your site. Fascinating. -- <a href="JimBesemer.html">JimBesemer</a>

        Dear Ward,:	Thank you for growing a beautiful community project. Thank you for reminding me that simplifying things often makes them better. -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a>

        I stumbled on your site while looking up the word "<a href="McGuffin.html">McGuffin</a>". I liked the collaborative format and went to your home page. I'm a software architect, principally doing re-engineering projects with Prolog tools. I have been curious about xp, but never really learned much about it. Well wiki wiki and its users are pretty amazing. I have never been able to graze so much information so quickly.

        I am blown away by the collaboration. I contrast it with a protest discussion group around the RNC that I have been lurking on and sporadically contributing to. Almost no constructive collaboration. I wonder if such folks could benefit from wiki wiki or whether they would just erase each other in the same way that they are talking on top of each other. -- Chris Rose

        Ward, I just wanted to thank you, publicly and personally, for providing such a remarkable environment for sharing learning. This Wiki, in particular, floats above an ocean of information like a liferaft. Thank you, and all the talented folk you have enticed into sharing their hard-won knowledge and experience of managing complexity with abstractions. --  <a href="PaulWilson.html">PaulWilson</a>

        A tornado shredding a bookstore and depositing the contents
        elsewhere would produce a more organized webpage than that. --NathanMates (reposted from USENET without permission)
