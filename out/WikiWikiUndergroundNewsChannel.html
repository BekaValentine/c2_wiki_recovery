        Wiki Wiki Underground News Channel
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>A </em><a href="WikiWikiUndergroundNewsChannel.html">WikiWikiUndergroundNewsChannel</a> is a <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> intranet that is used to communicate the information (the same information to everyone) without the knowledge of the management.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We got permission to set up a <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> intranet where I work. At the beginning, it was used to record and communicate the development on our projects. But it has evolved into an underground news channel because the management has been in <a href="FireFighting.html">FireFighting</a> mode for 6 months now. The management doesn't listen to what the employees say and  don't want to see the situation we are in. We do <a href="ManagementByCrisis.html">ManagementByCrisis</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a funny use of a <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> intranet and very effective to keep each employee up-to-date with the latest crisis details. <a href="KnowledgeIsPower.html">KnowledgeIsPower</a>.
