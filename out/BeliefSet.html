        A primal para-psi concept by <a href="JaneRoberts.html">JaneRoberts</a>. Here's the logic:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Term: <em>Beliefs</em> are opinions about life held by sentience.
        </li>
        <li>
           Axiom 1: <strong></strong><a href="BeliefsCreateReality.html">BeliefsCreateReality</a>.<strong> Period.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           Axiom 2: The point of power is in the present. <strong>All time is simultaneous.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           Axiom 3: Indefinite realms of alternate <strong></strong>ProbableRealities<strong> of each minor variation exist, and obviously beyond detection by any commonly known sensors.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           Axiom 4: <a href="ContradictoryBeliefSet.html">ContradictoryBeliefSet</a>s enable <strong>bad mental health</strong>. Get better by considering your beliefs looking for clusters of related ones that may more easily harbor these.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Reality floats in a field engineered by life to fit those axioms to a "corollary" of 3 dimensional space, math & physics constants, and time. All are camouflages on perceptual abilities and other-worldly communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you die, you reunite with an "OverSoul", and then arrive at a new life, in any different reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believing these things enables EtheIsm morality principles.

        For what it's worth, this is a variant on a philosophical strain called <em>idealism</em>

        <em>Insofar as it returns control to the user, yes.</em>
