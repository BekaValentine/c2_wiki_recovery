        "Have you ever seen a costume like mine?" (TheJuggernaut)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I am currently between high school and college, with a lot of free time on my hands, and I piss away a lot of it here. I have a website: <a href="http://turkey.fvdh.net/~hanumizzle">http://turkey.fvdh.net/~hanumizzle</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The nick hanumizzle is derived from the Hindu/Buddhist monkey god Hanuman. Because the Rama(?:yan|kien) is one of my favorite stories, I allude to it on an almost daily basis. I am not a Hindu or Buddhist (or of any religious opinion at all, including atheist), but I find those kinds of things interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Atheism, btw, is not a religious opinion, it's a lack of one, so if you have no "religious" opinion at all, you're an atheist.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's WeakAtheism. StrongAtheism is the dogmatic belief that there are no gods. The weak atheist regards the strong atheist as a religionist, albeit a degenerate one.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Qualifying atheism with strong and weak is as silly as qualifying evolution with macro and micro. It's meaningless. You're either atheist or not; there's no inbetween. You either believe in gods or you don't; it's quite simple. Agnostics are athiests as well; they're just polite about it.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I feel compelled to disagree. Agnostics do not deny the existence of god(s). They simply say that there is no evidence either way. A god who is completely disinterested in human affairs would be undetectable to us, but compatible with an Agnostic stance. -- <a href="MikeAnderson.html">MikeAnderson</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An universal standard quantum of belief is just as silly. Strong and weak qualifiers make sense if viewed in terms of the amount of force they hold over the belief holder. A Strong Atheist is marked by how inescapably compelled they are to preach their binary. Many aspects of their life is outright shaped by their strong stance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I think you are describing deism. It reminds me of some time I was reading a religious treatise by Newton on the nature of God, and he took a whole paragraph defining the Sanskrit word 'nirguna' (without form) in English to ascribe it to that most divine subject. (Theerasak)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The reason for qualifying evolution within micro and macro is because there is no such thing as a 'kind' barrier. (On top of that, speciation <strong>has occurred</strong> in a laboratory setting, so it's really kind of moot.) I am not a creation 'scientist' trying to pull the wool over the eyes of American education boards; I am just someone who refuses to take any definitive position on religion, including agnosticism. Some suggested that I might be an agnostic, which is what I use on forms and surveys, but I don't even think that's true. I'm not even sure that I'm not sure. 'Meta-agnostic' might be the best term to describe it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have transcended even [atheism]. Do a quick Google search for the Brahmin Jabali; the mindset of this freethinker most closely matches my own. (There is a wonderful English translation of a Bangla text on the man on boloji.com IIRC.) I believe atheism is a kind of religious opinion, or, rather, an opinion of religion. I argue with the more rabid atheists all the time, and delight in tripping them up with their self-righteous attitudes. True and false are both Boolean values, but I am nil.

        I'm not an atheist, trust me.

        <em>I've been reading </em><a href="ArthurCeeClarke.html">ArthurCeeClarke</a> novels lately, and a couple weeks ago I came across the name Hanuman. It's the name of an asteroid. I wanted to tell you about it, but I got caught up in other stuff and am just now hazily remembering what I read. Anyway, Hanuman shows up in either <em>2010</em> or <em>2061</em>.

           c.f. Rendezvous with Rama where the astronomers tap out of names in the Greco-Roman pantheon and name the new celestial body...uh...Rama. Hanuman was Rama's BFF and <a href="ArthurCeeClarke.html">ArthurCeeClarke</a> lives in SriLankaCountry now, so I understand he's very engrossed in all the Hindu mythology and such.

        Theerasak: I don't know whether you saw my recent explosion at you. I did a bad thing. I'm sorry I exploded at you. I was reacting out of something from my own youth. Can we be friends? I'm normally mild mannered. -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>

           Uh, I don't know. I remember very little about that circus now. I don't really feel qualified to say anything about it at this point. Flippant...to be fair, I've been so characterized on a number of occassions before. At least you didn't use an <a href="ArgumentumAdHitlerum.html">ArgumentumAdHitlerum</a>. (Yes, believe it or not, I've had people compare me to Hitler before in several instances.) This can be traced to a number of reasons, I guess. I have strong opinions, mainly on geeky stuff; I like it when people agree with what I say; I like to argue; the formative years of my life were fraught with isolation and pain...I am a pessimist about human nature. I do various 'good stuff', but I don't why, given that <a href="NineteenEightyFour.html">NineteenEightyFour</a> closely matches what is going on in my head at any given time in the day. In fact, I scarcely even recognize what <strong>is</strong> flippant; if I were not so hell-bent on educating myself (where 'education' encompasses various quaint human protocols that are learned behavior for the autistic), I am sure I would have <strong>way</strong> bigger problems now than an argument on wiki. In any case, <a href="ThaiLanguage.html">ThaiLanguage</a> is my first article here, and if you wish to extend an act of friendship, could you kindly read it for quality?
        </li>
      </ul>

        Sure. I'll read it. I probably won't have a comment, though. <a href="ThaiLanguage.html">ThaiLanguage</a> is way too foreign a field for me. -- Eliz

      <p>
        Yes, it's a good page: very interesting. It reminds me of my sister several years ago. She took up an interest in Theravada Buddhism and studied Pali awhile. BYW, I had no thoughts of Hitler when I read your thing to Earle :-) BTW, BTW, I was compared to Hitler a long time ago and it screwed me up for the next 15 years!

           <a href="MrVoltaire.html">MrVoltaire</a> liked to make his opponents look ridiculous. This is what I tend to do in such cases where it becomes (practically) necessary. One time I got into an argument with some Panjabi guy on freenode. He apparently mistook me for an Indian (maybe true, according to a Hindutva), a Tamil specifically, and started asking me all this stuff about: "What do you think of Indian guys who date white chicks?", and mysteriously assumed I fell into the same category. He admitted to being drunk the first time I talked to him, and for all I know, he was drunk the other times, too. He seemed to revile anyone who mingled sexually with any other ethnicity. Various anecdotes he told to give me the impression that he was not a bigot <strong>all</strong> involved Tamils, which led me to believe he was just making them up. I later pointed out that someone from Northern India adopting such an exclusive position towards race is comparable to proverbially "shutting the barn door after the sheep got out" and asked "when did Panjab declare a feature freeze?". Realizing that he made himself look like a total ass, he spewed profanities at me; I was a "fag" and "piece of trash", in his words, destroying any moral high ground he could claim to have. He then told me I was on ignore, parting with: "l8r loser". Apparently, this besotted ignoramus never heard of an open relay; I got behind an HTTP proxy w/ support for CONNECT and started gleefully taunting him with Juggernaut quotes, because there was no way in hell I was going to let him get away with the last word. He made a final mistake of granting me victory by calling me "a little nigger", and saying he quit freenode. And he did. I'm still gloating about it now.

        Interesting random thought: when MrPythagoras told his followers to "abstain from beans", we now think that this was a euphemism for voting, which was done with dry beans as ballots. "Avoid politics", in other words. Would a Hindi speaker say: "Abstain from <strong>dal</strong> (political party), not <strong>daal</strong> (lentils)?" -- tp

        I encourage everyone on C2 wiki never to use the #python channel on irc.freenode.net. Why? I thought the NO LOL rule was a joke of some kind, but when I sidestepped the bot that admonishes users on use of LOL by using the Greek omicron character in my 'LOL', which looks like this, Ο, one of the chanops threatened me with a ban.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my immature youth, I would get behind my shell account and/or open proxies and cavalierly use omicron 'LΟL' until the operators eventually grew tired of keeping up with the endless slew of Indian/Thai nicknames I created for myself --- something I did re use of profanity on ##linux until WildPikachu decided to quit playing into my juvenile Agent Smith schoolyard respawn game and let me drop as many F-bombs as I liked.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't use LOL <strong>that</strong> often. LOL itself doesn't mean <strong>too much</strong> to me. Arbitrary guidelines, with no rhyme or reason, do. It's not much of a <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a> argument to say that if you can accept one thing on blind faith, you can accept <strong>anything</strong> on blind faith. It's happened before, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        But <strong>I think</strong> I'm just going to leave it with a hearty "kiss my ass" for the admin who threatened me with expulsion and take my business elsewhere.
