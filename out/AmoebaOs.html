      <ul>
        <li>
          Distribution: connecting together many machines
        </li>
        <li>
          Parallelism: allowing individual jobs to use multiple CPUs easily 
        </li>
        <li>
          Transparency: users should not involve with system complexities
        </li>
        <li>
          Performance: achieving the three goals above.It's specially done by FLIP (Fast Local Internet Protocol)
