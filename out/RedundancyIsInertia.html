        Redundancy Is Inertia
      </h1>
      <p>
        Do you like where you're going?  If so, redundancy is your friend.  If not, redundancy is your enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ways inertia is bad:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your code is headed in a certain direction, and you suspect you'll change directions in the future.  Expressing each idea <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> allows this by reducing momentum.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Ways inertia is good:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your code is working, and you'd like to keep it that way.  <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s give features redundancy, making them harder to inadvertently remove.  (More on this kind of good inertia below).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your service is working, and you like this.  Add redundant servers to keep it that way.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Complaint:</strong> "Redundancy is Inertia" seems to be assumed here, without any critical defense.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe the whole concept to be subtly fallacious.  If there is <strong>inertia</strong> in code, it must be defined by <strong>cost of change</strong> (akin to physical inertia determining how much effort it takes to stop or redirect an object in motion).  Redundancy, then, can only be cause of inertia when, as a consequence of the redundancy, changes must be duplicated across the code - e.g. for the modification of a general behavior.  In these cases, <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> will reduce inertia.  However, in those cases where changing the behavior requires specialization, <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> will increase inertia, as it requires breaking apart abstractions and refactorings that had already been performed in order to acquire a finer grain of control.

        <em>Some discussion originally on </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> that makes sense in this light:<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> sounds like a nice principle but, when taken at face value, would lead to untested code. Even XP advocates stating each fact at least twice, preferably three times. (See also <a href="RequirementsAndDesign.html">RequirementsAndDesign</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        The three places where are fact is stated are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           what the customer wants (<a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s)
        </li>
        <li>
           what the programmer wants (<a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s)
        </li>
        <li>
           what the program does (the program itself)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There will usually be some slack between the functional tests and unit tests,
        the reality will be that some facts are stated many more times. I can
        usually manage <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> in program code, but I find it very hard
        to avoid duplication between tests. Its very tempting to say "Well, I think
        I've tested X elsewhere, but it can't hurt to assert it again". This results
        in one error causing multiple test failures, which some people consider to
        be a bad thing (personally it doesn't bother me too much).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have to put each fact in at least 2 places, then you can become creative in where those 2 places are. "Code + test" is one solution; "Code + <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>" is another.  Between these, you get "code + (test | static typing)". Using declarative systems and AI, it might be possible to reduce the need for the
        "code" fact. Fundamentally though, if you want reliability, you must state each fact more than one representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In hardware design, we have an extra consideration: simulating the design
        takes a long time. So we don't want a test to fail due to errors in the
        test. So it is common to develop the tests on a software model (with
        each fact in 3 places) to get confidence in the tests, and only then
        commit to the thousands of hours of CPU time needed for the simulations.

        This is a good point, Dave.  I have another rule I use when information must be duplicated: <em>When you must duplicate information make sure you will automatically detect if the duplicated information falls out of sync.</em>
        Tests do this implicitly, and by definition.  There are other common cases where the duplicated information is not self-testing, though.  Assertions are a classic tool for handling this kind of problem.

      <p>
        This point is valid only if the code is perfect. Otherwise the two types of test add information to the overall system, and hence are not duplicating knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, to be fair, what you're critiquing here is not really OAOO (which is about code refactoring), but <a href="DontRepeatYourself.html">DontRepeatYourself</a>, which is wider ranging. -- <a href="DavidThomas.html">DavidThomas</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The OAOO principle in XP refers specifically to the program. The program should express each idea once and only once - there should be no duplicate <em>code</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, comparing the code:
      </p>
      <code>
        square(NUMBER x) {<br/>
        return x*x;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        with the test:
      </p>
      <code>
        assertEquals(4, square(2));<br/>
        assertEquals(9, square(3));<br/>
        assertEquals(4, square(-2));<br/>
        assertEquals(9, square(-3));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        we see no duplication of fact (though the test could be optimized OAOO-wise). As for duplication of tests of specific things, there's no inherent objection, except, of course, that you have to find and change all the places when a change is needed. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        <em></em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> applies ever-so-much-more-so when it comes to the automated tests themselves. Automated tests by their very nature have a high degree of similarity from one test to the next. As in Ron's example above. A good way to doom a testing regime to failure is to not require refactoring of the test code. I have seen this nearly kill several automated test efforts.<em></em>

        <em>In one case, a testing effort would have produced our company's largest software product ever without some rude intervention on my part. After doing a little math I was able to project the size of the testware by projects-end, and it really opened some eyes. They started refactoring, and reduced the size of each test on average by an order of magnitude! -- </em><a href="EricRunquist.html">EricRunquist</a><em></em>
