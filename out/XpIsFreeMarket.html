        Xp Is Free Market
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you have access to the TV show "<a href="StarTrekDeepSpaceNine.html">StarTrekDeepSpaceNine</a>", study the 
        culture of the species called "Ferengi". Their natural instincts revolve 
        around mercantile and financial dealing. They pay money to visit someone in 
        their house, or to have a conversation with a government official, or to 
        worship their religion. Their officers pay their soldiers, per order. Their 
        childhood games revolve around gambling and simulating stock markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        They don't have wars. They sometimes have financial collapses; these rally 
        them to the cause. Their only serious crime pattern is kleptomania.
      </p>
      <p>
        An XP team works by pretending that it is payed per story. The team behaves 
        as if the <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> took bids in "ideal days" or "complexity points" 
        for each story, paid for an iteration, and at its end collected new program 
        features that add value. They are expected to behave like Ferengi.
      </p>
      <p>
        They do this because it's not pretending. The OSC invests real money in 
        running a programming team, and expects a continuous return on investment. 
        They should be able to cancel the project at any time, no love lost, and 
        get back a working product expressing exactly the value of the money 
        submitted into the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strict code ownership would interfere with return on investment. 
        Programmers without trust cannot efficiently fulfill their "contracts", 
        which are the user stories they bid on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an economic model, programmers cannot simultaneously own source code, and 
        own user stories. That would cause incredible friction. Hence, programmers 
        own the <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, and the <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> owns the code.

        <strong><em>The Ferengi Rules of Extreme Acquisition:</em></strong>

        Duplicating them probably violates Paramounts copyright or
        somesuch, but since someone else has already done this, I'll
        take advantage of the fact:
