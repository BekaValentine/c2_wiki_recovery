        It seems that the rhythm to developing software in XP marches to a beat marking <a href="TwoWeeks.html">TwoWeeks</a>.  What is magic about <a href="TwoWeeks.html">TwoWeeks</a>?

           Nobody can estimate anything with any accuracy of duration greater than <a href="TwoWeeks.html">TwoWeeks</a>.

           How wrong can you be in <a href="TwoWeeks.html">TwoWeeks</a>?

        I tried <a href="OneWeek.html">OneWeek</a> instead of <a href="TwoWeeks.html">TwoWeeks</a> in a project recently, and I think <a href="OneWeek.html">OneWeek</a> is just too short for useful stories to emerge. We ended up tacking simpler stories first since they fit the week boundary, instead of the riskier ones.
