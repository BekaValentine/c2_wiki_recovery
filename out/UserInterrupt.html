        User Interrupt

        This page did not exist, so I will throw some thoughts at it. I believe it should exist.

        A user interrupt occurs when the user decides to do something other than the intended design of the current active process. Commonly this would be a decision to abandon the current activity.  In any interactive process, where a user is in control (or another task), there is always the potential for the user to decide not to continue, or to escape. There are many mechanisms out there to handle the potential for process abandonment, other potentially terminal conditions, or interrupt-specific action to continue.

        One would think that would be a fine place to name a few of the more common ones. I can name two: signal handlers (Unix style) and asynchronous exceptions. The ability to continue <em>as well as</em> abandon operation after such an interrupt is often desirable independently of the behavior being interrupted - a fact that needs consideration in the language design.
