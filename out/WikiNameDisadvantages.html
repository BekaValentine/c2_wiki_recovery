        Well... Wikis don't lend themselves to discussing single words, or rather, ideas that are single words. For instance, take the programming language Ruby. It's probably under <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>; but I'm not a fan of post fixing like that... People say Ruby, not Ruby Language.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that clarifies the topic, so you know that it's Ruby, the computer language, as opposed to Ruby, the person, or Ruby the operating System, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also offers some extra search advantages; if one person is interested in computer languages in general, he could search for Language, and find Ruby.

        Although I aspire to be famous as just "Ward", and I have made some progress at this as google will report (<a href="http://google.com/search?q=ward),">http://google.com/search?q=ward),</a> on this site I begrudgingly qualify my given name with my family name so as to meet stringent naming rules of my own design. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
