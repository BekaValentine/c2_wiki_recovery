        Personal Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        Over the years, you have developed a personal practice or design structure that you have successfully used on at least three separate projects.  You benefit from writing this practice in pattern form and giving it a name.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have not yet seen others use this practice.  But this may only be because they, too, have yet to post it...
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there a good way to share or notate this personal practice on Wiki without implying that it is already a timeless industry best practice?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        How about calling it a <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> instead of a Pattern?
      </p>
      <p>
        I kind of like <a href="PersonalPattern.html">PersonalPattern</a>. Says what it means.
