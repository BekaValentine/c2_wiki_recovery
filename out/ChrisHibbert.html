        I learned <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> when I worked at <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a>.  I've been working in Java (and occasionally E) since I gave up on C++ in the early 90s.

        From 1994 to 2002 I worked at Agorics, Inc., a consulting company specializing in Security and Electronic Commerce.  I worked as a project manager, architect, designer, and team leader.  In 1998 and 1999 I managed a team building servers that processed electronic checks for banks.  That code ran in Bank Boston and Nations Bank.  More recently, I managed the development of GuardPoste, an email server that handled encryption and decryption of mail as a gateway.  This made it possible for people to exchange email with others regardless of which encryption standard the correspondent supported, and the users inside the company's LAN didn't have to deal with encryption keys at all.  This software was sold to <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> in 2003.

        In 2004, I did some consulting in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.  Since then I have been developing Zocalo (<a href="http://zocalo.sourceforge.net)">http://zocalo.sourceforge.net)</a> <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software for PredictionMarkets.
