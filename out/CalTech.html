        Cal Tech
      </h1>
      <p>
        Nickname for the California Institute of Technology.

        Little college (1500 students, almost as many staff) chock-a-block full of smart people and leaders in their fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        In astronomy, for example, Caltech runs not one, but <em>many</em> world class observatories, including Palomar, Keck (jointly with UC), OVRO and a sub-mm telescope (I think jointly with U Hawaii).

        Anecdote: My wife, who is Australian, wanted to get a Commonwealth scholarship to go to CIT. The bureaucrat told her they didn't give money for people to go to the <em>mere institutes</em>, only real universities. She retorted that <a href="CalTech.html">CalTech</a> had more Nobel laureates on staff than Australia had ever produced in its history. She got the money. :-)

        <em>Reminds me of a tale I heard at a Stanford graduation ceremony (it wasn't me graduating from Stanford).  Seems some parents looking for a good college to send the kids to were considering Stanford--but balked when they heard it was a "junior university".  (The full name of Stanford is Leland Stanford Jr. University--that is, a university named after one Leland Stanford Jr.)</em>
