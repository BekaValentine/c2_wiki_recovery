      <p>
        Nick Argall is a programmer at Pracom Ltd, a telecommunications carrier in Australia.

      <p>
        He programs mostly in <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a>, although he also does a bit of Java and a lot of Database.  Often thinks of joining a user group or something similar, but having a wife and two very small kids limits this considerably.

        One of those really painful people with an opinion on everything :)
