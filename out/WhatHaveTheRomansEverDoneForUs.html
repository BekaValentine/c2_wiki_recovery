        What Have The Romans Ever Done For Us
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Reg:</strong> They've bled us white, the bastards. They've taken everything we had, not just from us, from our fathers and from our fathers' fathers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stan:</strong> And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reg:</strong> Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stan:</strong> And from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reg:</strong> All right, Stan. Don't labour the point. And what have they ever given us <em>in return</em>? <em>(he pauses smugly)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Xerxes:</strong> The aqueduct?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reg:</strong> What?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Xerxes:</strong> The aqueduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reg:</strong> Oh yeah, yeah they gave us that. Yeah. That's true.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Masked Commando:</strong> And the sanitation!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stan:</strong> Oh yes ... sanitation, Reg, you remember what the city used to be like.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reg:</strong> All right, I'll grant you that the aqueduct and the sanitation are two things that the Romans <em>have</em> done ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Matthias:</strong> And the roads ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reg:</strong> <em>(sharply)</em> Well <em>yes obviously</em> the roads ... the roads go without saying. But apart from the aqueduct, the sanitation and the roads ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Another Masked Commando:</strong> Irrigation ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Other Masked Voices:</strong> Medicine ... Education ... Health
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reg:</strong> Yes ... all right, fair enough ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Commando Nearer The Front:</strong> And the wine ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>General Audience:</strong> Oh yes! True!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Francis:</strong> Yeah. That's something we'd really miss if the Romans left, Reg.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Masked Commando At Back:</strong> Public baths!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stan:</strong> <em>And</em> it's safe to walk in the streets at night now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Francis:</strong> Yes, they certainly know how to keep order ...
        <em>(general nodding)</em> ... let's face it, they're the only ones who could in a place like this. <em>(more general murmurs of agreement)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reg:</strong> All right ... all right ... but apart from better sanitation and medicine and education and irrigation and public health and roads and a freshwater system and baths and public order ... what <em>have</em> the Romans done for <em>us</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Xerxes:</strong> Brought peace!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reg:</strong> <em>(very angry, he's not having a good meeting at all)</em> What!? Oh ... <em>(scornfully)</em> Peace, yes ... shut up!
      </p>
