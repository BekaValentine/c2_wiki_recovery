        Production Rule

      <p>
        The <a href="ProductionRule.html">ProductionRule</a> pattern adds some power and reuse to  <a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/wikic/wikic?InterpreterPattern.">http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/wikic/wikic?InterpreterPattern.</a> [[<a href="InterpreterPattern.html">InterpreterPattern</a>?]]

        <em>Doesn't seem to be any mention of </em><a href="ProductionRule.html">ProductionRule</a> there<em></em>
      </p>

        There are two main improvements.  First, it turns out that you
        can create new production rules as
        as objects (instead of as classes). This means that in five programming
        statements you can define
        a language that has five grammar rules.  Powerful!
      </p>
      <p>
        The second
        improvement is the use of application-specific Stackers instead
        of visitors.
        Stackers are helpers that get plugged into production rules.  When
        you write a production rule, you can hand it a Stacker that does
        whatever you want to have happen when the rule fires.  For example,
        if you're parsing an HTML file, when you see some <BOLD> stuff, you
        can have a stacker set the text style to be bold.

        I've written this up in more detail in an article that I'm hoping will show
        up in Java Report in a few months.  If you're aching to know more
        and can't wait, drop me a note at Steve dot Metsker@acm dot org.
