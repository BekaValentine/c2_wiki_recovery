        Weird Error Messages
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here are some weird error messages and the mistakes that cause them.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In the mid-1980s I worked for a company that had licensed the source code for the 4.2BSD-derived Sun-3 kernel. One of us noticed the following in the VM system:
      </p>
      <code>
        panic("Shannon and Bill say this can't happen.");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        To the best of my knowledge it never did, though.
      </p>

        Around 1980, I worked at the European Space Centre in Darmstadt Germany. The Director always insisted on doing demos for visitors himself and always ended up down a path that should not be visited except for maintenance. The senior developer then always quietly dug him out and set him up where he should have been. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When the director left, the Senior developer added in a message at this point which said "That F***er Bill Bloggs is driving this system down a dead end again." 
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, the Director had gone to Paris, to become the Director of the whole of ESRO. As such, he now entertained visitors at the highest level only. So when he brought one to Darmstadt, he insisted on the usual. The visitor was very impressed, because it seemed to know the Director's name, despite the fact he was using someone else's login.

        I remember working on a DEC PDP-10 in the 70s, using its text editor, TECO. Creating a file was done using the "make" directive. The author of TECO dated him/herself by responding to:
      </p>
      <code>
        make love<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        with:
      </p>
      <code>
        not war?<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The classic UNIX examples:
      </p>
      <code>
        %make love<br/>
        cannot make love.  stop.<br/>
        %got a light?<br/>
        no match<br/>
        %^what is saccharine                          <em>(not sure if I'm spelling that right?)</em><br/>
        bad substitute<br/>
        %man: why did you get a divorce?<br/>
        man:: too many arguments<br/>
        %sh<br/>
        $"how would you rate Bush's incompetence<br/>
        Unmatched "<br/>

        <strong>OPE ILLEGAL FILE NAME</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Literally this means that an illegal file name was passed to the CDC6000 system. (OPE is the program that handles opening files.) In fact it means that a Fortran subroutine was called with one too many arguments and that the extra argument was a floating point number between .25 and .5. The exponent field of such numbers just happen to spell "OPE" in CDC display code so when the Fortran subroutine linkage code wrote the excess argument into word zero (indirecting through a zero pointer) the operating system interpreted the number as a request to run the OPE routine.

        I was always a fan of "Error: An error has occurred." But a <a href="DouglasAdams.html">DouglasAdams</a> sort of laugh came over me when I read, "Error: No error."

      <p>
        A variation seen recently in a Windows app: "Error: The operation completed successfully."

        <dd><em>The Windows thing can be partially explained. When a function fails it returns an invalid result such as INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE. Then you're supposed to </em>immediately<em> call GetLastError to get the error code, then call FormatMessage to produce it as text. You can then put the text in a MessageBox. However, if you accidentally allow any Win32 call to intervene between the failed function call and GetLastError, and the intervening function does not err, then GetLastError will return ERROR_SUCCESS, which means there was no error, and FormatMessage will return "The operation completed successfully." So the bug is, that somebody allowed a win32 function call to intervene between the failed function and GetLastError.</em> -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a></dd>

        <dd><em>This actually can happen for real as well - there are API functions I've run across that will return failure but, in some cases, don't </em>SetLastError. Another somewhat common cause is when people a generic error routine is called, which displays an error message using GetLastError, when the actual error was in DirectX or COM or something which doesn't SetLastError but instead expects you to use the return value as the error code.<em></em></dd>

        A fellow programmer once showed me a fatal error dialog in his application. It said something like, "Fatal error, cannot save. All work will be lost." with the typical "OK" button. After I jokingly remarked that it was not the least bit OK, he changed the button to read "Oh, well."

        That reminds me of the error I used to get in MSDOS 6 with DoubleSpaced drives:
        "Disk full error reading from drive C". <em>Reading?</em> -- <a href="DanBarlow.html">DanBarlow</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That one's not too surprising - </em>DoubleSpace works by compressing files you haven't used in a while, and decompressing them when you want to access them. So what's happening is that there wasn't enough space left to decompress the file so that you could read it. -- <a href="GavinLambert.html">GavinLambert</a><em></em>

        My (<a href="JoelNeely.html">JoelNeely</a>) personal "favorite" error story comes from the COBOL compiler on a Honeywell 200-series computer used for exercises in a computer programming class I taught in the early 70s - yes, I'm dating myself horribly! (As an aside, that computer also supported the administrative functions of the school and all of the programming classes, with only 8K characters [!] of memory, a far cry from current environments that require one or two thousand times that much just to boot.)
      </p>
      <p>
        After placing the source deck in the card reader, mounting three scratch tapes and bootstrapping the compiler from the remaining tape drive (octal keys, hard boot of the CPU... the whole nine yards), the system slurped the entire source deck, spun tapes, blinked lights, and then produced a one-line compiler printout:
      </p>
      <code>
        "FATAL ERROR: Missing division or section name."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Of course, this required manual inspection of the entire source deck to try to locate the little card that wasn't there! You other greybeards will remember the trick of tilting the deck and riffling the top edges to expose the "interpreted" (printed, eye-readable) content of each card just below the top edge. In this case, all appeared correct. After several inspections and re-attempts to compile, we concluded that there must be a registration mismatch between the cards and the card reader (a not-unheard-of phenomenon in those days). After reproducing the entire deck on a nearby deluxe Univac electronic interpreting reader/keypunch, we got the same error message. One more tilt-and-riffle exposed A BLANK CARD in the deck - the missing section name!
      </p>
      <p>
        The root cause was found to be a previous reproduction of the entire deck on a faulty device that had interpreted (printed on) that card, but failed to punch any holes in it.

        A great one is from back when Netcom had their own client software to get on the net. When browsing the web through their browser one would sometimes be presented with the "Oops. You're screwed." dialog box, containing just an "OK" button. Clicking "OK" killed the client, your connection, and most often the computer.

        Then there's the famous two error messages in the Unix V6 implementation of ed
      </p>
      <p>
        Error message "?" (just the question mark) meant you did something wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Error message "?io" (just those 3 characters) meant there was an I/O error and your data was probably lost (typically something simple like a disk being full).

        Another set of error messages that were interesting were the Rand MH mail system "this program is broken and should not have gotten here" error messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were two I remember. "Horse Puckey" and "Banana Pancakes". When I asked BruceBorden (main author of MH) about these, he said that this was because a more boring "contact your system support staff" message would be ignored by the user. Having a strange error message meant that he was much more likely to hear about it.

      <p>
        <strong>You don't exist. Go away.</strong>
      </p>

        The ODBC driver for Windows sometimes gives the "Member not found" error message. Cryptic, but the real fun starts in Polish localized version - the otherwise correct translation is ambiguous and is usually first understood as "Penis not found".

        I was involved in writing some help text for some software running on an IBM AS/400. When a user pressed F1, they got application-specific help. When they pressed F1 from the help display, they got help about how to use the help display itself. If they then pressed F1 a third time, they simply got the following message:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You are beyond help.</strong>

        Disastrous - now that's what I call a severity level! I suppose the usual 'fatal' or 'critical' wasn't ...severe... enough.

        The web itself, considered as an application has prawned a wondrous of variety of error messages in the form of the 404 page missing facility. See <a href="http://www.plinko.net/404/">http://www.plinko.net/404/</a> for a good collection of them.

        In an earlier Visual <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> there was an error message I don't recall exactly the error number, but it was something like that:
        "Error 2017 while trying to report Error 2017"
      </p>

        I just found this one while playing with PVX Plus:
        "Error #12: File does not exist (or already exists)"
        Well, it's quite a challenge to overcome this one :-)

        PHP expects T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Pa'am</em> is Hebrew for "time", as in "occurence or iteration".  <em>Pa'amayim</em> is the dual form (Hebrew has singular, dual, and plural), hence, "two times" or simply "twice".  <em>Nekudah</em> means "dot".  <em>Nekudatayim</em> is likewise "two dots".  (Note:  It is misspelled as <em>"nekudotayim"</em>, probably out of confusion with the plural, <em>nekudot</em>).  <em>Pa'amayim nekudatayim</em> means "twice two dots"--the double colon ("::"), which in <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a> (and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>) is the scope resolution operator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why Hebrew?  Because Zend, along with several key PHP devs, are Israeli.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is this a weird error message?  Because it's misspelled, dumdum!
