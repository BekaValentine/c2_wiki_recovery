      <p>
        Writer, revolutionary and artist. He is is infamous in European, particularly British, counter-culture as a media prankster, although he has also made his mark in America and Canada. He is reknowned as something of a scholar with what can appear to be an encyclopaedic range of knowledge, particularly of esoteric literature, avant-garde art movements, original British punk rock bands, the minutiae of disputes and feuds between obscure political sects, and the whole of Hegel's 'Aesthetics'. All of these interests inform and expand his prolific publishing history across fiction and non-fiction.
