        Itemized Clear Logic
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ItemizedClearLogic.html">ItemizedClearLogic</a> is a working definition that describe a layout for semi-formal logic so it's easier to digest and avoids or reduces the confusion inherent in English.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rough pseudo-example:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           All men are Socrates
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           All Socrates are birds
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Therefore all birds are men per the Foobian logic rule on #1 and #2
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        All statements are uniquely numbered or labelled (ID's). Any transformation of prior statements into a new statement require both the ID's of the "operand" statements and the source or name of the transformation being done (operator). Only one new statement is allowed per ID, and only one logic operator per ID.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one doesn't recall what a rule is, such as The Foobian Logic Rule, they can google it. Foobian is fake for the example, by the way. Don't google it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the numbered items are not intended to be steps in an experiment, such as "first, pour liquid X in flask B". In some cases, such steps may overlap with "logic" steps, however.

           Yes, I only argue with myself. Some non-person quibbled about the example.

           As per above, it's a "pseudo-example". It uses made-up operators. All overly-literal people are birds :-)

        I suggest you review the rules for the Foobian Logic Rule. -t

        <em>You're the one who said that there is no Foobian logic rule to review, so I defaulted to actual logic. Actual logic states that "All men are birds" follows from premises #1 and #2, but not "all birds are men". There can be birds that are not Socrates, and Socrates that are not men. Maybe in Wackyland, it follows that "all birds are men" from #1 and #2, but I don't live there. Do you?</em> --<a href="RobMandeville.html">RobMandeville</a>

        You forgot this rule:

        realShit + fakeShit = fakeShit (or at least tainted shit)<br/>

        <strong>You guys are feeding the troll again.</strong> C'mon, when is this going to stop? Why is it Wikizens insist on arguing with top as if he's an actual contributor, and not a 'bot noise generator with a faulty logic circuit? [cough]

      <p>
        You need skeptics, not <em>just</em> contributors. --top
