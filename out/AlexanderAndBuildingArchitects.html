        Alexander And Building Architects
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> has himself noted that his ideas seem to have had more influence outside architecture than within it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's what a couple of practicing architects had to say about CA when asked:
      </p>
      <p>
        One from New York, USA, said this,

        <dd><em>sprinkle of  Zen and Fung-shui.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        and added this telling comparison,
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>You may also want to consider the work of Buckminster Fuller</em> </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>as an [source of ideas] whose influence on built form is noticeable</em> </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>by its absence</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        and one from Ontario, Canada, said
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>[a] Californian who has worked with CA mentioned that the best</em></dd>

        <dd><em>thing that one could do with A Pattern Language is to blow it</em> </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>up with a stick of dynamite.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        And, a few years ago, a top-of-the-class student at one of the best schools of architecture in the UK, when asked, claimed maybe to have heard of CA. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

      <p>
        A British architect and Wiki writer comments:
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a particularly extreme (determinist) view of design put forward in '<a href="NotesOnTheSynthesisOfForm.html">NotesOnTheSynthesisOfForm</a>' and maybe Alexander's 'refutation' of this was reasonable. (I initially typed that as 'Notes on 'a' synthesis of form', a title that would imply many/several syntheses are possible....)
      </p>
      <p>
        As for <a href="BuckminsterFuller.html">BuckminsterFuller</a> having 'little influence on built form' that is pretty ridiculous: viz the work of Architects Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, Michael Hopkins (ie the whole 'Hi-tech priesthood!), even early Jim Stirling: all greatly inspired by the visionary American inventor/designer's ideas and, indeed, his personality.

        That's a valuable observation Martin, I hadn't thought of the HiTech folks as being the new Bucky(s), but now that you've said it, it makes some sense. - KB

      </p>
      <p>
        Are you suggesting that there are Big M methodologies in Architecture that are preventing CA's ideas coming to fruition? (Built) Architecture certainly is rife with "schools" and personality cults. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Having watched part of a UK architecture education at fairly close quarters I can't say I had any sense of anything we in software would recognize as a methodology being taught. Conversely, you could lose credit in assessments by producing a perfectly "adequate" design that just happened to conflict with the lecturers school of though. Of course, you could also get extra credit for really going out on a limb, but only once per term, it seemed. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

      <p>
        Which part of UK Architectural education did you see at 'close quarters'?

        My first degree was at Heriot-Watt and I was for a while close friends with an architecture undergrad there (in the 2nd and 3rd years, if I remember correctly). -- KB

      <p>
        Could you explain what Big M means please? -- <a href="MartinNoutch.html">MartinNoutch</a>

        I had the opportunity to design my own house from scratch and ended up using 45 of CA's patterns. If you're interested, you can read more on my page - <a href="RichardPawson.html">RichardPawson</a> - I'd love to hear from others who've done similar.
