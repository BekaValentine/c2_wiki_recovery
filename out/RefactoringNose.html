        Refactoring Nose
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="RefactoringNose.html">RefactoringNose</a> is a common idea brewing on the xpdeveloper website:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.xpdeveloper.com/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?">http://www.xpdeveloper.com/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic idea is that refactoring tools are here that can do the refactorings if we agree to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we need the same or new refactoring tools that can suggest refactorings in the first place. I see these tools as Ant tasks which when combined with a <a href="CruiseControl.html">CruiseControl</a> -esque ModificationSet can check the code that has changed against the entire codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        This would have a couple of benefits. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first benefit would be a time saver for the duplication spotting. I think of refactoring as creative destruction of duplication in code, and most of the time the duplications are pretty simple at the outset. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The refactorings I start to see later may be more complicated (too complicated for a tool to spot maybe), but the point is that the seed for these is always something simple which should be spotted by a tool. Most of the time I refactor code that I have not written to get it into shape. A tool like this would allow me to spot the areas needing work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second benefit would be that refactorings over large projects would become possible. I have experienced scenarios where two teams develop the same frameworks that are well refactored within, but did not/could not communicate across the teams and so the frameworks do a lot of the same sorts of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="RefactoringNose.html">RefactoringNose</a> would nip this in the bud if it was part of a continuous integration cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do other people think about this? I think that this is where Refactoring HAS to go to become scalable across the enterprise.

        You'll be interested in <em>Automated support for program refactoring using invariants</em> (<a href="http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/~mernst/pubs/invariants-refactor-abstract.html),">http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/~mernst/pubs/invariants-refactor-abstract.html),</a> then.  -- <a href="DavidSaff.html">DavidSaff</a>

      <p>
        A new automated duplication-finding tool, <a href="DupTective.html">DupTective</a>, could be useful as part of an automated build system: every time a set of changes is checked in, they could be evaluated for duplication of existing code.  For efficiency, <a href="DupTective.html">DupTective</a> could be extended to search for duplication <em>only</em> inside a given list of files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <a href="DupTective.html">DupTective</a> fits the "smell" metaphor: it can tell you which regions of code reek of duplication, but not exactly what other parts they're duplicating.
