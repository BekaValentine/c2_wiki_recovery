        Follow Instincts And Resist Urges
      </h1>
      <p>
        In software development, as in life, often we have a conflict between the short-term urge to do things (like declaring a fixed-sized buffer) to save time or effort, and the instincts we have developed over the years that remind us why it's a bad idea. Often we give into the urges and ignore our instincts. They may both feel "right" at the time, but the simpler way is often to follow the urge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Resist your urges, they are usually a bad idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow your instincts, you developed them to protect yourself.

        How do you tell the difference? <em>The urge makes your life easier now. The instinct makes your life easier later</em>

        I hate to be a <a href="LanguageLawyer.html">LanguageLawyer</a>, but instincts are not developed, you are born with them.  Perhaps a better phrase would be FollowYourConscience.

        Well, until we can agree on where instincts come from, and if humans have instincts at all (some say we don't), I'll stick with instinct - I agree it might not be the perfect word, but until they solve the first two problems we won't get a better word.

        <em>Could one say that the 'instinct' in this case is to do the thing that you know will hurt less in the long run?  Or is that too much of a stretch / too general? --cwillu</em>
