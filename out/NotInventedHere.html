        A company, to establish its position in the industry pecking-order, might ignore Library X, created by an inferior company. The dominant company might then waste internal resources building Library Z'. It has many of the same features as X, and might overlook the features that truly made X superior to Z'. That company might then promote Library Z' as "the One True Library, as invented by The Worlds Greatest Software Company".

        In fairness NIH diagnosis is often confounded by modern patent issues. Often NIH is an existential threat to the existence of a company if the alternatives are owned by competitors. More over if you intend to extend the X above you may find that you do need to re-invent, is it not better to do so up front, instead of bolting on a non-solution. Even if X will eventually dominate attempting to invent X' is an essential component of the free market at work which may in fact help keep X from becoming  to entrenched to  soon . Would we have Windows if there was no OS2? Was windows a example of Microsoft NIH? What of Mac OS ? Should they give up or does Apples existence help force Microsoft to keep 'innovating'. Please no flame wars about APPLE v MS my point is that NIH is only an Antipatern if your only reason for not adopting it is that you have a staff that needs the work. --<a href="MarcGrundfest.html">MarcGrundfest</a>

        I think you could well describe the company that I work for as a <a href="WheelFactory.html">WheelFactory</a>; we've spent the last 10 years writing our own versions of things that already exist. Our stated reason for doing so is that the standard thing isn't <em>quite</em> what we want, or it has some bugs. But then we go and write our own thing that has different bugs and different limitations, except that in addition to it being crappy, it sucks away our own development time as we are forced to maintain it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that's not news; every <a href="WheelFactory.html">WheelFactory</a> does that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The really weird thing is that within the product team individual developers will write a module that someone else already wrote. This is done with little apology, and no-one talks about it. (I've even done it myself.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this happens because developers are <em>afraid</em> to learn how to use someone else's module. They fear that they might not be able to figure it out, and so instead of trying they just dismiss the past work ("That's cryptic crap! My thing will be much better!") and start again in the name of <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> or <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a>. But then it's not better, and if they'd taken the time to understand the thing they were replacing, maybe they wouldn't have decided that it needed replacing in the first place. But they won't evaluate the results of their work unfavorably, because it's their work and they at least understand it better than what someone else wrote.

        "Not invented here" can mean not originally designed for the use to which you would now have me bend it. Or not designed with our problem domain in mind. Or their square peg not wanted on our round hole project.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this situation, though, the term "Not invented here" doesn't really apply, as there are two distinct inventions, not one invention recreated independently by two inventors.

        One possible defense of <a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a> practices is this: sometimes the knowledge of how to write the code is more valuable than the code itself (or its results). In that case, writing the code from scratch is the surest way to formulate and test your knowledge of how to write the code. -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a>

      <p>
        So then it appears that many developers do not like to write about their design and code ideas in <a href="PlainEnglish.html">PlainEnglish</a> (for fear of what?), but they like to rewrite their ideas about an already implemented system in code, and apparently for the same reason that one might write in <a href="PlainEnglish.html">PlainEnglish</a> (to find out what one thinks).

        <em>Few programmers know how to refactor their code. Without refactoring, you don't have the ability to put new knowledge into an already implemented system.</em>

        Most programmers would rather write programs than write <em>about</em> programs. Expressing ideas in code rather than in <a href="PlainEnglish.html">PlainEnglish</a> has many benefits, including formality and the ability to run and test the code and compare it to the other implementation. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        I have often intentionally reinvented other people's modules. It's one of several critical evaluation strategies that I use to determine whether a module really performs as advertised (in some cases, the reinvented module can be used to regression-test the original module). While I familiarize myself with the existing module, I develop a parallel implementation with an emphasis on the exact tasks I require the module to perform. Sometimes, the parallel implementation never leaves my brain, but it nonetheless exists. The total time spent in this fashion ranges from minutes to hours, but never more than one work day: after at most one day, one of the following should occur:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The replacement module under development gets sufficiently near completion that it turns out to be better (whatever "better" happens to mean in the specific situation). This tends to happen only in trivial cases, but this case is often useful to illustrate to non-technical people (managers mostly) who have been begun to believe some of the more outrageous lies told by people who sell code modules. If it takes an hour to rewrite (and test, and demonstrate) the code, it's probably not worth $500, let alone $50,000; if we'd have to rewrite our software license to use it, then somebody had better be paying us to even look at it.
        </li>
        <li>
           The replacement module project heads toward some kind of disaster (<em>Hey, this is harder than it looks!</em>), and it is quickly abandoned. Interestingly enough, this case does not always result in choosing the existing module that the replacement is supposed to replace - sometimes, it becomes obvious that anything like this module must be avoided at all costs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I often work with the special case of security software, where it is necessary to prove to my peers that the code implements some security policy. In that environment, if I used someone else's code, I'd have to read and completely understand (and defend!) the entire code anyway, so using other people's code doesn't actually save a whole lot of effort. -- <a href="ZygoBlaxell.html">ZygoBlaxell</a>

        I was brought in on a project around December 2001 at the behest of a large consulting conglomerate (they're having legal troubles now - hint, hint, wink, wink). My duty was to implement, in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> 6, a COM component that interfaced with <a href="FileNet.html">FileNet</a> for use by their ASP developers; they, of course, were in a <em>different</em> group. The excruciatingly painful part of this project was that the IvoryTowerArchitect was flown in and <em>insisted</em> that all COM objects must accept and return a single String - of XML. Never mind that I was wrapping an <em>already existing</em> COM object model - FileNET - that, quite frankly, wasn't that bad to begin with. No, on top of this stupidity, I was going to wrap the wrapper in an XML interface because, to quote their oh-so-great architect, "This is the way the industry is going. XML will provide complete flexibility."
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to explain to them that their ASP developers: a) understood COM and could use it quite easily, b) didn't really understand XML or XSLT. They didn't hear me. In the end, I wrote <em>the entire ASP application</em> that interfaced to my wrapper of a wrapper because the ASP developers they'd hired couldn't cope.

        This was a blatant instance of <a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a>, but for different reasons.

        In my experience, <a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a> often means 'I refuse to take responsibility for the decision to use something I don't completely understand and which I might get blamed for later if it fails.' In other words, it's a way to PassTheBuck.

        PassTheBuck? It sounds like the reasoning you're describing is, "If I am going to take responsibility for this decision, I am not going to make a decision I believe may be overly risky or wrong.". That's not evading responsibility, that's <em>taking</em> it.

        To the derogatory comments about tribalism on this page: to quote myself, "It's easy to be dogmatic when you're right and everyone else is an idiot." Some tribes are at least partially justified in building things from scratch, considering that they have had success in the past with their own code and failure in the past with third-party components. This may lead them to make the wrong decisions about projects with circumstances different from the ones they're used to, but it's not an entirely ignorant or bigoted decision, it's just their best guess.

        In my experience the real tribes are the WeShouldBuildIt tribe and the WeShouldBuyIt tribe. Depending on the organization and the context of a project, one is right and the other is wrong, but that doesn't matter: they always say the same thing. If the project succeeds, whichever tribe won control early on will laud the victory and claim it is an example that their view is always right. If the project fails, the other tribe will pooh-pooh the failure and demonstrate how it failed just like all projects that did not do it their way. However, learning rarely happens and almost always, the same people will be saying the same things in the next project, regardless of the outcome.

        Come to think of it, that's probably a more general antipattern, reminiscent of <a href="PixieDust.html">PixieDust</a>, but "<a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a>" is a catch-phrase that I have heard associated with it quite a lot.

        What I've learned so far: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The vendor relationships, support availability and responsiveness are at least as important as the product itself and often far more.
        </li>
        <li>
           Nearly all complex integrations will require an enhancement or fix from the vendor, or a workaround.
        </li>
        <li>
           avoid ThirdParty non-open-source solutions: we can never figure out what they're <em>really</em> doing
        </li>
        <li>
           building it ourselves is will take us further than we might expect
        </li>
        <li>
           do not to let ThirdParty classes and interfaces permeate the code. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Keep them confined to one package and hopefully only a few classes. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Wrap them in a pluggable interface, at least.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           our future needs really <strong>aren't</strong> what we expect
        </li>
        <li>
           switching from one solution to another is very expensive regardless
        </li>
        <li>
           we never have this discussion when there's an obviously superior answer
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The most obvious examples I've worked with have been O-R database mapping tools, functional testing frameworks, and Web application presentation layers. It's really tough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any framework that I could buy (or obtain as <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a>) usually is designed to solve much bigger problems that what I have. In order to address our simple needs today, the development team may have to learn a complex product which isn't tuned for solving the simple problems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if we build it ourselves, it is easy today, but in the future we can easily imagine it growing in weight and complexity until it is every bit as hard to wrap one's brain around as the ThirdParty solution, and maybe isn't as good because it was built by people who are not experts in that domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is in these <a href="BuildOrBuy.html">BuildOrBuy</a> discussions that I feel we are most confronted with <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>. Because the cost of changing usually is very high, we are inclined to avoid our best practices and design for the future. We should notice that we're doing this, and do our best to keep the code extra clean around ThirdParty software in order to hopefully keep the cost of switching down. Unfortunately, it isn't always easy to see where we've become tightly bound to the solution or how to keep our integration with that solution flexible. Often, it isn't until we're really suffering and want to switch to something else that we see where we've gone astray.

        This is an interesting discussion. I think <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a> designs their APIs in a way that aids these type of <a href="BuildOrBuy.html">BuildOrBuy</a> decisions. They usually have both a "basic" and a "complete" API surrounding a particular technology. The Basic API is designed to be easy to use, so you can make a quick prototype and meet the common-case requirements. This API wraps the Complete API, which exposes all the available options and techniques for using the technology. The particular example I have in mind is the <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a> movie API.  The Basic movie API allows one to create a basic movie player in a half dozen screenfuls of code, using calls that take few parameters.  The Complete API then exposes alternate transport mechanisms, large structures full of options, fine control over event handling, etc. Other library vendors would do well to follow this multi-tier API model.
