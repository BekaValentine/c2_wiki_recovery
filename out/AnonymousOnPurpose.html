        Anonymous On Purpose
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> used to identify one who chooses to contribute to a page without overtones or emotional baggage which might be associated with a unknown, known, famous or an infamous name. This may be said to be the norm for contributions in an <a href="EgolessWiki.html">EgolessWiki</a>. In fact as Ward has stated in many places, anonymous contributions are entirely appropriate, either in the case of original contributions or in the case of adding to a contribution or contributions made by others. This <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> is not usually needed, but can be useful in the special condition when one insists on a poster showing his courage or confidence in what he says by "signing his works". It just isn't necessary. Point them to this page by signing -- <a href="AnonymousOnPurpose.html">AnonymousOnPurpose</a>.
      </p>

        Other anonymous signatures, with arguments and reasons for an anonymous contribution:

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that the <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a> mechanism no longer allows anonymity through the use of a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie. This greatly reduces the benefits of using the <a href="AnonymousOnPurpose.html">AnonymousOnPurpose</a> user name. If signing work on a page, consider using <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a> instead.

        Something to think about here:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>To A Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing</strong> 
      </p>
      <code>
        Now all the truth is out,<br/>
        Be secret and take defeat<br/>
        From any brazen throat,<br/>
        For how can you compete,<br/>
        Being honour bred, with one<br/>
        Who, were it proved he lies,<br/>
        Were neither shamed in his own<br/>
        Nor in his neighbours' eyes?<br/>
        Bred to a harder thing<br/>
        Than Triumph, turn away<br/>
        And like a laughing string<br/>
        Whereon mad fingers play<br/>
        Amid a place of stone,<br/>
        Be secret and exult,<br/>
        Because of all things known<br/>
        That is most difficult.<br/>
      </code>
