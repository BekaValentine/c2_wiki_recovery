        <em>Is the referred-to "bug" the fact that 0.1 is not exactly representable in IEEE 754 floating point?  One could argue that the program is behaving correctly...</em>

        There's an old programming proverb to the effect that "all programs have at least one bug and at least one redundant instruction". Iteratively, then, all programs can be reduced to a single instruction that doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>abort() ???</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A friend has a story that illustrates the truth of this. Somewhere in an IBM mainframe OS (I don't know which one), there was a module that contained but a single instruction (it was a privilege-switching module). It was like that for several years. Eventually, a circumstance was discovered when it didn't work, and a bug report was raised. So the one instruction program did indeed have a bug. Apparently it's 13 instructions now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>From the context, there's every reason to think that this was a </em>'hardware<em>' bug, and that the extra dozen instructions were a work-around, not a fix for a software bug.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There's another IBM mainframe story, to the effect that someone wanted to write a program that did nothing, so they wrote one that said 
      </p>
      <code>
        BR    15 <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then someone pointed out that it should really say 
      </p>
      <code>
        BR    14<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (because programs are usually called using a BALR 14,15).  Then someone else pointed out that the return code (in register 15) was unpredictable, so it would be better to write
      </p>
      <code>
        SR    15,15<br/>
        BR    14<br/>
      </code>
