      <p>
        However, the similarity is not pretty obvious to most people, which is
        the point. The two expressions have the same *inner* syntax. That
        difference which is obvious is the surface syntax, or read syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you say ``syntax<em> to a Lisp programmer, she understands that to be</em>
        the tree structure. The parentheses, or <a href="InfixNotation.html">InfixNotation</a> or whatever are
        just the read syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can write an abstract syntax tree for the C++ notation like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        +<br/>
        x  *<br/>
        y z<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Okay, now traverse it in preorder notation, printing the parent first,
        then the children, recursively, and place a parenthesis before each
        parent and after its last child:
      </p>
      <code>
        (+ x (* y z))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Aha!
      </p>
      <code>

      </code>
      <p>
        Are you an experienced Lisp programmer? I'm mildly experienced and I
        don't have any problems.
      </p>
      <code>

      </code>
      <p>
        <a href="InfixNotation.html">InfixNotation</a>s which mimic mathematics work well only when the
        nesting level is not too deep, and the whole thing is written on one
        line. There is no satisfactory way to break infix notations across
        multiple lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, there are issues of precedence. That twelve-year-old has
        gone through several years of hard-wiring to parse multiplication at a
        higher precedence to addition. But throw in some unfamiliar operators,
        and he is stuck. You can always parse the *structure* of Lisp even if
        you don't know the meaning of the utterance due to unfamiliar symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, there are only so many infix operators. When those run out,
        languages with infix expression syntax switch to function call
        notations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lisp's notation is basically same thing as function call notations, but
        with the superfluous commas removed, and the parenthesis moved to the
        left of the function designator to properly enclose the entire call,
        so that (f x y z) is analogous to f(x, y, z).
      </p>
      <p>
        A properly formatted prefix notation can always be read as a sideways
        tree, similar to the layout of a GUI tree control:
      </p>
      <code>
        (and (or (not x)<br/>
        (not y))<br/>
        (not (or (and z<br/>
        w)<br/>
        (and s<br/>
        t))<br/>
        (or a<br/>
        b))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Taking out the parentheses and adding some connecting line segments we
        get:
      </p>
      <code>
        and +-- or  +-- not --- x<br/>
        |       |<br/>
        |       +-- not --- y<br/>
        |<br/>
        +-- not --- or  +-- and +-- z<br/>
        |               |       |<br/>
        |               |       +-- w<br/>
        |               |<br/>
        |               +-- and +-- s<br/>
        |                       |<br/>
        |                       +-- t<br/>
        +-- or  +-- a<br/>
        |<br/>
        +-- b<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        See? Same physical arrangement of symbols as the Lisp expression. You
        can see a sideways tree in the canonically formatted parenthesized
        notation. Moreover, you can mentally ``fold<em> portions of the tree</em>
        that you are momentarily not interested in it, like closing the nodes
        of a GUI tree control. Also note how the above resembles a logic gate
        diagram, albeit with the propagation going right to left. Why do
        digital circuit designers draw pictures rather than spew infix
        expressions?
      </p>
      <p>
        You can't easily see a tree in the <a href="InfixNotation.html">InfixNotation</a>. When it's written
        all on one line, it's a kind of downward-flattening projection of the
        leaves of the syntax tree, which you have to mentally unfold, possibly
        disambiguating by applying rules of precedence, if parentheses have
        been removed. There is no satisfactory way to split infix expressions
        into multiple lines such that a tree structure is apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here it is:
      </p>
      <code>
        (((not x) or (not y)) and (not ((z and w) or (s and t))) and (a or b))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I have not included associativity parentheses to show the left-right
        grouping of the and operator. This is clearly hard to read, and so we
        would like to break it into multiple lines. The question is how? Let's
        try:
      </p>
      <code>
        ((not x) or (not y))<br/>
        and (not ((z and w) or (s and t))<br/>
        and (a or b)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But the first AND clause doesn't line up with the other two. There is
        no obvious tree structure. How about moving the operators to the
        right?
      </p>
      <code>
        ((not x) or (not y)) and<br/>
        (not ((z and w) or (s and t))) and<br/>
        (a or b)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        then apply recursively:
      </p>
      <code>
        ((not x) or<br/>
        (not y)) and<br/>
        (not ((z and w) or<br/>
        (s and t)) and<br/>
        (a or b)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Or maybe write the infix operators on separate lines?
      </p>
      <code>
        ((not x) or (not y))<br/>
        and<br/>
        (not ((z and w) or (s and t)))<br/>
        and<br/>
        (a or b)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Hmm. Recurse into constituents:
      </p>
      <code>
        ((not x)<br/>
        or<br/>
        (not y))<br/>
        and<br/>
        (not ((z and w)<br/>
        or<br/>
        (s and t)))<br/>
        and<br/>
        (a or b)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Forget it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Mathematics actually has a far richer notation than infix; a two
        dimensional one. Only the infix part of it survives into the algebraic
        expression syntaxes of <em>[programming languages]</em>. Also, mathematicians
        invent specialized operators and shorthands for which allow them to
        concisely express the idea of some branch of thought. It's a kind of
        macro-processing, like in Lisp.
