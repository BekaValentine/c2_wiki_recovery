           FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency)--if you believe the militiaistas in the US, this agency (which coordinates disaster relief) is in fact an organization designed to suppress public opposition if and when a coup occurs.  (This particular theory was very common during the Clinton administration--strangely, the militia movement in the US has vanished since Bush was elected.)
        </li>
        <li>
           BATF  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.  A separate paramilitary/police agency (within the US Department of Treasury, not the Department of Justice), primarily concerned with weapons smuggling.  (At one point, bootlegging was the raison d'etre of this organization).  Even more unprofessional than the FBI.
        </li>
        <li>
           BCIS  Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (formerly the INS).  Not true spooks (especially now that the part of the INS that went about rounding up illegal immigrants is now a separate department), but still a royal pain in the ass to deal with.

        In the film version of <em>My Favorite Martian</em>, SETI was portrayed as a spook US government agency, complete with jack-booted machine-gun-waving MenInBlack, and Wallace Shawn as a pre-eminent government scientist. (Inconceiveable!)

        A misinformed person (me) asked: <em>"I don't know much Hebrew, but wouldn't MOSSAD be spelled with three letters? (Since vowels are optional)"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Surprisingly (to me, as I know enough hebrew to read it, but basically zero vocabulary), Mossad (usually used as haMossad, or 'the Mossad') is actually four letters. While it is true that 'vowels are optional' in the general case, both the 'oh' and 'oo' vowels are a special case. Each has two forms; one form which, like other vowels, is optional; and another form which is based on the letter vav (pronounced 'v', of course), adorned with a dot. Mossad, then, uses this second form of the 'oh' sound, so it is written (without vowels) mem-vav-samech-dalet. For more on the Mossad, including where I found this out (from their logo), see <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/world/israel/mossad/.">http://www.fas.org/irp/world/israel/mossad/.</a> For the hebrew alphabet, so you have some idea what I'm talking about, see <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/alephbet.htm.">http://www.jewfaq.org/alephbet.htm.</a> Also... if the Mossad isn't a TLA, does that make them spookier or less spooky than the others? -- <a href="AdamBerger.html">AdamBerger</a> <em>(Thank you Adam!)</em>

        A picture of the Mossad Logo, indeed showing 4 letters:

        <em>You're looking at the second line from the bottom. Remember, Hebrew is read right to left. The first letter is the 'h' of hamossad; after that, you see mvsd.</em>
