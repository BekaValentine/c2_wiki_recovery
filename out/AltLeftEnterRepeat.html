      <p>
        <strong>Alt+Left, Enter, Repeat.</strong>

      <p>
        The dance some people do when they see the <a href="CantOpenWikiDbForUpdate.html">CantOpenWikiDbForUpdate</a> error.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A humble plea: if you find yourself doing this, use some sort of random, increasing backoff. For example, I get <a href="CantOpenWikiDbForUpdate.html">CantOpenWikiDbForUpdate</a>, I hit <a href="AltLeftEnterRepeat.html">AltLeftEnterRepeat</a>, I get the error again; I count to 5 before trying again; I count to 10 before trying yet another time; 20; 40; etc. (The randomness comes from counting, rather than looking at a watch.) -- <a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>

        Other keystrokes that might work better than <strong>Alt+Left, Enter</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Ctrl+R, Enter</strong> -- though this might not work if you have your browser's cache options set to "Check for newer versions of the page: Every time I view the page.". (If you're wondering, the <strong>Enter</strong> is to Ok the "Send form data again?" box.)
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Backspace, Enter</strong> -- though this doesn't work on Netscape.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>F5</strong> -- Why didn't anyone else think of this? <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using Netscape, after Alt+Left, I have to click on SAVE (Enter is ignored). Ctrl+R, Enter also works.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Using M$IE, pressing F5 doesn't always work. And if it fails you lose your changes.</em>

        I suggest that people list here their favourite key/click sequence for each browser. In that way it might be useful and avoid the blanket statements that turn out not to be true in all cases.

           !Browse for the Acorn RiscPC StrongARM - right-click the "Save" button. This opens a new window and leaves the edit window open for retries.
