        Microsoft Managed Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ever since <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> is out, the word <strong>Managed</strong> seem to be repeated over and again.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a .Net context, "managed code" means code that requires <a href="DotNetFramework.html">DotNetFramework</a> to provide services such as "garbage collection". There is a certain misconception that Managed code is also "thread-safe" code, the latter is a default but has heavy performance penalties.

        Question: Any characteristic of  Managed code beside the implications of requiring the use of <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to automated garbage collection, freeing up resources for unwanted objects may be deferred. It is said there are special considerations required as a result of this "feature".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What are these considerations?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have to consider situations where a resource held by an object is not automatically freed immediately after the object becomes unwanted (keywords here are "automatically" and "immediately").

        I wondered what <a href="ManagedCode.html">ManagedCode</a> is other than a <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> where the <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> happens to x86-code. But then realized, that this seems to be a more or less new combination (even if it may be a step back). ??

        <em>Gunnar I do not understand your remark. I just make a mental translation of "Managed Code = code that works under an environment with garbage collection and sandboxing added to enhance </em><a href="InformationSecurity.html">InformationSecurity</a>." -- dl<em></em>
