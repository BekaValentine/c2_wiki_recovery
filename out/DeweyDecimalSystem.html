        Dewey Decimal System
      </h1>
      <p>
        A proprietary system for categorizing books used in public libraries in over 135 countries.

        This link gives the the most general one-thousand categories: <a href="http://www.library.illinois.edu/ugl/about/dewey.html">http://www.library.illinois.edu/ugl/about/dewey.html</a>  Perhaps this will provide fertile ground for Wiki categorization efforts.

        I doubt that the Dewey system, as it exists now, would be very useful on Wiki:
        This site is focused on a very small portion of all human knowledge.
        While the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> discussion bothered the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> community here, you'd need to go much further than 3 digits in the Dewey Decimal system to find the difference between extreme programming practices (like <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a>) and <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>.

        Instead, see <a href="WikiCategories.html">WikiCategories</a> -- a categorizing system tuned to Wiki features.

        The point was that some words and phrases are well suited for use as categories while most are not. It is difficult to find category names that are broad enough to describe a useful cross section of knowledge without being so broad that they fail to make useful distinctions between differing bits of information. The <a href="DeweyDecimalSystem.html">DeweyDecimalSystem</a> is a good source of examples of categories that are useful both for dividing information up and for finding it again later. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>

        I argue in <a href="RealWorldHierarchies.html">RealWorldHierarchies</a> that it should be replaced by a list of key-words and give examples of where Dewey fails. Anyhow, for pondering, <a href="TopsWikiCategoryEncodingSystem.html">TopsWikiCategoryEncodingSystem</a> has a rough draft of a "coded" classification suggestion for this wiki that is partly DDS-influenced.
