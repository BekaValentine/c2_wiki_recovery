        Library And Primitives Blurring
      </h1>
      <p>
        One technique that makes for a powerful dynamic or meta-language is blurring the distinction between what are "primitives" (built-in operations) and libraries (add-on-able functions, classes, and APIs). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> and <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> are known for this more or less. Some questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What other languages fall into this category, fully or partially?
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em></em><a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> is perhaps the quintessential example of this concept, where all Forth operations (aka "words") are library operators and vice versa.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> allows you to define your own operators, and some operators are defined in the Prelude (which is the standard base library).
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> is known for nearly arbitrary manipulation of objects, be they built-ins, standard library, or user-defined.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How far can this concept be taken?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Are there "social" problems with being too flexible? (<a href="LispIsTooPowerful.html">LispIsTooPowerful</a>)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Possibly.  Whether or not the cost for a developer to learn and maintain (or define) what is essentially a sublanguage defined by library-defined constructs is greater or less than that for an "ordinary" function/class library -- and to what degree this is a general principle, or library-specific or language-specific or developer-specific -- is a matter of debate and/or research.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        If the distinction is blurred (<a href="LibraryAndPrimitivesBlurring.html">LibraryAndPrimitivesBlurring</a>) this gives developers less chance to specialize - and in a recognizable way so. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Forces: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A human can only learn a master only so much.
        </li>
        <li>
           A known and well-defined set of domains (each of a size that can be mastered) allows for coordination of experts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>: <a href="TooPowerfulForItsOwnGood.html">TooPowerfulForItsOwnGood</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        So a clear separation between library and primitive is one means to ensure defined domains. There may be other differentiations.
