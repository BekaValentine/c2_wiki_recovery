      <p>
        Use the following marker
      </p>
      <code>
        not_yet_coded;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        in your C++ - code as a cure for <a href="ForgetToFixItLater.html">ForgetToFixItLater</a>.
      </p>
      <code>
        #define not_yet_coded  do   { cerr << "Error: " << __FILE__ <<     ", line " << __LINE__ << "\n";   throw whatever();  }   while(0)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That do/while - construct makes it a single statement.

        Leaving other issues aside for the moment, this should probably be phrased to result an expression, like assert:
      </p>
      <code>
        #define not_yet_coded    void((cerr << "Error: " << __FILE__ <<     ", line " << __LINE__ << "\n"),        throw whatever())<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Alternatively, one could build on assert directly if one so wished:
      </p>
      <code>
        assert(!"not yet coded");<br/>
      </code>

        One answer might be to write something like,
      </p>
      <code>
        #include <stdlib.h><br/>
        #include <stdio.h><br/>
        #ifdef NDEBUG<br/>
        #define FIXME(x) FIXME<br/>
        /* If you prefer detecting errors at runtime, uncomment this<br/>
        #define FIXME(x) do { fprintf( stderr, "FIXME (%s, %d): %s\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, #x ); exit( EXIT_FAILURE ); } while(0)<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          /
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        #else<br/>
        #define FIXME(x) fprintf( stderr, "FIXME (%s, %d): %s\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, #x )<br/>
        #endif<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        FIXME( Detect connection drop. )<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        so that in release mode, you will definitely know that the code should be fixed. Considering my approach to <a href="ConfigurationManagement.html">ConfigurationManagement</a>, this would ensure the code was fixed before you checked it in or else you'd be hit with a flying pencil. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Try using:
      </p>
      <code>
        #if FIXME<br/>
        #endif<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note the use of "#if" not #ifdef", also FIXME is undefined. In many compilers, this will generate a warning message, making the FIXME comments very hard to forget.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why use this in preference to #warning?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [It should not be; only a language lawyer could even tell you whether #if on an undefined symbol is explicitly allowed by the standard, explicitly disallowed, <a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a>, or what.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Any way of generating a warning is not a good idea, since many shops have a policy that warnings should be treated as errors -- with good reason, due to the widespread experience that warnings signal CodeSmells and can mask serious problems. "Yeah, I know we have 2,000 lines of warning output when we compile, that's normal." Fixing the code so that all the warnings go away invariably fixes a certain number of longstanding mysterious "unfixable" bugs.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Therefore, at most one should do:]
      </p>
      <code>
        #ifdef TRIGGER_FIXME_COMPILER_WARNINGS   /* normally an undefined symbol */<br/>
        #warning "fixme blah blah"<br/>
        #endif<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        [...or the similar but fancier code mentioned near start of page.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Consider further that the whole idea of FIXME is a deferred fix, otherwise one would just fix the code and not need a FIXME of any sort, so why ask for warnings on a topic you already know you are not ready to deal with yet? One merely gets desensitized and learns to ignore such things, which really is not a good idea.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Or, if it's a really critical thing, and you're trying to remind yourself/the team that something really, really, really needs to be fixed ASAP, then just use #warning, period. Or better yet, #error.]
