        Failure Is Unacceptable
      </h1>

        You have failed me for the last time, Captain Needa! -- <a href="DarthVader.html">DarthVader</a><br/>

      <p>
        A common <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, consisting of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The belief that all activities performed by an enterprise are deterministic and repeatable, and thus should all complete according to prepared plans
        </li>
        <li>
           The belief that any and all failures (meaning any deviation from what is expected) are caused by avoidable human error--i.e. carelessness or worse.
        </li>
        <li>
           Therefore, it is decreed that failing is not acceptable, and that whenever a failure occurs <a href="SomeoneMustBePunished.html">SomeoneMustBePunished</a> to reinforce the message.  The actual consequences (to the organization) of the failure--whether severe or not--are not important; the problem is that a failure occurred (or more specifically, was <em>allowed</em> to occur).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sometimes, of course, failure is <em>indeed</em> unacceptable.  A diagnostic medical device that manages to kill patients--even if .001%--is clearly not a good thing.  But most activities are quite fault-tolerant.  In the management context, business plans that cannot withstand quite a bit of failure to execute (in other words, those which require <em>everything</em> to go right in order to be successful), are themselves questionable.  Most businesses will not go under if a salesman only makes 99% of his quota, or a project is late by a day.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Many activities, of course, are not deterministic--or cannot be made 100% foolproof.  A classic analogy for this from baseball is the observation that the <em>best</em> hitters in the game fail to get on base 2/3 of the time; a batting average of .333 is considered excellent.  (I'm being a bit sloppy here in my discussion of baseball, as "batting average" doesn't equate exactly with "getting on base"; but that's beside the point for this discussion).  On the other hand, an outfielder whose fielding percentage is only .950 (meaning he makes an error 1 out of 20 times a fly ball comes his way) is considered a poor (defensive) player.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And when failure does occur; often times it is not due to unprofessionalism or carelessness.

           Fired?  You mean I no longer have to spend 120 hours/week in the office?  Oh, <strong>please</strong> don't throw me in the briar patch!

      <p>
        One negative <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a> of this particular <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> is that everyone in the organization lives in <a href="FearOfBeingFired.html">FearOfBeingFired</a>; and thus engages in highly risk-averse behavior (schedule padding, etc.) to prevent failing.  The result is an organization which is higly inefficient, and which may fail <em>its</em> overall business objectives.  Depending on the nature of the company, this may eventually lead to top management being replaced; or the organization may struggle on in this fashion for years, as the losses are absorbed by the corporate parent.
