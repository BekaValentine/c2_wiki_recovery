        Mobile Ip
      </h1>
      <p>
        Mobile IP is a routing protocol that allows hosts (the <em>mobile nodes</em>) to
        retain their IP address while changing their point of Internet connectivity. Traffic to a mobile node is forwarded to the mobile node by its
        <em>home agent,</em>
        which uses <a href="ProtocolTunneling.html">ProtocolTunneling</a> (usually IPIP) to forward the mobile node's
        <em>foreign agent.</em>
        The foreign agent then detunnels the packet and sends it over the final link to the mobile node.  Note that a mobile node can function as its own foreign agent if it is able to obtain an IP address at its current location (via DHCP, for
        example).
