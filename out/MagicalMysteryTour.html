        A code review extravaganza which takes you through all the bug ridden, nybble packing, byte shuffling, infinite loop spawning, magic number fest dungeon modules of the code that no-one dares look at lest they be turned to stone. Most of this code was written by Frank when the company was a start-up some 25 years and 20,000 employees ago. Frank now works for a small plumbing business in Nevada, where he's paid to cook the books and eat small children.
