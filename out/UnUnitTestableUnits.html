        This question is asked in the context of someone who has already bought into the XP method. The question here is not 'are <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s a good thing to have', it's 'is this unit <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>able, and if so, how'. The current summary opinion of the respondents is that the first scenario below <strong>is </strong><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>able and should have supporting <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s<strong>. Please feel free to add other scenarios if you want to muddy the water a little.</strong>

        <strong>Scenario 1</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider cSerialPort, a class encapsulating an O/S handle and simplifying the interface to a serial port by narrowing it tightly around what the client code actually needs from a serial port. This class has a skinny interface and each implemented method is a call or two into the O/S's API.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is tempting to ignore this simple unit and not write a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> for it. These are the rationales:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It takes more code to <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> this unit than it did to implement it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is no good way to write a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> that runs without special hardware (Implicit assumption: the port has no O/S accessible means of turning on internal loopback).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Even if the unit fails its failure will be dreadfully instantly obvious, the unit is currently done, currently working, and everyone depends on it every day all the time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here are the considered replies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It doesn't matter that it takes more code to test than to implement. It will still take less time and energy to code a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> and move on knowing the unit is safe-under-changes. One can cheerfully go up to a two-to-one test-to-implementation ratio without even blanching.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It doesn't matter that you need special hardware to test. It's easy enough to clearly indicate on your unit test display that a given test requires given hardware. Those developers not changing the unit can still run the test on incorrect hardware and ignore the result.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It doesn't matter that you think the code won't fail and will be easy to detect if it does and that the unit isn't scheduled for future changes. If you were that good at detecting when your code won't fail you wouldn't need tests at all, and if you were that good at detecting the nature of failures at runtime you wouldn't need debugging, and if you were that good at predicting the future path of your development you wouldn't be needing to use the iterative XP method.

        All code that may contain bugs should be tested. The conversion of C++ interface into OS API calls may be buggy. An easy way of testing this is to create a text log file of the generated API calls. This also has the benefit of removing dependencies on hardware from this unit test. -- <a href="EricUlevik.html">EricUlevik</a>

        I think that one should be pragmatic in testing.  There is value in having a unit test that relies on special hardware (I assume this is something like a loopback cable), though one would not include it as part of the automatically run set.  One would have to have a plan to periodically run it, though.  Depending upon the amount of work in the wrapper class, one might consider writing a stub for the OS calls.  This may have to be specially compiled with an #if preprocessor (other solutions probably also exist).  Finally, one absolutely must write a stub for this class to be used by higher level tests.  The code in question is not untestable in the absolute sense, it just may not be cost effective to set up for an automatically run test as part of each developer's build cycle.  This is really a risk issue and probably should be decided in conjunction with your team and not based on wiki opinions.  Just do what makes sense. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

        <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a> often does unit testing with real hardware, rather than writing the stubs. Running the tests is slower, and requires the presence of the real hardware, but it's generally easier to do and gives greater confidence that the overall system will work right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
        There was lots of testing on the Hubble telescope, but not an end-to-end test.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the serial port, you can start by wiring a "loopback cable" that physically connects transmit to receive pins, and similar connections for status pins. Later, if performance or hardware availability become an issue, consider writing testing stubs, so you can test most of the system, even when the special hardware is absent.

        I recently wrote another OO wrapper for OS functionality: This time an FTP wrapper. To test it, I point it at an FTP server I've set up to run on my desktop PC. (IE: IP address 127.0.0.1) Testing with the real OS interface helps test <strong>my understanding of the OS interface.</strong> -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Another approach is to have the unit test follow this algorithm
      </p>
      <code>
        if(isSpecialHardwareConnected())  // detects the special hardware<br/>
        {<br/>
        return runCSerialUnitTest();  // either SUCCESS or FAIL<br/>
        }<br/>
        else<br/>
        {<br/>
        cerr << "I didn't really do runCSerialUnitTest()" << endl;<br/>
        return SUCCESS;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Advantage is that any monkey that comes along can type <strong>'make test</strong>' and when all test succeeds, they are happy. It avoids needless hunting around for the test that "failed".
      </p>
      <p>
        Disadvantage is that someone has to remember to connect the hardware once in a while and run the tests - along with all the other peculiar tests that each have their own peculiarities. Otherwise you have a piece of software that gradually deteriorates.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've considered a similar approach for a cross-platform test.

        Sorry if this is a stupid question, but are there any general guidelines for creating <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s for real-time and multi-threaded programs? We are having a mental block creating <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s for our TCP/IP socket and SNA interfaces aside from creating some sort of stub TCP/IP or SNA subsystem. Any assistance would be extremely valuable -- <a href="DavidHurt.html">DavidHurt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why can't you create the stubs and see if that works? I do the equivalent thing all the time for databases. You may find you have to change your design around considerably to make this possible. However, when I make my designs testable, I'm always much happier with the resulting designs, even if I wouldn't have designed it that way if I hadn't been testing. Perhaps some day I'll design for testability by habit. Someday. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Stubs are good. Running your client and the server on one machine makes testing much easier. Writing required scaffolding code will help your design.
      </p>
      <p>
        For real time and multi-threading software, I've always tested and profiled the entire machine. After the usual unit tests and code inspections, of course.

        How about spawning a server thread and a client thread and having them to talk to one another? In our <a href="XpLeiden.html">XpLeiden</a> project one of the students made separate executables. He had a simple server program which he started from the test executable with a spawnlp call. If you want to do this, you'll have to have the test executable ready. In Visual Studio the easiest way to do this would be by making the project for your server code a dependency of the project for your test code. But separate threads are probably easier. --<a href="MartijnMeijering.html">MartijnMeijering</a>

      <p>
        <strong>Scenario 2</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider a system which is not multi-threaded, yet has more than one thing to do at the same time. Consequently, a "timer" class is written. When an object's "do some work" routine is called, it is given a timer telling it how long it can work before it must return. The object sometimes runs into situations where it is waiting for something to happen, but it can't return if it still has time, so it calls the timer class's "wait n milliseconds" function.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not saying that the the "timer" unit can't be unit tested, but I am at a loss as to how I might do so. -- <a href="DonaldMcLean.html">DonaldMcLean</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        First, wait(0). Then wait(n). Check the time to see if it waited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then wait(-1) and see if you want to change the interface. -- <a href="EricUlevik.html">EricUlevik</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        --
        I've written a few timers that fire events when they have counted down or whatever - I think that is what you want ?. Here is a method from a test for a timer which simply counts down and notifies its listener when it reaches zero. This test checks that this actually happens:
      </p>
      <code>
        long countdown = 500; //milliseconds<br/>
        Timer timer = new Timer(countdown, timerListener);<br/>
        timer.start();<br/>
        pause(700); //method on the unit test class<br/>
        assert("Timer finished", timerListener.wasNotified());<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        So the timer is constructed with the length of time to count down and a listener to notify when it has done so. It is started and then the test waits for 700 ms (longer than the countdown time). Then I assert that the listener was notified. There are lots of other tests to do (like pausing the timer and resuming).
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this what you meant or have I completely misunderstood? :)

        I recently stumbled across XP while looking for information on JUnit. Unfortunately my first attempt at adopting <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s is proving difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current project involves meta-programming in Java. The first task is to generate 1258 classes another 1258 interfaces from a description file. I wrote a parser using <a href="JavaCompilerCompiler.html">JavaCompilerCompiler</a> (javacc) and a class generator (I ended up doing two scratch versions, I think XP call them <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>s and ended up using the <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a>). It was at this point I went looking for JUnit.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently trying to produce a simpler description file to allow me to write some simple <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s for the code generator, but I have no idea how to go about testing the code that has been created. Especially if I was to try and follow the XP principle of WriteTheTestsFirst.

        You want to test that the compiler generates proper code for legal input, that it properly handles bad input and that the generated code runs within whatever runtime framework you provide. You can drive the compiler with a list of well known input files and compare the output to expected results (in files perhaps). You can also take a well known input, compile it and then run it in the runtime framework and compare the generated code's output with expected results. You may also want to drive the runtime with code not generated by the compiler so that you can know when you have messed up the front end versus the backend. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easier to generate the well known outputs from the compiler, verify that they are correct and then store them away. I would interpret "write the test case first" to mean that before adding a feature to the compiler you write the test that will use a well known input and compare it to an as yet uncreated oracular output. The test fails until you create, verify and save the oracular output.
      </p>

        Also note that, if you include the tools.jar file from the JDK, you can instantiate an instance of that javac class, and give it stuff to compile. This lets you verify that your generated code compiles. If you pull out a dynamic class-loader of some sort, you can then load up the generated class that you just compiled, and run some more tests over it. -- <a href="RobertWatkins.html">RobertWatkins</a>

        <strong>Scenario 3</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A real experience (of inapplicability of XP - from <a href="WhenIsXpNotAppropriate.html">WhenIsXpNotAppropriate</a>) was of a shared local queueing component which had been thoroughly unit tested and which failed during a system stress test involving highly concurrent usage of the component combined with a shortage of virtual memory. As each bug was fixed, the stress test just got further and another bug popped up. Eventually, the underlying cause became apparent, a data structure was replaced, and the stress test found no more problems in the component. In retrospect, it would not have been practicable to code unit tests to find this class of bugs. Admittedly we were not using XP, but unless the project had been using XP from scratch, how could XP have worked for this component?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why would XP have done any worse in this situation? If you feel your current approach was appropriate given the problems you describe, why would XP be any less appropriate?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not economically viable, in the above environment, to run a full stress test prior to integrating each set of changes. Effectively refactoring frequency has to be decreased to match the capability of testing to give confidence that changes haven't broken something. Maybe the philosophy is similar, but the rate of change is completely different. If you have to integrate changes before you
        get feedback, you have to apply measures other than unit testing to be sure you won't break other people's unit testing.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I could make the argument that a shared queue is something that takes a set of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> that are inherently multithreaded. In that case, the "Stress test" is nothing more than a proper <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> in that regard. In general, I recommend that people do three types of testing for server-side (multiuser) systems before they ever let them see daylight:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s ala <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> which say "does this do the right thing in simple (single-threaded) cases"
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ThreadTests.html">ThreadTests</a> which say "does this do the right thing when hit simultaneously by N threads"
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PerformanceTests.html">PerformanceTests</a> which say "does the system as a whole give us acceptable performance under stress"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Perhaps our definition of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> is wrong, or perhaps we just need to make a distinction between appropriate testing strategies for server-side code and client-side code.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It might be possible to unit test a component under stress, but often it is the interactions between multiple components that break under stress. In the shared queueing example, the queueing component wasn't expecting storage deallocation calls to result in a thread switch (the environment was not fully re-entrant - control was lost only on certain calls to the <em>system</em>).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, it is often when making calls between components that locking strategies succeed or fail. If they are too strong, you can get deadlock. If they are too weak, you can get races leading to unpredictable results.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, in practice, I think you have to run stress tests on subsystems or whole systems. There are probably economic limits too as stress tests tend to consumes large amounts of CPU and other resources.

        I would also admit to being confused as to what a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> implies in XP. Most of the discussions seem to be about testing each class/object in isolation.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In XP there are two kinds of tests, called </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> and <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>. The <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s are specified and belong to the Customer. The <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s belong to the programmers. All of the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are required to run perfectly in the integrated system every time any developer releases any code. Whenever a defect is detected downstream (i.e., in <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a> or in actual usage), a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> <strong><em>must</em></strong> be written to detect that defect. Then the defect is fixed. It follows that not all <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s test things in isolation. The point of the tests, as <a href="MichaelHill.html">MichaelHill</a> points out, is to provide <strong><em>mobility</em></strong>, the ability to change the code as needed. As such, the tests need to execute quickly, and to provide confidence. Sometimes isolation is the best way to do this. Sometimes it is not. Either way, XP teams have to do it.<em></em>
