        <strong>Historical Cruft, Circa 2001</strong>
        (don't trust the links)
        A new person to Wikis. First encountered them through <a href="http://www.personaltelco.net,">http://www.personaltelco.net,</a> the home site of the Portland, Oregon wireless network community. Groked the concept and tossed up <a href="http://wiki.patch.com,">http://wiki.patch.com,</a> which currently (April 2002) has a bit of discussion on good books people have read recently and issues with domain name registration. 
      </p>
      <p>
        patch.com also hosts a page of wiki engines at <a href="http://daemon.patch.com,">http://daemon.patch.com,</a> where I play with the usability of different wiki engines.
