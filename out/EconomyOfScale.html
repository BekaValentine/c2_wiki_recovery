        Economy Of Scale
      </h1>
      <p>
        Relative saving realized when the size of a plant, enterprise, etc., is increased. For example, lower production cost of an automobile due to production of a large number of cars of the same type is due to economy of scale. There may also exist a DISECONOMY OF SCALE where the increased size contributes to an increase in unit cost or a decrease in quality (see <a href="LeanThinking.html">LeanThinking</a> and EconomyOfScope).
