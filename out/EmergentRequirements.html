        <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> that are not defined at the project outset but rather emerge during the lifecycle of the software development are often referred to as Emergent Requirements. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As developers we cater for Emergent Requirements through <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> and <a href="IterativeDevelopment.html">IterativeDevelopment</a>.
