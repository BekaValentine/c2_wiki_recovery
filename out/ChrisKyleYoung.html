        I live in Auckland, <a href="NewZealand.html">NewZealand</a>, currently working as a programmer. My favourite programming languages include <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>, C++ (<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>), and elisp (<a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        People I program with (feel free to add yourself to the list):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           BradleyGrainger (<a href="http://cryo.gen.nz/)">http://cryo.gen.nz/)</a>
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I am a member of the <a href="KernelPanicLinuxUsersGroup.html">KernelPanicLinuxUsersGroup</a>, even though I am unable to attend their monthly meetings for locality reasons. This would be a perfect opportunity for you to perform the BreakingBreadTest if you know one of the members of that group; a fair number have met me in <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, if you happen to come by Auckland, be sure to get in touch sometime, and I'll be happy to have a game of badminton with you! (If you're not into badminton, I'm sure there would be some activity that we could both enjoy.)
      </p>

        For even more stringent identity checks, I'm a <a href="ThawteWebOfTrust.html">ThawteWebOfTrust</a> notary. To be a notary, you have to be certified by three or more existing notaries, or (in my case) by Thawte personnel. If you wish to be notarised, just let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of computing stuff, I love playing the piano (sometimes even more than programming), and <a href="OnceUponaTime.html">OnceUponaTime</a> I actually took time outdoors to tramp as well; <a href="NewZealand.html">NewZealand</a> is one of those fine places where there's plenty of good scenery wherever you go (except Auckland, of course).

        <a href="PetPeeve.html">PetPeeve</a><strong>'s with programming styles used by some C programmers:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Gratuitous use of postincrement and postdecrement operators (by gratuitous, I mean using the postfix operators in contexts where using the prefix operators would be just as correct). In C, it's probably just a stylistic issue, whereas in C++, if the object concerned has overloaded operators (usually with operator++(int) implemented in terms of operator++(void)), i++ is no faster (and in fact, usually slower, especially if the operator is implemented using an out-of-line function) than ++i, which makes a bad tradeoff if the return value is unused.
        </li>
        <li>
           Treatment of pointers as integers (especially when people use %u or %x conversion specifications to print out the value of a pointer---and the compiler is not in a position to complain about the mismatched argument types, since printf is a variadic function). The size of a pointer is as implementation-defined as the size of an int, and they should not be assumed to be equal. The printf function has a %p conversion specification for a reason, after all.
        </li>
      </ul>

        When I first encounter a social circle, the first question that gets asked of me is, `how do you know whoevermabob?' (<em>whoevermabob</em> being the person who introduced me to the circle). So, to preempt that question here, the short story is that my <a href="ProjectManager.html">ProjectManager</a> has asked me to research on, and advocate, <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a><strong>'ing in the office.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, what no one anticipated was that I'd end up advocating <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> in its entirety! While I'm unsure of its viability in my current workplace, I will be sure to give it a whirl when the time comes for me to move on.

        By the way, I would name this page ChrisKYoung if it were a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>. Well, at least it should satisfy the curiosity of all those who asked me what the `K' in my name stood for.
