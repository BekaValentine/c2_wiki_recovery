        Law Of Demeter Vs Information Hiding

        I contended that law of demeter is badly formulated heuristic that at best (when it applies , that is, cause it's not always a valid law) is a particular case of <a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a>. Therefore it is both unnecessary and confusing. -- <a href="AnonymousCoward.html">AnonymousCoward</a>

        Maybe we should all give up on <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> and decree that it is a badly formulated heuristic that raises a lot of problems, including those discussed on this page, and in the end, at a closer look we may discover that it is a squared wheel reinvention of <a href="DavidParnas.html">DavidParnas</a>' principle of <a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a> in the particular case of <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>. However the particular case represented by <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> severely restricts the generality of <a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a> and may provide false leads to OO practitioners. In other words, if one design is "good" or even "optimal" under the <a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a> criteria, we no longer need to worry about <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>, but the reverse is generally not true. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I see the </em><a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> as something that, if followed, enforces Parnas' principle of <a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In support of this thesis I bring <a href="KarlLieberherr.html">KarlLieberherr</a>'s updated general formulation of the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/demeter-method/LawOfDemeter/general-formulation.html">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/demeter-method/LawOfDemeter/general-formulation.html</a> where he says:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But in essence this is exactly the same thing as formulated by <a href="DavidParnas.html">DavidParnas</a> seminal paper "On the Criteria to Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules" which dates from 1972. --<a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        It's interesting to follow this discussion because most people seem to be
        missing an important point. The Law of Demeter is not a pattern since
        it does not have a context. In all probability, the Law of Demeter could
        be a useful pattern if placed into a context in which it does resolve
        the forces of that context and then there will be no need to discuss
        whether the Law is <strong>true</strong> or not. -- <a href="MichaelDillon.html">MichaelDillon</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The above is actually just a common misunderstanding because most folks aren't given the full story when they learn about the </em><a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>. While it's certainly not a pattern, nor should it be IMHO, it really does have a context, albeit a very broad one.<em></em>

        <em>This has been moved here because Demeter tries to establish a relation about objects created and used within a method or function, while Parnas' </em><a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a> has to do with modules, or what we would call today JavaPackages.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Modules are not packages, nor the other way around. Maybe we should expand on this here on wiki, but please refer to <a href="SoftwareFundamentals.html">SoftwareFundamentals</a> or to online available publications by <a href="DavidParnas.html">DavidParnas</a> with regards to modules.
