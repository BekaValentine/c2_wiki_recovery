        Programming Is Art
      </h1>
      <p>
        Years ago I took some kind of HR test to determine my worth as a human being. I scored high in artistry. My manager at the time was suprised as I was a software engineer. I wasn't suprised. I thought "software artist" was a good description. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The question that remains is "Is programming a Black Art?"

        <em>I will answer this question if someone defines art without including anything ever made by a human</em>
