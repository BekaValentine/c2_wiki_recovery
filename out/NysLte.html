        It is being used and refined, having just recently been selected as the approach used in the development of a program for release soon.

      <ul>
        <li>
           More on its development and a coming public release of a free version. 
        </li>
        <li>
           A more advanced version will be available for license which includes additional features 
          <ul>
            <li>
               which allow the creation of an unlimited number of Categories

        Current Version undergoing <a href="InProcessPlanning.html">InProcessPlanning</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been planning and thinking about a program which uses a flat text linking environment, which I have named "<a href="NysLte.html">NysLte</a>" consisting of pages within categorized topic spaces. It is a program which uses the environment and process to aid in its own development as well as for use in <a href="TheOtherThings.html">TheOtherThings</a>. It is this characteristic which allows one to define and extend notions, ideas, structures, and processes, restructuring and making code changes to enable new features and to extend old ones. This is one of the strong points of this process. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I can pick up where I left off in this process by creating a TagWord on the page, named something like: "IWorkedHereLast". Since this program can be used for organizing information one would want to link together, its usage scope can be huge. When plans for linking to external processes (which will follow as target of Version 2015), the scope will include in its reach, the entire internet, as well as links to other development venues using processes which are called ArtiFactories. These are maintained in existing, reachable and usable locales.

        <strong>Different concepts of Spaces containing Information</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="InformationSpace.html">InformationSpace</a> is defined as the set of concepts and relations among them held by an information system. This is as compared to <a href="CognitiveSpace.html">CognitiveSpace</a>, which is the set of concepts and relations among them held by a human

      <p>
        The Semantic Web offers exciting possibilities for information retrieval (IR). 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In IR, we would like systems that go beyond simply matching words in documents and queries, and instead match based on topic, data type, relations among data, and many other qualities. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The Semantic Web, through fuzzy matching of information spaces from different sources, will provide for much more specific information seeking than current Web-based search engines or other IR systems. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In order to succeed, however, it is necessary to map between the differing schema, metadata standards, namespaces and so forth used by documents on the Semantic Web. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This information space mapping may be accomplished by a simple match or table lookup when document sets come from similar or otherwise well-defined domains. 
        </li>
        <li>
           When the match is less precise, sets of rules or algorithms may be employed to map between information spaces. 
        </li>
        <li>
           When schema or metadata are inconsistent, though, we are left with a similar data environment as the modern Web, and must rely on the context of the documents themselves to determine the mapping between information spaces.
