        Amaya Browser
      </h1>
      <p>
        Web client from W3C, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/.">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/.</a> Amaya differs from <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a>s by treating editing of pages equally to viewing them, and there aren't even separate modes/views for reading and writing. Imagine browsing the web in <a href="NetscapeComposer.html">NetscapeComposer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Special features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Several useful view modes: structure (tag hierarchy), alternate (to check graceful degradation of page elements), links, TOC, and of course source.
        </li>
        <li>
           Tag parser to validate/correct XHTML
        </li>
        <li>
           Natively supports <strong>Annotea</strong> (<a href="WebAnnotation.html">WebAnnotation</a>), also for private localhost-stored annotations
        </li>
        <li>
           natively renders SVG [<a href="ScalableVectorGraphics.html">ScalableVectorGraphics</a>] files
        </li>
        <li>
           natively renders <a href="MathMl.html">MathMl</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Frequent updates: v8 (Apr 2003)

      <p>
        The net result is that it is extremely painful to use for both viewing and editing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The version I'm using (dated April 2000) is actually very nice for both. I find a web that's even easier to edit than Wiki really quite astounding.</em>

        Amaya comes with source, so even the rest of the <a href="WikiPrinciples.html">WikiPrinciples</a> can be implemented - at least on your local host. Amaya is a candidate for a <a href="WysiwygWiki.html">WysiwygWiki</a>. BTW do you know some public editable Websites that supports Put Publishing With Amaya? -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>

        Dear Amaya/Jiigsaw team,
      </p>
      <p>
        At least one public Jiigsaw site, where we can use/test/discuss Amaya as a collaborative environment like on a newsgroup or a Wiki-forum would be nice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please have a look at <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WysiwygWiki.">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WysiwygWiki.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It hurts lovers of your great browser-server concept, that on your <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/</a> no link to a reference implementation of Jiigsaw is given. Or did I miss something?
      </p>
      <p>
        I append this email as a posting to the publicly editable <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AmayaBrowser">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AmayaBrowser</a> for your power feedback to interested Wiki-users. (This way, you need not waste your time in bilateral email-communications, as you know from your Amaya-publishing concept). 
      </p>
      <p>
        An Amaya-based Wiki would be great.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best wishes
      </p>

        By the way - did we happen to discuss the fact that Amaya doesn't even come <em>close</em> to complying with HTML 4.01? Or that it renders everything completely differently than every other browser out there? Or that it is a pain to use?
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry about that, W3C, but I test my pages through <a href="NetscapeNavigator.html">NetscapeNavigator</a>, Internet Extorter [<a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a>], and <a href="OperaBrowser.html">OperaBrowser</a>. Amaya is unusable as a browser to test compatibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Surely ANY single browser is unusable to test compatibility, since compatibility testing by definition requires testing on all browsers.</em>
