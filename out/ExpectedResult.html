        Expected Result
      </h1>
      <p>
        Invoke a function and ensure that it returns the expected result.
        Problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           you don't know what the result is supposed to be
        </li>
        <li>
           you can't automate the equality comparison
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you don't know what the result is supposed to be, hopefully
        there are some sanity checks that can be performed to ensure that the
        result is at least probably correct.
        A typical example is ensuring that a message is printed to standard
        output.
        It's possible to capture standard output, but it's not reasonable for the
        testing framework to require that the message printed be exactly the
        same in all versions of the implementation.
        However, it is possible to require that if the message is telling
        some number to the user, that that number appear in the output.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the result of the function is a complicated object, and it can be
        specified exactly what that object should be, it seems reasonable to
        implement that equality test.
        If the equality problem can't be broken down into smaller fragments,
        is the design right?
        <a href="DesignForTestability.html">DesignForTestability</a> includes the ability to check equality.
