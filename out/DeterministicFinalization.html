        Deterministic Finalization

      <p>
        Object destructor is called immediately when object is removed from memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Object is removed from memory when it goes out of scope (eg. local variables created on the stack in C++ go out of scope when the method completes)
      </p>

      <p>
        A similar effect is achieved in <a href="GarbageCollected.html">GarbageCollected</a> environments with an idiom like:
      </p>
      <code>
        |file|<br/>
        [ file := File open: 'filename.txt'.<br/>
        self use: file.<br/>
        ] ensure: [file close].<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The file will be closed in a deterministic, statically scoped way. This idiom can be generalised more by using block closures, thus:
      </p>
      <code>
        File<br/>
        withOpen: 'filename.txt'<br/>
        do: [:file| self use: file].<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or whatever. 
      </p>

        <em>I have seen numerous discussions/arguments about the usefulness (or not) of DF in a garbage-collected world, or indeed whether it's possible to elegantly integrate determinism into garbage-collected languages (I'm talking about releasing memory here, not external resources/handles).  Is it really an either/or decision, or are there languages which deal with the problem (if it really is a problem) successfully?</em>
