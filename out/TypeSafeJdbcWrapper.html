        Type Safe Jdbc Wrapper
      </h1>
      <p>
        To solve the problem with string constants (e.g. in SQL-statements), as described in <a href="NoStrings.html">NoStrings</a>, I implemented the following set of relatively simple tools/classes for Java:
      </p>
      <p>
        Two tools to compile 
      </p>
      <p>
        a) SQL CREATE TABLE statements (using a simple jflex grammar),
      </p>
      <p>
        b) the actual database schema (using JDBC and DatabaseMetaData)
      </p>
      <p>
        into java class files with properties (getter/setter methods) for the found columns. 
        The classes also feature a getPrimaryKeyFieldNames() method (returning a Set of String of course) 
        to represent the primary key as well as a getTableName() method returning the datbase table name
        (defined by an interface DbBean).
      </p>
      <p>
        All Names are mapped one to one, i.e. a column NAME is mapped to getNAME and setNAME.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second part of this 'relational mapping tool' is a class, that wraps around a JDBC Connection and has the following methods:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           load(DbBean)
        </li>
        <li>
           save(DbBean)
        </li>
        <li>
           delete(DbBean)
        </li>
        <li>
           select(Query, DbBean)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        the latter Query class is currently a wrapper for an SQL-SELECT String, but it would be straightforward to replace it e.g. with the Query from <a href="http://sodaquery.sourceforge.net/.">http://sodaquery.sourceforge.net/.</a>
        Another way would be to use a construction like
      </p>
      <p>
        new Query(UserDbBean.class, new And(new Equals(UserDbBean.FIRSTNAME, "gunnar"), new Equals(UserDbBean.LASTNAME, "zarncke")));
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course the tools would have to be extended to generate these additional fields of type Column.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This jdbc wrapper can also provide sensible error handling instead of the useless SQLException.
        This might be done along the lines used in the <a href="SpringFramework.html">SpringFramework</a>:
        <a href="http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/jdbc/package-summary.html">http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/jdbc/package-summary.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="ExpressionApiComplaints.html">ExpressionApiComplaints</a> complains about this new-dot-new-dot style of API's.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I did this before in a project, and this is my preferred way to handle the database in Java. (For the same reasons of maintability, safety displayed in <a href="NoStrings.html">NoStrings</a>) Additionaly what it does buy you is that you can run a <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> that will compare the database schema as known by your code base, and the actual schema currently in use, and display the differences. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Together with QueryObjects handling query building, execution and connection handling (a sort of <a href="MethodObject.html">MethodObject</a> dedicated to Sql queries) and a visitor object to build result views, or objects, it brought a rather safe, thin modular layer above plain jdbc.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Another, more flexible but also more arduous way of achieving type-safe JDBC is iBatis (<a href="http://www.ibatis.com/),">http://www.ibatis.com/),</a> also mentioned in <a href="ObjectRelationalToolComparison.html">ObjectRelationalToolComparison</a>. With this approach you must still type your own SQL statements (queries AND insert/delete/update), but they are stored in a separate (XML) file. ResultSets are then automatically mapped to <a href="JavaBean.html">JavaBean</a>-compliant objects (matching column and property names), although you can override that.
      </p>
      <p>
        iBatis also provides some caching features, thread-safe modus of operation and some primitive support for relationships, but that doesn't influence the basic idea (and you can safely ignore relationship support if you don't need it).
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Hum? iBatis seem to be the totally opposite idea, (described in </em><a href="NoStrings.html">NoStrings</a>) by relying on external XML content. It even seem to encode the property lookups in the XML file itself! The idea of the <a href="TypeSafeJdbcWrapper.html">TypeSafeJdbcWrapper</a> is to exploit the java compilers and IDEs to do what should be validated here by a specific tool running against those external XML descriptions.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Note that <a href="TypeSafeJdbcWrapper.html">TypeSafeJdbcWrapper</a> is just a short step away from full-blown <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> tool. The only major feature that is "missing" is support for (inter-object) relationships (but it brings its own set of headaches).

        <em>I think the interesting point is that it doesn't over-emphasize full blown object-relational mapping, not attempting to fully bring the relations into the navigational world of objects</em>
