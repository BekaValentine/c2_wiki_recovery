        <strong>little-endian</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        CPU instructions to use multi-byte numbers can take a <a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a> approach, where the most significant bytes of a multi-byte number have the lowest memory addresses.  Or the approach can be little-endian with the least significant bytes first (example: <a href="ExEightySix.html">ExEightySix</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        A related but distinct problem is the approach chosen for indexing a bit in a register.  Some CPU instructions have a 3-bit field that designate what bit of a byte is to be operated on.  On some processors, a zero in this field accesses the most significant bit of the byte (as determined by the CPU's other instructions for arithmetic operations).  Other processors use 7 to address the most significant bit.

      <p>
        One of the reasons little-endian was chosen for many processors a few decades ago was that a pointer to a little endian number can be more usefully treated as a pointer to multiple data types. For example, consider the number
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           02 03 04
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        as a little endian number (two hexadecimal digits per byte). This then has the value 
      </p>
      <p>
        4*2^12 + 3*2^8 + 2*2^4 + 1
      </p>
      <p>
        when treated as a 32-bit value. When treated as a 16-bit value, it has the value
      </p>
      <p>
        2*2^4 + 1
      </p>
      <p>
        i.e., the 16-bit truncation of the former value. <a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a> numbers do not have this property. --<a href="AdamBerger.html">AdamBerger</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Pardon the </em><a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, but what does that have to do with usefulness?  Consider that the 16-bit interpretation of the number is a different value than the 32-bit.  I think the real underlying reason is that Intel chose <a href="LittleEndian.html">LittleEndian</a> to reduce the number of transistors needed for manipulation, and Motorola chose <a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a> to reduce the burden of the programmer looking at memory.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of the <strong>motivation</strong> of the respective cpu architects, Adam is correct that <a href="LittleEndian.html">LittleEndian</a> and <a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a> have mutually exclusive useful properties -- and algorithms that make use of those properties are the ones that cause problems in porting programs between the two kinds of architectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adam is saying that <a href="LittleEndian.html">LittleEndian</a> architectures allow storage of 16 bit integers simply by truncating the 4-byte stream that would be emitted for a full 32 bit integer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another handy trick on <a href="LittleEndian.html">LittleEndian</a> widely used in interpreted languages (and first pioneered by Lisp) is to use the low order bits of a word to encode the type of the word's value (e.g. a union of a char, int, and word pointer). The equivalent on <a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a> encodes the info in the high order bits, but depending on the scheme, one architecture or the other can be noticeably more efficient due to need for shift versus only a mask, etc. Alas, when porting such algorithms to a cpu with the opposite byte order, one may have to completely redesign the encoding scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously people have long advocated avoiding such tricks and just storing things in network byte order (<a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a>), but it is not uncommon for these issues to arise in inner loops where using network byte order can actually significantly slow down a program (I have personally seen 30% and even 300% slowdowns from using non-native byte order in common programs such as interpreters).
