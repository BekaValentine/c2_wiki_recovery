      <p>
        A bodgy person is someone who only does half a job...at best.  "Bodgy" is rushing a job to ensure that a social commitment can be met, regardless of the consequences to those who were "bodged."  "Bodgy" is someone with the "Gift of the Gab," but demonstrates the skills of an untrained poodle.
