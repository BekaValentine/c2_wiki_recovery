        Ward -- I've looked around
        on the web, and I can't find a pattern that deals with maintaining
        symmetric object relationships.  Like, if A contains B, and B knows its
        container, what's a pattern that ensures referential integrity, so that
        we don't get A contains B, but B thinks it's contained by C? -- <a href="SteveMetsker.html">SteveMetsker</a>

        Steve -- I know the pattern you're talking about, but I don't know if it
        has been written up. The patterns mailing list is a good way to poll a
        lot of people. Try sending your request there and then read the list for
        a week or two. I'm going to see if I can write the pattern off of the
        top of my head. Then I will put the correspondence on <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> to see
        what happens there. Good luck with your search. Tell me what you find.

        <strong>Pattern:</strong> <a href="SymmetricalReference.html">SymmetricalReference</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> Two collaborating objects maintain a relationship for some
        period of time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Both objects must be aware of any changes in their relationship
        so that assumptions made about symmetry remain true.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Adjust the public accessing methods of both objects so as to
        keep collaborators informed. Use private protocol between the
        collaborators to distribute updates. Such protocol is simplest when one
        object is known to be responsible and the other delegates to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use:</strong> Smalltalk-80 Models and Controllers work in pairs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Alternative:</strong> An AsymmetricalReference can sometimes have accessing
        protocol that makes it appear symmetrical. A <a href="RelationshipObject.html">RelationshipObject</a> can take
        all responsibility for modeling dynamic collaboration.

        My take on this is that maintaining the integrity of object
        links lies outside, and in a sense above, either object.  For
        example, if containers contain items, making sure that 
        containers and items match lies outside the encapsulated
        interests of either containers or items.  In this case, we
        want to make sure that when Container c contains Item i, that
        i isContainedBy c.  The integrity of these links seems to
        lie outside of either Container or Item.  I'm inclined to
        introduce a Judge pattern, whose job it is to ensure the
        consistency of such links.  In a system, there is one Judge
        singleton needed for each relation pair that is maintained.
        Only a Judge can 'marry' a Container and an Item.

        Come on, guys!  This isn't hard!  You do it every day,
        and it doesn't require extra objects or complicated
        code.  I usually teach it when I teach Composite,
        though I always try to point out that it is much
        more generic than Composite.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm going to explain what Ward said.  It is obvious
        that people did not understand it.  In my 
        opinion, Ward's mistake was that he was too abstract.
        A single example would have explained his point better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose a Component knows the Composite it is in.
        Composites always know their Components, but
        sometimes Components know their Composites, too.
        Then the Component will have a "container" instance
        variable, and Composite will have a "components"
        instance variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that an error might cause A to be a
        component of B, but B is *not* the container of A.
        In other words, the back pointer is messed up.
        How can you make sure this never happens?
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard solution is to make sure that there
        is only one operation for changing the pointers.
        Actually, there needs to be two, one for adding a
        component and one for removing the component.  This
        operation is usually on the Composite, i.e. you
        send addComponent: to the Composite to add a component
        and removeComponent: to remove it.  The Composite must
        inform the Component that it has a new container.  The
        code looks like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        Container>>addComponent: aComponent
      </p>
      <code>
        components add: aComponent.<br/>
        aComponent container: self<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Container>>removeComponent: aComponent
      </p>
      <code>
        components remove: aComponent.<br/>
        aComponent container: nil<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Component>>container: aComposite
      </p>
      <code>
        container isNil | aComposite isNil<br/>
        ifFalse: [self error: 'circular reference'].<br/>
        container := aComposite<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The only problem with this solution is that the
        container: message should be private, and
        there is no way to make it private.  Of course,
        this is not a problem in C++.  In fact, if you make
        the container variable protected, you don't even have
        to add an accessing function for it, because the
        Composite can access it directly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There *are* times when you want to make an object to
        represent a relationship, but the simple way is the
        right way 95% of the time.

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I think there's an important pattern here, because as
        Ralph points out:
      </p>
      <code>
        - We do it every day.<br/>
        - Good teachers teach it.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, I think I see two problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 1, Multithreading Requires a Single Mutex
        Semaphore.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a multithreaded environment, it may be critical that the
        lines of code Ralph's example execute without interruption:
      </p>
      <code>
        components add: aComponent.<br/>
        aComponent container: self<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        One way to ensure that these lines execute in critical
        section is to make a singleton (which I call a Judge)
        responsible for these lines.  Initialize the judge with
        a mutex semaphore, and have the judge execute the above
        instructions as a critical block.  This is an effective
        way to ensure that all container/component marriages
        pass through one mutex semaphore.  We don't want every
        container to have its own semaphore, we only need one,
        held by a singleton who stands outside and above all the
        containers -- the judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 2, True Symmetric Relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ralph's example illustrates the case Ward mentions, where
        'one object is known to be responsible and the other
        delegates to it.'  Not all relation pairs allow this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relations we're talking about, such as 'contains' and
        'isContainedBy' are normally inverses.  For integrity,
        we want to ensure that whenever aRb, then b(R inverse)a.
        For example, whenever a contains b, b isContainedBy a.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some relations, R and (R inverse) are the same.
        This is called a 'symmetric' relation.  Marriage is an
        example, where the relation isMarriedTo is the same as
        its inverse.  If a isMarriedTo b, then b isMarriedTo a,
        if our links are correct.  A Person class might have a
        spouse attribute, and the following setting method:
      </p>
      <p>
        Person>>spouse: aPerson
      </p>
      <code>
        spouse := aPerson.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        We can't add the line:
      </p>
      <code>
        aPerson spouse: self<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or we'll get an infinite loop.  We can solve this problem,
        but we need a different approach than the one used for
        nonsymmetric relations, such as in Composite.  An advantage
        of a Judge pattern is that it works for both symmetric
        and nonsymmetric relations, in pretty much the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we always use Judge singletons to marry the links of
        objects related by relation R and its inverse,
      </p>
      <code>
        We shed light on an everyday pattern.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        We help developers to avoid problems with messed<br/>
        up back pointers.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        We can use the same pattern for both symmetric<br/>
        and nonsymmetric relations.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        We allow related links to be connected in critical<br/>
        section.<br/>
      </code>

        hence different patterns;<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
           - you should adopt a simplifying naming convention in all but the simplest case.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I have seen at least two papers written on, roughly, "Modeling Relationships".  One was an IBM Tech Report, if you have an excellent research library you can search for it and find it.  James' paper may be easier to find.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is making this simple discussion not converge is that how you implement a relationship differs greatly depending on the requirements of your situation, i.e., the forces acting on you.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case I, the simplest case, you make one-way knowledge.  Object A knows Object B but not vice versa.  I have met people who simply refuse to put a two-way relationship in their system because they believe it is impossible to maintain its integrity over the life of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case II, you decide you must have two way links, and to guarantee consistency, you make only one published access point.  You tell object A to add object B, then A tells B that its new partner is A in an unpublished (you can't make it private) method.  Ward wrote this case, and Ralph commented on it. I have adopted the convention, to make my code easier to understand, that I always prefix the unpublished method with 'note'.  So I would write
      </p>
      <code>
        components add: aComponent.<br/>
        aComponent noteContainer: self<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        to remind strongly that that noteContainer is not a recommended public method.  The 'note' prefix becomes especially useful in case III.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case III, you decide you want to be able to change the relationship from either end - examples being  parent/child, hubby/wife or employer/employee.  Maybe you don't like having a programming rule that says one always has to tell the employer first.  That may not be natural, or whatever grounds you choose for needing two-way access.  Then life gets very complicated if you don't have a convention like the 'note' prefix (see 'spouse' example above).  In the hubby/wife relation, you get 4 methods:
      </p>
      <code>
        Man>>wife: w  --does-> self noteWife: w.  w noteHubby: m.<br/>
        Woman>>hubby: m --does-> self noteHubby: m.  m noteWife: w.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Man>>noteWife: w  --does-> wife := w.<br/>
        Woman>>noteHubby: m --does-> hubby := m.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that this also fixes the recursion problem in the spouse example 
      </p>
      <code>
        Person>>spouse: p --does-> self noteSpouse: p. p noteSpouse: self.<br/>
        Person>>noteSpouse: p --does-> spouse := p.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Case IV is the one Steve is interested in, in which you decide you don't want to play those games, so you introduce a relationship object, some call it an associative object, Steve calls it a judge object.  Neither A nor B know about the other, only the judge knows about both.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now you start over again, asking whether A and B should know the judge as well. There are another 3 cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, there are 4**3 combinations of who knows whom, at least 10 of which are potentially interesting, and of which 4 designs are commonly implemented (one-way, two-way, judge knows both but niether knows judge, judge knows both and both know judge).  Which you use depends on what your particular requirements and philosophy are.  There is, therefore, no "pattern" to ask for, or there are 4 or 10 or 64 patterns to ask for. or there is one pattern with the table of 64 solutions to ask for.  Steve is right, Ralph and Ward are right, James is right - and you are all talking about different things, so the conversation won't converge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teaser for me out of this is, what does this situation say about patterns?  I regularly find myself in such a situation, where there is one entry point to a pattern and many possible solutions, depending on the particular strengths of the various forces.  I personally feel uncomfortable about using the word 'pattern' in such a case, because I somehow want to use that word for more stable, universal patterns, not just an entry into a table of solutions.

        <a href="ThankYou.html">ThankYou</a>!  I'm not a big fan of patterns, and this was the first time I've found some useful ideas for programming by examining them.  This pattern has shown up many times when I've designed initialisation of large object systems (I use a lot of production pipelines, where every object knows its immediate neighbours, and the components from the pipeline should be possible to change at will).  
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to make the relationships artificially hierarchic and form the pipeline in initialisers: for example, a protocol_handler's initialiser just gets a connection_handler as an argument and not vice versa, and calls connection_handler's notification method about the new protocol_handler.  But then I reverted these to use a function that is not member of either, i.e. connect_protocol_connection, which calls the notification method of both.  Much cleaner, IMO.  I wouldn't use an object as this "neutral" part, though.

        Nowadays that I mostly do functional programming I tend to use <a href="CoRoutine.html">CoRoutine</a>s for the same stuff.  But reading this has been very enlightening in any case.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, in the elaboration above it was implicitly assumed that in the Judge case, A and B don't know each other directly.  But this need not be the case; they can very well know each other directly, and use the Judge only to update their relationship. It might even be worthwhile to use a global Judge for all maintained relationships.

Of course, this happens under conditions of considerable freedom. It will tend not to happen, when we are copying, too closely some known pattern, or some previously worked out design.
