        Staffing Economics Versus Theoretical Elegance
      </h1>
      <p>
        Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this long-running debate theme that's been tugging at this wiki for years. (See <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a> for an example.) I believe that excessively abstract programming is un-economical to a good many organizations because it makes it more difficult to find staff that can read their existing code. Poorly abstract code (such as copy-and-paste programming) may slow down maintenance, but not being able to grok it can outright halt production, which is often viewed as the greater evil by management (for good or bad). <strong>Two factors are fighting against each other: 1) long-term average productivity, and 2) risk. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Even some of my own code has been called "overly abstract" in at least 3 organizations I worked/contracted at, thus I'm not trying to protect my style: it's a real concern in real organizations. I shall call it the "<strong>abstraction halt</strong>" as a working term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many organizations value people skills and domain knowledge just as much as technical ability in coders such that they are not going to go out and hire better caliber programmers and sacrifice the other two factors. Managers eventually realize that a certain level of abstraction is the Goldilocks Region of abstraction such that it produces a sufficient level of productivity without risk of an abstraction-halt. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Maybe your code was "overly abstract" (though I don't know what that means, actually), or maybe your critiquers were idiots, or maybe they were merely trying to tell you -- in as polite and ego-preserving a fashion as possible -- that your code was unreadable or awkward.  (You didn't try sticking all the code in a table, did you?)  None of these provide any indication as to what is, or is not, an appropriate level of abstraction.  Done well, a given level of abstraction should always improve readability, if for no other reason than it -- by the definition of "abstract" -- means there's less irrelevant detail to consider.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           On paper that "sounds right", but in practice it doesn't work that way. Different coders are tripped up by different things, and over time one gets a feel for what's "safe" and what's not. I don't know why such grokking patterns exist, they just do. That's just the way human coders are.  And it wasn't TOP (<a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>) that was the most frequent complaint, but merely too many levels of functions or general indirection. (I tended to avoid TOP outside of <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, where I learned early it was not appreciated. A good many <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> contractors were just fine with TOP and used it themselves.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Weak coders are tripped up by many things.  I don't think abstraction can be singled out as a cause for up-tripping, or even considered more likely to trip up weak coders than, say, wholly concrete up-trippers like C format(...) strings, interacting with Web services, configuring an Apache2 .htaccess file, and so on.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Different people are tripped up by different things. Most intranets are on IIS, not Apache, in my experience, such that internal coders didn't have to deal with Apache config. IIS used to be almost plug-and-play, but because of breaches, Microsoft is gradually making it more like Apache, such as switching off services by default, such that web service configuration experts are becoming separate from programming. Or one just hosts "on the cloud" where the common web-oriented behavior is ready to go. And if one specializes on C they learn C's idiosyncrasies. However, most internal custom business app shops don't use C, but rather Microsoft and a handful of other tools, such as Delphi, Paradox, Oracle client tools and PL/Sql, etc. For non-mission-critical apps, Microsoft is by far the most common tool set, for good or bad (VB, Dot-Net, Access, Office VBA). One has to kind of target a lowest-common-denominator of abstraction, or at least around the 75% percentile, roughly. In other words, don't use a technique that is likely to trip up more than 1/4 of typical developers who would walk in the door based on existing company profile and hiring practices. -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>You're actually bothering to quibble about a list of almost completely random examples?  WHY?  Who cares what's used where?  I simply picked examples likely to be recognised by every reader, but Office VBA has just as many gotchas as anything else.  The point isn't the examples themselves, but the concept they illustrate -- that abstraction is no more likely to trip up weak coders than concrete complexity.  It's complexity that trips them, not abstraction.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I have to partly disagree. I've seen coders able to handle "spaghetti code" well, but were tripped up by abstractions I thought were relatively straight-forward. The quantity of parts does not seem to be the primary factor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Spaghetti code isn't any more "complex" in a technical sense than a ball of string, because it's the same thing -- GOTO -- over and over.  There's no variation or variety.  It's simplicity taken to the point of ludicrousness.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I suppose "complex" is a tricky word to tie down the exact meaning of, barring a pet metric. And by "spaghetti code" I didn't mean GOTO in particular (it's an overloaded term). It could be over-use of global variables with goofy side-effects, having multiple functions with different signatures that do the same thing, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>By the way, shouldn't this be </em>StaffingEconomicsVersusTheoreticalEvidence?  Elegance is merely one facet of theoretical evidence, which also includes parsimony, simplicity, composability, flexibility, reusability, readability, extensibility, power, expressiveness, safety, and so on.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One can have a theoretical model of <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> also. I admit I am at a loss for a better single word to place on the concepts that tend to generate the controversy of issue, but have yet to find a better alternative to "theoretical elegance". -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But nobody's arguing in favour of theoretical elegance, so how can it be versus staffing economics or anything else?  Theoretical </em>'evidence<em>' can, on the other hand, be considered either in opposition to, or support of, empirical evidence.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, we'll probably have to consider each issue on a case by case basis. The term "theoretical evidence" is <strong>too broad</strong> for our use. The economic-meets-wetware evidence I often use can also be considered "theoretical evidence": I establish economic and wetware models as approximations of reality and likely human behavior and then optimize the parameters to maximize the "good factors" of those models. But since those models have not been empirically established, they are only "theory". Psychology is often "theoretical evidence" also. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I mean "theoretical evidence" solely in terms of </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>.  Theoretical elegance is something else -- usually (in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>) meaning algorithmic symmetry or beauty.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Symmetry or beauty" is pretty much the same as "elegance" in my book.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, that's what I wrote.  Nobody's arguing about staffing economics versus symmetry or beauty.  I've never seen anyone on this wiki argue for anything on the basis of symmetry or beauty.  Theoretical </em>'evidence<em>' is about parsimony, simplicity, composability, flexibility, reusability, readability, extensibility, power, expressiveness, safety, and so on, and gives only glancing notice to elegance.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Parsimony is about the only metric we agree on, but very few agree that "code size" should be the overwhelming factor. The rest are often subject to personal views or conflict with each other such that they cannot all be optimized at the same time. Something that's <strong>flexible can also confuse</strong>, for example. Grokkability (readability?) is important. See <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>. Lisp is very flexible and "compact" in terms of syntax and language rules. But it has confused typical developers for 50 or so years. Some of those goals conflict with grokkability. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Parsimony is not just about "code size", but about overall simplicity.  I make no claims as to the importance of, or any other ranking of, the various categories of theoretical evidence, other than to state that theoretical evidence is important and significant evidence.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Outside of code-size or something very similar, it's difficult to define objectively. "Overall simplicity" as a phrase in English is highly subjective if code size is not included. And I disagree they are all nearly equally "significant". I'd like more evidence to support such a claim. Further, most are tied to grokkability anyhow. If the maintainer cannot grok it, they are not going to get much reuse out of it, for example. If they cannot grok the "safety" features enough to use or fix them, they may hack a work-around that is uglier than not having the safety feature to begin with. <a href="KissPrinciple.html">KissPrinciple</a> thus sometimes facilitates safety even more than explicit safety features. Pretty much <strong>all roads go through grokkability</strong> first, making it a cornerstone. -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a maintenance programmer cannot figure out the abstractions(s), the project is dead in the water; stuck! The other issues may create annoyances or temporary slow-downs, but rarely get one outright stuck. A business will often choose to have say 5 slow-down events over one outright stuckage event. Stuckages get the developer and his/boss hauled onto the carpet to explain what went wrong to the upper echelon. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Level of abstraction is but one type of theoretical evidence, and by no means the only one.  Yes, sometimes degree of readability or grokkability is at odds with the level of abstraction.  An abstraction based on </em><a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>, for example, would probably be beyond anyone without the appropriate background in <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>.  Deciding what is an appropriate basis for using or rejecting a tool or technique is something a good project manager does on a case by case basis.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, case-by-case basis. However, there are some general common patterns and business true-isms; and techniques that risk confounding typical future maintainers are an orange flag. Using the <em>existing</em> staff as your reference point is taking a fairly big risk. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How do you objectively identify the "techniques that risk confounding typical future maintainers"?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unfortunately, one has to go by experience and anecdotal info from trusted colleagues. I know of no formal studies, either way.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>However, I agree that using existing staff as your reference point is taking a big risk.  You risk undue limitations.  For example, whilst many currently-employed programmers won't have been educated in </em><a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> and abstractions like <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a>, almost every new <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> or <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> graduate will have extensive exposure to both.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging based on estimated future trends is riskier than basing them on the current situation. I see no evidence the pool of skills is significantly changing. The proportions I typically encounter in non-IT businesses are <strong>roughly split evenly</strong> between:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No degree: self-tought or college drop-out (including associates degree)
        </li>
        <li>
           Trade schools (with names like "IT Systems & Business Intelligence Institute") 
        </li>
        <li>
           Other majors (math, engineering, biology, philosophy etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Software engineer or computer science degree
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you can identify an industry trend that's changing this mix, please do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I can only speak for trends in the UK, but there are currently two significant industry-impacting movements:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The first is a growing government recognition that </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and programming are fundamentally important, to the point that school children will now be taught <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and programming as part of the national curriculum, starting in September 2014. (See <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10410036/Teaching-our-children-to-code-a-quiet-revolution.html)">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10410036/Teaching-our-children-to-code-a-quiet-revolution.html)</a>  From the employer's side, I attended an employment conference a few years ago where I did a straw poll of about fifteen major national and international employers -- none of whom were IT per se (though one was a CPU manufacturer) -- and all required <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> or EE graduates and <strong>strong</strong> technical skills in addition to business knowledge.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The second is a general movement, over roughly the last decade -- in both IT education and IT practice -- from the rather amorphous "user support" and soft skills like systems analysis, to a highly-technical focus on databases, data management, data analysis, customer insight and business intelligence.  Students who once would have been taught to support Excel and draw ER diagrams -- or would know even less, coming from a non-technical background -- are now taught a variety of programming and reporting tools like Qlikview, SAS VA, Cyberquery, Cognos BI, etc., and are expected to be able to use them effectively.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, here in the USA, the Republican Party strongly balks and attempts to block any federal "government interference" in commerce, including education. The education profile of IT workers has generally not significantly changed over the last 3 decades (since the microcomputer revolution). The proportion of CS graduates to other types of IT education has generally remained the same in my observation. Some states are <em>considering</em> making programming a standard high-school course in that state, but so far it hasn't ramped up. I'm not sure that would change anything anyhow, since it's only an introduction. -t

        One of the problems with lots of levels of indirection is making an exception to the rule. If you use mostly copy-and-paste, then an exception to the rule is simply a spot change. However, function calls require a way to specify that a particular instant gets slightly different treatment. Simple OO inheritance is not powerful enough because the difference may not be "tree shaped". And many languages don't make it easy to have named optional parameters such that one has to change every existing function call to get add new behavior (parameter profile). There are ways to make code better able to handle exceptions to the rule (variations on a theme), but everybody has a different favorite way and some ways confuse different coders, especially if not coded well (including poor variable names, lousy comments, etc.) -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Making an exception to a rule is hard no matter how you have to do it, though needing to make an exception in an abstraction suggests the abstraction wasn't right to begin with.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's always a problem with abstractions. The existing case set may not be sufficient to build an abstraction able to handle future changes in the abstraction. The business world is filled with "soft" and dynamic abstractions such that you WILL often get it "wrong" on the first try. Related: <a href="EightyTwentyRule.html">EightyTwentyRule</a>, <a href="AreBusinessAppsBoring.html">AreBusinessAppsBoring</a>. One is not modelling something stable like physics or math, but rather the world view of the customer/managers; and they change.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, that's a problem with exceptions, or with programmers lacking understanding of the role of abstractions.  Abstracting a customer category is generally doomed to failure -- it's not abstract, it's just an arrangement of characteristics.  Abstracting a style of report or a type of form is likely to be highly successful -- it is abstract.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I disagree that abstracting CRUD well is a trivial undertaking. The potential for variation or tweaking to fit specific requests is pretty large such that a CRUD tool that handles everything will be so large a mass wad of configuration as to overwhelm most. Instead, most CRUD tools assume certain UI styles and conventions to cut down on being a God CRUD Tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Who said it was a trivial undertaking?  Anyway, the key to abstracting CRUD well is composition, </em>'not<em>' configuration.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There appears to be some confusion here. What did you mean by "type of form"? Hierarchical "types" are often too inflexible in my experience. Future variations on a theme are hard to predict here also. The deeper one's Grand Abstraction, the more fragile or confusing-to-change it may be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are different types of forms.  E.g., dialogue box, master-detail, master-detail-detail, master-master-detail, and so on ad infinitum.  Attempting to encapsulate all current and future form requirements via a "mass wad of configuration" is doomed to a quick failure.  Instead, forms can be effectively composed out of smaller parts, like assembling a house out of </em>LegoTM bricks, except instead of bricks you have panels, searchbars, navigator bars, selectors, menus, popups, toolbars, etc., and ways of combining and recombining them into reusable components.  Most GUI toolkits already embody this strategy; it's a matter of extending the strategy to include forms, reports, and all the usual CRUD-oriented UI components.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hierarchical decomposition (parts, sub-parts, sub-sub-sub-parts, etc.) often sounds like a wonderfully simple idea on paper, but integrating them all to work smoothly as a unit is often not a trivial task, especially when the screen view is very different from the underlying database tables, as often happens with legacy systems. For example, it's generally not efficient (nor ACID-friendly) for each field/widget to communicate with the database on it's own. Thus, it must somehow coordinate or participate in coordination with other widgets and objects to communicate with the database in the appropriate way at the appropriate time, including validation concerns. And sometimes updates to the content of one widget will need to reflect on another. These kinds of <strong>cross-cutting concerns</strong> are not trivial to coordinate and are rarely purely hierarchical. Lego bricks are an unrealistic analogy, except as a rough starting point. Further, managers/customers often want to cram as much as possible on one screen/page. This requires fine-level control over many features that "generic" or "overly smart" widgets may not have or do well. (Cramming may be a UI design smell, but it's what they want and they have your paycheck.) One finds that multi-dimensional (cross-cutting) concerns are usually the bottleneck even outside of CRUD and that any hierarchical/nested/compositional arrangement is only a starting reference point--a scaffolding upon which to wire up and tune the cross-cutting concerns, which is where most of the coding, tweaking, debugging, and hair-graying work takes place in terms of time. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, programming is challenging.  I've been developing CRUD-screen tools since the 1980s.  It </em>'is<em>' possible to "integrat[e CRUD components] to work smoothly as a unit", and I agree that it's not a trivial task, but it's certainly do-able.  I did it.  I based a successful career on it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Successful at what? Implementation specific CRUD-intensive applications, or devising lasting and "good" CRUD frameworks? Either way, I have no way of inspecting their quality to see if they are as nice as you claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Successful at both.  I developed lasting and "good" CRUD frameworks and used them to build CRUD-intensive applications.  Whether you would consider them "nice" or not is irrelevant.  My colleagues, employees and I found them "nice" enough to be competitive.</em>

        In a way, I think that I'm agreeing with Top here.  There are many shops where it's easy to out-abstract the rank-and-file programmers.  Sometimes that's for a bad reason: management doesn't care, or is just looking for <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a>.  Sometimes, it's because you simply can't hire enough smart geeks: you need hundreds if not thousands of programmers to build your operating system and/or New World Order.  And sometimes, the best programmers for the jobs are poor to mediocre geeks who have other skills you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        I once interviewed for a position at a Finite Element Analysis shop; the guys who make the software that figures out how fast you can run your engine before the piston heads come flying out.  They were a FORTRAN shop considering a move to C++.  The vast majority of their coders were people with PhD's in mechanical engineering and/or physics backgrounds.  Maybe one in five considered themselves software developers, and they were there to write the glue and try to refactor the spaghetti that the engineers wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was exactly as it was meant to be.  Certainly the programmers didn't know enough to program the solutions the company needed; they needed domain experts.  You could out-abstract them easily, even though they may even be smarter than you, because that's just not how they think.  And especially in engineering apps like this (and expecially fluid flow simulators), you still care more about calculations per second than elegance of expression, and would rather have fast spaghetti than slightly slower beautiful code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where I work, OTOH, is a credit card processing network.  Our domain experts don't have to write the code themselves, and the speed of our code isn't so critical--calculation time is dwarfed by disk and network I/O.  We can afford to hire very good programmers, because we can work with several dozen, not several hundred of them.  With all that, reaching for a higher abstraction isn't such a bad idea, so long as the tests still pass.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't need Mongolian Hordes of programmers, if your can afford to have your coders be programmers first and domain experts second, and you aren't in a maximum performance or minimal hardware environment, then higher abstractions can quickly reduce the cost of adding your next feature.  Lots of us on this board live in that world, or at least imagine that we do.  Those not in that world are going to care more about other concerns, like not confusing the people that they have.

        I believe part of the problem is that some <strong>evaluate the code itself</strong> before or instead of looking at the big picture from the business perspective (owners, customers, managers, etc.). If you look at the code for "good design" alone, then you are evaluating its value through your own eyes, not that of the organization or other maintainers. How other actual maintainers will react to the code is a very important, if not <em>the</em> most important factor in judging code. -t

        You have to examine how much productivity you're gaining by "coding down to" the lowest denominator.  I've been on a project where there were several programmers who were deeply, fundamentally confused by the code; they simply couldn't understand it.  They might have been capable programmers in some other life, but they didn't grok it there, and they made no actual effort to learn.  They complained for months, and contributed nothing to the project.  Meanwhile, the three programmers who understood what was happening produced tens of thousands of lines of working code.  If we had written down to the lowest common denominator, we would've been abandoning many things that allowed the successful delivery of complex functionality in favor of--what?  Dynamic web page coding out of 2001?
      </p>
      <p>
        The company could've done better just hiring the three programmers who were capable of understanding the abstractions.  We were sufficient to get the work done (as demonstrated by the fact that we got work done), and would've been better off without the friction of contractors complaining that they didn't understand why we would write unit tests or what a "validator" is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I never suggested targeting the LOWEST common denominator. I don't know where you got that idea from. There is a "goldilox" level </em>'somewhere in the middle that is the best balance<em>'. I don't know the details of your particular project so cannot comment on that case, such as comparing potential alternatives. I also don't know whether the reason for some member's difficulties were due to project requirements or coding/design style choice imposed by others.</em>

This wiki is filled with ivory-tower academics, often devoid of real-world experience and knowledge of economics, who dismiss empirical science and testing using a wide range of excuses, often ranking designs on criteria they personally find intellectually titillating, not focusing on what owners and customers want out of a tool.

It's like an accountant demanding a mechanical engineer explain why car clutches are made of metal instead of wood.

        Software *is* heavily about economics whether you want it to be or not. <strong>Economics interweaves with engineering</strong>. As a thought experiment, consider how you'd do a particular project if you had a trillion dollars and 10,000 years to spare on it versus how you would do it under typical circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        And clutches can be empirically tested per failure rates, with NUMBERS even!, so that we don't have to take the word of a con artist trying to protect his or her expensive services. And the accountant or market analysts can consider what defect rate is acceptable to customers. <strong>If you can't find a way to explain and measure the metal/wood issue in terms of something that customers and/or shop owners care about, then you are either lacking knowledge, or are a very poor articulator</strong> and shouldn't blame the customer/owner. (If safety issues come into play, that's another matter, but is STILL measurable with numbers, such as stress tests.)  None of your "evidence" produces numbers, just wordy bullshit. If there is a chain of logic, YOU lost it and are unable to produce <a href="ItemizedClearLogic.html">ItemizedClearLogic</a>. If <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> has the answer, you are not extracting it in a proper format.

        If you had one, it is as obtuse as your other writing. If there is a "chain" of clear logic, list it rather than be some fuzzy impression in your head. (I've fleshed out the accountant analogy a bit.) Note that we should probably consider a patient accountant that's willing to spend the effort needed to do it right, not the typical accountant who has a tall in-box. Also, they may not be able to find all the relevant metrics by themselves, but rather rely on experts and end-users for suggestions, to be later pruned, ranked, and clarified.

        <em>I haven't yet worked in a place where the skill level was so variable that I couldn't code with the highest level abstraction capabilities of whatever language was prevalent, and not be well assured that every coder in the place could read and maintain my code.

           That differs from my experience. That is, the experience/skill level of developers has been highly variable in the 2+ dozen or so companies that I have worked for or contracted at. I should point out that most were not software companies: software development was not their end-product. A software company probably puts more emphasis on raw technical skill and less on the other factors I've mentioned because most won't be facing non-technical clients/customers/users/managers/owners directly. (IT shops are also generally more specialized such that the database expert isn't also expected to do GUI design, etc. They are thus pre-screened more narrowly and deeper. Somewhere we've had this discussion already.)

           Well, that perhaps explains much of our difference in experience. I've been gradually shifting toward systems analysis such that the domain and domain managers predominate many of the hiring decisions I witness. The orgs I work for seem to prefer departmental experts rather than a centralized development shop because they want the developers to be closer to the domain. If you are being judged on a wider variety of skills, then there will be less focus on coding alone.

        And, what is the probability that one will have to port Java to C#? <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a> suggests you don't up-front code for such scenarios unless it's fairly likely, otherwise one can play WHAT-IF all day to justify <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a>. Recently I've been working on a custom project tracker for a small work-group. I can see a potential future need for version control, a more flexible permissions control system, a custom field-selector report writer, among other things; but those are not current needs and adding all those would bloat up the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's interesting, but I'm not sure what it has to do with the above.  Particularly, why ask -- if only rhetorically -- what the probability is of porting Java to C#, and how is it relevant?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you say, "Look how well technique X made change Y easier". The probability of needing Y still matters. When making decisions we don't know the actual events of the future, and can only estimate. In this case Y happened, but that does not mean the probability of Y is 100% in the general sense. One sample point does not a trend make. I think you would agree that it's probably not worth designing code around an event that only has a 2% chance of happening (unless perhaps it's catastrophic) such that you agree that probability matters, at least to some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There was no anticipation when writing the Java code that it would be eventually ported to C#.  It could equally likely have wound up being ported to Modula 2, or Python, or Haskell, or PL/I, or Perl, or assembly language, or Lisp, or FORTRAN, or not being ported at all.  I didn't code the application with any intent that the code would later be ported, but if I had known it would eventually be ported, I would have written it exactly the same way.  Use of higher abstractions generally makes code more readable -- and therefore more easily portable, and by that I mean more easily re-writeable -- than lower abstractions because higher abstractions generally express intent more concisely than lower abstractions.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "More readable" varies widely between individuals and probably teams. And I've been bitten at times by higher abstractions when requirements changed way outside of their fit, at least domain-related abstractions. See <a href="EightyTwentyRule.html">EightyTwentyRule</a>.

        <em></em><a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> and the like aren't domain-related abstractions, they're programming language constructs.  As such, any requirements change that precludes using one programming language construct such as a <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a> is almost certainly a requirements change that requires a general re-write.  As for "more readable", one programming language construct is only less readable than another if you haven't learned it yet.  'For' loops are as mysterious as HOFs to the programmer who has learned neither.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        HOF's make a language or system closer to machine language, and if you build a kind of machine-language interpreter in your app language, then all you have to do is build another machine-language-like interpreter in the target language to simplify conversion. In that sense, you are correct. However, one of the reasons assembler and machine language was mostly abandoned for non-machine-intensive business and end-user applications was to introduce discipline and some degree of regimentation to coding. Some abstraction and indirection ability may have indeed been lost, but that's the price of civilizing development and staffing.

      <p>
        <em>How are HOFs "closer to machine language"?  I've never seen a machine language construct that directly implements closures, let alone </em><a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a>.

        I didn't ask for a general illustration. And perhaps I am just too stupid to apply such examples to my domain in a way that improves the app because I just can't, and the only examples you guys seems to apply that are domain-relevant appear to assume poor languages or poor API's. "HOF's are a great band-aide for crappy tools" is perhaps the lesson because I'm not learning anything else from such attempts. But why should I or any reader <strong>assume</strong> they do have some clear benefit for general custom business apps? Either you don't know the domain well enough to comment on it, or you are not smart enough to apply HOF magic to it <em>either</em> (outside of the band-aid pattern). We are both stupid, it seems, and the elusive Scenario Unicorn remains at large.

           <em>Programmers don't think in paradigms.  They think of language features.  No programmer is going to look at a Java lambda and say, "Sheesh, that's yet another paradigm I have to learn!"  They'll say, "Ooh, simpler event handlers!"</em>

           <em>Not in Java or C#.  In these and other languages, typical event handlers are activated by registering them or adding them to a container.

           When I first saw that approach, I and others found it awkward to expose the fact that they are registered with a listener etc. The wiring is hanging out of the box. Yes, people got used to it; <a href="QwertySyndrome.html">QwertySyndrome</a>. But it's still a <strong>poor design</strong> in my opinion. People getting used to it does not turn it into good design. (C# cloned a lot of Java intentionally to capture Java's audience back after they jumped VB for Java.) I know you disagree, you don't have to state that again. And my suggested approach <strong>doesn't preclude OTHER handlers</strong>, as already mentioned. It just simplifies the most common usage pattern, which good interfaces should.

           As I mentioned elsewhere, perhaps we can do away with FOR loops and replace them with a <em>regular</em> function (perhaps a base library function even). It's hard to do untainted experiments/surveys on such anymore at this point in history.

           <em>FOR loops are only an example of the fact that every language construct is unfamiliar until it's familiar.  To beginning programmers, </em>'everything<em>' is unfamiliar.

           Hogwash! "They'll get used to it" can be used to justify any awkward or non-optimal solution. In the long term, IT staff and related education is more productive if their tool conventions are judiciously chosen and the <strong>idioms are as orthogonal</strong> as reasonably possible. And while I agree that Lisp is very flexible, it is also too flexible in that it allows one to too easily reinvent similar idioms, losing the benefits of consistency. Flexibility and consistency do tend to be at odds with each other. I cannot necessarily spit forth clear general rules on how to always balance those, and thus use related experience to make judgement calls when making many recommendations.

        </li>
        <li>
           None of the C# shops I've been at use Linq. The DBA's refuse to help with queries if they are written in Linq. Besides, using a library that uses HOF's and using HOF's directly in apps are two different things.

        <li>
           [Your reference to <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> appears to be an irrelevant tangent. LINQ is a library that's primarily exposed to the user in the form of extension methods taking functions, i.e., higher-order functions. C# also offers a vaguely-SQL-like expression syntax for constructing LINQ queries, but this syntax is of equivalent expressive power and somewhat less composable than using the extension methods directly -- they're trivially composable as method calls may be chained -- so standard practice when using LINQ tends toward regular application of the LINQ extension methods, which necessarily accept functions as arguments. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
        <li>
           The fact that app devs CAN alter the code does not mean they will. It's still de-facto <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> to the majority of them.
        </li>
        <li>
           [Again, this appears to be an irrelevant tangent. I didn't suggest that app devs would "alter the code" implementing LINQ; there is no call to do so. Standard <em>use</em> of LINQ involves regularly making calls to the extension methods that compose its API, which are primarily higher-order functions. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
        <li>
           They are syntactically hidden from the app dev.
        </li>
        <li>
           [Um, if you use the SQL-like expression syntax, sure, but like I said that syntax is less composable than the method-call syntax, and use of the methods directly is supported, expected, and exceedingly common. The higher-order functions are perfectly visible when you use the extension methods directly. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
        <li>
           We have no evidence of usage rate among such options either way. Linq exists, that I'm not questioning.
        </li>
        <li>
           [The extension-method syntax is used sufficiently often to be relevant: It's used throughout the codebases I work on personally, it shows up in code samples all over MSDN, there are myriad Stack Overflow questions and answers that use it, and so on. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
        <li>
           That could possibly suggest it creates more confusion than normal. Things that are quick and easy to grok generally don't need a lot of documenting or Q&A, and thus their lack of mention is not necessarily reflective of their usage rate. They could also be mostly <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> developers. <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> developers need Q&A forums also.
        </li>
        <li>
           [Everything needs documentation. That's normal. Everything gets asked about on Stack Overflow. That's also normal. To presume a particular technique is inherently complex or confusing based on the presence of documentation is absurd. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm only saying it's a poor measure of actual usage because other factors could be at play. For example, can you determine even approximately what percent of those are app-side developers versus <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> developers versus academic projects?

        <li>
           As an end-user of it, yes, but how does this change anything relevant? SQL writers are end-users of RDBMS, which are <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a>.

        <li>
           [Sure thing. Writing LINQ queries is analogous to writing SQL queries. When you write a LINQ query, you express it in terms of higher-order functions. So, when you write LINQ queries, you are an end-user working with higher-order functions. -DavidMcLean]

           ["extension methods" are a C# feature that allows methods to be "added" to a type on-the-fly, similar to the monkey-patching feature in Ruby but somewhat safer due to being lexically namespaced.

Lisa, the project manager, decided to use Lisp.  Here's what happened...", etc.  Your example, "On March 7, 2009, Lisa Stevens said ..." is hearsay; you're not telling a story you experienced, but repeating a second-hand report from someone else.  Another name for it is "gossip".  However, with a little detail even gossip might provide some evidence.  So far, you've offered none.</em>

               I'm not seeing your point here. What comes after "here's what happened"? I cannot read your mind. If you mean statistical evidence that language X fails projects more than language Y, that's a different animal, and may be too large a granularity to tease out problems with specific features of languages anyhow (if that's what you are getting at). Try a COMPLETE mock example from head to toe this time.

               This topic is about staffing issues. If you want to ONLY talk about code size, then you are off topic.

Complaining about such repeatedly and redundantly over and over repeatedly and redundantly is quite annoying and a poor writing style. Please end that practice. <a href="LetReaderDecideEvidenceAgreement.html">LetReaderDecideEvidenceAgreement</a> is fair and reasonable.

        There are already discussions on the <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> of blocks versus GOTO. I don't need to repeat that here.

        I thought you meant the existence of loops in general. (And we could perhaps do away with FOR loops, per another discussion that I forgot the location of.) As far as HOF's, its best competitor may depend on the situation rather than be a one-to-one swap-out. That's why I want realistic business examples/scenerios to explore so that we can don't have to dance with general claims anymore.

        I’d like to take some time to explain why, in spite of all its qualities, Ruby on Rails will never become mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you probably guessed, my conviction <strong>doesn’t come from technical grounds</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you ever come across Smalltalk or Lisp programmers?  You know, these people who, no matter what you tell them, will always respond that "Smalltalk did that twenty years ago" or that "Nothing has been invented since Lisp".  They listen to you patiently with an amused light in their eyes and when you’re done talking, they will just shrug away your points and kindly recommend that you read up on a thirty-year old technology that was the last thing they ever learned and that has been dictating every single technical judgment they have offered since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that in ten years from now, people will look back at Ruby on Rails and will have the same reaction.  I’m not sure what Web frameworks we will have by then, but I’m quite convinced that a lot of the current Ruby on Rails fanatics will have the same kind of attitude:  "That’s nice, but Ruby on Rails already did this ten years ago, and better".
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, <strong>they might even be right</strong>.  But by then, it won’t matter because <strong>despite its technical excellence</strong>, Ruby on Rails will still be a niche technology that <strong>only experts know</strong> about...
      </p>
      <p>
        I find [Ruby's] syntax and concepts extremely elegant and powerful at the same time...But it’s a complex language that contains a lot of <strong>advanced idioms</strong> which will be <strong>very hard for PHP and Visual Basic programmers to absorb</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [On Rails] Sometimes, too much magic is too much magic, and it can definitely be the case that the flow of code is too direct or <strong>too clever to be understandable by regular developers</strong>.  Developers were able to do the jump from imperative to object-oriented programming, but it was a hard fight.  I don't believe the Web world will ever be ready to embrace the Rails cleverness.

        <em>That's an interesting article, though now quite old.  What appears to have kept Rails from the mainstream is not its "cleverness" -- as much of it is now found in various mainstream languages and frameworks -- but slow performance, awkward integration with enterprise systems, poor and/or unprofessional documentation (how many Fortune 500 IT departments are going to trust their infrastructure to a system with docs written in a hallucinatory style by a guy named "Why the Lucky Stiff"?) and support-communities that seemed entirely populated by socially-inept 15-year-old boys.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who are best able to master symbolic languages generally tend to also be "socially-inept" and poor at writing and human interaction. Thus, the two factors may be related in terms of R-on-R. Symbol math and "people math" both consume a good many brain resources to do well, typically. Thus, it's difficult to master both.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's an interesting hypothesis.  If generally true, we should expect the Haskell community to display an exceptional degree of socially-inept writing and behaviour, given that Haskell is considerably more abstract than Ruby or </em><a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a>.  In actuality, the Haskell community is notably mature, socially supportive, and articulate.  By (anecdotal) contrast, the Borland Delphi and Microsoft Access forums I participated on some years ago were rife with immaturity, and nobody would accuse Delphi or Access of being abstract, let alone symbolic.  In short, I doubt there is any consistent correlation between a language's level of symbolic-ness or abstraction and its community behaviour.<em></em>
