        The Thirteenth Floor

        An excellent movie where programmers create a virtual reality computer simulation as real as the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>.

        There are plenty of buildings which leave this number out, annoying me to no end.  Superstition has no place in the twenty-first century. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>

      <p>
        <em>Indeed. It's bad luck to be superstitious.</em>

        An arrogant opinion followed by a well put answer. <a href="ThankYou.html">ThankYou</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [...followed by an equally arrogant put-down. You betcha. Exactly what <em>is</em> the place for superstition in the 21st century?]

        There is at least one hotel in Atlanta GA, USA that has a 13th floor.  And a room 1313.  I plan to stay in that room someday. --<a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        This movie is a perfect example of what happens when you pop an empty stack.

        Each floor a parallel instance of a plane of living, as it were, alternates of the other floors, having some sameness and much uniqueness. I prefer TheSeventhFloor, I don't know why!
