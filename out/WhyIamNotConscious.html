        Why Iam Not Conscious
      </h1>
      <p>
        There's been a spate of books recently attempting to explain the nature of consciousness. There are dualists and monists and verificationalists and gnostics, - the whole shooting match - all attempting to answer the question of the nature of consciousness, perhaps the most fundamental philosophical question most people think they are faced with.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't believe I'm conscious. Here's why.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nobody's been able to define consciousness particularly satisfactorily. Most appeal either to intuition or neurology, both unconvincing as bedrocks for this discussion. Along with the nebulous goal comes the nebulous arguments: the scientist with her conjuring tricks and freak shows, as well as a side-line in confusing falsehood with lack-of-evidence, and the intuitionist with his warm fuzzy hand-waving, and warm glowing feelings, and a side-line in confusing truth with lack-of-deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sand upon shifting sand, faulty towers are built towards heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought of what this reminded me of, and it was the issue in the middle ages of the nature of the <em>soul</em>. Historically, you can see the two issues as being closely related. I'm not saying that the steps in the arguments are at all similar, just the nature of the process. The issue also has, in the manner of discussion, a number of similarities to the classical form/matter distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, when philosophical or political traditions have fallen into trouble, they seem to resort to similar forms of argument: appeals to intuition or magic tricks covering the holes in the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This, I think (as best I can), at a more metaphorical level, is for me the nature of consciousness. It is much that our dominant cultural paradigm cannot structure in terms of the individual. When something becomes explainable, derivable, it seems to fall out of the conscious and become automatonic. Consciousness is the dirty secret behind our assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which paradigmatic assumptions? I don't know, I'm within them as much as you. Perhaps Eastern traditions offer alternatives to many of them, but it is just as likely that the two traditions coincide on some particular notion, and no historical footing is left for considering alternatives. But there is hope in that paradigms shift with time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I very much believe that any new paradigm will have its own hole, its own 'shameful scandal', and this is ours. Neurologists try to prove it is of size zero by removing things to the explicable mechanistic domain, and intuitionists try to paper over the cracks. Why not accept the flaw and work around it? Ignore the issue where it's not relevant, as it usually isn't (it certainly seems considerably less obtrusive than the 'soul', perhaps this was a motivation for the change).
      </p>
      <p>
        Consciousness for me, then, is a linguistic thing, the spare room full of junk you lock when visitors come around. Admit it. You'll always need one, and it'd be good if it were as unobtrusive as possible. It's a ragbag of leftovers and outliers from taxonomies, not something I have, biologically, but something conceptual/lingustic that I acquire when I acquire cultural paradigms.

        This seems very similar in its root to my own concept that consciousness is an illusion. However, I take a more <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> tack to it. The traditional concept of consciousness (<a href="FreeWill.html">FreeWill</a>, etc.) seems to me to contradict fundamental theories of physics, and if you assume consciousness does not exist, you don't end up with any external anomalies, only internal ones (i.e. I feel like I'm conscious). Those internal anomalies can be explained in two ways: 1) Consciousness really does exist and physics is messed, 2) consciousness doesn't really exist and my mind is playing tricks on me (which has been known to happen with optical illusions, etc.) By <a href="OccamsRazor.html">OccamsRazor</a>, the second option is more useful, and so that is what I believe. Besides, it gels nicely with the theory of evolution by natural selection.

        <em>Interjection</em> - how does #2 work? Why do minds get to exist, but not consciousness?

      <p>
        <em>What's wrong with consciousness as just an emergent property of various features of our brains? (Such as, which should be OK with both of you, our language modules.) Consciousness can at least be identified as the </em>'I<em>' symbol; the consistent pattern of thoughts that are evoked when we say "I am" or "I think" or somesuch (as well as on an almost continuous basis whenever we are thinking of just about anything), and which appears to be a universal symbol among members of the human species.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In evolutionary terms, it seems obvious that the ability to distinguish between "self" and "not-self" has adaptive benefits for organisms which have the ability to alter their immediate environment.</em>

      <p>
        What if we could get <a href="DavidChalmers.html">DavidChalmers</a> involved in this one?
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you mean, get him involved? Chalmers summarily (and correctly) dismisses the idea that consciousness could have an "evolutionary explanation". See <em>The Conscious Mind</em> chapter 3, section 6. I doubt he is going to waste his time here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The suggestion was made regarding the general topic, i.e. consciousness being illusory, rather than any evolutionary issue. ... Sometimes it's worth asking or enquiring about things one may not think possible ....

      <p>
        I for one hold to the opposite point of view, namely, that consciousness is an axiom and therefore not subject to "proof": I am conscious, and that's that. If I were not, then I would be unable to believe any ideas at all, much less "prove" them, so I <em>must</em> believe that I am conscious, as a precondition of any proof, or of any belief or knowledge whatever. I can't say "I see X" or "I know Y" and deny the existence of the "I" which sees and knows. That would be a <a href="StolenConceptFallacy.html">StolenConceptFallacy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people say, "Consciousness is proof of the supernatural," and others say, "That's right; so, in rejecting the supernatural, I reject consciousness." I think that's a false alternative. Consciousness exists, but it is nothing supernatural; it is a natural phenomenon (in humans) and should be ultimately susceptible to natural explanation. There is no evidence that the usual supernatural explanations are true (or even plausible). I expect that physics and other sciences will someday explain <em>why</em> people are conscious, and explain precisely what <em>conditions</em> are necessary in order for consciousness, in general, to arise and exist - but in order for scientists to even <em>investigate</em> such matters, they must start with the idea that there is something to investigate - that consciousness is real. And if they ever <em>do</em> explain it, the explanation won't erase consciousness: science can explain things, but it cannot "explain them away." Realizing that a table is made of molecules does not make the table an "illusion." We merely know more about the table than we did before. So it will be with consciousness.

        And, of course, there's a lot of empirical evidence that consciousness exists, whether we have a precise definition or not. :)

        How can you do one without the other? But more to the point, we know about all sorts of stuff for which we lack a precise definition. I can't define "potato" but I can pick one out at the grocery store. Similarly for the vast majority of things that people know about. Some fundamental things might not be definable (non-circularly) in terms of other things at all, but that doesn't stop us from knowing about them. For example, I couldn't tell you definitions of "left" and "right", and perhaps no meaningful definitions of these things are possible, but I know which side of the road to drive on. (Defining them in terms of angles doesn't count. I'll just ask you to define the angles, and so on until you run out of definitions.) -- <a href="BenKovitz.html">BenKovitz</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        What is there to consciousness over and above behavior? I think this is kind of what <a href="DanSheppard.html">DanSheppard</a> is getting at. Clearly, it's not stuff (either physical or soul-stuff): nobody's espousing a phlogiston theory of consciousness. So, if it exists, it must be some state of some actual stuff, and the actual stuff is part of our bodies (brain plus whatever else turns out to be needed).
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of behavior, let's look at how we use the word "consciousness"; that should provide a good (and uniformly accessible) starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
        I myself don't use the word at all; I will talk about people being "conscious", but by that I just mean "not asleep" - and I'd use the same term about squirrels, or whatever other animal with a sleep-wake cycle you'd care to name.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I think about thinking <em>a lot</em> - it's hard to write software and avoid thinking about thinking. So if I can think about thinking perfectly well without recourse to the term <em>consciousness</em>, it's not a very useful term, and I suspect it doesn't actually refer to anything.

        How do you guys use the term <em>consciousness</em>? -- <a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>

        Well, it's possible to be conscious, but not conscious <em>of</em> something...

      <p>
        This is tough. It's like trying to define <em>knowledge</em>. If you know something, but you don't know that you know it, then do you really? Can one be conscious without being self-conscious? -- <a href="WaldenMathews.html">WaldenMathews</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        To be awake is to be <em>reactive</em> and not conscious. One can do many complex tasks, including driving home from work, without being at all conscious of them.

        Okay, I'll bite.
      </p>
      <p>
        One writer commented on the possibility that physics would have to be "messed" if we are conscious, and that he preferred non-consciousness because it fit with "evolution by natural selection". Another writer claims that "nobody's espousing a phlogiston theory of consciousness". Unfortunately, what is being presented here is (unknowingly) doing exactly that. If you believe in modern physics and evolution, then eventually you will find that they lead to the equivalent of a "phlogiston theory of consciousness".
      </p>
      <p>
        But, first things first. I think that it is important for us to distinguish between knowing <em>that</em> we are conscious from knowing <em>how</em> we are conscious. I would agree that knowing <em>that</em> we are conscious is axiomatic. We presume it, and I do not think that we can escape the presumption. I also think that it is a very safe presumption. It is so fundamental, empirical, even obvious, that it is ridiculous to debate it. However, many will debate it anyway. I see no need. On the other hand, there is the <em>how</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the dispute over the <em>how</em> of consciousness seems fruitless due to its basis in speculation. Everyone seems to have an opinion, and the dispute quickly degrades into arguments over whose opinion is more authoritative. That is generally a useless exercise. Some of us prefer a "scientific" approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up until about a century ago, pursuing a "scientific" approach would be straightforward. But not today. Today, there is much disagreement over what constitutes a truly "scientific" approach. If two people can not agree on what constitutes a "scientific" approach, then one can not expect that they will ever agree on the "results" of a "scientific" investigation. There are three aspects of a scientific approach that seem most pertinent here.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, some people define a scientific approach as excluding supernatural phenomenon. They state categorically that supernatural phenomenon do not exist. Of course, if such phenomenon do exist, their statements to the contrary do not make it disappear. However, it does limit the usefulness and correctness of their approach. It seems that this viewpoint may have arisen as an eventual corruption of the realization that supernatural phenomenon may exist but can not be tested (essentially by definition). This leads to the second aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people have recently (last century) adopted the point of view that a scientific approach does not have to include testability and related characteristics. In other words, they redefine the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> to eliminate the model-test-revise process. Without the requirement to be tested, one's opinion gains relevance significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, in the process of redefining the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a>, an additional key characteristic was dropped. The new <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> no longer assumes (axiomatically) determinism. The redefinition had many other impacts, but this one is crucial and tends to be overlooked. Therefore, I will attempt to explain it carefully. Determinism is the assumption that natural processes operate consistently and predictably -- given the same conditions, a natural process will always produce the same results. Without determinism, experiments are not repeatable. If experiments are not repeatable, then testing is pointless. Obviously, this characteristic is closely related to testability. Determinism is what allows us to create chemical formulas and mathematical equations about natural processes. Determinism gives us the LawOfCauseAndEffect. Determinism is so fundamental that it tends to be invisible to most of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        These changes to the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> are neither new nor accidental. Those changes are a return to a philosophy known as Epicureanism (after the Greek philosopher Epicurus) or Atomism. One of its greatest spokesman, Lucretius, said:
      </p>
      <code>
        "Here too is a point I'm eager to have you learn.<br/>
        Though atoms fall straight downward through the void by their own weight,<br/>
        yet at uncertain times and at uncertain points, they swerve a bit --<br/>
        enough that one may say that they changed direction."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Epicurus assigned many other special characteristics to the newly invented but unobserved atom. But this amazing ability of the atom to experience an effect (swerve) without a cause (it supposedly causes itself) was leveraged to explain various phenomenon up to and including the <em>human soul</em> and <em>free will</em> (I think we can include <em>consciousness</em> in their intent).
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, <a href="NielsBohr.html">NielsBohr</a> (inventor of the BohrModelOfTheAtom) borrowed this concept to allow his orbiting electrons to execute a "quantum leap" -- to spontaneously (without cause) change orbit and energy level. This concept was also incorporated into the <a href="HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple.html">HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple</a>, a foundation of <a href="QuantumMechanics.html">QuantumMechanics</a> and, hence, the TheoryOfRelativity. Those are the foundations of modern physics and, hence, much of modern philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not a expert, but as I understand physics, </em><a href="QuantumMechanics.html">QuantumMechanics</a> is all about extremely small things, and the TheoryOfRelativity is about extremely large things. Moreover, physicists cannot yet combine the two theories into a single whole theory of everything. String theory is an attempt to combine the two. The <a href="HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple.html">HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple</a> (1927) is part of <a href="QuantumMechanics.html">QuantumMechanics</a>, but is not a foundation of the TheoryOfRelativity. (1905 Special Relativity, 1915 General Relativity)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is useful to note that the ancient atomists also said:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"But that no atom ever swerves at all from the perpendicular, who could sense and see?"</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        and
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Atomic nature all lies far below our powers of observation; hence since atoms cannot be seen, their movements, too, escape us."</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Contrasted with the earlier quote, it is apparent that the atomists maintained an OrthodoxParadox: they had never seen an atom, but they created the concept and used it to explain practically everything that they could see. Our modern atomists routinely do the same by advocating theories that exclude each other and contradict experimental results. They dress it up a little more, but not by much. Observe:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Thus, the inherent power of the atom to move by its own weight plus its equally inherent power to swerve from its normal path, plus its power to cling together with other atoms both like and unlike itself, plus the law of chance, can and do account, of and by themselves, without the intervention of any outside force or guiding intelligence, for every form of being that can be observed by one or another of our senses."</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Frank O. Copley, <em>Lucretius -- The Nature of Things</em>, <strong>1977</strong>.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Here we can see it all coming together. The motivation is to explain what we can see without reference to the supernatural (especially a SupremeBeing). However, they routinely observe phenomenon that can not be explained by deterministic natural processes. Therefore, they drop determinism and the LawOfCauseAndEffect. They lose testability in the process, so they redefine the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> so that they can state their opinions and still call it science.
      </p>
      <p>
        But have they really gained anything, or advanced humanity?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you accept that anyone who can talk is now a scientist, able to spout theories that can no longer be tested, then you are probably content. However, if you want the "real" <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> back, then you will not find very many people practicing it any more. And if you apply it to what is being spouted, you will find lots of noise and very little signal. Evolution is a perfect example. Go back and read what Darwin wrote. Did he really do much science?
      </p>
      <p>
        I realize that I have been verbose, and possibly I have overspoken. Much of this probably (eventually) belongs elsewhere. If the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> consents, we can discuss it further. I am content and prepared for however it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I have offended anyone, I apologize. I intend to challenge your assumptions and reasoning, not your person.

      <hr/>
      <p>
        You make a mistake when you say that testing is worthless when experiments are non-repeatable. Theories of history and astronomy can never be examined in the laboratory directly, and never could, but they do make predictions that one can go back and check. Darwin's theory is an example of science at its finest for this very reason - it can be tested, and has been tested, though the time scales are too great for us to work with, and the theory is not deterministic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determinism deserves a second note. Historical theories cannot be deterministic, simply because of the huge number of variables to consider. The appearance of the asteroid that caused the K-T extinction is a random event in current biological theory, and rightly so, since it lies beyond its scope. That does not make historical theories inherently unscientific, and that does not change that the universe as a whole might be deterministic. Whether or not it is, is an issue of some contention - see <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have we gained anything? Never mind precisely what ought to be called science and what ought not, for it matters very little. I think it would be hard to say we have not moved any closer to the truth, and I think that's what counts.

        I assert that the fundamental purpose and criteria of science is to explain how the Universe and its constituents work within the limits of human ability. Science, by definition, must resolve such questions, or at least make progress towards such a resolution. Anything that does not, is not science (it may still be useful though). I claim this as the universal and practical definition of science. Some people may nitpick it, but my observation is that essentially everyone means this when they refer to science. This is their expectation when considering the realm of science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, people desire scientific laws -- those reliable explanations of phenomenon upon which one can build a fortune or plan a future. To attain that status, an explanation must generate predictions that can be tested, and the explanation must have withstood such testing for a sizable time period (withstood the test of time). Before it reaches that status, it must first pass through the stages of hypothesis (relatively untested) and theory (tested, but still somewhat doubted). Notice that the status is always tentative -- an explanation can NEVER be unquestionably proven. This follows from the fact that an explanation can ALWAYS be trivially disproven: by providing a single verifiable counterexample. Such a disproof immediately robs the explanation of its previous status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Testability is not limited to the lab or, rather, the lab is the Universe. Therefore, some astronomical conjectures are (potentially) testable. However, humans can not travel into the past to perform tests. <em>We can not "...go back and check.." our "predictions".</em> <strong>Therefore, historical theories are an oxymoron.</strong> Instead, they are historical assumptions (suppositions, axioms).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="JoshuaGrosse.html">JoshuaGrosse</a>'s comments provide a good example of science falsely so called and of TheDumbingDownOfHumanity. Notice, for example, the OrthodoxParadox he gives concerning Darwin's theory:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Darwin's theory is an example of science at its finest for this very reason - it can be tested, and has been tested, though the time scales are too great for us to work with, and the theory is not deterministic."</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        If the times scales are too great for us and the theory is not deterministic, then how can it be tested? It is a theory, but it is also not a theory (the paradox). But, either way, it is supposedly an example of science at its finest (the orthodox).

        Is it fair to make comments at halftime? I think you are fundamentally misunderstanding what a prediction is. <em>Forecasting some unknown part of the present is as much a prediction as forecasting some part of the future,</em> it places just as much of a constraint on theories. So while we can't do experiments with large scale evolution, we can see what evolutionary theory predicts about (say) the foot structure of theropods, and then go find out whether we were right. As with theories that forecast the future, we can never be completely certain, but we still have the same method of hypothesis-testing available to us, and I do not think anything you said above disqualifies that from the sphere of science.
      </p>

        Evolutionary conjecture such as "predicting" the foot structure of theropods is NOT <strong>pre</strong>-dicting or <strong>fore</strong>-casting. It is far more like playing Monday night quarterback, second-guessing how the game would have turned out if the quarterback had played it "right". Both are after-the-fact (note the prefixes <strong>pre</strong>- and <strong>fore</strong>-) and untestable. With both evolution and football, there is no way to resolve who is correct. You can ask a billion people what they think about both and you can get a billion answers, and you have no <em>reliable</em> way to resolve them down to the <em>correct</em> answer. <strong>In such cases, you are not engaging in science and you will not resolve the question. You are engaging in an opinion poll.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="JoshuaGrosse.html">JoshuaGrosse</a>'s example of the K-T asteroid is similar. How can anyone actually resolve that question (and all the questions that it begs)? If you can not repeat the event (testability), and you can not go back in time to observe the event (first-person account), then you can not resolve such questions about the event (generally including whether the event occurred at all). Yet <a href="JoshuaGrosse.html">JoshuaGrosse</a> presents the event as an unqualified fact! This sloppy thinking and careless presentation are what I am talking about; even the best "scientists" of today engage in such activity, basing their conjectures on the similar behavior and results of their predecessors. And you blindly buy it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Explanations concerning such things as the theropod foot structure and the K-T asteroid, even the big explanation "evolution", are conjectures, opinions, suppositions, assumptions, axioms. They are adult fairy tales. They are not laws, theories, or even hypotheses. When they take on the level of orthodoxy exhibited here, I say that they have graduated to mythology and religion. Evolution, in particular, is an OrthodoxParadox that you either accept or not. It does not fall into the arena of science; it is outside the range of questions that humans can directly investigate and resolve.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is easily demonstrated by the lack of scientific activity that accompanies such conjectures. Where is the acknowledgement of the assumptions being used? Where is the raw data, available for all to review? Where is the presentation of the reasoning that leads one from the assumptions and data to the conclusions? Where is the discussion of how the conjecture may be falsified/verified? Where is the occasional acknowledgement that the presenter has reached a boundary of scientific inquiry, where human limitations prevent further progress?
      </p>
      <p>
        Two people arguing for their favorite conjecture about some ancient event or unobservable phenomenon is NOT hypothesis testing. It is simply arguing. It will resolve nothing except that they are foolish enough to engage in such arguing. The fact that you claim not to be able to see anything in what I have said that disqualifies that as science is my point - science as it was originated has nearly disappeared along with the quality of thinking and education. Today, when you point out a fallacy in somebody's statements, they are more likely to think that you are making a sexual innuendo rather than be able to follow the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I DARE YOU</strong> to re-read the sources of your favorite "scientific theories" and evaluate them in the terms that I have presented. I am confident that most of my readers have never read, or even seen, an original source document for any of the major "scientific theories" that they believe. Go buy a copy and read it. I expect that you will find that we are far further from the "truth" than you currently believe. However, then I would at least hope to have an interesting discussion with some meaty content. OrthodoxyIsMonotony.

        By the way, I am now certain that this discourse does not (solely) belong here. However, I do not know where it does belong.

        Thank you for not reading what I wrote. If the foot structure of a theropod is not known before the prediction is made, then it is forecasting - not of what its foot will be, but of what the outcome of the experiment of examining its foot will be. <em>It is a method of falsification.</em> And yes, I have read one or two sourcebooks presenting historical and evolutionary theses, and yes, better ones do present raw data, reasoning, and frequently though not always admit when something is undecidable. I'm not sure where your invective is coming from but it does not match up with the real world, and without further points will not be refuted again.

        I read your comments regarding theropods carefully and repeatedly over the course of a week; I responded with several paragraphs. Your additional comments help illuminate the disconnect between us, though. You assert that examining the theropods' foot constitutes an "experiment" which can falsify one's "predictions (forecast)" of its structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Exactly</em> how does looking at a few bones constitute an "experiment"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Exactly</em> how could this "experiment" falsify one's "predictions"?
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you justify redefining the terms <strong>prediction</strong> and <strong>forecast</strong> so that you can use them to describe an activity (specifying the foot structure) that occurs <em>several million years (evolutionary model)</em> after the last living theropod died (ending the opportunity to actually examine the foot structure)?
      </p>
      <p>
        One could make any claims about the theropods' foot structure that one pleased, and there is no way that they could be falsified. Some may scoff at some proposals and some may acclaim others, but none of the proposals can be verified without an intact theropod foot (preferably several). Many of the proposals would be unverifiable without a living, moving theropod. Likewise with the K-T asteroid, etc.
      </p>

        The threat to respond no further is simply to ensure points are not repeated ad infinitum, please don't take it as a personal insult. If you want I'd be happy to elaborate. In commenting on theropod feet specifically, I was thinking of this. The bones in bird feet have an intricate arrangement not shared by other modern vertebrates, with enough independent peculiarities to be exceptionally unlikely to have evolved twice. Now I advance a theory that theropods are not related to modern birds but are in fact closer related to modern lizards. To help verify this (of course I can never prove it true) I could go look at their feet. If I find a theropod whose feet show the same peculiarities as those of birds, my theory is untenable. I can get feedback on my theory, I can falsify it. I see nothing to complain about.

        <em>What is the alternative? I agree that 'science' is often thought to be based in some reality rather than opinion, but we know this cannot be the case. Since it is a fiction, we can ask what science tends to be. Well it turns out to be a set of mutually consistent (mostly) opinions of the world, based on some number of observations. It doesn't produce truth in the normal sense. Therefore an appeal to authority is all we have, be it the authority of experience or the authority of others' experiences. </em>

So consciousness definitely exists for those who label it so; it is unlikely, however, that it has the properties assigned to it (e.g. freewill). -- </em><a href="RichardHenderson.html">RichardHenderson</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly, very little thought is required to see that "the label exists". It's much less clear that you can see so easily that "it points at something".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We experience something we label consciousness. That is what the label points at. The experiences themselves cannot be fabricated, but they can be misinterpreted.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We experience a whole lot of stuff. We wave vaguely at it and say "there, that's consciousness". I don't think it's clear that there's any thing that the label "points at", or that if there is it's any different from, say, "being human". Doubtless, the experiences themselves cannot be fabricated (though I'm in some doubt as to what that statement really means), but consciousness is alleged to be, not the experiences themselves, but some unspecified common quality that they have, or some unspecified context in which they are set. It's legitimate to debate whether <em>that</em> exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that people who say things like "I am not conscious" or "there is no such thing as consciousness" are not denying the experiences. As for lacking the properties it's usually ascribed, I reckon that "Consciousness exists but doesn't have any of the properties usually ascribed to it" is much the same as "Consciousness does not exist". Compare "God exists. He's a small piece of adhesive tape stuck to my desk, has no special powers or metaphysical status, had nothing to do with the creation of the universe, and is no more entitled to be called good than any other piece of adhesive tape." I'm not sure why Richard singles out free will, though.

        I wholeheartedly agree that science is inherently infused with opinion - science is a human activity and humans are ridiculously far from infallible. You mentioned reality, upon which I would like to expound. We should remember that humans perceive reality filtered through our very limited senses. We are easily confused or deceived. We have very limited computational and cognitive abilities. Compared to the vastness and complexity of the Universe, we are completely inadequate to provide an explanation. Nevertheless, I assert that it is useful to try.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your comment that we are only left with an appeal to authority is quite appropriate and well said.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, how can you assert that consciousness exists for those who label it so, then assert that it is unlikely that it has the properties (such as free will) assigned to it? If we create consciousness by asserting it, then we must be able to create its properties by similar assertion. And we would be outside the realm of science since we have apparently adopted a purely metaphysical view. On the other hand, if consciousness exists in the realm of science, then your claim that it is "unlikely" to have certain properties seems quite unscientific and out of place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your claim that science consists of a mostly mutually-consistent set of opinions based on observations is certainly the widely-held view, but it is an OrthodoxParadox. When science was young, it was valid. However, it is no longer so.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mutually consistent aspect disappeared primarily during the last century with the advent of the <a href="HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple.html">HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple</a>, <a href="QuantumMechanics.html">QuantumMechanics</a>, the TheoryOfRelativity, and related conjectures. These proposals contain explicitly-known inconsistencies and contradictions among themselves, and relative to other theories and even laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        While science still consists of a set of opinions, the quality of the opinions has degraded radically.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, they are hardly based on observations anymore. Very few scientists actually conduct experiments anymore, especially in the arenas being debated here. Also, it has become uncommon for a scientist to share his raw data anymore. While this seems intended to prevent other scientists from pre-empting his success, it has the additional consequence of severely limiting their verification. Indeed, it has even become easy for "scientists" to completely fake their "discoveries", as many recent hoaxes have revealed. It has also become common for "scientists" to conduct their "research" by building on the results of other scientists, without suitable understanding and verification of the underlying observations. Good scientific opinions can not be generated from bad or missing observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, the quality of the reasoning behind the opinions has dropped. Opinions can be evaluated on a quality spectrum regarding their scientific usability. This is the essence of the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> -- observe, create an opinion that explains the observations, devise an experiment to verify the opinion, repeat. Very good opinions become hypotheses, theories, then laws. Today, opinions seem mostly constrained by their media value rather than their scientific value. Cleverness is valued over content. Timeliness is valued over timelessness. Obtaining grants and keeping tenure is valued over purity and real progress. In the past, it seems that a certain high quality of thinking was exercised that prevented such opinions from prevailing. Today, it seems that such high quality of thinking is rarely being exercised, and nonsense prevails.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, the number of opinions and opinion-makers has dramatically increased during the last century. Our collective ability to filter them has not kept pace at all. I would love to be involved in a project that would apply today's technology in an attempt to address this. However, I think there are many obstacles, mostly non-technical, that preclude it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, the idea that science is still being practiced primarily as you described above is an OrthodoxParadox. It is acceptable to think and say so (the "real world" mentioned above by <a href="JoshuaGrosse.html">JoshuaGrosse</a>), but it is exactly opposite of the reality (the actual practice observed in our companies, media, and academia). As is somewhat evidenced here, if one chooses to pursue real science in an unorthodox direction, one will find strong opposition -- but one will find essentially no money, no tenure, no support, no publication. Without those, one finds progress difficult and the audience tiny. The orthodoxy will then justify itself because of one's lack of progress and audience!
      </p>
      <p>
        That science has degraded to non-science (both in content and in process) is the main point of my comments on this page. This is the hard thing to hear, the diverse viewpoint, that I challenge you all to consider. I do not care if you agree with me (I prefer that you do not), but I eagerly await someone with the ability and desire to find the weak points in my view. I must assume that such weaknesses exist since I am also human, yet my humanity implies that I can not find them on my own.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Some very weak points: Contrary to your statements above, each of relativity and quantum mechanics are perfectly internally consistent. There is some difficulty in getting the two to match up, but the problem is now not so much a lack of solutions as an over-abundance (eg the several different theories), which we do not have the experimental data to distinguish between - and any decent publication on them will admit as much. Elsewhere, observations still play a key role in most scientific theories, and most experimenters do in fact make available huge quantities of raw data. Especially in fields like biology and archaeology.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do have some good points about the unfortunate amount of opinion in some modern science and the difficulty of challenging scientific orthodoxy. There are many cases where orthodoxy has left over baggage that is hard to get rid of. But your statements about theories being evaluated solely on media appeal are wrong. Certainly, interesting and new ideas get more press, especially in pop sci but also in journals, but they rarely end up as the mainstream position unless they have significantly more ground to them.

      </p>
      <p>
        You cite the existence and prevalence of transistors as <em>verification</em> of <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>. But you could not be further from the truth. Transistors have nothing to do with <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>; their existence and prevalence is an excellent verification of ElectromagneticTheory. Likewise, the rest of our wide variety of technologies are dependent on and provide verification of ElectromagneticTheory. I doubt that you could find a single product on the market that has anything to do with <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>. Indeed, I doubt that you could find any significant <em>practical</em> discussion of <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a> anywhere. For all practical purposes, <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a> is irrelevant to the real world. Because of that, there has been little cause or opportunity to officially falsify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the <em>supposed</em> <strong>perfect internal consistency</strong> of both <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a> and the TheoryOfRelativity, allow me to re-burst your bubble. As I described in detail above, both of these <em>theories</em> contradict the LawOfCauseAndEffect due to their reliance on the BohrModelOfTheAtom (and perhaps more). Also, for example, they model electrons as mathematical points - <strong>zero volume</strong>. Tell me how you get a <em>finite electrical charge</em> into <em>zero volume</em>, giving an <em>infinite charge density</em>? This is not an oversimplification, it is what the <em>theories</em> actually require. Supposedly, most scientists working with these <em>theories</em> are aware of the inconsistency but simply ignore it.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Demonstrating severe misunderstandings here. You may not be able to find products on the market that show quantum mechanical effects, but cloud chambers and superfluids aren't exactly rare. There is no logical inconsistency in having infinite charge density, and you can't claim that there is a physical inconsistency unless you know for a fact that such things are impossible in the real world, which you can't possibly. In fact, the claim that the Bohr model of the atom somehow violates causality is so absurd that one wonders if this whole discussion is based on that all too common reason for criticizing modern physics, a simple failure to grokk its basic concepts.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I was not specifying products that <em>show</em> quantum mechanical effects; I was commenting on the example (transistors) of products that supposedly <em>verify</em> <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>. Cloud chambers do not show or verify quantum mechanical effects - they are based on simple physics and just happen to be used in related "research". As stated, cloud chambers are indeed not rare. However, superfluids are most definitely rare. They are claimed to demonstrate behavior dependent on <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>, hence they may help verify it, but there are no products even remotely available based on that technology. <strong>Thank you for demonstrating my point with your two examples</strong>; cloud chambers are a good example of the many products that people think of as demonstrating <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a> when they in fact have nothing to do with it other than common (mis)association, and superfluids are a good example of a technology that <em>may</em> demonstrate <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a> but for which there are no products. I challenge you to find a single significant commercial product that directly depends on <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a> for its proper function.
      </p>
      <p>
        The logical and physical inconsistency of infinite charge density comes from the fact that we <strong>know</strong> that it is not true. We know that an atom occupies a non-zero volume, yet Bohr models it as zero volume anyway. For some purposes, the difference is unimportant and the model is usable. But for many purposes, the difference is significant and our continued use of the model becomes questionable. For <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>, the difference is absolutely critical and our continued use of the model becomes damnable. The Bohr model is a model that we know that we are misusing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The claim that the Bohr model violates causality is NOT absurd, nor a failure on my part to grok its basic concepts. As I mentioned (far) above, the violation of causality is an explicit characteristic of the Bohr model that was intentionally adopted by <a href="NielsBohr.html">NielsBohr</a>. It is well documented and well known by those of us who have actually bothered to grok its basic concepts. Indeed, there is even a sci-fi television series based on it that is named "Quantum Leap" after the characteristic of the Bohr model upon which it is based. Who is failing to grok the basic concepts?
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding my ability to claim an inconsistency unless I know for a fact that such things are impossible, I assert that you are engaging in one of the most basic of fallacies -- reversing the burden of proof. Everything that we know about our universe tells us that infinite densities are unreachable (even a black hole has a non-zero volume). The burden of proof rests with <a href="NielsBohr.html">NielsBohr</a>; he made the (indirect) assertion that an infinite charge density is reachable, even commonplace (every electron!). No one has ever observed such a phenomenon, yet he asserts it, and you support it, nonetheless. That is not science. It is nonsense.

      <p>
        What if we admit that some things are undecidable (free will, the nature of consciousness, Big Bang, and other goodies)? We only need to be worried about the quality of arguments when the next guy tells us he solved such a problem. We can assign some empyric undefined probability (it is <em>likely</em> that free will exists because of this evidence, or it is likely that the universe started with the <a href="BigBang.html">BigBang</a>), we can have faith that if a phenomenon repeatedly conformed to a specific model, the next time it will happen it will still conform. It's only a matter of language and how we can get together (believers / non-believers, optimists/pessimists, materialists/religious/agnostics) without wasting time in debates over the side issues. We certainly need a great deal of good faith and principles so that nobody will advertise his ideas under false labels (proven, demonstrably, blah, blah).

        Admitting that some things are undecidable is an excellent alternative, and it is exactly what I am advocating.

        <em>"Of course no-one will ever be able to decide what a theropod foot was really like..."</em> - you vehemently claimed exactly the opposite in the discussion above, Josh. Most people would require that experimentation must, by definition, grant the ability to make such a decision (at least to some degree). That is the essence of falsification (the disproving part). Your acknowledgement that such a decision can never be made is an admission of my point - that the theropod's foot structure is not subject to experimentation. If it is not subject to experimentation, then discussion of it is outside the realm of science. You can't have your cake and eat it, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I never said you couldn't make any decisions, just that you can't prove a particular model is correct. You can't interpret my statement that proof is impossible as a statement that disproof is impossible and then criticize me for supposedly being inconsistent in my claims falsification is possible!</em>

        Regarding textbooks, I probably should have included the public media and high school as well as college, since you and many of the other contributors seem to be relying on what you can remember from those sources. I am disappointed that a math major does not have a better grasp on the concept of "proof" and on the distinctions between conjectures, hypotheses, theorems, and laws. Such a grasp would help prevent the wild assertions that you (and others) have presented here.

        <em>Yeah, right. I don't suppose it has occurred to you that when everyone has a different concept of proof than the one you are trying to advance, it might be you that is mistaken?</em>

        <em></em><a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a> is NOT one of the best verified theories ever<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I doubt there are any theory that is verified to the level as <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>. For example, the agreement between the calculated result based on QuantumElectrodynamics and experiment is something like 1 part in 10^8 (or is it 10^10 or 10^13? Need to look it up).

        <em>You cite the existence and prevalence of transistors as </em>verification<em> of </em><a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>. But you could not be further from the truth. Transistors have nothing to do with <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>; their existence and prevalence is an excellent verification of ElectromagneticTheory.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        AFAIK, ElectromagneticTheory (or any classical non-quantum theory) cannot explain a transistor (based on semiconductor), you need the tunnelling effect of <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a> to get the exponential dependency between the gate voltage and the resulting current.

        The response from <a href="OliverChung.html">OliverChung</a> is another wonderful example of what I am talking about -- he makes a statement, throws out a number or two, and then claims to have said something significant. <em>The "calculated result" of what, Oliver???</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if the experiment that Oliver is referring to has produced good results, that does not necessarily mean that it verifies <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>. Not even if the experimenter asserts as much. Tying the experiment to <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a> is a separate exercise requiring a proper line of reasoning to justify it. Oliver obviously did not do that here, nor did he report any useful information about someone else having done it.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Having dealt with that, allow me to address the more fundamental question that has been raised. What exactly justifies the title of <strong><em>"best verified theory ever"</em></strong>? It has been mentioned several times, and it appears to be rather important to several of the contributors here. Let's talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been thinking about this subject extensively during the two months that have passed since Oliver presented his little tidbit above. Just recently, I received the latest issue of a newsletter that provides a perfect response. Please allow me to quote a bit at length from an article by Dr. Charles W. Lucas (Ph.D. in Physics):

        <dd><strong>Principles of Logic and Criteria Undergirding Science.</strong></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Since the days of the ancient Ionian, Greek, and Roman natural philosophers, the role of logic in guiding science toward truth has been clearly understood. The most celebrated example of this was <a href="EuclidOfAlexandria.html">EuclidOfAlexandria</a>'s "Elements". Natural philosophers considered the development of a scientific theory as analogous to the proof of propositions and theorems in Euclidean Geometry. Some of the rules of logic that have been continuously held for thousands of years are as follows:</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>1. No scientific theories are allowed based upon postulates or assumptions known to be false.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>2. No scientific theories are allowed that cannot explain all the valid relevant experimental data.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>3. All scientific theories must be self-consistent with one another.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>4. All different types of valid measurements of the same quantity in science must be self-consistent with one another.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Since the discovery of the infinite range of the gravitational force between massive particles and the discovery of the infinite range of the electromagnetic force between charged particles, an additional rule has been added, i.e.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>5. All scientific theories must acknowledge in a self-consistent way the mutual interaction and interconnectedness or unity of all parts of the universe - Mach's Principle.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>The famous philosopher, mathematician, and physicist Henri Poincaré added an important logical criterion for fundamental theories. According to logic, each fundamental theory in science may have one or more fundamental constants associated with it. No two fundamental theories may employ or use the same fundamental constant. If they do, one of them is not fundamental. In the case of Special and General Relativity, the fundamental constant is <em>c</em>, the velocity of light. Since <em>c</em> is also the fundamental constant of the larger theory of electrodynamics, Poincaré argued from logic that Relativity is not a fundamental theory and that relativistic effects are merely electromagnetic effects with an electromagnetic explanation.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Since in Quantum Theory the quantized energy <em>E = n h v = 2 n h pi c / lambda</em> also involves the fundamental constant <em>c</em>, one can also argue that Quantum Theory is not a fundamental theory and that quantum effects are merely electromagnetic effects with an electromagnetic explanation.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Einstein's General Theory of Relativity also incorporates <em>c</em>, the velocity of light, in explaining some gravitational effects. Thus, Poincaré predicts that gravity is of electromagnetic origin as well as the correction terms due to the General Theory of Relativity.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Dr. Lucas then discusses numerous experiments and developments over the last two hundred years that demonstrate his points. Among those developments is his ability to <em>explain</em> and <em>predict</em> the values on the Periodic Table of the Elements. <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>, etc. are forced to present those values as axioms, since they can neither explain them nor predict them. <strong><em>Did you know that???</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nope, because it isn't true. Except for atomic numbers, which serve as the independent variable, and cosmic abundances, which require a broader theory, the parameters on the periodic table all come out of the machinery or easily could if we had better tools for calculations. The assumed values are all things like the mass of a proton and the strength of the electromagnetic force, which are common to all elements so don't matter for the above claim.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The bit about all sorts of theories being electromagnetic because they use c is assuming that this constant is at heart electromagnetic. It isn't in most models. Rather, it has to do with the way space and time relate, and will appear naturally in any relativistic theory, of which Maxwellian electromagnetism is a part.</em>

        <dd>This paper references key experiments, theoretical developments, and arguments from logic that are to form a new working foundation for modern physics which is based on Classical Electrodynamics. Some long-standing errors in classical physics have been fixed so that the corrected theory acknowledges particles to have finite sizes in the shape of toroidal rings formed by helical filaments of charge. The new and improved version of electrodynamics appears to satisfy all the rules of logic that undergird the Scientific Method. In its current rudimentary form, this approach is able to give the first holistic description of the atom -- including its nuclear structure and spins, blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the emission spectra of atoms. This new approach in physics is logically superior to relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics Theory (QED). In addition, it explains the electromagnetic origin of gravity and gives many correction terms to Newton's Universal Law of Gravity without invoking the General Theory of Relativity.</dd>

        Here we see that Dr. Lucas presents a solid basis for evaluating scientific theories. I assert that a <strong><em>"best verified theory"</em></strong> must meet all these criteria, plus it must have stood the test of time. This means that is must have been around for a long time (centuries to millennia seems appropriate), and it must have been readily accessible to a wide variety of people for testing. Such a theory will naturally have become known as a <strong><em>Law</em></strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only law to meet that criteria seems to be the <em></em>'LawOfCauseAndEffect<em></em>'. <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>, Relativity, etc. do not meet even the basic criteria for a scientific theory, so they are hereby disqualified and disproven. Some elements of those "theories" (the truly scientific and verified portions) would properly become subsumed into the fundamental new model of Classical Electrodynamics.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>So, Lucas makes up some criteria, dismisses all the work that previous people have done, and pushes some theory of his own in their place. This is, believe it or not, a big warning sign that the person in question is likely a crank* physicist. So are claims to explain everything - the universe ain't that simple - singling out aspects of theories like virtual particles as "unphysical" (whatever that means), and </em>especially<em> not providing any equations. I'm sure you can find a detailed criticism of Lucas' model somewhere or another, and I'm sure you'd be interested in doing so if you are genuinely interested in the way the universe works. I'm not going to provide one, since I got tired of criticizing poor physics a long time ago, but someone else is welcome to take over.</em>

        By the way, I retract my earlier claim that this discussion does not belong here. Indeed, we have come full circle. Physics took a wrong turn as it began its attempt to explain free will, consciousness, etc. back in the time of Epicurus. Dr. Lucas and others have returned us to a solid understanding of science, and revealed that discussions of consciousness et al are interesting, but they are not science. Likewise, much else that gets presented as science does not stand when evaluated under reasonable criteria. Much of the detail of this content does belong with discussions of science and the particular theories, in addition to here.

        The Nucleus of an Oxygen O-16 Atom
      </p>
      <p>
        The nucleus of an atom is located in a small volume at the center of an atom. The nucleus of Oxygen-16 is shown here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern science asserts that the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Since protons strongly repel each other, the Strong Force was invented to hold the nucleus together. Unlike other forces, the Strong Force does not decrease with the square of distance between the objects of force.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the CSS model of the nucleus, a geometrical packing scheme for electrons and protons describes the shells of the nucleus. A common feature of a shell is the "triplet" structure consisting of an electron and a small proton on either side of the electron (as illustrated by the nucleus of Oxygen).
      </p>
      <p>
        The CSS model accurately predicts the nuclear "magic numbers" and explains the physical origin of nuclear spins and the liquid drop features of nucleides.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CSS model correctly predicts the spin (angular momentum) in hundreds of nuclides, whether stable or unstable. Quantum nuclear shell models cannot do this with so few assumptions.

        <em>Rational argument isn't of much use here.</em> Mostly agree. It can be of use but we must step outside of our rational world, which can never reveal the whole truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we know we cannot <strong>know</strong>. Pages like this reveal intelligent arguments interesting as they are, ultimately are self-referential and lead in circles.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is useful? We open our minds and <strong>feel</strong>. This takes practice, it can be enlightening and disturbing. Feeling also does not reveal the whole truth. This is not a trade off, we don't discard our thinking but we recognize that balance is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a 3-way balancing act, knowing, feeling then leads us to <strong>do</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes together, you know it, you feel it and you act true what you know and following how you feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is <strong>useful</strong> to me. <em>Am I conscious?</em> - I really don't care. <em>Am I living?</em> - this I care about and I am exploring what it means for me to be able to suck the marrow out of life. -- <a href="PaulCaswell.html">PaulCaswell</a>

        <em>Eventually, </em><a href="NielsBohr.html">NielsBohr</a> (inventor of the BohrModelOfTheAtom?) borrowed this concept to allow his orbiting electrons to execute a "quantum leap" -- to spontaneously (without cause) change orbit and energy level. This concept was also incorporated into the <a href="HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple.html">HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple</a>, a foundation of <a href="QuantumMechanics.html">QuantumMechanics</a> and, hence, the TheoryOfRelativity.

        Even if you say, "well <a href="NielsBohr.html">NielsBohr</a> didn't say that; someone else added that to the model later," it still crumbles your evidence for the assertion that modern physics and modern philosophy are irrevocably entrenched in non-scientific assumptions. Maybe he knew the electrons were jumping, but couldn't explain why with the tools available to him at the time. One can create very useful knowledge from unexplained, observed phenomenon.
