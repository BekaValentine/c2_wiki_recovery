        Stories For Slow Readers
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm looking for recommendations.  A friend's child
        has been slow at learning to read, and now they're
        in a Catch-22 situation.  Anything at the right
        reading level is too childish, but anything that's
        sufficiently exciting and engaging is too advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please, suggestions welcome for books and stories
        in which the language is simple, but the stories
        aren't too childish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks.
      </p>

        <em>How about the Limony Snickett (sp?) series? Also </em><a href="NeilGaiman.html">NeilGaiman</a>'s Coraline. I also recommend The Railway Children.<em></em>
