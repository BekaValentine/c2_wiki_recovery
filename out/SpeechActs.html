        <em>In certain situations, then, we vocalise in order to send messages through the air to other members of our species. Such situations are speech events.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In the approach to the analysis of speech events termed speech act theory, the message sent, the content of the communication, is a form of human action. This action is not the act of speaking, but an act we perform by speaking -- a speech act.</em>
