        OOPSLA is changing as of 2010 -- OOPSLA is becoming SPLASH 
      </p>
      <p>
        SPLASH:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Isn't just a new name for our favorite conference-SPLASH has a new charter and mission: To bring together practitioners and researchers who are passionate about software, programming, design, and software engineering to explore the frontiers of software and software practice. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Takes most of its name from OOPSLA: <strong>S</strong>ystems, <strong>P</strong>rogramming, <strong>L</strong>anguages, and <strong>A</strong>pplications: <strong>S</strong>oftware for <strong>H</strong>umanity. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        OOPSLA:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Original mission of understanding and promoting objects has been mostly achieved with the pervasive adoption of objects, though is still a lot of work to do there. But 
        </li>
        <li>
           Has always exceeded its mission-being an engine for innovation and incubating important new ideas related (even remotely) to objects. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Has helped spawn multiple technologies and conferences including the Unified Modeling Language (UML) MODELS conference, Agile, Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), Onward!, <a href="WikiSym.html">WikiSym</a>, <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> and the <a href="PatternLanguages.html">PatternLanguages</a> of Programs (PLoP) conferences, and the DynamicLanguages Symposium (DLS).
