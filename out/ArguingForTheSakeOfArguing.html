        Arguing For The Sake Of Arguing
      </h1>
      <p>
        Not sure if there are some other patterns that are similar on this wiki already, but <a href="ArguingForTheSakeOfArguing.html">ArguingForTheSakeOfArguing</a> is when one makes an argument just for the sake of arguing. There is almost no reason to argue, and yet the person engages in arguing because they want to argue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some <a href="DevilsAdvocate.html">DevilsAdvocate</a>s will argue for the sake of arguing, to spur on heated debates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some "arguments for the sake of argument" might even lead to <a href="ViolentAgreement.html">ViolentAgreement</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare with UnintentionalArgument. This may happen if you just talk about something (<a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a>) and someone misunderstand this as a critique of something. Before you notice you might be drawn into a heated discussion finding yourself in the position of the <a href="DevilsAdvocate.html">DevilsAdvocate</a> or <a href="SaintsAdvocate.html">SaintsAdvocate</a> even though you don't really want to place or see yourself there. But by someone arguing X and <a href="BifurcationFallacy.html">BifurcationFallacy</a> you unintentionally argue for not X.
