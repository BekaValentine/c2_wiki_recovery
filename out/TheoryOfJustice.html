        A work of political philsophy in the SocialContract tradition. Rawls argues that a just society is one that is arranged according to principles that would be agreed upon by people who did not know what their place in society would be Rawls' term for this the Original Position, and that such decision-makers are acting from behind the <a href="VeilOfIgnorance.html">VeilOfIgnorance</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Rawls concludes that the principles that rational decision-makers would agree upon are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Each individual should be provided with as much liberty as is compatible with an equal amount of liberty for all.
        </li>
        <li>
           Inequalities may exist so long as they benefit the least advantaged first.
        </li>
      </ol>
