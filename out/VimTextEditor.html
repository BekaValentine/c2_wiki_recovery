        Vim Text Editor
      </h1>
      <p>
        Vim [<a href="http://www.vim.org]">http://www.vim.org]</a> is an open source clone of vi, the de facto standard Unix text editor.
        Actually, it does lots of things that original <em>vi</em> doesn't;
        the name stands for <strong>v</strong>i <strong>im</strong>proved. Or maybe <strong>vi</strong> i<strong>m</strong>proved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, the acronym VI stands for Vim Imitation. ;)
        Or Very Impossible.

        Vim (<a href="http://www.vim.org)">http://www.vim.org)</a> has natively a rather cumbersome extension language, but you can compile it with an embedded Python interpreter, a Perl interpreter, etc.. Python definitely counts as a "modern O-O language".

        I believe you can also use Ruby, if that's your sort of thing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The 'native extension language' called (I think) Vim script works quite well, it's just a little ugly. You can use Python (or Perl) but for editing work there's usually no need - the editor itself has a myriad of builtin features that are very powerful.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The developer release of Vim 6.0 has the following of the features bulleted above:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Virtual Edit Mode
        </li>
        <li>
           Column Cut and Paste
        </li>
        <li>
           Fill Selected Area (including column(s) with Char)
        </li>
        <li>
           Delete Selected Area (including column(s))
        </li>
        <li>
           BadAss regular expression support
        </li>
        <li>
           Hex editing thingy
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And I've edited 200Meg files with it just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Heck, I have edited MS Word files with it. ;-)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is there some trick to this? Do you run them through antiword? Because Word files appear to not be text-based...</em>

        I'm using VIM 6.1, but it has a remarkably difficult time displaying (and colorizing) non-trivial XML files.  (7/26/2002)
        I'm often forced to fall back to Notepad.  <em>(Ick!!!)</em>

        <em>Err, ah, you could just turn off the syntax awareness feature.  I mean, really, </em>'notepad??<em>'  Extreme Masochism?</em> -- <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>

      <p>
        If you have xmllint installed, try formatting your XML markup with
      </p>
      <code>
        :%!xmllint -format -<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Aside from nicely indenting the XML, this will restore Vim's speedy syntax coloring (which apparently depends on line length). When working with large, unformatted XML files, I generally turn off auto-highlight for XML, then turn it on selectively.
      </p>

        You can turn off syntax highlight with :nohl

        What about <em>Vigor</em> instead?
        <em>No. Vigor does not belong here, as it is based on nvi.</em>

        Vi Improved. An excellent implementation of VI, the venerable <a href="UnixOs.html">UnixOs</a> editor that originated at <a href="CalBerkeley.html">CalBerkeley</a>. It has lots of improvements and extensions over the original VI (hence the "Improved") and is available freely (<a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> and free as in <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>). If you don't want to build it yourself, there is almost certainly a binary available for your particular platform (nearly every <a href="UnixOs.html">UnixOs</a>, <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>, <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>, etc.).

        <em></em><a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>, at least, comes with Vim included, accessible from the command line. Just type "Vi" at the prompt in whatever shell you use.<em></em>
