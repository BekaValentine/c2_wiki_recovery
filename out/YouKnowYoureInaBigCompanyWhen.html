        You Know Youre Ina Big Company When
      </h1>
      <p>
        As someone who's worked in small companies all his career, moving to a larger company produced a whole series of <a href="DilbertMoment.html">DilbertMoment</a>s.

      <ul>
        <li>
           You say your employer's name, and everybody stares in shock and awe. "Wow, he works for this megacorporation!"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You sometimes find youself saying "my boss's boss's boss's boss's boss".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You need a whole group of employees just to help the engineers figure out how to use the code repository.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Corollary: You use a code repository that requires a whole group of experts on staff just to figure out.
            </li>
            <li>
               It's based on <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> (which only a BigCompany can afford...)
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Subcorollary: You work at <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> and <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> is your company's product.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You must email the repository department in order to have them label repository sources for you or create a branch.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The hardest part of completing a task is figuring out how to do a convoluted cross-branch merge of the repository sources.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Corollary: Your development process is convoluted enough that such merges are necessary.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your manager occasionally says something silly enough to remind you that he's not staff.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It takes 2 weeks to plan for a one-hour task.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your manager quashes a plan whereby person B (from another department) helps person C (from a third department) by doing something with your work-product; he quashes it, fearing that <em>his</em> manager might blame him if person B doesn't come through.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The email system doesn't use standard protocols and won't work on most platforms, but it books conference rooms automatically... sometimes... until it stops for some unknown reason and forgets your appointments and you start missing meetings...
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em></em><a href="GroupWise.html">GroupWise</a>, I presume?<em> No, </em><a href="GroupWise.html">GroupWise</a> runs on most platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
               Uh, that would be MicrosoftExchange. (But Exchange <em>is</em> cross platform; it runs on Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows Nt...and we have <em>both</em> kinds of music here. Country <em>and</em> Western).
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Uh, "cross platform" refers to being able to run on many different operating systems, i.e.: *nix & MacOS & OS X & AmigaOS. The abomination you refer to as "Windows" is one single platform that promotes enough bugs with each release to make it look like different platforms.
                </li>
                <li>
                   I think that was the joke.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               This can also refer to old mainframe-based mail systems.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   However, old mainframe-based e-mail systems generally tended to <em>work.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               A message you sent was standards-compliant when it was sent, but is not by the time it arrives.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You get more phone messages from MIS apologizing that email is down than you get from your significant other.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your external email address contains a field revealing your department, e.g., joe.blow@engineering.companyname.com rather than joe.blow@companyname.com.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Or, a field revealing your country, like joe.blow@us.company.com, juan.perez@mx.company.com or ola.nordmann@no.company.com
            </li>
            <li>
               Or it reveals your subsidiary. Real example: joe.blow@lotus.com instead of joe.blow@ibm.com
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You dread the day you'll have to hold a phone conference with your colleagues in India and China. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>(This is actually one big reason why American companies will sometimes outsource to Latin America rather than cheaper Asian countries -- the time differences are no more than 7 hours and that's between Alaska and the Easternmost tip of Brazil, which means the managers can spend more time looking after their businesses within working hours)</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           At least one very senior manager is universally acknowledged to be completely incapable of doing his job, but purely political considerations keep him there... for four more years.
          <ul>
            <li>
               D<em>id</em> you work in the Whitehouse, by chance? <em>(-:</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               This happens in small companies too.  E.g. the brother-in-law of the CEO.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some administrative procedures require bootstrapping. For example: you need to submit a scanned paper form to request permission to use the company scanner; the bootstrap phase here would be going to Office Depot to have it scanned for you.
          <ul>
            <li>
               That's their indirect way to say: "Scan your own sh8t!".
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The CEO visits rarely, but when he does, he uses the corporate jet.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your boss has more people <em>over</em> him (i.e. his boss, his boss's boss, etc.) than <em>under</em> him.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Terms such as "division," "department," "product line," and "business unit" all have official meanings within your company, and all refer to different levels within the corporate structure.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Mergers and reorganizations of "divisions," "departments," and "business units" cause yours to change its name and level every couple of months.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Such changes lead to the introduction with much fanfare of new logos and mission statements for the "divisions," "departments," and "business units" concerned.
            </li>
            <li>
               There are contests for employees to come up with the new logos and mission statements.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>Hey, don't knock it. The last mission statement was laminated, and made a nice placemat for keeping my lunchtime sardine oil off pile of papers on my desk.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is more than one employee with the title of "president."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There are more than two ranks of "vice president," e.g., "VP," "Executive VP," "Senior VP." (And maybe 2 is too many.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are called away from actual work to have a meeting about when you should next have a meeting about "the Schedule." (cue foreboding music) Your company gets the Double Monolith MCP Bonus if this meeting includes a heated discussion about when the meetings should occur.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You must file paperwork to declare your intent to file paperwork which declares your intent to file paperwork. Double Monolith MCP Bonus awarded if there are more levels of indirection. Remember, you need to fill that out by hand in triplicate without the benefit of carbon paper!
          <ul>
            <li>
               For this reason, your company plows through <em>forests</em> worth of paper every month, and is in the process of implementing e-paperwork.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Which is so infuriatingly frustrating that people still stick to physical paperwork.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You have to requisition a form, but it turns out that the form to requisition this form is obtained by requisitioning another form, which in turn requires that you submit the original form in question. (This circular dependence may seem absurd and unrealistic, but I've actually seen one in the wild.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your boss's boss's boss's boss's boss works in another city and is someone whom you have never met, but he's still considered to be MiddleManagement.
          <ul>
            <li>
               At my current job, I've calculated that the maximum boss nesting as a function of employees is about b(e) = log(base 1.4) (e/5). I could end up in this position if our company reaches 50 employees. I guess I should start taking management classes.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>That simplifies to b(e) = log[1.4]e - log[1.4]5 = log[1.4]e - 4.78.  Apparently this means that for 3 or fewer employees you can actually have -1 or fewer bosses!</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your company feels the need to organize meetings in which they reassure you that you're more than just one cog in the system.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Your entire office space counts as just a little cog in the system. <em>You, my friend are just a tooth. I think your manager is the little screw that makes sure the cog stays on the shaft.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               You politely decline an invitation to attend an all-morning "we love you and want to make you feel included" shindig, at which the CEO will be presenting, and your boss's boss has a talk with your boss, who then explains to you that having real work to do is not a good enough reason not to go.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You miss a meeting to resolve a critical production issue because it conflicts with an appointment you have with HR.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Corollary: HR is the most important department in the organization.
            </li>
            <li>
               The critical production issue is still unresolved, and the aforementioned meeting is still going on an hour after HR is done with you.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You must attend meetings in order to find out what you are quite capable of reading via email.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your company has an internal instant messaging system, like Microsoft Lync or IBM Sametime.
          <ul>
            <li>
               There's an internal social network which is almost as huge and active as your Facebook.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In a normal, work-related conversation, you use the word <em>yammerhead</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You have to ask around to find out the names of the people who are writing the code that will interface with yours.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Which building?" is a common question when trying to set up a meeting or find something.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Due to company growth, the staff is beginning to feel like sardines packed in a can; meanwhile, the company owns the vacant building across the street, which for tax reasons it can't use.
          <ul>
            <li>
               When the building finally does become available, internal political battles keep anyone from taking advantage of the new space.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Three months into a project, you find out that another group is working to create a product just like the one you are creating. (They're even using the same specs!)
          <ul>
            <li>
               You wake up in a cold sweat from a nightmare in which you discover everything you do is a duplication of what someone somewhere else in the organization has already worked on.
            </li>
            <li>
               Then, you start poking around, and find out it's real.
            </li>
            <li>
               Later you find out this is policy. There are three groups who have been given the same task. After the first or second milestone, upper management will decide which two projects get killed. <em>This is in fact how the Samsung Galaxy S3 </em><a href="SmartPhone.html">SmartPhone</a> was developed -- three teams were assigned to develop their own prototype, the one the managers liked best was the one that got released, and the other two projects were killed.<em></em>
            </li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The "MIS Department" doesn't include any programmers. The MIS staff works full-time keeping the e-mail server working, tracking down viruses, and auditing desktop computers for unauthorized files.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The programmers and other technical workers have to maintain their own network separate from the MIS-sanctioned corporate network.

               At the company I work, there was once <em>three</em> separate IT fiefdoms: One that supported basic email and other productivity apps (Word, etc.), one that supported engineers and their tools, and one that supported the finance/accounting department. (This insanity has since been reeled in). <em>(In at least one other company, it hasn't)</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   ... it actually makes sense to have separate fiefdoms, and finance and accounting are themselves separate

           Getting approval to purchase a $3000 laptop is no more difficult than getting approval to buy a $10 stapler.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Corollary: Getting approval to spend $10 is as difficult as getting approval to spend $3000.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Getting approval to spend $10 is more difficult then getting $1.5 Mil for a compute server.

                <li>
                   The cost of the requisition process is far greater than the cost of the requested items.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       Entire projects end up getting funded out of the developers' own pockets, because the requisition process is so long it actually becomes more feasible to acquire hardware and resources with personal funds. <em>(That one is veering into </em><a href="YouKnowYoureInaBleepedCompanyWhen.html">YouKnowYoureInaBleepedCompanyWhen</a> territory though)<em></em>

                </li>
                <li>
                   Most servers cost under $5 grand because there is a <a href="DiscontinuitySpike.html">DiscontinuitySpike</a> in requisition processing complexity if one goes over $5 grand, per company rules.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       One buys the server with minimum hard-drives and RAM, and then "upgrades" two years later to keep under the $5 grand limit. If one upgrades sooner, then it looks like one is trying to buy an 8-grand server at 5-grand by splitting the order, which is officially a no-no. (True story.)
                    </li>
                  </ul>

           It's easier to call in to your company's main business line and ask the operator to connect you to a co-worker than it is to look up that co-worker's extension in the internal directory.

                   The disciplinary report is sustained by middle management, resulting in all three of you receiving letters in your HR file and one manager is demoted -- all for doing your jobs properly -- because not doing so would contravene company policy about dealing with rogue traffic.
