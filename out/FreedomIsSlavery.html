        Freedom Is Slavery

        A phrase from George Orwell's "1984", a classic piece of literature about control and its forms. Conspiracy theorists cling to its message, professing that we live in an age of Big Brother.

Waley in 1938 is as follows: "If the language is incorrect...the people will have nowhere to put hand and foot"]

        Yet another example of <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a>. Consider how the term freedom, which used to be fairly un-coopted, has changed. Now "freedom" is used to mean "the American way of life", even "something you must give up liberties to protect".
