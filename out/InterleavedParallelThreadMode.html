      <p>
        Cats are nice. I don't like dogs. Oxygen is good. -- Joe<strong>'Bloggs</strong>
      </p>

        <strong>Stage two</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cats are nice. I don't like dogs. Oxygen is good. -- Joe<strong>'Bloggs</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't agree with you about cats. They're an abomination from hell. Also, dogs are the nicest animals on the planet. And oxygen is overrated. -- Fred<strong>'Blaggs</strong>
      </p>

        <strong>Stage three</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cats are nice. I don't like dogs. Oxygen is good. -- Joe<strong>'Bloggs</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't agree with you about cats. <em>How dare you! Cats are lovely, lovely, lovely. -- JB</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They're an abomination from hell. <em>Blasphemy! -- JB</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, dogs are the nicest animals on the planet. <em>Apart from dogs. And weasels. And everything else. -- JB</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And oxygen is overrated. -- FredBlaggs <em>Provided you don't care about breathing, anyway. -- JB</em>
      </p>

        <strong>Stage four</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cats are nice. I don't like dogs. Oxygen is good. -- Joe<strong>'Bloggs</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't agree with you about cats. <em>How dare you! Cats are lovely, lovely, lovely. -- JB</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What's so great about cats, then? I think they're boring. -- Ethel<strong>'Fnord</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        They're an abomination from hell. <em>Blasphemy! -- JB</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's nothing blasphemous about that. -- Ethel<strong>'Fnord</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, dogs are the nicest animals on the planet. <em>Apart from dogs. And weasels. And everything else. -- JB</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't understand. Joe, do you like weasels or not? Jane<strong>'Doe</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        And oxygen is overrated. -- FredBlaggs <em>Provided you don't care about breathing, anyway. -- JB</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps Fred breathes something other than oxygen? -- Ethel<strong>'Fnord</strong>

        At this point, there is absolutely no possibility of coherence unless someone
        comes along and refactors mercilessly (<a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>).
