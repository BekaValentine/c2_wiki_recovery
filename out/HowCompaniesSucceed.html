        Unfortunately, I've studied how companies succeed and what such
        success means, and it boils down to something like this, but not
        exactly what you've written. The key is in the phrase ``its society.<em></em>
        A company has a set of entities that buys its ``products<em> and thereby</em>
        provides revenues to the company. This set is ``its society<em> in the</em>
        sense I think is the thrust of the e-mail exchange I saw (what is
        important to the members of the corporation is a little different). 
      </p>
      <p>
        This set of customers, let's call them, has a mode (the most common
        sort of customer) whose needs the company meets best (by definition, I
        suppose). The needs of this mode might not be the needs of the whole
        set, and certainly those needs are not the needs of the let's call
        them the elite of that set. In fact, like many biological-like sets,
        the mode is bacterial - low-end, simple, casual users. Let's look at
        an example, Microsoft Word. The mode of people who buy this product
        use it infrequently and probably use computers infrequently. They are
        happy that what Word produces looks better than what they could scrawl
        on a pad, and they can get things done with it faster than handing it
        to their secretaries because with Word you can throw together a wide
        range of document things quickly but crudely. The mode loves it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best strategy for Microsoft is to improve Word as slowly as
        possible, and the fewer the number of competitors, the slower that is
        (development is <em>the constraint</em> in <a href="EliyahuGoldratt.html">EliyahuGoldratt</a>'s term (and isn't it
        odd that this guy's name is Gold Rat?)). (I know one hardware company,
        for an automatic knitting machine, that has no competitors at all, and
        today they use 30-year-old technology and charge $500 for a 32k memory
        upgrade.) The required rate of improvement is what satisfies the mode,
        because anything more leaves money on the table and anything less
        leaves an opening for a secondary competitor.

        There is another factor which I call Gambler's Ruin and which another
        writer (a business theorist) calls the Law of Increasing Returns which
        says that the company in the lead in revenues/profits increases its lead.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies a few things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Competition is better than no competition
        </li>
        <li>
           The mode tends to drag down the quality of the product as far as the non-mode is concerned
        </li>
        <li>
           Gambler's Ruin says that the rich get richer, and so the leader can slow down and make more profit (the asymptote is the knitting company)
        </li>
        <li>
           The average customer is not served because the mode expects less and the elite customer is screwed
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I don't know of anyone who writes for a living where they typeset what
        they write who uses Word (I'm sure there are some, but I don't know
        any). All such people use, in order, Frame, Tex, and
        Interleaf. Yet Word is the best-selling, most profitable
        ``typesetting<em> system. Does this serve society? It certainly serves</em>
        the target society for Microsoft.

        Another example, 15 years ago there were around 22 relatively major
        publishing houses which, in the 1960's and 1970's, put out quite good
        literature in addition to trash. Now there are 8 conglomerates who put
        out mostly trash. Trash to us is literature to the bacterial mode of
        readers. A few years ago Doubleday tried to lure Chris Alexander away
        from Oxford with a big contract. Chris asked them to list all the
        books they had in print that were more than 20 years old, and
        Doubleday couldn't name any. Chris also asked how their longevity
        compared to the 500-year-old Oxford.
