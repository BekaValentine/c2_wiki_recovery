        Omnigon International
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="OmnigonInternational.html">OmnigonInternational</a> is no longer looking for sophisticated, disciplined, brilliant engineers to work on a technology far beyond the current state of the art. The entire engineering staff have either resigned or been terminated, and sharks are circling.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What happened?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A trainwreck. Engine busted off the rails and all the carriages followed along. Very sad for all concerned. Even the little grey men are out looking for something else to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What were you guys doing then?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, the claims to fame were constant time constant resolution high dimensionality non-procedural pattern recognition and system control. And rely on the empirical universe outside an application to maintain the state of the application. This was intended to eliminate most traditional complexity limits. The logical architecture we were working to was sort of a <a href="CompositePattern.html">CompositePattern</a> of <a href="BraitenbergVehicles.html">BraitenbergVehicles</a> in a tiled Hausdorff <a href="HyperSpace.html">HyperSpace</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space).">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space).</a> With bells on.

        <em>Huh? That's a straight answer? Do you actually think you know what you're talking about?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Look, you asked the question, it's your problem to grok the answer. Imagine that you didn't know a thing about software and someone tried to explain a compiler in a nutshell. <a href="OmnigonInternational.html">OmnigonInternational</a> spent many months trying to get world class engineers to understand what it wanted them to do. Few succeeded at that and most likely you won't either. If you'd still like a close analogy, think of <a href="IterativeFunctionSystem.html">IterativeFunctionSystem</a>s applied in information architecture rather than imaging. If you want details on what's needed to do that, read <a href="KenHappel.html">KenHappel</a>'s patents below and think hard for a few months. I assert without proof you'll get it - or at least you'll get <em>something</em>.

      <p>
        <em>Likely a headache.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You pays your money and you takes your chances. A lot of people are still owed. Including the founder of the company, the former employees of the company, and several generations of investors in the company.

        <em>Why is this shit relevant to wiki?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not. But there are various links to this page given the influence the company had on several wiki alumni. And the joint used <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> which is kind of <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>.

        <em>I just wanna know one thing. Did you guys work with space aliens or not?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not so far as we could tell. At best we worked with guys who had once worked with space aliens. Most likely we worked with guys who find space aliens a convenient cover story for their ties to the <a href="BavarianIlluminati.html">BavarianIlluminati</a>. Or something like that. Fnord.

      <p>
        Sean David Morten just mentioned (on Art Bell) this company as a front for alien technology being fed to the public
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That would have been a much better deal.</em>

        <em>No, it doesn't look like that, either.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is <em>still</em> out there.

        There was a rumor that I was a gray (alien) on a website known as nightwings.com tht Art Bell saw. I am not a gray and not an alien. The mathematics is part of what is becoming known as algebraic semiotics and the stuff I have done and am doing, I call Topological Semiotics... KMH
