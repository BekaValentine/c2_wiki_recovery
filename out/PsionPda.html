        Psion Pda
      </h1>
      <p>
        Psion makes some small computers that could be categorized as PDA's.
        The Psion 3 runs EpocOs 16 and 5 runs EpocOs 32. Some newer model runs <a href="SymbianOs.html">SymbianOs</a>. The processor is a 36MHz ARM. There is a CompactFlash card slot for backup and expansion, IR port and a serial port (with special cable).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are clones, such as the Ericsson MC218 (5 clone).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some funny features in these. They (at least the MC218 I have) slide open revealing a mostly-complete keyboard and a wide LCD touchscreen. The screen is 640x240 pixels and 16 shades of gray in the MC218 and possibly slightly different in other models. It is touch sensitive and there is a stylus that is used as a pointing device. The touch-sensitive area is slightly larger than the display and there are "buttons" marked along two edges of the screen containing a set of common launchers and a few menu shortcuts such as zoom, infrared send/receive and clipboard (which all should ideally work and work the same way in all applications).
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole package draws about 50mA to 100mA of about 2.5V (2 AA batteries and a CR2032 Li backup battery) according to the battery meter. Turned off, it appears to use virtually none (batteries' internal resistances drain them faster).
      </p>
      <p>
        The system software includes a few PDA-ish things and a Basic-like language interpreter that presumably has bindings for most OS features.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find ports of B Prolog and Hugs Haskell interpreters at least and a very functional PDF reader, PDF+. There is a software suite to use on "real" computers called plptools and a file converter library calles psiconv available. Apparently some models are also able to run Debian Gnu/Linux (<a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        With the low power draw, wide screen and instant on/off ("suspend"), no moving parts etc, these can be quite convenient.
