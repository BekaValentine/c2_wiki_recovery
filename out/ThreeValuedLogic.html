        Three Valued Logic
      </h1>
      <p>
        An extension of <a href="BooleanLogic.html">BooleanLogic</a> (<a href="TwoValuedLogic.html">TwoValuedLogic</a>) or <a href="BooleanAlgebra.html">BooleanAlgebra</a>, where there are three values: 'True', 'False' and 'Unknown'. Unknown might also mean 'undefined', or 'neither'.

        Three-valued logic is used quite a lot in <a href="FormalMethods.html">FormalMethods</a>.

        Truth tables for <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a> ( | = or, & = and, ^ = xor, ! = not)
      </p>
      <code>
        T & T = T  T & U = U  T & F = F<br/>
        U & T = U  U & U = U  U & F = F<br/>
        F & T = F  F & U = F  F & F = F<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        T | T = T  T | U = T  T | F = T<br/>
        U | T = T  U | U = U  U | F = U<br/>
        F | T = T  F | U = U  F | F = F<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        T ^ T = F  T ^ U = U  T ^ F = TU ^ T = U  U ^ U = U  U ^ F = U<br/>
        F ^ T = T  F ^ U = U  F ^ F = F<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        !T = F     !U = U     !F = T<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In addition, an operator isUnknown (?) is often defined; this has the following truth table 
      </p>
      <code>
        ?T = F     ?U = T     ?F = F<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Although technically "three-valued logic" does not depend on the particular operator definitions given above, these are by far the most commonly used definitions (they are used in <a href="ViennaDevelopmentMethod.html">ViennaDevelopmentMethod</a>, for example).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that unknowns are not held to be equivalent. The exclusive OR of unknown and unknown is unknown (not false); as it is not necessary that the two unknowns are the same thing. Likewise, comparing two unknowns for equality returns unknown, not true. This can cause "holes" in reasoning; as such operations can be well-defined if two instances of unknown can be shown to be equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the proposition ((P==NP) ^ (P==NP)), one could argue, is false. P==NP is a well-known unknown proposition; however one could argue that if it is true on one side of the ^, it's true on the other (and likewise for false); thus the exclusive-OR ought to be well-defined, not unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, the proposition ((P==NP) ^ (P!=NP)), one could argue, is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the proposition ((P==NP) ^ (IsFactoringHardAsDiscreteLogarithm)) ought to be unknown; as the two <a href="OpenProblemsInComputerScience.html">OpenProblemsInComputerScience</a> might not have the same solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many authors and computer scientists, for this (and other) reasons, prefer to avoid <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a>. Part of the problem, of course, is that by reducing an unknown predicate from it's explicit formulation to the singular value "unknown", one <em>loses information</em> in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> argues at length against <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a> in the context of database systems in the book <a href="AnIntroductionToDatabaseSystems.html">AnIntroductionToDatabaseSystems</a> (and in many of his other writings). This section has been moved to <a href="NullsAndRelationalModel.html">NullsAndRelationalModel</a>.

        This page, so far, appears to miss several major implications of <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a>. Most importantly, the operators considered (| = or, & = and, ^ = xor, ! = not) are only four of 19,683 possible ternary logic functions. Instead of discussing values of (T F U), it might be more helpful to consider the tuple (0 1 2). The truth table for an arbitrary ternary function is then:
      </p>
      <code>
        F|0 1 2 <br/>
        -+------<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          |a b c
        </li>
        <li>
          |d e f
        </li>
        <li>
          |g h i
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For example, here's one:
      </p>
      <code>
        F|0 1 2 <br/>
        -+------<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          |1 0 2 
        </li>
        <li>
          |0 2 1 
        </li>
        <li>
          |2 1 0
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are 19,683 (3^9) unique permutations of the truth table, leading to the same number of values for F. In general, for <em>n</em>ary logic, there are n^(n^2) possible single-argument functions. The number of such functions for 4-ary is 4^(4^2), or 4^16, or 2^32.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How many of them are useful? :)</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          That's a good question. :)
        </li>
        <li>
          We can manage Boolean logic with one unary and one binary operator (of a possible sixteen) plus two propositions (NOT, AND, 1, 0).  One way to answer this question is to find an intuitive but minimal sets of operations for performing all the ternary logic one might ever wish to do.  Then add any desired for semantic convenience and syntactic clarity for common constructs (OR, XOR, IMPLICATION).  In searching for good, intuitive, binary ops, some reasonable targets are Commutivity ((a OP b) == (b OP a)) and Associativity (((a OP b) OP c) == (a OP (b OP c))).  Identity ops can be dropped, since they don't really calculate anything useful.  Any binary ops independent of one input should also be eliminated or considered for unary.  Reflexive ops ((a OP a) == a) such as AND and OR seem a bit easier to grasp (than, e.g. XOR), but that shouldn't be a ruling factor if something can be gained from them (e.g. with XOR).
        </li>
        <li>
          How much does that eliminate?  From the basic set, there are 3^(3^2) possible binary ops.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        F|0 1 2<br/>
        -+-----<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          |a b c
        </li>
        <li>
          |d e f
        </li>
        <li>
          |g h i
          <ul>
            <li>
              Well, in support of commutivity, we can eliminate three of the items.  That cuts us down immediately to 729 binary functions for potentially 'useful' and intuitive ternary logic.  
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        FC|0 1 2<br/>
        --+-----<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          |a b c
        </li>
        <li>
          |b e f
        </li>
        <li>
          |c f i  
          <ul>
            <li>
              For Reflexive binary ops, we can also eliminate questions on the diagonal, reducing us to 27 functions that are reflexive.  If only reflexive ops are chosen for binary, then at least one unary op is needed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        FCR|0 1 2<br/>
        ---+-----<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          |0 b c
        </li>
        <li>
          |b 1 f
        </li>
        <li>
          |c f 2
          <ul>
            <li>
              The requirement of dependence on both inputs eliminates as useless all functions where either each row contains only one value, or each column contains only one value.  As you might expect, there aren't many of these.  For F, it eliminates 51 functions (27 for pick-column value + 27 for pick-row-values - 3 shared (all values equal)).  For FC, it eliminates only 3 functions (all values equal).  For FCR, it eliminates none at all.
            </li>
            <li>
              For associative operations, the constraint is that ((x OP y) OP z) == (x OP (y OP z))... which is nice for folding operations across collections and such.  Counting these is a brain teaser that I haven't figured out yet, and I'm not sure how much more it restricts things than commutivity already did.
            </li>
            <li>
              For Unary operators, however, the qualities of value are more questionable.  Only one operator is needed for all possible unary operations (\x -> (x+1) mod N for N-ary logic), but what is intuitive and meaningful would depend on the interpretation of the logic.  For true/false/unknown, I'd propose the Boolean 'not' (which is identity on the unknown value) and the 'unknown?' operator, which returns true if the value is unknown, and false otherwise.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We should also consider the question of state inversion in ternary systems (as well as 4-state systems and so on). In a binary system, inversion is trivial - not 0 is 1, not 1 is 0. In three-value logic, inversion (!) is not necessarily as simple as claimed above. The inversion of 0 can be either 1 or 2. Inversions are often most useful when they are reversible, so that if !0 = 2, then !2 = 0. This leaves 1 to invert to itself. Another approach, however, has !0=1, !1=2, and !2=0 - this is invertible but not reversible, as !(!0) = 2, not 0. There are 6 reversible ternary inverters (including the identity).

        Ternary systems (and <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a>) is of interest in biology because it may be helpful in analysing and modeling "pathways", the chains of various reactions that promote or inhibit the production of a particular protein. Such a pathway can be modeled as a network of nodes, where each node is promoted, inhibited, or not affected by others. Some researchers have speculated that <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a> may be as natural to a biological computing system as binary logic is to an electronic system.

      <ul>
        <li>
           How so? Consider unary operation not, mentioned already. not(0)=1, not(1)=0, not(2)=2. It can't be defined in terms of x+1 mod N.
        </li>

        <em>I'd propose the Boolean 'not' (which is identity on the unknown value) and the 'unknown?' operator, which returns true if the value is unknown, and false otherwise.</em>
        With these two functions it's impossible to get undefended value from true or false value.
        Only by combining all three (not, unknown? x+1 mod n) it's possible to cover all unary functions.

        These things don't show the same sorts of structure as normal binary logic. What makes them <em>logics</em>, as opposed to just operations on sets? I couldn't find an answer in the quoted pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't understand the distinction you're drawing between "logics" and "operations on sets". Each particular truth table corresponds to a function mapping the value of two ternary variables to a third outcome. Boolean logic has 16 such mappings. Ternary logic has 19,683. The association between the chosen values (0 and 1 or 0, 1 and 2, or -1, 0, 1, etc) and concepts such as "true", "false", "on", "off", "undefined", and so on is arbitrary.</em>

        I understand all that. I'm asking you what makes a particular collection of set operations a "logic", or why the word is overloaded to include them. Normally, in mathematics, categories of objects are defined by axioms, and I have seen some versions of "logics" defined that way. But those normally at least include some rule about negation being self-inverse, and apparently these don't. Hence my question.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The subject is complicated by the development of so many new kinds of logic in the 20th century (multi-valued, <a href="FuzzyLogic.html">FuzzyLogic</a>, relevance, etc), however it probably remains true that any system of "logic" contains at minimum the primitive values "true" and "false", as well as some kind of inference system for deriving truth or falsehood.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [From that point of view, a set theory must at minimum have values isomorphic to true and false, as well as morphisms between sets which is in some sense equivalent to inference. Given that, such a set theory could be regarded as a logic, whereas without that, it wouldn't seem profitable to call it such.]

        <em>The association of semantics with ternary logic, such as the assignment of "true" and "false" to values and the identification of "interesting" functions, is one of the more interesting areas of study at the moment. My cursory read of the literature is that this is being approached statistically, through simulation and computation, rather than through more classic approaches. Researchers are assembling networks of ternary operators, using brute-force relaxations from initial conditions, and comparing the results to observed gene expression data. The theme is to discover, empirically, "interesting" functions that increase the correlation between the computed and measured results. -- </em><a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

        How does the "unknown" value compare with "top" and "bottom" elements of LatticeTheory ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-manyvalued/4V-truth.gif" />
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unknown probably doesn't correspond to either; however the database NULLs that give rise to unknowns in a relational context are very similar to the </em><a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-manyvalued/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-manyvalued/</a>
        (from where the diagram above is from) seems to be saying that <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> corresponds to "unknown" and top should represent "conflict" or in their words:
        "conflicting information saying that the state of affairs obtains as well as fails." In which case you are then dealing with a FourValuedLogic but is the construct valid for <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a> if you omit <a href="TopType.html">TopType</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In my personal opinion - </em><a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> should be used for exactly one thing - divergence. Anything else (nulls, exceptions, unknowns, etc.) should be handled with separate types, and whenever you need one of these you should construct a type-union of the "normal" datatype and whichever of the aforementioned SingularityTypes you like.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why? Because </em><a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> is like a wildcard in the type system - any expression or variable, no matter the type, can also be <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> - as <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> is the universal subtype of anything. There is <strong>no way</strong> to exclude the possibility of any expression being _|_. Many OO languages - <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> (to some extent), <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a> - treat nulls in this fashion; thus there is no way to say in any of these that a given reference cannot be null; because the type system says null is valid in any context. (I qualified Java because it doesn't explicitly equate null with <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a>; Eiffel and <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> do, OTOH; however Java doesn't provide mandatory references).<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>"Any expression or variable, no matter the type, can also be </em><a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a>"<em> -- this is incorrect.  Any expression or variable, no matter the type, is also of </em><a href="TopType.html">TopType</a>.  If some particular value managed to instantiate the <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> of some particular TypeLattice, then you could say that this value was an element of every other type in the lattice.  This does happen to be the case when dealing with the TypeLattice constructed under the <strong>Maybe</strong> monad where <em>Just T | Nothing</em> is considered, which is structurally equivalent to <em>references</em> for which NULL values are allowed.  One should not say that Nothing/Null/etc. is a type of Integer (since it lacks the properties of an Integer), but rather that it is a value that instantiates the type: Maybe Integer/Reference Integer/etc.  
        </li>
        <li>
          In many languages, <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> isn't occupied by anything at all.  Thus, while <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> is a subtype of all types, it doesn't have any values, because any value in <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> would need all the properties of all the different types of values in the language... which are often mutually exclusive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Having </em><a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> represent divergence does make sense, because any computation can potentially diverge - and unlike the other cases, divergence doesn't mean the returning of in invalid result; it's the failure to return a result at all.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To make good use of this in the general case, of course, you'd need to solve the halting problem.

        There is no single "right" answer that applies to every situation. An obvious contradiction to your expressed preference is in divergence-free systems, such as SQL. All SQL queries terminate.

        <em>That doesn't necessary contradict my preference - in such a system, one could dispense with </em><a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> altogether. Of course, SQL doesn't use <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> (and SQL nulls are very much like bot, in that any attribute, regardless of its type, can be set to NULL) for divergence, it uses it for "unknown".

           Not intending to, though perhaps I'm confused. It's been known to happen before. :) My general feelings on the subject of nulls (in the context of general purpose programming languages, and SQL at least has its toes in that particular pond) is that use of <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> to implement null is questionable practice, for the reasons outlined on the aforementioned pages. That said, many languages do it, and there are far worse sins committed than null=bot. There seems to be some confusion (not in your mind) between "null" and "unknown"; these ought to be different concepts (and "unknown", one of the three values in <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a>) definitely ought to <em>not</em> be the <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a>. (You shouldn't be able to assign "unknown" to an arbitrary int; any more than you can assign "true" to one; C/C++ type coercions nonwithstanding). Costin pointed out some flaws in <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a>'s proposed solution (and I have a few of my own doubts). Some of the above commentary on logic(s) is interesting; however it tends to consider logic in isolation. Null in general, I have no problems with, as they are damn useful, even if it gives the academic types fits - I've several books on <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> and <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> (relatively advanced material), and the authors of all of 'em (KimBruce, <a href="BenjaminPierce.html">BenjaminPierce</a>) tend to sidestep nulls. Part of the disconnect between theory and practice, I suspect, springs from the fact that proving that a particular expression isn't null (at compile time) is a hard thing for a <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> system to do - but it's so quick and easy for programmers to do the check. At any rate, I don't mind null; I just prefer systems that allow me to exclude it from the set of values for any particular variable/attribute/etc. I hope this explains my position a bit more on the issue. -- sj

           Yes, and that's not unreasonable. But consider the functional language feature of first class type unions. You should be able to say in some program, ok, I'm going to define a NAME type, and today I want it to be the union of the types STRING and UNKNOWN. Tomorrow, though I want to add BOTTOM to that union. The biggest problem I see with SQL and other languages that have various multi-valued-logic types predefined is precisely that they are trying to pick a single solution, rather than allowing the programmer to specify the multi-valued-logic types that are appropriate for the application domain. -- dm

           I think type unions are an excellent solution to the problem. Date doesn't like them, but he and I part company there. However, it should be pointed out that adding <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> to the union <em>is an operation with no effect</em>. As <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> is the universal subtype, <em>it already is a valid value for any domain you create.</em>. Even if your type system allows a class/domain to be declared "final" (using the Java terminology), it still has at least one subtype if <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> is present. Which is why I argue against using <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> for nulls - if null is of type <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a>, <em>it can never be excluded from the set of values for any given variable</em>. I think we mostly agree here, and again are picking at the nits. :) -- sj

           <em>"As </em><a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> is the universal subtype, it already is a valid value for any domain you create."<em> -- in favor of picking a few more nits, it's wrong to assume that </em><a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> actually has any occupying values.  However, your claim is certainly true for every value that is allowed to occupy <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> (including NULLs, as you mention).  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I almost said "ERROR" rather than "BOTTOM". I guess I should have. I have seen a fairly bewildering variety of systems, and I thought that, in some of them, BOTTOM wasn't always universally valid, but maybe I'm just misremembering, so skip that. One thing, though, NULL is already a type union in SQL, so shouldn't you say that it is "null being used for <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a>", not "<a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> being used for null"? Anyway Date has a favored approach, whereas I favor a multitude of paradigms with the choice in the hands of the programmer. -- dm

           <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> comes from <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>, and I've never seen it used for anything other than the universal subtype. Some languages, like Haskell, import the concept directly; others have Bottom-like things but call it something else. Null (however spelled or capitalized), AFAIK, doesn't have a well-defined meaning in <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> - it's very much an application-specific thing. Date has a point that (in the context of relational) NULL can cause problems - especially if any attribute can be NULL, which is the current state of affairs. However, he seems to want to exclude NULL (or other singularities) from domains/attributes completely, because it "breaks the model" (or at least complicates things greatly). However, databases are intended to model reality; if relational-without-singularities cannot model reality (including dealing with unknowns) then that's a problem with relational-without-singularities, not a problem with reality. In many cases, "unknown" or "N/A" and the like are valid values for a domain--and when that's true, they should be available. They just shouldn't be forced into domains where they <em>aren't</em> valid. -- sj

        In terms of the diagram referred to above, the discussion on that Stanford page explains that the topmost symbol is True, the bottommost is False, the leftmost is Unknown, and the rightmost is Contradictory.

        But there are other possibilities; there is no single 3-value nor 4-value logic, and any mathematician or architect is free to choose whatever system they like (and then get flamed by the people who disagree with his choice :-)

        In a particular application area, yes, but even there, still not just a <strong>single</strong> clear way to go. This should be unsurprising, considering that the mathematical issues are very far from settled. We don't have an overarching formal theory yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        A clear example of this is in how the frame problem arises in theorem proving. You would think that this could be fixed by doing a <a href="TheoremProvingSystem.html">TheoremProvingSystem</a> based on relevance logic, but as far as I can see, that's still beyond the state of the art.

        In the electronics world such logical devices, known as "tri-state", have three output values: high, low, and high impedance, meaning they are essentially disconnected from the rest of the world. It is possible to have an array of devices that all talk to the same data line but only have one device driving the line at a time. It is possible to have no devices driving the data line at all, of course - although its logical value would then be undefined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this analog help in the discussion somehow?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I thought about tri-states as well when I first started thinking about gene regulation pathways (long ago in a distant universe I was trained as a hardware engineer), but it's really a different concept I think. For genes, the states are "promotes" (meaning increases production of a protein), "inhibits" (meaning decreases production of a protein), and "no effect". In a typical lab setting, you have many samples of many genes. The analysis problem is to explore the space of all possible ternary networks, searching for those whose behavior matches the observed data. -- </em><a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

        Electronics does provide another application domain where examples demonstrate that, once again, it depends on what you want. Tristate is a ternary logic with T, F, and a third truth value which typically is not indicative of error or divergence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a truth table for a PLA or for test vectors, inputs are T, F, or don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
        How the third truth value is intended is different on input vs output, and there's actually a lot of things it might mean. -- dm
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Um, actually, it means, "not connected," which can't have a lot of different interpretations to it. A high impedance input has no effect on fanout of a driving device, contributes very little to overall capacitive effects, and affects no logic anywhere. A high impedance output acts exactly the same way to the outputs of other devices. The third state has a pretty specific meaning under these conditions. I see no reason why tri-state logic can't act the same way.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An oversimplication, of course.  The behavior of tri-state logic is entirely predictable and defined, from the various voltages and impedances of the various devices in questions (output nodes driving a bus, input nodes being driven, and any external pullups which may be present).  At DC of course; at high frequency things get difficult to model as solid state devices have decidedly non-linear responses.  At any rate, the above discussion should be convincing that <em>tri-state (or any) logic has (or doesn't have) value, depending on the application.</em>  The suitability of tri-state logic in electronics has nothing to do with its suitability in a relational database.

        Despite the messiness, three-value logic often models the real world better than two-value. For example, a common source of debate in this wiki is "X is better than Y". Before any evidence is applied, the "default" value of this statement should generally be considered "null". In other words, "The difference in value between X and Y is unknown".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think until you define </em>'"better"<em>', the "default" and "actual" value of this statement should generally be considered "undefined".</em>
