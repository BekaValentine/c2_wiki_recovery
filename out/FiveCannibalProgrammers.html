        Five Cannibal Programmers
      </h1>
      <p>
        Five cannibals get appointed as programmers in an IT company. During the
        welcoming ceremony the boss says: "You're all part of our team now. You can
        earn good money here, and you can go to the company canteen for something to
        eat. So don't trouble the other employees". The cannibals promise not to
        trouble the other employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Four weeks later the boss returns and says: "You're all working very hard,
        and I'm very satisfied with all of you.  One of our cleaners has disappeared
        however. Do any of you know what happened to her?" The cannibals disavow all
        knowledge of the missing  cleaner.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the boss has left, the leader of the cannibals says to the others:
        "Which of you idiots ate the cleaner?"
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the cannibals raises his hand hesitantly, to which the leader of the
        cannibals says: "You FOOL! For four weeks we've been eating team leaders,
        managers, and analysts, and no-one has noticed anything. And now YOU
        have to go and eat the CLEANER!"
