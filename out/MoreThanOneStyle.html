        A friend recently asked why I worked so hard to give this server an identity. <br/>
        I believe he thought the subjects I addressed, particularly patterns, would be better served if anonymously<br/>
        woven together in the global web. <br/>
        The following are excerpts from my reply.<br/>
        <strong>C2.COM as Public Space</strong><br/>
        I've been influenced by Roger Blumberg's WWW '94 paper that asks if there isn't a better metaphor for the web<br/>
        than a super highway. A highway is, after all, a place we don't really want to be. The author suggests "public<br/>
        space" as a better metaphor and then considers three forms: museums, public lands and billboards. He makes<br/>
        some interesting observations. Have you ever noticed that some publicly owned museums can be hard to see<br/>
        while privately owned billboards are hard to avoid?<br/>
        I think of PPR as a privately owned public place. I want people to come visit and enjoy this space so I work<br/>
        hard improving it. My improvements are, in effect, my statement as to what the web should be. Although I<br/>
        admire many other places in the web, I've chosen not to mimic any in a literal way. Diversity is good. But<br/>
        diversity is also confusing. There is a lot of latitude in html to make different kinds of space. So I want to make<br/>
        it clear when you've entered or left this space. There are many doors leading both in and out. That's why it has<br/>
        identity.<br/>
        Actually, the server has three identities: C2, PPR and <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. <br/>
        - C2 is a billboard of sorts, though I've tried to make it valuable to those who see it.<br/>
        - PPR is mostly like a museum. It's dedicated to a narrow subject specifically to distinguish itself from <br/>
        other museums.<br/>
        - Wiki is another space still, more like open land where one can do pretty much as they please with only <br/>
        an occasional sign making suggestions. I will add more identities as their visions come to me.<br/>
