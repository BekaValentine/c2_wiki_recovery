        Once one of the <a href="GreatResearchLabs.html">GreatResearchLabs</a>, the most important research laboratory for ThePhoneCompany (AT&T) when it was a monopoly, now part of Lucent Technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, the source of much important research, including <a href="InformationTheory.html">InformationTheory</a> due to <a href="ClaudeShannon.html">ClaudeShannon</a>, the transistor, high-temperature superconductors, wireless communications, and lots more.

        It was one of the best GeekCentrals in the world.

        This is where the <a href="InventorsOfUnix.html">InventorsOfUnix</a> created <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and the <a href="UnixOperatingSystem.html">UnixOperatingSystem</a>, among other things, and later <a href="PlanNineFromBellLabs.html">PlanNineFromBellLabs</a> and <a href="InfernoOs.html">InfernoOs</a>.

        The golden age of <a href="BellLabs.html">BellLabs</a> seems to be over.  With Lucent's troubles during the telecom meltdown, researchers have been leaving at a shocking pace.  The spin off of Avaya and the microelectronics division further fragmented what remained after AT&T Labs and Bellcore were split off.  <a href="BrianKernighan.html">BrianKernighan</a> joined the faculty at Princeton, though at <a href="BellLabs.html">BellLabs</a> once a week and during the summers.  <a href="KenThompson.html">KenThompson</a> left at the end of November 2001(?).  The mood among those remaining (of which I'm currently one) is that it's the end of an era.
