        Forth Immediate Words
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>, words that are marked as "immediate" are executed at compile time ("immediately" upon being seen by the compiler) instead of run time.  They have access to the full <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>.  They can read ahead in the input source stream, and they can generate new compiled code while they are running.  This makes <a href="ForthImmediateWords.html">ForthImmediateWords</a> useful in extending the compiler in order to implement <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>s, similar to the way that <a href="LispMacros.html">LispMacros</a> are used.
