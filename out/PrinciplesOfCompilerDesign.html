        See also: 'Compilers - Principles, Techniques and Tools', by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman. ISBN 0201100886, published 1985 (the <a href="RedDragonBook.html">RedDragonBook</a>). From the back of it:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Anyone interested in compiler design is familiar with "The Dragon Book"... Since it was first published, the state of compiler design has advanced. As a result, Addison-Wesley announces the birth of a new dragon.</em>  (The Dragon Book they refer to is the <a href="GreenDragon.html">GreenDragon</a>, obviously...however the term <a href="TheDragonBook.html">TheDragonBook</a> without a color nowadays usually referes to the <a href="RedDragonBook.html">RedDragonBook</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess the world has moved on a lot since <em>that</em> book too. Any advance?
