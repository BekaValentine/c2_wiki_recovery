        I've added your IP to <a href="ReverseIpLookup.html">ReverseIpLookup</a> because you do a lot of minor edits. After the spat over blue yonder's vandalism, I initially thought you were blue yonder. The entry is aimed at preventing another such misunderstanding. If you object to being known, feel free to delete the entry. -- RK

        Sorry, but I post from random cubicles at my office. Frankly, I forgot about the option to set the right cookie. I'll do that soon. And, I never write anything I would be ashamed of. If I don't have anything nice to say, I don't say it. Okay--done.

        [edit note] Sorry for moving this conversation here, I couldn't find a better place. And good luck with gnoming, do not mind the more excited part of the wikidom. One can find pretty good and reliable measures of when gnoming is justified - it improves the page for the <a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a>. -- Costin

        Question -- If I am contributing to a page, and I see a programming example that uses a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> that has not been escaped with six quotes, does anybody mind when I adjust the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> so it is no longer a link? Or is that pollution? -- <a href="EricJablow.html">EricJablow</a>
      </p>

        <li>
           Despite DV's comment, although it's not pollution, it's not always wise either; DanglingLinks can serve a purpose, depending on what it is. It's a judgement call. If the non-existent target page <strong>might</strong> be a useful page for someone to create in the future, that's a good reason not to adjust the <a href="DanglingLink.html">DanglingLink</a>. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

               It was a random class name like MyClass. -- <a href="EricJablow.html">EricJablow</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               Ok. But bad example; the page "<a href="MyClass.html">MyClass</a>" exists! -- Doug
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Is <a href="MyClass.html">MyClass</a> a good name for that page?  It doesn't indicate the page's content.  Something like CppForwardDeclaration would be better.  In the context of the page I was contributing to, <a href="MyClass.html">MyClass</a> had no meaning; it wasn't part of a <em>class </em><a href="MyClass.html">MyClass</a><em> forward declaration.-- </em><a href="EricJablow.html">EricJablow</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                   (A) I have no idea which page you were contributing to where you referenced <a href="MyClass.html">MyClass</a>, so I can't check that context, and (B) regardless of whether you think <a href="MyClass.html">MyClass</a> looks offhand like a descriptive name for the contents of that change, I have reason to be sure you didn't check its backlinks, which in <strong>this</strong> case may be an overwhelming reason to keep that particular page name. -- Doug
