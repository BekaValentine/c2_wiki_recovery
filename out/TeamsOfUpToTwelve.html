        Teams Of Up To Twelve
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm already fed up of the <em>XP won't scale</em> refrain, so here goes.

      <p>
        The relevant metric here is ProportionOfUse -- what proportion of real software use per day globally is of systems written by a team bigger than this. My completely unscientific answer: statistically insignificant to the vital job of making the world a safer and happier place. Many more such projects get started than used of course. Once you add a weighting for the user joy in employing the system the big team disappears further down the plug hole where it belongs. But then maybe I'm biased.

        <em>Doesn't Microsoft, the maker of software used on over 90% of the world's computers, use teams of many more than twelve persons? Please correct me if I'm wrong.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Before anyone else answers, please note that there's a difference between a team of more than twelve, and a team <em>made of up</em> <a href="TeamsOfUpToTwelve.html">TeamsOfUpToTwelve</a>. While Microsoft may have used many engineers to develop Windows, Office, etc., did they work in atomic teams of more than twelve?
