        Non Virtual Calls Pure Virtual Idiom
      </h1>
      <p>
        A programming idiom where a non-virtual (Java final) base class method provides a skeleton for an operation by calling pure virtual methods at appropriate points. The base class method contains common code, allows specialization, and enforces correct order of calls. Contrast <a href="OverrideAndCallInheritedIdiom.html">OverrideAndCallInheritedIdiom</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a C++/Java implementation of a <a href="TemplateMethodPattern.html">TemplateMethodPattern</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic idea here is that the base class has a non-virtual or final method which encapsulates the common functionality and enforces the desired contract by calling pure-virtual methods at appropriate points. Working off of the Drawable_Item
        example from <a href="OverrideAndCallInheritedIdiom.html">OverrideAndCallInheritedIdiom</a>, we have:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Drawable_Item<br/>
        {<br/>
        /** Override item_draw to draw subclass-specific elements. */<br/>
        void draw(Context context)<br/>
        {<br/>
        draw_border(context);<br/>
        item_draw(context);<br/>
        update(context);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        virtual void item_draw(Context context) = 0;<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        draw(..) here is not a virtual function, so Drawable_Item::draw(..) is always called through a Drawable_Item pointer/reference. In Java, the method should be declared final. The key point here is that the caller:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Has no choice about which draw(..) gets called and therefore cannot effectively override it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Must implement item_draw(..)
        </li>
        <li>
           Does not need to worry about when item_draw(..) is called; it is handled by the superclass.
        </li>
        <li>
           Does not need to worry about base class refactoring. Since it is being called rather than calling, changes are better isolated and the class is less fragile.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This adds up to a tight and easily testable contract.

        One sometimes gets into a bit of trouble with these methods when they are nested several levels deep. For instance:
      </p>
      <code>
        public abstract class Drawable_Item;<br/>
        public abstract class Special_Drawable_Item extends Drawable_Item;<br/>
        public class My_Special_Drawable_Item extends Special_Drawable_Item;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        So, you have draw(..) and item_draw(..) in Drawable_Item. Special_Drawable_Item implements item_draw(..) to handle
        the code common across all its descendents but wants subclasses to be able to further extend behavior. I split the methods again and create a pure virtual special_item_draw(..) called by Special_Drawable_Item::item_draw(..). In C++, item_draw
        is already virtual and I can add no further protection --- My_Special_Drawable_Item can maliciously override it and break the contract. In Java, I can declare Special_Drawable_Item.item_draw(..) final. Either way, the common mistakes have been eliminated and there just isn't that much to be done about malice. I find that naming the specialized method after the class (item_draw(..), special_item_draw(..), etc) makes naming much easier in the nested case than variants on _draw, subclass_draw(..) and variants I have seen.
