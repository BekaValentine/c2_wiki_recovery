        Reactive Demand Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        Reactive Demand Programming (RDP) is a new declarative model of programming with bi-directional, reactive dataflow, continuous demand-driven <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s to control a <a href="MultiAgentSystem.html">MultiAgentSystem</a>. RDP is, at essence, a fusion of <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> and eventless <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a>, where <a href="MessagePassing.html">MessagePassing</a> is replaced by an FRP control signal with a corresponding FRP response. RDP was conceived in April 2010 by David Barbour, and has developed considerably since.

        This page contained a discussion from a time when RDP was still very immature, so has been cleared to avoid confusion with RDP as it exists now. A blog to explain and promote RDP is now available at (<a href="http://awelonblue.wordpress.com).">http://awelonblue.wordpress.com).</a>
