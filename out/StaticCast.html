        Static Cast
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> operator which performs relatively typesafe casts.  Spelled:
      </p>
      <code>
        static_cast<type>(yo)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        All elaborate_cast<> operators have these benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           they have a name, not just ()
        </li>
        <li>
           they restrict their input and output types to a subset of all possible type combinations. Failing the check creates a diagnostic at compile time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any C-style typecast can convert to one-and-only-one elaborate_cast<>, but dynamic_cast<> cannot convert to a C-style cast. (If that fails, the C-style typecast will jam raw bits into an <em>lvalue</em> without complaint.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The types of casts allowed are (some casts are covered by more than one of the below; no complaints please that the list is redundant)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Any cast which is allowed implicitly (without a cast operator)
        </li>
        <li>
           Typecasts from one object to another where a cast function (operator T--see OperatorTee)
        </li>
        <li>
           Typecasts from pointer/reference to a subtype to a pointer/reference to a supertype
        </li>
        <li>
           Typecasts from any pointer to void *
        </li>
        <li>
           Numerical conversions--double to int, int to short, short to int.  Note that "narrowing" conversions are allowed; though if you try one without an explicit cast operator you will get a warning.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note also that "typesafe" does NOT exclude undefined behavior: Using static_cast to "downcast" some Base class pointer or reference to one of its Derived classes does not ensure that the referenced object <strong>really</strong> is of the target class. (Use <a href="DynamicCast.html">DynamicCast</a> to add appropriate runtime checks.)
