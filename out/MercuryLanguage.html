        Mercury Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Mercury is a Programming Language descended from the Prolog Language.

        From the project site (<a href="http://www.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au/)">http://www.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au/)</a> <em>with some </em><a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s sneaked in<em>:</em>

        What is Mercury?

      <p>
        <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> languages have been around since about 1970 (Prolog and MicroPlanner). Despite the expected advantages of a very <a href="HighLevelLanguage.html">HighLevelLanguage</a> based upon well developed theories of logic over conventional programming languages (such as <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> and <a href="AdaLanguage.html">AdaLanguage</a>) they have not had significant impact on the computer industry. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercury is a new logic/<a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a> which combines the clarity and expressiveness of <a href="DeclarativeProgramming.html">DeclarativeProgramming</a> with advanced static analysis and error detection features. Its highly optimized execution algorithm delivers efficiency far in excess of existing logic programming systems, and close to conventional programming systems. Mercury addresses the problems of large-scale program development, allowing modularity, separate compilation, and numerous optimization/time trade-offs.
