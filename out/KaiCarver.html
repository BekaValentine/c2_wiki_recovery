        I'm developing intranet apps using perl and databases.

      <p>
        I saw a mention of Wiki in a discussion on slashdot about how to start an open source project.

      <p>
        I tried reading the IETF WebDAV spec but it was too long.  I'm very inspired by the elegance and simplicity of Wiki.

        I wonder if the <a href="ParisPerlMongers.html">ParisPerlMongers</a> would be interested in hosting a <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>?

        As <a href="mailto:kcarver@dalet.com">mailto:kcarver@dalet.com</a> I work for Dalet Technologies <a href="http://www.dalet.com">http://www.dalet.com</a> in Paris, France.  Not a very interesting web site, I'm afraid, but there's some cool people working there.  It specializes in <a href="GroupWare.html">GroupWare</a>, which is a kind of <a href="VirtualCommunity.html">VirtualCommunity</a>, I guess, but for corporations mostly.  It has offices around the world:

        My friend <a href="HarryVelez.html">HarryVelez</a> is interested in virtual communities.  I'll point him to this page and see what he thinks of it.  He's started a <a href="VirtualCommunity.html">VirtualCommunity</a> at Excite <a href="http://mycomm.excite.com">http://mycomm.excite.com</a> but I'm too paranoid to join 'cause they demand my email and I'm afraid they'll try to make money off me.  Call me <em>paranoid</em>, but I'm more attracted to the free spirit (<a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, NotForProfit, and very elegant) of something like a <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a>.  Harry, what do you think?

        Another friend who might be interested in this is JamesRiley.

        Another person who <em>might</em> be interested is VirginieOmar.  And another: <a href="ChristopheChenon.html">ChristopheChenon</a>.

        <a href="DavidLandgren.html">DavidLandgren</a> started the <a href="ParisPerlMongers.html">ParisPerlMongers</a> , and he met Kai through that group.
