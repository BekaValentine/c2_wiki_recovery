        Noun Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        The structure, relationships, and attributes of nouns or entities. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Databases tend to focus on this. A Schema could perhaps be
        considered a <a href="NounModel.html">NounModel</a>, except that certain behavioral issues, such as triggers and validation, are sometimes included under the umbrella of <a href="NounModel.html">NounModel</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The attributes of nouns?! Is this expression used for real, or is this just kid speak for </em><a href="EntityModel.html">EntityModel</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>{Is it ambiguous, covered by another term, or just silly sounding to you?}</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nouns are just a type of words, they have no ER-type relationships or attributes. Entities do. It's also silly-sounding.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Somebody read an inept OO tutorial that recommended a <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> session should consist of a "hunt for nouns" in the requirements that could represent OO classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though this has nothing to do with modern <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>, someone has then latched onto it as if canon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some seasoned OO fans still agree with a noun-centric way of organizing. I don't know if they are a minority or not, though. Besides, if a class is not based on a noun nor wraps state, how does it differ from a procedural module or subroutine?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm gonna type a word without searching for it first, and see if it turns into a clicker:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MethodObject.html">MethodObject</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        There. I'l bet it doesn't have a ? on it.
