        Plea For Constructive Edits
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've noticed later a tendency for people to come along and simply rubbish things they find. The insanely great thing about a wiki is that when you find something that's not true you don't have to just add a comment saying it's nonsense, <strong>you can actually add signal and remove noise.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, some people simply get off on rubbishing others and never have anything positive to contribute, but next time you find yourself saying that other material is wrong, consider adding a correct exposition.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't be negative,
          <ul>
            <li>
               be positive.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't be destructive,
          <ul>
            <li>
               be constructive.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't belittle,
          <ul>
            <li>
               educate.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you're clever enough to see other people's folly, stupidity or ignorance, help them.
