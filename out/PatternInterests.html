        Pattern Interests
      </h1>
      <p>
        Whenever I meet someone who has an interests in Patterns, I try to figure out <em>what</em> Patterns (and the Pattern movement) means to him or her.
        I find that when we talk about <em>software patterns</em> we could really be talking about a lot of things.  Are you a <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> person? Are you interested in <a href="PatternLanguages.html">PatternLanguages</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that the answers to these questions say a lot about the various interests about Patterns in the pattern community.  Most people get their first introduction into the world of patterns from the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> book.  Some go beyond that, some feel that the GOF stuff is the big win.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, so how would you classify your own interests?
        (Some of these classifications overlap, and some may be vague, so take them with a grain of salt or feel free to refine them...)

        BTW, my interests are in most of the above, but I feel strongly attracted to the whole Alexander notion of a <em>Quality without a Name</em>. -- <a href="ToddCoram.html">ToddCoram</a>

        See <a href="LifeAsArt.html">LifeAsArt</a>.  I'm interested in the BIG picture--how patterns relate across disciplines--language, arts, and science.  --<a href="EdBuffaloe.html">EdBuffaloe</a>

        I'm interested in Patterns as an aid in reverse engineering object-oriented frameworks.  I would say I'd seen the worth of this, but I learned how to extend the <a href="UnidrawFramework.html">UnidrawFramework</a> in part by reading the original papers, and back then they were called idioms... <a href="ScottJohnston.html">ScottJohnston</a>
