        Chat Mode

      <p>
        Chat, also known as <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, belongs on chat servers. One should clean up <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, and <a href="OmitNeedlessWords.html">OmitNeedlessWords</a>, to make content easy to read.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Is there a page detailing, or serving as an index to, a set of patterns for refactoring <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> into <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>?
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Try </em><a href="DocumentModeConversion.html">DocumentModeConversion</a> and <a href="RefactoringWikiPages.html">RefactoringWikiPages</a>.<em></em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is useful in many instances to facilitate Collaboration, to question assumption of fact, to clarify and elaborate, and to build consensus. Used in that way, <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> can lead to the building of <a href="ReallyValuablePages.html">ReallyValuablePages</a>, the Opening up of <a href="WalledGardens.html">WalledGardens</a> and of incomplete or unclear ideas to integration with the rest of the wiki.  
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be fruitless and frustrating if the threads show no sense of ComingTogether,  no Coherence, no LeadingToConclusionsAndAgreements, no <a href="OnlySayThingsThatCanBeHeard.html">OnlySayThingsThatCanBeHeard</a>, and no AgreementToDisagree. If a <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> page or several related <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> pages cannot be refactored into a SinglePageDissertation or a SplitofSupportedContentions (perhaps even by splitting to two or more pages), then it should be considered for deletion (with suitable notice of course).
