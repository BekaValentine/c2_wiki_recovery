        Abc Metric
      </h1>
      <p>
        From an article by Jerry Fitzpatrick originally published in C++ Report, June 1997. <a href="http://www.softwarerenovation.com/ABCMetric.pdf">http://www.softwarerenovation.com/ABCMetric.pdf</a>

        ABC is strictly a software size metric, although it has often been misconstrued as a complexity metric.
      </p>
      <p>
        Size is computed by counting the number of assignments, branches and conditions for a section of code. The counting rules in the original C++ Report article were specifically for the C, C++ and Java languages, and defined as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Assignment -- an explicit transfer of data into a variable, e.g. = *= /= %= += <<= >>= &= |= ^= >>>= ++ --
        </li>
        <li>
           Branch -- an explicit forward program branch out of scope -- a function call, class method call, or new operator
        </li>
        <li>
           Condition -- a logical/Boolean test, == != <= >= < > else case default try catch ? and unary conditionals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A scalar ABC size value (or "aggregate magnitude") is computed as:
      </p>
      <code>
        |ABC| = sqrt((A*A)+(B*B)+(C*C))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The individual A, B and C counts provide distinct information about the code that the overall size value doesn't. For example, the B (branch) count is virtually identical to "cyclomatic complexity".
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to syntax differences, the ABC counting rules for a specific language must generally be tweaked to fulfill the goals of the metric. Futhermore, the metric is probably unsuitable for non-imperative languages (e.g. Prolog).
