        How long will it take? How much will it cost? How can we possibly get all that done in the time given?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>, it is Development's responsibility to estimate time/cost for a story.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a project is anemic in terms of time or money, if the scope is not also reduced, quality suffers and we get FragileCode. But scope reduced too far can result in a MeaninglessProject. On the other hand, too much money or time leads to OverComplicatedCode or LazyCode or time/money wasted in FeatureFrenzy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simplest rule is this: if you cannot estimate the story's time and cost, it's either too big or too fuzzy. It must be split or redefined or both.
