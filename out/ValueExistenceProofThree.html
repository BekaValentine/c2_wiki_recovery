        (On values being allegedly immutable)
      </p>
      <p>
        So the bucket itself is not mutable, we both agree (for practical purposes). Right? But the "contents" of the bucket ARE mutable, as we can put in and take out different content to and from the bucket. Agreed? However, <strong>rocks are a problematic analogy</strong>. In the physical world, you typically have to remove the existing rocks to put in new rocks. It's not practical to smash the rocks into dust and then rebuild new rocks (unless maybe we are recycling pottery). But with electronic flip-flops, we don't have to remove any existing physical "thing" to put in a new/different physical things. It's more equivalent to switching a gate(s) to change the flow of fluid (or flowing electrons). Signals change the direction or "state" of "fluid gates" to alter the flow to a different path (gulley), as needed. Values (content) are NOT solid "things" in the chips such that your rock analogy is a poor fit. There is nothing clearly equivalent to your rocks in chips. Any such mapping requires indirect and contrived fittings or associations or additional layers of pretend or abstract hardware. (I don't believe common notions about languages to be heavily influenced by hardware, but I'm entertaining your claim to see if it provides some insight into the origins and nature of your rather curious and seemingly alien notions about common beliefs among programmers.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's a casual analogy, intended to clarify.  It's not meant to be a precise "rock and bucket" model of </em><a href="VonNeumannArchitecture.html">VonNeumannArchitecture</a>.  It's better to skip analogies entirely, and recognise simply that slots (memory addresses or variables) contain values, slots are mutable in that a different value can be stored in a slot, but values are immutable.  With this simple model, the distinction between values, variables and types can be easily explained and understood.  Without this simple model, it's likely that values, variables and types will continue to be unhelpfully misunderstood as an indistinct muddle, resulting in a poor grasp of programming language semantics which leads to poor programming.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I cannot objectively verify that "values are (or must be) immutable".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's self-evident, and correct by definition.  A "mutable value" isn't a value; it's a variable, by definition.  It's a variable because it has a time-varying aspect, which is -- inevitably -- a value.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If that's the case, then values can never exist in existing RAM-based hardware because every bit/slot of RAM is potentially mutable. Mutability is relative. My "values" are not mutable to the app code writer, but are mutable to a model fiddler. Same with your "values": they are mutable to a model fiddler, or at least to a RAM hacker.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Certainly values exist.  They're what are stored in every RAM address.  Changing a bit replaces a value; it doesn't alter the value itself.  I know of no architecture where 3 becomes 4; in every architecture, a slot that holds a 3 now can hold a 4 later.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not appear to be "replacement" in terms of physical replacement as typically observed during "replacement" of physical objects, as I already explained. No material can be observed to be removed, for example. It doesn't fit the profile of physical observations of replacement in the everyday world. It again appears as if you are mistaking your personal head model for universal or objective truths. Either that, your notion of what "replace" means in English is far different than mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Again, beware of taking illustrative analogies too far and trying to treat them as models.  Computational machines are unique, such that analogy inevitably fails because there is nothing else precisely like a computational machine.  Whilst the notion of "replacement" is a helpful device to aid casual understanding, it is not precise.  In order to be precise, it is necessary to dispense with analogy and accept the pure abstraction:  That slots (memory addresses or variables) contain values, slots are mutable in that a different value can be stored in a slot, but values are immutable.  This simple model makes it possible to understand values, variables and types without any blurring between them, and at the same time allows us to use those concepts to predict and explain all behaviour in (at least popular imperative) programming languages.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Words like "replace" come from the physical/social world of "common" humanity. That's the usual frame of reference for such words, for good or bad. As as far a non-physical abstraction, that's fine as a <em>situational</em> working term, but your version is <strong>not universal nor universally required</strong>. And, in terms of the tag model, not helpful for illustrative purposes per my judgement of target audience <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>. Yes, I know you disagree about the target audience <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, so there is no need to rekindle that sub-debate for the 13th time (approx.). And I don't "blur between them" as I define "value" in the model.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, it was you who suggested we look at "computer architecture" for examples of explicit "values". Now you seem to be back-tracking. It turns out to be not any more concrete at the hardware level then it was on a language or interpreter level. We are just reinventing the same arguments at a different level of architecture. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course it's concrete, at all levels.  What does a machine register store?  What do you push onto a stack?  What do you pop from a stack?  What is stored in a memory address?  In all cases, the answer is "a value".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever a register or memory address stores is not immutable, whatever we call it. If "value" requires immutability, then it's not what memory addresses directly store: <strong>the content of a RAM address is mutable</strong>. You can envision a pretend or virtual middle-man object called a "value" that's not mutable, fine, but that's merely a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> at best (and a distraction at worst), but not a universal objective truth. The content is mutable. Perhaps sub-components of content may <em>modeled as</em> immutable, but such is not the only working model.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Think of it another way:  At a given point in time, any variable (or register, or memory address) has a particular state.  Whilst a variable may take on various states at various times, a particular state is -- by definition -- immutable.  "Changing" state means referencing a different state.  The usual term for a possible state of a variable (or register, or memory address) is a "value".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Every change and zero changes can be viewed in such terms, if one so chooses. Sometimes it's helpful to model something that "changes state" as being "swapped out" for a different one, or model it as being mutable. Both can often be made to work, but the real question is whether using such a view is "helpful". 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Absolutely it's helpful.  It clearly distinguishes values from variables, and makes it possible to recognise a type as a set of values.  Treating values as mutable (despite being contrary to any meaningful definition of "value") forces a conflation of values and variables, and blurs the otherwise clear distinction between types, values and variables.  Treating values as immutable makes values, variables and types trivially distinct, which simplifies understanding of programming languages.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The tag model does not "conflate" values and variables. It just does not use YOUR definition of "value". Different issue. And defining types as a "set of values" has some conceptual problems in many cases. In dynamic languages, it's best to say that each operator <em>does what it wants to</em> with type-related info and skip defining a global view of any given "type" because there often is no One Right global view in such languages. A "Boolean" for one operator may differ or be inconsistent with "Boolean" for another. Global consistency is nice when it occurs, but is <strong>not guaranteed</strong> per dynamic language conventions (or lack of). Perhaps we can definite it as a "set of values" within EACH operator, but nobody has found a nice way to present such so far. That's why I do it imperatively in the tag model: developers know that presentation style. See, it's all done for a rational reason. -t

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I suspect you feel "nobody has find [sic] a nice way to present [an explanation of </em><a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> languages] so far" because of your lack of understanding, not because it's unclear (except in the PHP manual, which is notably dire).  The fact that literals of various types can be encoded in string literals -- so operators can interpret string operands as they see fit -- is so obvious as to generally not be worth mentioning.<em></em>

        <li>
           I already know you believe me to be a stupid dummy; repeating that over and over won't change anything. It's not new information about your assessment of me. My personal observations of how other developers mentally manage dynamic types can be found in <a href="MentallyManageDynamicTypes.html">MentallyManageDynamicTypes</a>. Yes, I know you disagree. And again, the issue is not that such parsing MAY happen, the issue is knowing and predicting where it actually will happen specifically. ["Found" typo has been fixed.]

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Regarding "knowing and predicting where [parsing] ... will happen specifically", since it only occurs within given operators, how can you "predict" it except by making reference to specific language documentation?

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I didn't claim there was. And, using your style of "values" won't help that either.

        <li>
           <em>My descriptions -- including my "style of 'values'" are based on the semantics of popular imperative programming languages, the understanding of which is likely to benefit programmers in general.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           So you claim. Until we have a way to objectively measure "semantics", a fitness computation ("based on X") is so far elusive. My model does NOT contradict typical dynamic language documentation; so if you are somehow measuring "semantics" based on the documentation, then we are both in the same boat. (Some terms are overloaded or vague such that it's possible to have different interpretations without being "wrong".)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>We don't need a way to "objectively measure 'semantics'", and I've no idea what you mean by "a fitness computation".  Again, your "different interpretations" are irrelevant.  All that's needed is to see what language semantics are intended by reading language documentation.  Your assertion that "some terms are overloaded or vague" reflects only on </em>'your<em>' lack of understanding, not any general misunderstanding about language semantics.  The proof is that there are working programming language implementations written by thousands of programmers being successfully used by millions of programmers.</em>

           You have NOT done a formal textual analysis of such to provide solid evidence the written material backs your model/notions and contradicts mine (outside of I/C builder docs). You just make claims out of the blue about those writings. And you admitted English (as usually used) is indeed insufficient in <a href="TypesAndAssociations.html">TypesAndAssociations</a> near <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> human_languages_26. Are you back-tracking now?

           Like I've explained many times (see <a href="WeakProgrammersRelyOnBadDocumentation.html">WeakProgrammersRelyOnBadDocumentation</a>), rough and approximate notions are "good enough" for production work for typical programmers because dynamic languages are rarely used in mission-critical or bug-sensitive applications. However, if somebody wants a more rigorous model, for whatever reason, there are few options unless one is skillful with or familiar with post-graduate academic approaches and writing. Instead of relying on the difficult-to-digest academic approach, I've created a model using imperative techniques that programmers use in their daily work to make it more digestible. Here's a different way to restate the choices:

      </ul>
      <code>
        // example choices_382<br/>
        IF approximate "type" notions are good enough THEN<br/>
        use approximate notions.<br/>
        ELSE IF more rigor or x-ray-ability is desired THEN<br/>
        IF you find the academic approaches difficult to digest THEN<br/>
        try top's tag model, it's based on imperative algorithms and XML,<br/>
        which is something you likely use often at work.<br/>
        ELSE<br/>
        dig in the academic materials or fork over 70k for more school.<br/>
        END IF<br/>
        END IF<br/>

        We could model human aging as swapping out each person with a different version of the person every morning, and say that people are not mutable, but rather being replaced by older-styled variations. But, is that thought model actually useful? That's the real question. Yes, we <strong>can</strong> view memory addresses in a similar way, but in many cases it serves no purpose or provides no net improvements to a model in terms of the model's intended purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Again, by introducing "human aging" as an analogy, you're trying to stretch analogies to fit where analogies will not fit.  Analogies are ultimately unhelpful, because the only appropriate analogy for a computational machine is another computational machine.  Computational machines are unique; no non-computational analogy will fully fit.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not an analogy, it was an application of the your "state swap" view (for lack of a better term) to demonstrate how the mutability view and the state-swap view are generally <strong>interchangeable</strong>. The benefits or weakness of each depend on circumstances and <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> of the model user and neither are absolutely right or absolutely wrong (except maybe if we gained a God View of the guts of the universe). Maybe the universe really is generating a different instance of everything per "click" of time. We can't rule it out. (That idea is not any weirder than some other quantum theory related hypotheses, such as the Many Worlds hypothesis). In the everyday world, we generally only consider state-swap happening if the "prior version" can be seen and typically has to be moved out of the way or discarded/recycled. But in virtual worlds, we don't need this step such that one can use either model interchangeability. To insist that either one is "the only right view" is silly. The benefits of either is more about weighing model description/grokking/implementation tradeoffs, NOT absolute truths. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't follow your pseudo-philosophical ruminations, which still seem to be attempting analogies.  It would help to think solely in terms of computation and computational machines, not things which are neither.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's the same issue with chips: both the state-swap model and mutation model can fit observations. The actual physical model of such chips/transistors is "flow redirection" as  already discussed such that both are merely <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>s. We don't want to model electron flow systems at a higher level, and it's not "natural" to most human thinking. Perhaps we should study electro-mechanical computers so we don't have to delve into how transistors work. As I roughly understand them, they generally had the equivalent of a toggle switch for each "bit". A current on the left side of the switch will either switch the toggle "on", or leave it "on" if it's already there, and the current on the right side will either switch the toggle "off" or leave it off if it's already there. To me, this process is clearly NOT "replacing", and therefore does not fit your description/view of immutability. -t

        A physical model that matches what you describe would be more like the <strong>old-fashioned gas-station price boards</strong>: One has a special long stick to grab the old digit card, take it down, and replace it with a new (more relevant) digit card. But that's not how computer hardware typically does it.

        That's what we went over above when we looked at RAM and "replace" etc. There is no physically observable "replace" happening. You seem to be projecting your personal mental models into physical things. The mutate model is a better model of what's actually observable. If you disagree, so be it. Let's <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There is a physically observable "replace" of values happening in computers, because we can't observe any transition from one value to another.  There's no point at which we can observe a memory address partly containing the old 3 and partly containing the new 4.  It's either 3, or it's 4.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Please elaborate. Physical "replace" always involves old material having to be removed. We don't see such. And I don't see how apparent instantaneous-ness backs "replace" over "morph". Both can be viewed as either instant or gradual such that that factor is not a determiner of one over the other. Further, gradual versus instant is usually moot because RAM observers are usually "locked out" during the change-over. Thus, the slot user sees: 1) State A, 2) Lock-out, 3) State B. (I don't know if each bit actually changes at the exact same time and I doubt regular programmers know or care such that it doesn't affect their view of RAM. I doubt it's at the EXACT same time because that's probably impossible if time is truly continuous. It only has to switch within a given range of time: generally inside the period of the lock-out session.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I don't know where this "lock-out" comes from.  We're not talking about concurrency issues.  Even if we are, the slot user sees State A, then the slot user sees State B.  There is no intermediate state.  There is no gradual change of state.  The notion of "old material having to be removed" is a confusion resulting from your adherence to analogies; a machine state isn't "material" to be removed.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There <em>is</em> an intermediate state. The user is just <strong>not allowed to see it</strong> via a lock-out mechanism, such as timing techniques. The "lock-out" is a real feature to prevent so-called "dirty reads". Perhaps "lock-out" is the wrong term/phrase, but lock-while-write is a real feature of memory and disk design. Still, instantaneous-ness is not a distinguishing factor between the two views anyhow. And the removal stage is HOW we know "replacement" is happening. It's a <strong>symptom</strong> of replacement, NOT an analogy. Without such symptoms, we can't tell if "replace" is happening. We shouldn't just take your word for it. <strong>If "replace" has any useful meaning, then characteristics of replacement need to exist</strong>. Otherwise, it's either the wrong term OR indistinguishable from alternative descriptions/interpretations. See <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> English-Universe.

           That's poor reasoning. <a href="AbsenceOfEvidenceIsNotEvidenceOfAbsence.html">AbsenceOfEvidenceIsNotEvidenceOfAbsence</a>. If they can't observe the state change happen, they should NOT make assumptions about it when making conclusions intended to be universally true. <strong>You should not conclude it's instantaneous or not instantaneous of you cannot see it</strong>. It's perfectly okay to make a working assumption for certain kinds of models (<a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>), but one should make those working assumptions clear. If I'm not allowed to see what happens during the "lock out" period, I am not going to make any <strong>universal</strong> conclusions (guesses) about it. That would be irrational behavior.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>No, that's reasonable technical reasoning.  I'm not making any claims about universal truth, only about the truth observed by a user, which in this case is the only relevant truth.</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, sorry, it's not reasonable. You cannot conclude it's "instantaneous" just because the transition is not observable. The answer to the "instantaneous" question is "unknown" or "null" from the chip user's perspective.

        <li>
           <em>I never claimed anything was "instantaneous".  What made you think I did?  From a user's point of view, values are immutable and slots are mutable.  That, and that alone, is observable.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           I won't revisit where that perception came from as long is it doesn't come up again. And to most users, "slots" (and similar terms) and "values" are quite often <strong>used interchangeably</strong> in colloquial descriptions of such, creating a contradiction in your statement. Plus, "value" is often used in a non-mutable way in general, indicating immutability is NOT an idea strongly cemented with the term in people's heads. But I live with such contradiction and inconsistency because English as usually used for such things is ambiguous and overloaded. I don't pretend it's rigorous because I know better.

           "Change the content of cell" probably means "change the content of (inside) a cell". Yes, it's probably thought of as "morphing", for lack of a better word. But I will admit I have not x-rayed user minds and only go only indirect clues. But such evidence is all either of us has.

           "Sounds like"? They are not equivalent to me. Very different. The second phrases comes across as very unnatural and uncommon. Same goes for "inside". And "slot" and "cell" are generally interchangeable as far as I'm concerned. Needless to say, we both appear to interpret English very differently. I feel my way is "right" and common, but there is probably no use in arguing about it without formal studies. Let's <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a>.

           If we are not measuring implementation, then we are modelling abstract models.

           If somebody gets inside the guts of <em>any</em> interpreter, the "results of expression evaluation are mutable". As a reminder, the source code (input) cannot do such a thing. There is no source code that can be fed into the tag emulator/model that can change the intermediate results in the way you keep fearing (unless somebody adds a backdoor). As we discussed before, a production interpreter would probably want to use stricter designs/classes to reduce the chance of "internal" changes to such, but this is a "toy" (learning) model that intentionally allows fiddling with the interpreter/emulator guts. But even with stricter designs/classes, RAM is always mutable via hacking etc. such that <strong>"immutable" is relative</strong>. Most people who know the basics of computer hardware would agree that "the content of RAM are mutable". That's the way it is. A theoretical 100% immutable value is purely an abstract idea (that may or may not be useful for modelling etc.) that does not objectively exist in the absolute sense, at least not without special hardware. It's more practical to talk about immutability from the perspective of something, such as the <strong>perspective</strong> of the app programmer (input source code), from the interpreter model, from a hacker, from a chip designer, etc. -t

           Anyhow, I thought we were talking about "common notions" (or common semantics), not abstract theoretical objects such as fully immutable values. It is <strong>NOT a common notion that "values are immutable"</strong>, at least when values are used interchangeably with "content", which they frequently are. If you claim immutability is a common notion of "value", then please cite a sufficient number of sources, and include those that don't have such evidence. In other words, if you survey texts on the subject to gain evidence, you cannot report back JUST on those that match your claim; you have to report all that were examined because "failures" also convey info, and that's proper statistics, being that "common" is the issue at hand.

        And the gas station analogy was meant to show what your version of "value replace" would actually look like. It's NOT intended as an analogy, but a <strong>proof of concept</strong> for your viewpoint (as the word "replace" is typically used in the real world). Such could be implemented/automated in computational hardware. I provided it to contrast with existing hardware and to demonstrate how most would interpret your wording in terms of hardware implementation. In fact, <strong>punched cards</strong> were like that. They were rarely directly changed, but rather the old one discarded and a new copy made with the changes in place. -t

        Apparently so. You are not describing your position well. Observation of RAM does <em>not</em> provide clear evidence of "immutable values". I don't know where this clear evidence is.

      <p>
        <em>Understanding </em><a href="VonNeumannArchitecture.html">VonNeumannArchitecture</a> and the simple mathematics upon which it is based does, however, provide clear evidence of immutable values.  Note that there is no arithmetic that mutates a 3 into a 4.

           We looked at <a href="VonNeumannArchitecture.html">VonNeumannArchitecture</a>, and you are wrong, or at least using one possible model among multiple that fit observations. <strong>Physical observations do NOT back your immutability model</strong> as the only fit.  I'd argue current computer architecture intentionally blocks the stage where we could otherwise answer the immutability question as part of it's fundamental design philosophy to avoid "dirty reads". This applies to disks also, not just RAM: disks typically don't read and write the same sector at the same time. And we are talking about computers, not arithmetic.

           Sorry, you have not given decent and clear evidence for such. We've been over that, and there's no hints of anything equivalent to physical swapping as seen in the everyday world, such as replacement debris. You'd have to demonstrate debris at least, to convince me. I will only agree that "replacement" is one of multiple matching ways to model it.

           I also pointed out that many systems use "substitute" instead of "replace" for such. But I'm not sure string processing is representative of the issue here. I'm trying to explain that actual observations do not point to replacements EXCLUSIVELY. I agree that "replacement" is one interpretation/model that "works" in terms of matching observation, but is NOT a unique interpretation/model that works. There is no observation that EXCLUSIVELY makes or demonstrates "immutable values". If you find such an EXCLUSIVE observation, please carefully describe it. In fact, in physical materials, there probably is a transition stage where a "'3' morphs into a '4'" in a <strong>gradual</strong> fashion (per small time scales) to borrow your example. The only place that comes to mind where your model of values existed physically in computers is punched cards: the old card was tossed or archived, and a new one created with the record changes on it. But I do NOT believe that kind of thing is a common head metaphor used by most developers when thinking about changing content in spreadsheet cells, table cells (row and column), form fields, or variables.

           Again again, <a href="AbsenceOfEvidenceIsNotEvidenceOfAbsence.html">AbsenceOfEvidenceIsNotEvidenceOfAbsence</a>. Your logic is flawed. One CAN observe that a change has happened, but cannot witness the actual change, and thus cannot make any statements about the mechanism. (The actual physics support morphing, not swapping.) If one observes a chair in a room, closes the door for a short while, then opens the door, and sees a chair that appears different from the firstly observed chair, one cannot say with certainty whether it's the same chair morphed somehow, or a different (swapped) chair. All one can confirm is that it has different characteristics. You are over-speculating about the mechanism.

           Can you clearly demonstrate "directly observable"? And I don't mean your personal interpretation of what may be happening: I mean direct evidence of "replacing"? Note that we can observe that it "has changed", but we cannot observe the moment of change. That's why I use the word "replace". The chip user can NOT directly observe the "value" (content) at the very <strong>point of transition</strong>. Observing that it "has changed" does not provide evidence to distinguish between the two models.

           <em>Sure.  In Javascript:  "a=3; b=3; alert(a==b); b=2; alert(a==b);"  We should note that the first alert displays 'true', the second displays 'false'.  Thus, we note that changing the value in a slot is directly observable.  Now try "3=2;"  It fails because we cannot mutate a 3 into a 2.  Furthermore, there is no construct we can conceive that would allow us to observe a 3 mutating into a 2.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Like I said above, observing that something "has changed" does not give us enough info to select between the two competing explanations. You are not providing new information here. You have not proved that the content of "b" has not mutated. (No language experiments will differentiate between the two explanations, I'm pretty confident.) And "3=2" is invalid syntax. Such a test tells us nothing to help select. The models and interpreters shouldn't run "3=2". It's <strong>meaningless</strong> to interpreters and humans (unless they invent a personal meaning for it in their head). Might as well be "glap#&@^@*".

Second, there are at least two ways to interpret that statement. The first is that variable names can start with with digits, and "3" is a variable name. The second, is that all occurrences of the literal, value, and/or constant "3" will be treated like or replaced by a "2".

        You seem to interpret English different than most other people. "Replace" means something very different to YOU than to me. I don't know how to remedy that. It's like talking to an alien from another universe with different physics. In MY universe, "replace" almost always leaves detectable remnants/waste such that I expect detectable remnants if "replace" is happening. If there are no remnants, it's indistinguishable from a "message" to change state, such that I would call such a "message" in my universe. In your universe, "replace" ODDLY has no such side-effect. If replace means something completely different in cyber-space than the physical world, then that's news to me and I need a <strong>cyber-space dictionary</strong> that's been cleansed of the everyday physics and processes that originally shaped English. Such a dictionary would give clear cyberland definitions of common words like, "has", "is", "contains", "change", "replace", etc. (Granted, a "message" can leave behind debris in the physical world, but unlike "replace", the debris resembles the message device, not the "fixed" item containing the content. If the message and the content item are of the same construction, then "change" versus "replace" are indistinguishable anyhow, barring some marking technique, making them interchangeable viewpoints.)

Note that the term "replace" is not essential; it's more important to recognise that variables are mutable and values are immutable.  Whether we call it "replace" or "change" or <whatever> matters not, as long as we understand what it means.</em>

      <p>
        MY difficulty with language? I propose YOU have the difficulty in that you mistake your personal interpretation as a universal truth. And my "values" are not more or less immutable than yours. I'm not entirely sure what your complaint is; you seem to flip flop. Per naming actually used in my model, my "values" don't demonstratively violate such. <strong>You appear to be quibbling about some extremely minor and obtuse philosophical nit</strong>. As far as your accounting anecdote, I don't know those students or their issues and so cannot comment. Generally as long as one can guess how future accounting coworkers and auditors are likely to label something, that's good enough to get work done. It doesn't matter if they are "wrong" as long as you can predict their classification and match it. It's a form of <a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a> per matching the "output" of people and auditors instead of interpreters. <strong>You only have to match them, not philosophically agree with them</strong> to get work done and paid. One of the jobs of legal experts is to predict how a judge or jury may interpret a given law. Whether the judge or jury is "right" is moot: one is <strong>paid to predict them, not "fix" them</strong>. Accountants have similar responsibilities when classifying transactions. If they have a disagreement with how something "should" be classified, they can take it to an accounting association or a professional discussion forum. But don't gum up your current employer's operations by forcing your classification into the existing system/environment when it will create a likely flag (mismatch) with auditors etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You appear to have misunderstood my example.  The problem with the accounting students who get hung up on what "debit" and "credit" mean is that it inhibits their understanding of bookkeeping and accounting.  All that "debit" and "credit" really mean are the left and right hand columns, respectively, of a bookkeeping ledger.  Those who try to infer greater meaning to "debit" and "credit" -- such as whether money is being added or subtracted or loaned or deposited or going in or out or whatever -- inevitably wind up confused.  Similarly, getting hung up on whether "replace" or "change" or <whatever> is the best term to represent what happens to variables will inhibit understanding rather than helping it.</em>

        True, but the word choice may be because nobody found a better name, or it's good enough. Many systems call it <strong>"substitute"</strong>, which is more technically accurate in my opinion, but longer. Further, that usage does NOT forbid the existence of debris, for the debris could be dumped in an internal garbage can (GC?) without the function user having to be concerned with who empties it. English usage is not rigorous or consistent when applied to the technical world. And this allows two or more approaches to be "right" even though it may create a potential inconsistency. As I mentioned before, "change the value" is frequent in form and spreadsheet discussions, implying values are mutable. For these reasons, one shouldn't put too much stock in English, especially in arguing that there is <a href="OneTruePath.html">OneTruePath</a>. Because you are arguing for <a href="OneTruePath.html">OneTruePath</a> in type modelling, <strong>you have a higher burden of evidence than I do</strong>.

        No, it's not. You have not shown that it violates any clear-cut rule other than rules you made up in year head, but mistake for external universal truths. RAM is not immutable by most accounts, thus no "value" (cell content) in any fucking interpreter is 100% "immutable" in an objective and measurable way using physical tools and photons. QED. The RAM model you use in your head is an <strong>arbitrary model</strong> with arbitrary rules (or at least unnecessary rules).

        "Immutability" is relative, like I already described. Anything in RAM is potentially mutable. I only need to things to be immutable per matching the reference interpreter's level regarding immutability to be "correct". The intermediate internal parts are NOT changeable via the input source code; and thus <strong>I satisfy the requirements</strong>.

        Re: "values are immutable by definition" - In that case, then common speech and RAM physics kicks the definition in the nuts. But you over-apply it in that mutability is generally considered relative to something. Further, the things labelled "values" in my model are not any more or less immutable than your "value", based on the info you've given. If you stated in your model, "they must be implemented using a write-only structure (create only)", then I might give your model credit for making them immutable from the interpreter source-side side, but that STILL does not prove "common usage/semantics". That would only be a feature specific to your model.

If you assign an object to a variable [...] all you really do is make this variable [...] point to the object [...] which is kept somewhere in memory, as a convenient way of accessing it." -- i.e., a variable is a named pointer; no indication of a 'type' property associated with it.<em></em>

           We've covered Python already somewhere. It's a "pure" OOP language such that everything is an object. (And the tag is probably in the object.) But that does not make its variable design a universal model. Different languages may indeed need different models (if we want to say capture its OO-ness properly). No news there. (Note that if we don't care to model the OO aspects and just study "simple" scalars, we don't necessarily have to introduce the OO modeling aspect if no tests reveal it's necessary. Just because you want to model the position of the planets in the sky doesn't mean you also have to model their brightness to viewers.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>If "the tag is probably in the object" (whatever that means) then it isn't in the variable.  Also, in Python we know any value can be assigned to any Python variable at any time.  Hence, no type-checking on assignment, therefore Python variables do not have types.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I agree in Python's case, at least in terms if the first sentence. But perhaps it never matters for scalars such that my structure may still work in terms of matching results with scalars. If we are not interested in modeling objects, then why model them unless it impacts what we do want to model?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Your structure has a redundant attribute, the "variable type", that will never be used.  Why model it unless it impacts what you want to model?</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Flat False. It clearly changes the behavior if removed for tagged languages. You are just bitching because you <em>personally</em> don't like the structure used in the model. You have not identified a clear and objective flaw, just round-about esoteric and evasive mumbo jumbo.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The clear and objective flaw is that you include an attribute in your variable that is not reflected in the semantics of variables in dynamically-typed languages.  In dynamically-typed languages, there are only ever two operations associated with variables:  Store a value, and retrieve a value.  That being so, what is the "type" attribute used for?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are <strong>making up allegedly formal rules</strong> about variables out of the blue. Knock it off. Bad habit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I'm not making up anything.  I'm simply observing what happens in popular dynamically-typed imperative programming languages.  I've never seen anything done with variables in Perl, Python, PHP, Javascript or Ruby other than "store a value" and "retrieve a value".</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What about "getType" kind of functions? Both our models generally associate one way or another two "attributes" with each variable: the "type indicator" and "representation" (naming decisions aside). The packaging/nesting and "accessors" for those two attributes may vary, but that's just implementation/model specifics. I don't see clear and consistent indicators in most writing that dictates such packaging. There are simply multiple ways to skin the packaging cat.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The "getType" functions retrieve a value from a variable, and then return the value's type.  Note that you can pass any expression to getType() in PHP.  Regarding packaging, since a type reference is </em>'always<em>' paired with a value's representation (though the pairing may be implicit if the type reference is always the same, e.g., "string"; otherwise, the representation is meaningless), why would you not always package the representation with its type reference?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I *do* package the representation ("value") with the type reference. They are in the same XML tag. (And they are not always paired, by the way.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, but you use that same XML tag to represent variables, so you wind up conflating variables with the result of expression evaluation (which you don't want to call a value.)</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Okay, I am using the same structure to represent both "variables" and "result of expressions", I will acknowledge. But "internal" variables follow certain naming traditions to avoid confusion with "regular" variables. I could introduce an additional different "kind" of structure to make sure they are clear, but that's "double clarity" because the described naming already is sufficient. The extra structure complicates the design without offering sufficient benefits in exchange. It's mental <a href="SafetyGoldPlating.html">SafetyGoldPlating</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Isn't it more complex -- and less likely to be easily understood -- to rely on naming conventions to disambiguate an unfamiliar programming concept (I doubt your audience of programmers will have ever heard of an "internal variable"; indeed, I never heard of it until you used the term), than simply use two structures to identify the familiar programming concepts of "value" and "variable"?  Wouldn't "double clarity", as you call it, be something worth having?  If "clarity" is good, isn't "double clarity" better?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's a model-specific term, not unlike "representation". And no, double clarity is redundant. If the additional clarity layer complicates the model, then its downsides outweigh the benefits. The "mental crashes" and abandonment caused by a more complicated model become more likely or more severe than those caused by lack of an extra assurance mechanism ("double clarity") by my estimate. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>"Representation" isn't a model-specific term; it's used in the conventional manner.  How does distinguishing "value" and "variable", which language documentation typically does already (whether it defines these terms or not is something else), potentially result in "mental crashes" (what are they? sounds scary!) and abandonment?  (Abandonment?  Really?)  You make it sound like the difference is between simple algebra and tensor calculus, when in fact it's like the difference between some simple algebra and some other simple algebra, except your simple algebra doesn't distinguish variables from values.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The way your model uses representation is model-specific. Generally "representation" in terms of app programming means the formatting a particular operation uses to present content to a human reader or external device.  As far as why it would complicate the model, I'd probably have to create 2 sets of API's, one set for internal variables (whatever they are called) and one set for regular variables. I may be able to factor some of the implementation to a single spot, but that creates an extra layer of indirection or call levels. And it would increase the code base by roughly 30% to 50%. If a model is too complex or "long", people are more likely to abandon it (give up). To try to put proportions on that, 40% more code means grokking takes on average roughly 40% longer (linear is perhaps the wrong scaling model, but good enough for very rough estimations). And I roughly estimate it would increase the abandonment rate by 40% also. On the other hand, issues caused by confusing internal variables with external ones would run roughly around 5% for the same metrics. Remember, we already have one "protection" or self-documenting internal-ness-labelling mechanism in place due to the naming conventions of internal variables. Thus, the prevented "problem incidents" resulting from a <em>second</em> such mechanism will be small. -t

           <em>No, my use of "representation" is not model-specific.  It's consistent with what "representation" means, which is "how something is represented."  In my model, "representation" is how a value is represented in RAM.  In "app programming", it's how content is represented to a user.  I'm not sure why you think my approach would be more complex for distinguishing values from variables.

I don't know of any objective and universally-accepted test to measure "explicitly have" beyond modelling with and without and comparing to the results; i.e. empirical science. I do know that modelling it that way often "works" in terms of <a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a>, or approximations thereof (for scalars).

           <em>Sure, it's possible to define a model in which values are not nested in variables, but I don't know of any popular dynamically-typed imperative programming language where a variable doesn't store a value.  Therefore, it makes sense to "nest" values in variables.  It would be equally reasonable to employ any mechanism that shows a time-varying relation between a variable name and a value, because that's what a variable is.  Of course, in that case a value should be shown as an immutable relation between a representation and a type, because that's what a value is.</em>

           That's your personal description of how variables "work". That's not an objective statement. You have not produced any formal proof, just round-about and obtuse word-play. The model "works" withOUT using your preferred version of variable/value (per <a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a> testing). Now, you probably claim it doesn't match descriptions given in manuals, but most such <strong>manuals do not formally or clearly describe "values". They are mentioned mostly in passing</strong>.

               If it's talking about Java, then why reference it? We are discussing dynamic languages. And your description there is your personal model, not the canonical model. If you found say 3 dynamic language manuals that <em>directly</em> said "variables have no types", you may have a decent case. <strong>But, you don't.</strong> FAIL. One or two may be author-specific descriptions/notions such that it's too weak of a frequency to "count" in terms of canonical-ness. Three establishes it as at least a "common notion". But do note that being common and being "the canon" are not the same thing. For example, perhaps half agree with your model of variables and half agree with mine. That would mean that half the manuals could end up backing your favored view. But half does not make a canon. But since you've yet to crack the 0.0000001% mark, we are not even close to a canon-level debate.

               That's not a "manual", it's some guy's blog, more or less. But I'll compromise and count it as half a point. Re: "There is nothing in <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> language semantics that denotes retrieval or storage of a variable's type independent of its value." -- getType()-like functions do it. You use words like "compelling" and "obviously" so casually. "Compelling" would be like 20 manuals that explicitly stated such.

                   <em>No, getType()-like functions </em>'do not<strong> "do it".  If they did, they would only work on variables.  However, every implementation of a getType()-like function accepts an </strong>expression<em>' as an argument.  Every reference to a variable in (or as) an expression retrieves its value.

           I am not aware of such. If you have specific issues with the wording of the documentation, please point out these specific spots, suggest alternatives, and I'll be happy to consider them and make changes if they improve the docs. As far as "canonical", it came about in association with religious organizations. If and how it applies to the IT world, I cannot say with any certainty. It's another case where regular English is not rigorous enough to address specific issues. Designating the manual that came with the programming language as the canonical authority may be an arbitrary designation. The "notions of the masses" matter, in my opinion, similar to how definitions are determined by actual usage, <em>not</em> by the creator of the term. I <strong>consider the audience</strong> of the model as they currently are, not as they "should be". You seem to be should-ifying again here. <strong>Typical programmers have no "solid" and/or consistent model or notion about the association between values, variables, and types</strong> based on my field experience. They have or use rough notions or just rely on experience-based habits. This may differ from your experience with typical programmers such that we'll have to deal with the <a href="AnecdoteImpasse.html">AnecdoteImpasse</a> and <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> which best fits their experience or situation.

        </li>
        <li>
           Yes, I did review the disclaimer on that page and expanded it. And the tag model does NOT contradict the vast majority of such manuals (except maybe some OO-centric languages, which require refitting in both models). As far as matching how interpreters "actually work", that's not a primary goal of the model. The reader/user is allowed to select a model that best matches his or her goals. Even you agreed that implementation-matching may complicate a model (caching techniques, etc.). And all implementations are "arbitrary". There are many ways to skin a cat.

That is to say, when you assign an expression to a variable, the entire value of the original expression is copied into the destination variable.

That statement is just clarifying Php is not using object references or something similar, being some OO languages would have such side effects. It's setting the stage for the "&" discussion that comes just after by contrasting regular behavior with the reference-based behavior. It's not defining nor discussing a type system there. Why you think it's talking about types, I don't know. Obviously, you interpreted it different than I did. I also suspect it's using the common terminology "by value" that comes with the "by value" versus "by reference" pairing. It's thus borrowing common phrases for their familiarity <em>alone</em> and is not attempting to define "value" in any rigorous way.

           Yes. See how "plus" calls "updateVar" at the end with a tag parameter and a value parameter? Note your statement made me realize I was missing a function from the API that allowed direct copying of variables because most examples focused on operators. I just added "copyVar", and clarified the usage of the "assign" function. Thank You for helping make the tag model/kit more thorough. I'll call you one less mean name as compensation :-)

           "a=b;". Granted, there is a wide range of different ways people describe it. But, "copy a variable" is typical in colloquial programming in my experience. Other variations include "copy the contents of a variable", and "copy a variable's value" and "copy the data from...". Content, data, and value tend to be used interchangeably. "Content" tends to be a bit more general in that it may be a structure(s) also, whereas "value" usually refers to a specific singular number, string, date, etc. -t

Models often have internal parts that are required for the specific model to run, but don't reflect the thing being modeled, like gears in an orerry. It's as if you use thread spindles instead of gears, and then complain that the gears in my model are not in the real thing. But neither are your thread spindles. (Yes, you probably think your "spindles" ARE part of objective reality, but that's because you mistake your personal pet notions for universal objective truths. You have a problem in that area.)

           <em>The semantics of every popular imperative programming language all state (or strongly imply) that the result of evaluating an expression, or what is returned by a function, is a value.  I know of no semantics that state (or strongly imply) that the result of evaluating an expression, or what is returned by a function, is a value along with something else.  If there's no semantically significant "something else", why model it?</em>

           As written, almost none of such statements contradict my model. As far as the design tradeoffs of the parts, I've been over and over that. I'm sorry you disagree with those choices. I've described the reasoning behind those tradeoffs as carefully and detailed as I know how. <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> whether those explanations are sufficient. Most of our disagreement appears to be over assumptions about programmer <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, including "common notions" they may have.

           <em>That's not what we're debating.  Thanks for trying to "straighten out" us "foo(l)s", though.  That's what the world needs; more superficial attempts to "straighten out" other people, especially with insults.  Insults are a great way to get people on your side, because when they realise your insult was really, really good -- like "foo(l)s"; that's the best. I am a foo, and we're definitely a pair of foos -- they'll do everything you say.</em>

        Computer software is all about making sense of a whole lot of states and logical gates. The rest is all sugar. -- <a href="ChaunceyGardiner.html">ChaunceyGardiner</a>

        <em>Perhaps.  Another view is that a whole lot of states and logical gates are just some electro-mechanical sugar we use to speed up the execution of computer software.</em>
