        Explicit Management Of Implicit Context
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Explicit Management of Implicit Context (EMIC)</strong> is a potential language feature.  I'm describing it here to help solidify its concept and to run it up the flagpole and see who salutes or flames - all comments are welcome.  
      </p>
      <p>
        EMIC shifts what is essentially a <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> (or <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>) into the implicit evaluation/execution context of a language, such that it needn't be explicitly threaded or forwarded via parameter passing from one method to another.  However, it is intended to be a fully language-supported feature... requiring a more generic (and likely more difficult) implementation than the humble <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Chances are EMIC is nothing new and could be implemented in many languages (esp. the dynamic ones) without much effort.  However, I consider it worth describing as a feature.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Working definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>context</strong> - services (including mutable state) and values accessible for computations (either or both of calculations and communications); a fairly broad term that sweeps up such things as environment variables, local variables, globals, singletons, thread-local state, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>implicit context</strong> - context is forwarded or threaded through computations without expression of this threading/forwarding represented explicitly in the code.  This would, thus, exclude parameters (which are forwarded explicitly) and local variables (which aren't forwarded at all - though they could be included in a language with <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a>).  Globals, singletons, environment variables, thread-local state, and even Haskell's language-supported monads (due to the implicit forwarding) all include implicit context.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>language-supported feature</strong> - a language-supported feature is (in this context) declared to be one that is integrated with the language syntax, standard libraries, and other language features such that it can be utilized orthogonally to them.  Some properties for EMIC would include, for example:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Convenient syntax for most manipulations.
            </li>
            <li>
               statically type-safe access to and manipulation of the context (at least if the language is normally statically type-safe)
            </li>
            <li>
               garbage collection (for languages that are normally garbage collected)
            </li>
            <li>
               avoidance of downcasting (at least if it normally can be avoided in the language...).
            </li>
            <li>
               coupling with threads (if the language supports them) - a context for each thread is very sensible.  Would replace use of <a href="ThreadLocalStorage.html">ThreadLocalStorage</a> (making <em>usable</em> one of the most painful <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> features in this world) though may be implemented atop it.
            </li>
            <li>
               coupling with promises (if the language supports them) - a promise to perform a calculation or communication should automatically be performed in the context in which the promise was initially made.
            </li>
            <li>
               coupling with continuations (if the language supports them) - continuations should somehow be paired with contexts, whether this be the continuation containing a context, the context containing a continuation, or simply being a pair (continuation,context).  For optimizations and safety guarantees, it is best if the continuation (opaquely) contains the context (allowing assumptions and partial evaluations over components of the context from call/cc to call/cc). 
            </li>
            <li>
               support for providing arbitrary language values and services (i.e. more than just strings... unless <a href="EverythingIsa.html">EverythingIsa</a> string).  Obviously, this aspect is easier for languages with some sort of 'any' typed value or object representation.
            </li>
            <li>
               if the language provides implicit or explicit partial-evaluation optimizations, accesses to context should also be available for such optimizations (i.e. allowing access to 'context.cerr' be as runtime-efficient as access to a global 'cerr').
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>possibly</em> uniting global context with the EMIC context (so that 'cerr' can always be overridden at runtime), though this one might run into some optimization and encapsulation issues.  It may be better to, instead, encourage use of context where most singletons and such are currently used.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>explicit management</strong> (in EMIC) - includes the following abilities:
          <ul>
            <li>
               ability to get the whole context value/object (e.g. to save it for <a href="ActionChunking.html">ActionChunking</a>)
            </li>
            <li>
               ability to set the whole context value/object (e.g. to swap to a previously saved context)
            </li>
            <li>
               a not-opaque context, offering full ability to copy the context or create a new one from scratch or perform arbitrary functions over a context and its components.
            </li>
            <li>
               usefully, the ability to get/set/add/remove/access some context 'component' without excessive syntactic overhead (e.g. context.cerr.print(x) instead of ((Stream)CurrentContext().getService("cerr")).print(x)).
            </li>
            <li>
               usefully, the ability to rope contexts together without adjusting the syntax to access or manipulate them... i.e. so that one can 'push_context(); context.cerr = myCerrService(); <...>; pop_context();' and anyone accessing 'context.cerr' will receive myCerrService while anyone accessing 'context.cout' would continue to use the old one.
            </li>
            <li>
               usefully, the ability to reverse 'default' behavior with a very simple bit of syntax by supporting one of:
              <ul>
                <li>
                   explicitly execute a statement or expression in a nested 'copy of' the context (optimized as copy-on-write or a context 'rope') with threading the context after returning being the default.  Nested contexts allows programmers to track more easily exactly what is in the context they are working with on some local scope.
                </li>
                <li>
                   or explicitly execute a procedure in a threaded context such that upon returning the context the procedure returns in becomes the current context, with the default being the 'nested' context.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It should be clear that most languages you know probably don't have EMIC.  Of course I wouldn't be surprised if some of the more dynamic languages did have something like it (Lisp certainly does with its <a href="SpecialVariable.html">SpecialVariable</a>s, and Haskell monads are very close, albeit both of these are somewhat opaque and difficult to get or set in whole chunks).  I expect that EMIC, or a good approximation, could readily be implemented in Ruby and Python (if they don't already provide it via some library I've never heard about)... though it would be non-standard and some of the advantages would not apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted above, EMIC, in a language that supported it, would effectively replace <a href="ThreadLocalStorage.html">ThreadLocalStorage</a> as far more syntactically efficient (though its underlying implementation may be atop TLS), and would ideally wrap or replace <a href="EnvironmentVariable.html">EnvironmentVariable</a>s except, perhaps, at those rare places where one must interact with the <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> in order to spawn a new process (because most operating systems limit <a href="EnvironmentVariable.html">EnvironmentVariable</a>s to plain-ol-strings).  
      </p>
      <p>
        So... what does EMIC buy us?  
      </p>
      <p>
        Above and Beyond the <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Syntactic convenience</strong> (very significant).  Passing a context object all over the place is extremely painful, especially when most procedures or methods don't access the thing.  This convenience is doubled when accounting for explicit syntax for accessing and manipulating the context, and explicit syntax for threading or nesting the context.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Integration</strong> with other language features, such as communications environment.  A fully integrated EMIC could essentially integrate every 'singleton' and 'global' into the 'initial context'... which would just be a normal context, excepting that execution starts there.  A parameter object is likely to integrate well with type-safety and such, but this greater level of integration is what makes a feature really 'part of' the language.  
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Consistency</strong>, and reduced reinvention-of-the-wheel.  EMIC is defined once for the language, whereas <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a>s are reinvented once per project that needs them.  In turn, all language libraries and language frameworks will use the same EMIC system... e.g. promises and callbacks would likely include their full context.  One can also put more optimization effort on it, since the benefit will be multiplied across projects.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Better Factoring/DTSTTCPW:</strong> one just does the simple thing and uses the context when needed/useful/simple and not markedly inappropriate.  Compare to <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a>: if a need for a <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> arises, one starts by adding your <a href="MyFavoriteLanguage.html">MyFavoriteLanguage</a> equivalent of 'MyContext& cc' to every method and procedure call in the whole path between you and the component that requires it.  Or you try using TLC (painful, especially if the code is very modular and needs to be well integrated) or global variables (and just forget about flexibility, security, and modularity).
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Dynamism</strong> in a typically rigid environment (like <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>).  Essentially allows for <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a> to be implemented where demanded while allowing the vast majority of all variable accesses to remain lexically scoped (and advantage from the associated access-time optimizations).  In languages where you can add new attributes to an object at runtime, the advantage over <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> isn't so significant here.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In Common with the <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Improves <strong>modularity</strong> of procedural programs by decoupling them from the global environment.  Essentially allows support for multiple contexts within a single application.  For example, in some contexts you could set 'cout' to flush to a particular textbox on the screen, then call the same procedure later with 'cout' going to another textbox.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Deriving from the improved modularity, makes far <strong>more amenable to </strong><a href="UnitTesting.html">UnitTesting</a><strong> those procedural programs and others that would normally communicate with singletons, the operating system, or the global environment.  Essentially, one can reduce the environment to a bunch of 'dummy' services at need.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           Layer of indirection offers <strong>ability to wrap services</strong>... e.g. one could choose to trap all calls to the memory manager service in order to track who is requesting how much.  This sort of thing is performed via use of macros, but this would make it a runtime option and available to a broader spectrum of services.  Not quite <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>, though.
        </li>
        <li>
           Convenient way to control the dynamic environment in which scripts shall be executing.  This essentially provides for BOTH <strong>parameterized scripts and far more security</strong>.  
          <ul>
            <li>
               This is doubly true in a '<a href="ScriptingLanguageAgnosticSystem.html">ScriptingLanguageAgnosticSystem</a>' - one that doesn't know which scripting languages it supports, and is instead dispatching scripts to runtime-loaded modules/services based on a language token (e.g. '#javascript:command goes here') and the desired effect (execute/evaluate/subscribe-to-evaluation).  Essentially, some sort of <a href="ParameterObject.html">ParameterObject</a> is the only way to pass parameters to such arbitrary scripts (you certainly can't overwrite any strings! you don't know the format for representing values!  and a parameter object is more efficient anyway).  
            </li>
            <li>
               Use of EMIC or <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> is better than a 'typical' <a href="ParameterObject.html">ParameterObject</a> for security and completeness because it also  (a) encapsulates which services a script may access and (b) will typically be far less 'myopic' about which context values are needed for the scripts (i.e. the closer you get to the script dispatch code, the less you know about the context that got you there, and so you essentially MUST somehow pass and accumulate a <a href="ParameterObject.html">ParameterObject</a> in order to deliver the right data - back to major syntax and flexibility hassles! something like dynamic scoping... or EMIC... would help).  For security, the scripting context can be set up from a value in the context ('set context = context.scriptingContext') which can more easily be controlled across long executions.    
            </li>
            <li>
               I'm actively writing a GUI that needs this, which is why it's getting a lot of focus.  There are scripts for checkmarks/graying/hiding of menu items, more scripts for execution thereof, scripts for gauges and hovertext... all language agnostic so customers can integrate a language of their choice (and so I can upgrade the languages I use easily), all stored in a per-customer XML configuration database because we have too many customers with too many different robots and too many different payloads to hardcode the variety of configurations they want.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A very convenient home for <strong>caching and memoization and interning services</strong>, especially those one may desire to discard after some session of procedural events relative to a particular task.
        </li>
        <li>
           A very convenient home for the<strong> 'security context' in a </strong><a href="PasswordCapabilityModel.html">PasswordCapabilityModel</a><strong> - one essentially keeps a set of (lazily signed) certificates or tokens offering access to whichever security-sensitive features are required (e.g. a certificate to read any 'secret' information tagged with 'need to know: geographic', signed by anyone with geographic sigauth from the DOD).  In a language supporting partial-evaluations and proofs of security, these might not actually be checked or even represented at runtime, instead being confirmed based on a proof that they'll be correct.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           A sort of <strong>catch-all </strong><a href="ParameterObject.html">ParameterObject</a><strong> for other parameters that might be needed by the deep leaves of a procedure call.  And though some may consider it easily abused (i.e. this use shouldn't be favored).  In this role, it would ideally serve similar purpose to Environment Variables... e.g. telling you what counts as the 'current directory' or 'user_home'.  </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           Both <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> and EMIC allow one to <strong>control environment on a per-user or per-interaction basis</strong>, which is good for databases (with user-'views' and access rights), <a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a>s, <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>s, and other multi-user systems.  Things like <a href="ActionChunking.html">ActionChunking</a> could also be paired (action,context).  EMIC makes it convenient to capture the whole context and replace it, both of which abilities are useful to avoid 'leaking' context.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Does your idea of an EMIC contain any default behavior of an EMIC? I'm thinking of
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           everything that is normally accessed in a pseudo-global way like
          <ul>
            <li>
               current thread
            </li>
            <li>
               current system environment (system propertes, time, runtime engine, GC, <a href="FileSystem.html">FileSystem</a>)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Reflection
          <ul>
            <li>
               who am I (current class, method, annotations)
            </li>
            <li>
               who called me (current invocation/<a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>) recursively
            </li>
            <li>
               facility to create an exception
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>As mentioned above, EMIC should take over for most global variables, services, and singletons.  Ideally these could just be placed into the 'initial' EMIC context... (e.g. you say 'cerr' and you're actually getting 'context.cerr').  I can't say for certain that this would include ALL globals due to module-based encapsulation being what it is.  Such a conclusion would require considerably more analysis.  But the more EMIC takes over, and the less the need for supporting two distinct sorts of language contexts, the better - consistency is a good thing, as is the modularity and flexibility that comes with being able to swap out the global context.  EMIC tracking the active thread (and anything that would normally enter </em><a href="ThreadLocalStorage.html">ThreadLocalStorage</a>), the environment variables (including various system properties), time and 'java.System' (or any equivalent in any language) and memory allocators and filesystem and GC (these all being <em>"services"</em>) would all be part of this default behavior.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As far as "Reflection" - explicit access to implicit context may be useful for reflection (and its kissing cousin: debugging), but I'd have imagined it being more that a debugger could readily display context right along side the parameters to whichever function you're in (most debuggers I use fail to display relevant globals and singletons in the default watch windows).  But I can't help but think that creating or allowing logical dependence on "who called me" to be a </em><a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a> - it breaks abstraction and refactoring and a variety of optimizations and isn't useful for security (<a href="ConfusedDeputyProblem.html">ConfusedDeputyProblem</a>) and I wouldn't want the language I'm designing to encourage or provide special facility to support it (not that it's readily capable: all functions and procedures and types (which are all structural) are anonymous and are considered distinct from the names by which programmers handle them, so 'Who Am I' questions are out even before one gets recursive about it).  But it <em>can</em> be done easily enough in a language with named methods/functions and nominative types/classes (<a href="NominativeAndStructuralTyping.html">NominativeAndStructuralTyping</a>)... e.g. using aspect-oriented techniques to make the context track the complete stack and all parameters at every call (and thus taking over some of the debugger's traditional role), and I can see the value of such for embedding debugging and profiling.  I'd prefer aspect-oriented techniques because I dislike introducing <em>explicit</em> dependencies on services that won't be available in the context at the time of a release build.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As far as "facility to create an exception": creating exceptions ideally shouldn't be markedly distinct from creating other values or objects in the language. Such distinctions are problematic when it comes to integrating language features.  If the runtime 'throwing' mechanism wishes to couple exceptions with </em><a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>s at the time you 'throw' them - or after it is proven that no one will 'catch' it - that would be more acceptable to me.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>I wonder how to type this EMIC.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you mean?  Do you mean 'type' as in <a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a> and <a href="TypeSafety.html">TypeSafety</a> or 'type' as in clacking away between chair and monitor to implement EMIC in a language?  As the latter is really part of more general language implementation issues for which I have no good answers (but see <a href="TheSimplestPossibleCompiler.html">TheSimplestPossibleCompiler</a> and <a href="RethinkingCompilerDesign.html">RethinkingCompilerDesign</a>), I'm going to imagine you intend to ask about the former.  It is worth noting, however, that implementation of a very 'basic' EMIC isn't all that difficult... it is only when you start integrating it with the other features and services and taking over parts of global space (by convention - e.g. shifting 'cerr' to 'context.cerr' - if not as a requirement) that it becomes a 'complex'.  And I actually believe it simplifies many of these things.  Based on my own work so far, EMIC seems to be one of those features that looks complex but makes a bunch of other things more simple... indicating that working without EMIC is 'simplistic' (violating the <a href="EinsteinPrinciple.html">EinsteinPrinciple</a>'s second clause) and that EMIC may be a <a href="KeyLanguageFeature.html">KeyLanguageFeature</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow, for languages providing <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a> the solution to 'type' EMIC is extremely easy: dynamic <a href="DuckTyping.html">DuckTyping</a>.  Don't bother checking for ahead... just throw an exception or whatever the language normally does when you ask for an element of an object or record that does not exist or is of the wrong type.  Trust the programmer to get it mostly right and run any necessary unit-tests and such to get it working the rest of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a>, the problem might more generally be approached in much the same manner as Haskell's Monads.  You can use a great deal of <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> (<a href="ImplicitTyping.html">ImplicitTyping</a>) to determine which features will be required on the execution/evaluation paths, taking into account modifications to the context as you move along it.  You may additionally support mechanisms for manifestly annotating required context components (because 'dumb' comments are kinda pointless and if you're going to comment on required context items, you might as well make the compiler able to check for it).  One thing to note, however, is that if you're using <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> you'll need to also couple continuations and thunks more tightly with context because the programmer can't be permitted to change these out arbitrarily.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> implemented via <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a>, one requires that certain proofs over the context and its context be possible.  This goes a bit beyond <a href="TypeSafety.html">TypeSafety</a> (though it is equivalent if the system supports <a href="DependentTyping.html">DependentTyping</a> and the ability to force static <a href="TypeSafety.html">TypeSafety</a> for certain methods).  It allows code to be safely blocked unless contracts are fulfilled.  <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> implemented via dynamic (runtime) assertions is no different (and no less expensive) than it would be normally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, for <a href="SoftTyping.html">SoftTyping</a>, you combine the two mechanisms... essentially, you <em>emit errors</em> at compile-time if you can <em>prove</em> that something is missing or of the wrong type, and you <em>emit warnings</em> (as well as the code to check at runtime) if you <em>cannot prove</em> it to be safe (these warnings to be disabled with a compiler flag or pragma).  This is what you always do for <a href="SoftTyping.html">SoftTyping</a>, of course, so there is nothing new here.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as optimizations go: the context equivalent of DeadCodeElimination is obvious (no need to maintain unreferenced context) but how much you can eliminate depends on how 'modular' the code happens to be (i.e. if your application can load or create modules dynamically, the context must remain).  Additionally, you can remove duplicate efforts... e.g. if a context contains a value (not a reference to a mutable-state service, but an honest-to-math immutable value), at one point, you can often prove it will contain the same value at a later point... and thus avoid the duplicate access or duplicate calculation.  Also, <a href="PartialEvaluation.html">PartialEvaluation</a> can occur wherever you can prove a context will contain a certain value or reference at a given point in the code, which can then be used to compile the code specifically to its context.  As with EMIC for <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a>, it helps a lot if continuations and thunks are tightly coupled to the context.  If <em>only</em> the continuation can change its own context then you can ensure it won't suddenly become unsafe or invalidate the optimizations... and you can easily parameterize the continuations should you require a <a href="TypeSafe.html">TypeSafe</a> way to replace all or part of the context.
      </p>
      <p>
        For both <a href="PartialEvaluation.html">PartialEvaluation</a> optimizations and <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> it is likely useful that there be a <a href="TypeSafe.html">TypeSafe</a> mechanism for checking whether or not a record or object contains a particular entry prior to accessing it.  For example, code might "context.cerr.print(x) if (context.cerr exists)".  Not only would this represent a more flexible path-dependent model for <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> in general (allowing a <a href="TypeSafe.html">TypeSafe</a> <a href="FeatureBuffetModel.html">FeatureBuffetModel</a> of process operations); it would also allow (given <a href="PartialEvaluation.html">PartialEvaluation</a>) the implicit context to take even more over the role of preprocessor-based conditional compilation (essentially equivalent to '#ifdef') based simply on the initial context components provided by 'main'.

        <em>I indeed meant the former. :-) I would have elaborated, but I was interrupted just when typing the question.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How to do </em><a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a> is indeed obvious. I was more concerned with <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a>. The only clean way I see is indeed with Monads (there may be other ways though). For 'normal' languages this is not an option I fear, but maybe I'm wrong.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Other less controlled ways to do it would be to declare that certain parts of the program use certain EMICs. For methods this is like a parameter type only without the parameter itself because it is 'passed' automatically. This is only a small improvement over the explicit 'context parameter pattern'.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Other scopes where the declaration is placed could be class or module scope. This saves more effort - the context is inherited my all methods/classes respectively - but is less specific of course.</em>

        <strong>Security Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A powerful, largely offline <a href="SecurityModel.html">SecurityModel</a> based on modified <a href="SimplePublicKeyInfrastructure.html">SimplePublicKeyInfrastructure</a> (SPKI, a <a href="PasswordCapabilityModel.html">PasswordCapabilityModel</a>) can readily be embedded into EMIC as a <strong>Security Context</strong> (in a <a href="TypeSafe.html">TypeSafe</a>, optimizable way... esp. with <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        In essence, one checks that the necessary combination of signed certificates (values saying you have certain rights) are available in the context (e.g. located in a collection under context.security).  One checks that these are either signed directly by the right people (with <em>fixpoint</em> "right people" = (a) a particular public key, (b) a URI or reference to a service to find such a key (ideally cacheable), or (c) the public key of someone who has provable signature-authority from the "right people").  With the optimizations above, you can ensure that most security checks pass without actually performing them at runtime (e.g. a process that creates a memory cell starts with access rights to it, so no need to check at runtime).  <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a> can force checks into a <a href="GateKeeper.html">GateKeeper</a> so processing doesn't even start before all security is proven, but this doesn't prevent the <a href="GateKeeper.html">GateKeeper</a> itself from proving such checks statically.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make it work in an environment where eavesdropping is presumed possible - and thus capabilities can be stolen but not forged - can be done by having these values specify 'extents' such as expiration dates, a statement that the value is only valid so long as one is involved in a particular (reversible) transaction, or only so long as some other capability is granted (dependent capability), or only so long as communications on a certain port aren't cut, or only so long as a request to XYZ says its valid (which might come back with a response cacheable for so many seconds... e.g. 'yeah, you can use that certificate for the next 30 seconds).  Etc.  These limitations in extent are honored by the code checking for the certificates (if you can compromise the security checking code accessed by the primary services you must already have full control of the system).
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to limit forwarding of signature authority (sigauth) also offers all the normal features of AccessList based security.  This is considered one 'extent' but feeds back into the "right people" calculation, and thereby allows you to limit 'who' can <em>directly</em> access a service.  Proponents of the <a href="CapabilitySecurityModel.html">CapabilitySecurityModel</a> think it a good thing it doesn't attempt to prevent the impossible (i.e. you can act 'directly' on someone else's behalf), but I believe it good to be able to provide 'buck stops here' support when it comes to dealing with <em>responsibility</em> for actions (i.e. AccessList provides 'responsibility', and <a href="CapabilitySecurityModel.html">CapabilitySecurityModel</a> provides 'capability').  I also figured there wasn't a reason to fight myself over <a href="CapabilitySecurityModel.html">CapabilitySecurityModel</a> vs. AccessList model when there is an easy way to obtain both.

        I'm wondering about the relation of <a href="ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext.html">ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext</a> and <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a>. 
        It seems that EMIC depends on and build on or simply generalizes <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a>.
        One key point again seems to be typing. <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a> is mostly found in dynamic of weakly typed languages. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The primary differences are that (a) EMIC allows one to capture, save, and change the entire set of 'dynamic' variables at once, whereas with </em><a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a> it would need to be done one variable at a time, (b) when dealing with threads, thunks/promises, and lazy evaluations, those would be designed to execute in the context in which they were created rather than the context in which they were needed except where <em>explicitly</em> changed; <a href="SpecialVariable.html">SpecialVariable</a>s in Lisp don't work in that manner and it has been a cause of problems that results in unusual 'gotchas' for promise-passing systems. (c) EMIC can work with true, asynchronous <a href="MessagePassing.html">MessagePassing</a> languages - and when doing so acts a bit like a cross between cookies and environment variables - whereas <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a> is limited to the current call-stack. This latter item leads to some very interesting programming patterns, especially in a distributed programming language; e.g. the context can have a reference back to the caller's console, which can then receive distributed reports and prompts.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong><em>Typing</em>' is far less an issue; most of the relevant benefits of EMIC can be realized without typing. I'd go for strong typing because I like strong typing for other reasons (including security and safety guarantees, each of which allow optimizations), but by own implementation of EMIC sacrifices <em>static</em> typing at the point of interaction with the context; that is, there can be type failures when working with the context at runtime; said failures will be well defined (exception/use-alternate) and occur at very well-defined points of interaction with the context (i.e. fail fast, loudly, and all at once or fail not at all; partial failure is the main hobgoblin that needs killing). That said, my target environment is distributed-authority with continuous services; there isn't any way for a typechecker to peek inside services that are already running. I'm studying a document titled 'Typing Dynamic Typing' (</strong><a href="http://people.cs.uu.nl/arthurb/data/Dynamic/p189-baars.pdf)">http://people.cs.uu.nl/arthurb/data/Dynamic/p189-baars.pdf)</a> and some follow up work that obtains safe, static typing in Haskell even for message passing between processes.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        EMIC with dynamic scoping would essentially look like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        print(point) { stream << point.x << "," << point.y; }<br/>
        print(a, b) { print a; print b; }<br/>
        [...]<br/>
        {<br/>
        stream = environment.stdout;<br/>
        print new Point(3,4), new Point(4,5);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        How can this be typed? A fully type version might look like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        @requires(Stream stream)<br/>
        void print(Point point) { stream << point.x << "," << point.y; }<br/>
        @requires(Stream stream)<br/>
        void print(Point a, Point b) { print a; print b; }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (here using some kind of annotation to add the type of the implicitly used stream). 
        Note that the stream type must be declared for each method it passes thru. 
        This exactly what we want to avoid: Chaining the context thru all intermediates <em>where this gains nothing</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type inference could infer and check these types (just infer treat all free variables as extra parameters; recursively) - but only if all outermost callers are available for checking.
        This breaks modularity and separate compilation. 
        But we could enforce the rule that modules must make there EMIC requirements explicit (i.e. no free variables leaving ModuleScope).
      </p>
      <p>
        -- .gz
      </p>
      <p>
        PS. Additional note: The introduction of variables in dynamic scope should happen in a structure way i.e. such that the 'scope' of the uses is clear and in particular clearly different syntactically from 'normal' variables. I think something like
      </p>
      <code>
        {<br/>
        with(stream = environment.stdout)<br/>
        print new Point(3,4), new Point(4,5);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Type inference is the way to go here when the aim is to verify safety within a collectively compiled process. Manifest typing of Java exceptions was a huge mistake, and manifest typing of EMIC would destroy its utility.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There does not need to be a violation of "modularity and separate compilation"; in the context of such, one leaves some of the type-checking to the linker - something that needs to occur anyway when working with open functions and open datatypes, so if you already have similar cross-module features this isn't a loss at all. That said, we can (and, I say, </em>'should<em>') also trade separate compilation as it is currently performed for other approaches to composition, efficient builds, and obfuscation that are more amenable to whole-program optimizations, EMIC, open datatypes and open functions, other features that cross module boundaries, and checks. It doesn't take much thinking to do much better.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm still thinking about how I favor introduction of variables to a context, but I would note that in a real system with EMIC and Java/C/C++-style process model, 'environment' itself would simply be the context passed to </em>'main()<em>'. That is, it is unlikely to exist as a global value. As such, there is no need for "stdout", since nothing out "out" needs to be "standard". With that, one could do something like this for the structured approach (changing the context for a limited region)</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        using(environment with out = <my Stream>, x=A, y=B)<br/>
        print new Point(3,4), new Point(4,5)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Alternatively, changes to the environment could simply last until end-of-block. While one could save and restore the environment, most of the time one would simply structure code so one doesn't need to do so:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        savedEnv = environment;                                          <br/>
        environment = environment with out=<my Stream>, x=A, y=B<br/>
        print new Point(3,4), new Point(4,5)<br/>
        ...<br/>
        environment = savedEnv<br/>
        vs.<br/>
        {<br/>
        environment = environment with out=<my Stream>, x=A, y=B<br/>
        print new Point(3,4), new Point(4,5)<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Procedures whose main task is to set up the environment would need to 'return environment' or 'return (value,environment)' more explicitly.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Admittedly, I think I'd prefer to use a word 'context' (which nicely pairs with 'content' when discussing messages) to the 10-character 'environment', and possibly treat access to it it as a primitive procedure rather than a primitive-supported variable. Syntactic details like that aren't on my immediate schedule for resolving.</em>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Being demand-driven, such that publishers don't waste their processors, batteries, and bandwidth pushing events when there are no listeners.
        </li>
        <li>
           Being compositional, such that 'abstract' dataflows can be hooked together to form complete dataflows, <strong>orthogonal</strong> to demand (no need to introduce demand just to compose dataflows! I.e. shouldn't ever need to subscribe-then-push.)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Secure</em> composition - ability to hook publishers to subscribers through a network of trusted intermediaries, without either ever knowing the source of the other, and with the downstream processing and upstream processing being totally opaque to the trusted intermediaries (intermediaries could potentially see data, but not the source). And all this is to <em>still</em> be orthogonal to demand (i.e. the intermediaries can perform composition without introducing a demand on the publisher).
        </li>
        <li>
           Handling disruption (crash, network partition, destructors); in particular:
          <ul>
            <li>
               If a publisher is disrupted, ability for subscribers to immediately 'fall back' on other (likely lower-quality or performance) sources for the same data.
            </li>
            <li>
               If a subscriber is disrupted, ability for publisher to soon stop pushing messages to that subscriber
            </li>
            <li>
               Resilience: ability to re-establish and recover connections when no longer disrupted.
            </li>
            <li>
               If a publisher or subscriber is destroyed forever, global <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> of resources (and moving to appropriate fallbacks)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Initial subscription and application start-up issues - picking up 'recent events', ensuring 'whole' events (i.e. if events may consist of many messages).
        </li>
        <li>
           Sharing, such that N subscribers can be serviced by a single publisher in a manner that potentially consumes as little as O(log(N)) processing and bandwidth resources due to sharing as much of the processing as possible between subscribers. (And, of course, achieving this without sacrificing any of the above properties!)

               for <a href="FeatureBuffetModel.html">FeatureBuffetModel</a> layering (e.g. on a map you have many layers for terrain, regions, directions and routes, events, interest-areas, weather) that requires extra data be pushed to you.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        EMIC helps with the demand-side properties <em>in the presence of</em> secure composition (i.e. where a <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a> intermediary is acting primarily as a switching-network that composes dataflows) <em>without sacrificing</em> demand-driven publish or effective disruption handling. For <em>sharing</em> of dataflows, EMIC both hurts and helps - a property I'll discuss below. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Integrating EMIC with a dataflow is surprisingly simple:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>concrete dataflow (definition):</strong> A 'concrete' dataflow is a (context,dataflow) pair. The context is from subscriber-side, whereas the dataflow represents a publishing source (and is often opaque to the subscriber). Essentially, before any data is flowing, there is always a concrete dataflow.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>context multiplexing of dataflows:</strong> {cxmux context->dataflow} is a dataflow. Concrete dataflow (cx,{cxmux fn}) evaluates as {cx,{fn cx}}. Since the 'cx' is defined by the subscriber, and the dataflow is defined by the publisher (and may be indirected), this allows a sort of 'automatic negotiation' between publisher and subscriber at an undefined point in between. It's capable of composing (not <em>just</em> multiplexing) existing dataflows in rather flexible manner. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>context-modify within dataflow:</strong> {cxmod context->context dataflow} is a dataflow. This allows override and 'interpretation' of the subscriber's context by the publisher of the dataflow before the context reaches other parts of the dataflow. Since EMIC has only "by-convention" standards, cxmod is very useful for wrapping and re-defining dataflows in a non-homogeneous environment, and can be performed transparently by trusted intermediaries to standardize context conventions at the service-interface layer. Concrete dataflow (cx,{cxmod fn df}) evaluates as ({fn cx},df). 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, and rather trivially, you may want some way to manipulate the context of the "return" messages. This might be done similar to transform functions and filter-functions, but it might not make much sense to keep the context of the original source; I'd suggest simply making the reply-context part of the hook (subscription).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm assuming a panoply of 'dataflow primitives' (such as dataflows from state, 'fallback' dataflows, a 'failure' dataflow, an 'indirection' dataflow (i.e. redirect: takes a dataflow-of-dataflow-of-X and returns a dataflow-of-X, a 'functional-transform' dataflow, various 'combinator' dataflows (which take state from other dataflows), as well as whatever 'initial dataflows' might be introduced or published by the application layer). Also, the cxmod and cxmux apply just as effectively to event-flows (the main difference between an event-flow and a dataflow is that you can always ask for the 'current state' of a dataflow, and you can get from ).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow, I said earlier that EMIC both helps and hurts sharing. Well, there is a complexity to that. Basically, using EMIC means that (cx,df) can share share 'df' among many users. Where this really helps sharing is <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a>, as it means that subscribers do not need to 'specialize' an 'abstract df' based on mutable demands. Since the <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a> domains become less specialized, dataflow 'splits' due to switching can be avoided. This, in turn, helps sharing. It's an incredibly indirect, emergent effect, but amounts to: 'cxmux' reduces necessity for higher-layer mux, and thus keeps more of the 'dataflow' defined in the lower layers where the language and runtimes can make more assumptions and perform more optimizations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And at the outer edges of the system, context can may also be used to decide <strong>policy</strong> (aka demand-driven policy). E.g. assume there are dozens of dataflows indicating the current 'image' of a webcamera, but the webcamera can only hande certain modes (e.g. cannot be in both IR mode and visible-light mode, and cannot be in both low-band mode and high-band mode). One could control such modes via stateful commands but, just as one could control whether the camera is on or off by explicit state, it is often more <em>convenient</em> and <em>robust</em> (to changing needs) to allow such features to be demand-driven. One could use a priority or voting-scheme to decide bandwidth and IR in the absence of a directive from a control node. And, in the absence of connections, the webcam can power down. (Usefully, one could also use SPKI certificates as described in Security Context to ensure secure policy-fields like 'priority' to work in a system with different levels of true authority.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, if 'polling' is used at the edges of the system to keep data up-to-date, the demand-driven policy can easily be used to set the polling rate (i.e. if nobody needs updates faster than once a second, just poll at once a second). One of the advantages of <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a> is to push the evils of 'polling' to the very edge of the system where it will consume the fewest bandwidth and CPU resources. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I might end up not using EMIC for the context, but I suspect the primary result of so doing would be to require a more explicit context. Upon reviewing primitives, there are a lot of places context would be useful, and the above access to context is quite limited. It might be worthwhile to still support the implicit context but to ensure simple access to it in 'select' and 'switch' statements rather than adding new primitives like cxmux and cxmod.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to forward context, there is also some value in manipulating and supporting a couple more implicit contexts
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the 'reply' context for event-flows (i.e. the context coming with each 'event' message would usually be determined by the initial event, but manipulating the context a bit might be useful). Not as necessary given use of transform on the message, though, so this one could be left to the receiving actors (message-context would then remain untouched across an event-flow).
        </li>
        <li>
           a 'status' context for event-flows (and for dataflows, if I can find an elegant way to add it)... to help report information about the source of data, especially across failovers. I could simply allow that, for each Ef or Df, {status Ef} and {status Df} are paired dataflows paired with the original. One might use {status {status Df}}, but one eventually hits constants. Only real problems with this design: (a) race-conditions between status updates to a dataflow or event-flow would not be uniformly coupled to the failover, (b) doesn't reflect actual state of any given 'hook'.

        Recent work on the ConfigurationProblem has produced another solution for <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>. See <em>Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations</em> by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-chieh Shan. <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf">http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf</a> (<a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> TypeClass)

        This uses typeclasses to introduce configuration-parameters, and manages many of the above critical features, especially regarding the ability to maintain multiple configurations at once, not mix them up, manipulate configuration contexts at runtime, etc.

        <em>Very nice solution. Works basically like the C++ template magic^H^H^H^Heta programming (see e.g. </em><a href="TemplateMetaprogrammingTechniques.html">TemplateMetaprogrammingTechniques</a>). The obvious disadvantages of this kind of techniques are<em></em>

        If it's a choice between me and the compiler, I'd rather burden the compiler. In any case, <a href="TemplateMetaprogramming.html">TemplateMetaprogramming</a> with concepts (which were recently redacted from C++0x (now C++1x) for lack of confidence that all the kinks were worked out) would have supported much better compiler errors. I suspect Haskell can do reasonably well with its typeclasses.

        <em>What I am wondering is: Can a separate 'type language' be avoided? I mean all this type/meta/macro programming usually happens in a separate language mostly for historical reasons: The associated language evolved out of more primitive structure of the 'host' language.</em>
        <em>Types were initially only keywords. But now types are as complex as the expressions they type.</em>
        <em>Macros were initially only simple replacement expressions. Now they have binders and scopes and libraries of their own.</em>
        <em>Same for templates.</em>
        <em>Why do I have to learn another language when large parts - at least structureal part - are the same for both?</em>
        <em>Could'nt these DSLs be the same - albeit with restricted domain/expressivity/types?</em>
        <em>For example to make the type-language sub-set computable we could restrict the loop expressions and types of its expressions. It is a kind of boot-strapping.</em>
        <em>We'd only need a means to connect the host language with this DSL. And that's where I'm not clear.</em>

        That question is off-topic with regards to EMIC, but the answer is: yes, easily. Indeed, in more dynamic languages (like <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>), types themselves are often plain-old-objects. See <a href="FirstClassTypes.html">FirstClassTypes</a>.

        Based on your earlier inquiry, though, I suspect you are more interested in the <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> side of things. Attempting to achieve this statically, even given sufficient support for <a href="PartialEvaluation.html">PartialEvaluation</a> or staged evaluation (like <a href="CompileTimeResolution.html">CompileTimeResolution</a> or <a href="ThirdFutamuraProjection.html">ThirdFutamuraProjection</a>), gives rise to <em>issues of regression</em>: one is using language expressions to describe type of language expressions. You need a base case. One could break the regression by falling back on <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a> at some point, especially for a <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>-free (and ideally terminating) language subset used at compile-time (that is, one may take advantage that a <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a>-error at <a href="CompileTime.html">CompileTime</a> may be elevated to a <a href="CompileTime.html">CompileTime</a> error, and it ain't a serious problem in the absence of <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s, especially if one can guarantee termination). One could also use third-party analysis to help validate the expressions describing types.

        The Implicits or ImplicitParameters of <a href="ScalaLanguage.html">ScalaLanguage</a> provide something comparable to an EMIC. They as powerful as TypeClasses (as explained in the article below, see <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> TypeClass above) and could be the base of an implementation of EMIC.
