        <em>Jim's stated the whole list somewhere else in Wiki. I know that two are </em><a href="GriefObserved.html">GriefObserved</a> and <a href="TheLittlePrince.html">TheLittlePrince</a>.<em></em>

        See <a href="GreatBooksAboutSoftware.html">GreatBooksAboutSoftware</a> for a list that might be the one mentioned. Or perhaps <a href="GreatSoftwareBooks.html">GreatSoftwareBooks</a>?

        It's not there. I did a couple of searches and could not find the list in wiki anywhere.

        Hi Jim!
        During your stay in Brazil for <a href="SugarLoafPlop.html">SugarLoafPlop</a>, you gave a talk where you defend the idea the software should be written as many authors would write a collaborative book. I argued that most collaborative writings <em>suck</em>. I believe that Wiki community would like to read about your ideas on it. -- <a href="GeraldoXexeo.html">GeraldoXexeo</a>
