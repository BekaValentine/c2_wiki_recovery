      <p>
        If you found "<a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a>?" on your page, it is an indication that somebody has noticed a lack of activity and is trying to determine whether you are an active wiki user. If so, just remove the <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> tag from your page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you hear me, Major Tom...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the tag remains on your page for a long time, then it will be assumed that the page has been abandoned and it will be deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a protocol for deleting seemingly abandoned home pages on Wiki.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Upon noticing an <a href="AbandonedHomePage.html">AbandonedHomePage</a>, place <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> at the top of the page, followed by the current date, followed by the last edit date. E.g. <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a>? - April 30, 2002; March 20, 1999. Both dates are mandatory, since the first one dates the tag, while the second ones shows the reason for it. It is considered GoodPractice to check for the number of <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s and make a comment about that as well.
        </li>
        <li>
           This page (<a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a>) contains a polite explanation at the top similar to that found on <a href="DeletedButWelcomeToWiki.html">DeletedButWelcomeToWiki</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           If the owner of the home page chooses, they have a fairly long time frame (e.g. one year) to remove the question and reaffirm their participation in our community. Simply removing the <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> will do - they don't have to respond.
        </li>
        <li>
           If the owner does not respond after the specified duration, we will assume that the page is authentically abandoned. At this point, we will replace the entire content of the page with 'delete <a href="AbandonedHomePage.html">AbandonedHomePage</a>'.
        </li>
        <li>
           A seconder can then make a minor edit (see <a href="DeletionConventions.html">DeletionConventions</a>) to complete the deletion.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This page will also serve as a <a href="ReverseIndex.html">ReverseIndex</a> for potentially abandoned pages, making periodic pruning easier.
      </p>

        <em>I agree that a home page that says no more than "gee this really works" isn't really a home page and is a candidate for deletion. However, if there is even just enough information to consider saving it here, then I would suggest leaving the page in place. -- </em><a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A page has "enough information to consider saving" if it has any of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           an e-mail address
        </li>
        <li>
           a URL to a personal web site (a <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> does not qualify)
        </li>
        <li>
           backlinks (not including change-log pages)
        </li>
        <li>
           significant content that would be of interest to others
        </li>
        <li>
           edits within the past twelve months
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a page has none of these things, then it is probably safe to delete it immediately. If any of these things are true, but you think the page warrants deletion, then add the <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, during the annual <a href="WikiSpringCleaning.html">WikiSpringCleaning</a>, we can search for these pages and delete any that haven't been edited in over a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who has signed more than a couple of pages (as referenced by <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s) should remain.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an e-mail address is provided, consider contacting the person to determine whether the address is valid and whether the person wants the page to remain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is worth observing that the "</em><a href="AbandonedHomePage.html">AbandonedHomePage</a>" marker is not of itself a call for deletion. It is what it says, a marker that the page, a <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>, appears to have been abandoned. That mark is related to, but not the same as, a call for deletion.<em></em>

        I'm glad Ward's put down these guidelines, because they jive closely with what I want... I don't mind the presence of old home pages at all. Hey, they're only a k or two each, right? It can be interesting to peruse them, to see what sorts of people have visited wiki... The tiny ones with only a couple sentences and no real information are the only ones I'd consider removing. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>

        <em>Is homepage deletion of orphaned pages a move of exclusion, or is it simply a matter of keeping Wiki pages relevant? There are many valued users who post anonymously here. But why have a homepage if nothing here points to it? How is such a page useful?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe the author has a web presence other than <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> and uses that presence to point to his/her homepage here. In this case, the homepage is useful because it draws new people to the wiki without confusing them by linking to a non-existent page. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If it did then it would probably have enough content (such as an intro to Wiki) that it wouldn't qualify for deletion. Referring people to a basically blank page isn't going to bring many people to Wiki.</em>

        Remarks from an interested bystander:
      </p>
      <p>
        All pages are in the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>, even though the participants may have moved on, or else you have a NowWiki where only current participants and current pages count. While this may reflect current thinking, and current philosophy anchored in the importance of ego and self-interest. Those who view the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a> as a representation instead of a time, would disagree. The wiki Is not a mailing list, is not a dictionary, is not an encyclopedia, it is not a restructured email system, it is not a forum, it is an informal history of computing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of this badge reflects a disinterest in the historical aspects:
      </p>
      <code>
        That a person has visited this wiki,<br/>
        That they have taken the time to record something of and from themselves<br/>
        That they think others may someday read what they have penned<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The use of this badge implies that the one who uses it thinks of the Wiki as a two-way radio and that if someone does not respond on the channel, the message previously transmitted can be removed from history. It it is one year, two years, or some arbitrarily determined length of time and the person is no longer of a mind to respond, and no-one will defend his contribution, and one other person might agree, the deletion will probably be sustained. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not seem that concurrency should be a test for the existence and continuance of a page. I am sure there are those who may be of the same mind. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There is another requirement that you are forgetting. </em><a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> tags are left on homepages only if the page has no meaningful backlinks. Nobody is suggesting that all wikizens need to constantly update their homepages or face deletion. What some of us are suggesting is that if somebody passed through a long time ago, made one homepage for themselves, and didn't write anything anywhere else, perhaps that homepage isn't so relevant to this Wiki.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Relevant in whose opinion? I do not think with regard to homepages that the two persons necessary to delete a page can set themselves up as adjudicators on a homepage's continuance. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As I said before, a home page is a record
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That a person has visited this wiki,
        </li>
        <li>
           That they have taken the time to record something of and from themselves, and
        </li>
        <li>
           That they think others may someday read what they have penned
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A homepage is relevant for historical purposes whether presently relevant or not!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This has been discussed elsewhere at length, but Wiki and history make for strange bedfellows. Many editors and refactorers routinely delete and rearrange the words of others, sweeping history into the dustbin in the hopes of making the pages more useful and direct in the present.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        This should not be the custom for a person's homepage, the words penned there should be left for editing by the Named Individual. One may leave comments, or notes, but sweeping its contents into the dustbin should be a left to the page owner. -- views drawn to <a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a> attention by 213.42.2.25 last edit

      </p>

        One might perceive power in the ability to remove entirely a page, and in prioritizing according to self-perceived judgments, but this in no way can be interpreted as giving Wiki "power".

        I came to this page from a homepage that had an <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> tag on it ... apparently, the previous edit was in 2000, and the tag was placed June 2002 (call that 6 months ago). But I had gone to that homepage from a very interesting comment its owner had written; the homepage added context to the comment. The homepage by itself, well, it's like someone had signed the guest book. But the homepage as context for the creator's comments, that's something more. So, really, dead as it is, it serves a purpose, i.e. a homepage <em>however stale</em> adds a level of information. -- <a href="BenTremblay.html">BenTremblay</a> 25DEC02

        I found an <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> on <a href="JohnBrant.html">JohnBrant</a>'s page. I was quite disturbed by that, having been a proponent of <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a>. I guess I still am, but why would anyone even consider removing that page? It has content and plenty of back links. Thankfully, <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> is less destructive than a 'delete', so I guess it served its purpose, but still... be responsible people.

      <p>
        A solution to the history aspect might be to refactor the content of a <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> that is about to be deleted (by the rules of <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> set out above). Possibly shortening and moving them to, e.g., HomePageHistory. This serves the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a> better but still allows the original owner to recover and for interested parties to review.

        Another arguably lame Wiki convention which has little value. I can understand the temptation to clear dead wood from the archives, but a page of text and links is hardly going to save you much disk space. Furthermore, it requires the user checks their page from time to time to clear a <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> comment. Time might well be better spent elsewhere.

        I suggest we list the names of people on this page, instead of modifying the page concerned directly.

If someone rarely visits wiki, they will most likely check their homepage on those rare visits, but I would have thought them most unlikely to visit this page.

               yes the idea is not very good, but bit better than going thru to tag very old homepages. I think we can get the community to get accustomed to watching the <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> list instead, for homepages 5 years or older. There is always the way back machine for restore if an error is made.

           I am generally against touching homepages for purposes of tagging. There is more than "last edited" date as sometimes quickDiff shows useful information to another person (unwanted by the person doing the edit, but has some info may be of interest). How about this, I have added more names to this page from last change 6 years ago people, if you guys decide to put a AreYouThere tag it is fine. To me a homepage that has not been updated for many years, has few backlinks, also has little value to even the owner.

        Deletion Hint:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All who frequent this wiki are not writers and or editors. Some find valuable stuff for reading. If they have made a home page when or near the time they first visited this wiki, this is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>. There is no device which indicates who is reading the wiki. Until and when such a device comes into being and indicates no reading activity, only then should anyone delete it but the person named as having the home page.
        </li>
        <li>
           also: if there is an email link on the page, those concerned can easily express their sadness of no activity in the writing and or editing of the wiki with a short message encouraging such activity.
