        Default Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        Someone just recently created a page where he asked what to do it no design patter applies. Waht is the <a href="DefaultPattern.html">DefaultPattern</a>? I cannot find it, maybe it has been deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        His idea was to just create one class for each use case, one method for each action and so on. 
        This may result in an badly factored code, but once code is there, we know how to progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the next step may be to be <a href="UsingGoodNamingToDetectBadCode.html">UsingGoodNamingToDetectBadCode</a> and progress from there on.
