        I'm an imposter really.

        My greatest strength is that I'm not very good at programming so value simplicity over all other virtues.

        Once upon a time I used to be able to make web apps, but all I needed to know back then was html. And cgi if I wanted to be fancy. Now I need to know html, xml, ajax, jquery, sql, nosql, rails, ruby, python, django, and every new technology layers on top of the existing ones.
