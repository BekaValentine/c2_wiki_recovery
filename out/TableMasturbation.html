        Table Masturbation
      </h1>
      <p>
        Table Masturbation occurs when a human continually visualizes tables in his mind, while spewing out comments about how everything should be put into a table.  All arrays in programs, all lists, and all structs/records and objects should be tables. Strings and buffers are wrong. They are tables. Pointers to chars are much better as tables. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For the sake of masturbating about the table (visualizing her in our mind) we will see <strong>everything</strong> as a table - even if it is not practical for everything to be a table (especially on C2 wiki where we have the chance to masturbate the table thoughts out aloud). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the following program:
      </p>
      <code>
        var s: string;<br/>
        b<br/>
        s = 'hello';      <em>// bad.. should be a database insert</em> <br/>
        s = s + ' world'; <em>// bad.. concatenation is just reinventing inserts</em><br/>
        outln(s);<br/>
        e.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Someone skilled in <a href="TableMasturbation.html">TableMasturbation</a> will immediately see a problem with the above program. The problem is that the string "hello world" should actually be in a table. Each character or the entire string should be indexed with a primary key in a table. According to one skilled in <a href="TableMasturbation.html">TableMasturbation</a>, the "hello world" string cannot be placed into that program and one is just reinventing the table and database with such a program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider also
      </p>
      <code>
        var s: array [1..100] of string;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The above array should be placed into a table immediately, even if it doesn't need to be in a table - because we prefer <a href="TableMasturbation.html">TableMasturbation</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is a valid need for a table, then it is no longer masturbation - but rather practical use of a table.  Ideally, one should use a <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>, and think about the relations rather than masturbating about <em>tables</em>.

      <code>
        This example (unecessarily and inefficiently) creates a relation variable<br/>

        <em>Dave,  thank you for the "DO" loop idea in Rel. Do is shorter, and more concise than "FOR" in you first loop. I may consider this loop style for Qomp. Although you could have just used FOR instead of DO for the notation/syntax in the first loop, I suppose.</em>

        I believe this topic is in retaliation. Tables don't qualify if one uses them because they fit the way one thinks. They are not an experiment for the sake of experiment, but a "user interface" from the developer's perspective. Thus, claiming thinking in tables is <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> would be like claiming that GUI's are "interface masturbation" because users better relate to them than CUI's. Thus, its it's not equivalent. --top

        <li>
           The same argument could be made for an array. Arrays don't qualify if one uses them because they fit the way one thinks. However, this is not the reason I use arrays. I pick the appropriate data structure for the problem. I don't go based on  "gut instincts" or "hunches" or "the way I thought for 24 years". Rather, I try to learn and pick the right algorithm and data structure for the situation. If a relation is suited to the task and if the relational DB is very accessible, then I use it. If I just need a list of integers without it needing to be associative, then I use an array. I don't bend every thing intoa  table just for the sake of bending it into a table, nor do I bend everything into an 1D or 2D array just for the sake of bending it into an array.

           <em>Further, being a table and being an "array" is not necessarily mutually-exclusive. One could be merely a view of the other. An array can be viewed as a table with certain constraints put upon it, for example. Ideally, our tools would allow us to incrementally morph one into the other (or act as the other) as needs change. If performance is a key, then ideally a smart compiler/interpreter would select the best fitting physical implementation similar to how some RDBMS can select the optimum (or pretty good) execution path based on query analysis. -t</em>

        <em>Again, if I remember correctly, you didn't accept fitting the way one thinks as a good enough reason to drop the label.  In addition, I recall your attitude when you were shown an example of a significant improvement.  Your response indicated that it was still MM because the example wasn't from your limited domain.  Thus, it is representative of one way you use it.</em>

           <a href="TableMasturbation.html">TableMasturbation</a> is a serious problem and a serious <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>. There are cases, when one needs to use an integer or an array - and not a table. TableMasturbators have a serious problem that needs to be patterned on this wiki - despite your claims that this is purely a retaliation. It is in part a humorous semi retaliation - but also a serious effort to categorize a pattern. I see people commonly picking the wrong algorithm. Everything should be a table, everything is fine as an associative array.  Use what the language gives you, don't define any types.  Etc. Etc. The pattern is people are continually masturbating about their pet (in this case tables) instead of picking the correct data structure and algorithm for the situation at hand. A table has its uses, and an array does too. One should not bend and force everything into a table, or an array, or a hash list. One should pick the correct tool for the job. Type systems help one create these tools. Continually visualizing and masturbating only about tables can lead to <a href="BrainDamage.html">BrainDamage</a> and CodeStains.

What if machine performance is not the bottleneck for a particular application or need? Generally I'll pick the tool that best fits my mind before picking one that best fits the machine, unless of course the machine becomes a limiting factor. Otherwise, let the machine slave away instead of humans slave away. If you have an objective and tested Universal Formula for determining "right tool" or "right data-structure", I'd like to inspect it.

        Or "naive script kiddie", "brain damage", "lazy", etc.  At least I don't create new topics to complain about each and every new occurrence. Your reaction is much stronger than mine. You escalate rather than return in equivalence. Your "e-sin" is greater. (My only recent topic rename, "brain damage" to something like "languages that teach bad habits", was in no way intended to retaliate or offend. I merely made it less offensive and more self-describing.)

      <ul>
        <li>
           You're very quick to rename pages like <a href="BrainDamage.html">BrainDamage</a> (which is a common pattern formed by Dijkstra), yet you commonly use inflammatory pages in your writings such as <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> - while calling languages "anal languages".
