        Brokat Doesnt Do Xp
      </h1>
      <p>
        [This is a reaction to <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-j1xp.html">http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-j1xp.html</a> ]
      </p>
      <p>
        So this guy from Brokat claims they do XP, with some "modifications"
        -- in particular:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           they do <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           they don't have a Metaphor
        </li>
        <li>
           they don't use User Stories
        </li>
        <li>
           the manager <em>assigns</em> the pairs for <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           they don't even <em>use</em> <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> during the coding and production phase, and (oh, yeah):
        </li>
        <li>
           they <em>have</em> a coding and production phase.
        </li>
      </ul>

        tell the peasants how to vote, and then they vote that way."

      <p>
        All Brokat is doing is adopting some of the proven practices that
        XP advocates.  Given that they throw out or mangle about half of
        XP's core practices, it's ludicrous to say they're doing XP.

        I'm reminded of a popular theological term: "cafeteria Catholics".

        <em>I would say that their definition of Xp is one with which I was entirely unacquainted.</em>

        They don't in my opinion do <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a>.  It isn't just the code that is collectively owned it is also the design which at Brokat is handed down from on high. Given that I doubt that they really do refactoring as a design technique either. --<a href="DonWells.html">DonWells</a>
