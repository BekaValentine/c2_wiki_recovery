        Use Net Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        What do you get when you cross Wiki and <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        If this were a joke, the answer would be "<a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>!"
      </p>
      <p>
        But think about it a little: <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> is a massively-replicated
        database of mostly ascii text.  There's a little bit of structure
        (e.g. subject and date headers, threading info, newsgroups)
        and a lot of flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could use it as the storage mechanism for a Wiki:
        ExamplePage would be stored by posting a message to <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>
        with "ExamplePage" as its subject, and the Wiki-formatted
        text as its body.  When someone edits the page, the entire
        new version of the text is posted as a message with the same
        subject ("ExamplePage").  There's really no point trying to
        conserve storage space: it's all a drop in the <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        A front end to this Wiki could take advantage of <a href="DejaNews.html">DejaNews</a>
        (or whatever its successor is): to display ExamplePage,
        search for messages with the subject "ExamplePage" (probably
        restricted to a single newsgroup, e.g. alt.usenetwiki.mywiki),
        and pick the one with the most recent date.  Display as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Displaying a page's history would be easy: just find all the
        messages whose subject is "ExamplePage", and display them in
        a list, with their dates.  The user could pick any two to diff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Editing a page would similarly be easy: grab the text, let the
        user edit it, then post the new version to <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only potential stumbling block I can see is simultaneous
        edits.  You can't do effective locking, since the store is so
        radically distributed, and latencies are so high (e.g. you can't
        wait an hour to confirm that you have a lock on a page).
      </p>
      <p>
        But this isn't necessarily fatal to the scheme.  An analogy:
        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> uses page-level exclusive checkout,
        like most source-control systems.  The <a href="UseNetWiki.html">UseNetWiki</a> would use
        optimistic non-exclusive checkout, like CVS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm temtped to say "So what", let the <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s take care
        of content forks (which should be automatically detectable,
        if you use reply-to: headers properly), and let users discover
        that <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> isn't just harmful on <a href="UseNetWiki.html">UseNetWiki</a>, it's a pain
        in the ass to engage in, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        A web-based front end would be the quickest way to get started,
        but dedicated clients (e.g. an Emacs extension) could also be written.
      </p>
      <p>
        One extension has occurred to me: use encryption on the content
        (including the subject: headers) to create a distributed, secure
        Wiki.  If you want to distinguish readers from writers, you can
        use PublicKeyCryptography: readers get the public key, so they can
        decrypt everything, but only writers get the private key, so only
        they can change pages.
      </p>

        Thoughts?  Is this an insane scheme?  Could it possibly work?
        Will we be reading a <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> link next year to an article
        titled "How Wiki Ate <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>"?

        <em>Couldn't work for a popular wiki since new posts take a while to propagate. Consider people using </em><a href="GoogleGroups.html">GoogleGroups</a> to post: It takes several hours to see newly posted messages. In the mean time, there could be (and definitely are in popular newsgroups) several conflicting posts. <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> is much more asynchronous than Wiki.<em></em>
