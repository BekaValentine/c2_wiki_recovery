        Non Monotonic Logic
      </h1>
      <p>
        A system of logic with the property that adding premises to a system can cause a proposition to become invalidated--in other words, additional information can cause a belief that was previously true to become false.  In classical <a href="FirstOrderLogic.html">FirstOrderLogic</a>, the rule "once true, always true" holds--if a statement is true (explicitly so, or inferrable from the axioms in the system), then addition of additional facts or axioms cannot make it false.  (Additional rules/axioms <em>can</em> make the system inconsistent; but that's another kettle of fish).  In systems with the <a href="ClosedWorldAssumption.html">ClosedWorldAssumption</a> (where falsehood is the absence of truth), things <em>can</em> go from false to true.  In systems with the <a href="OpenWorldAssumption.html">OpenWorldAssumption</a> (where falsehood must be stated explicitly), things can go from unknown to either true or false; but things that are known (true/false) can neither become unknown or take the opposite known state.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="NonMonotonicLogic.html">NonMonotonicLogic</a>, this rule vanishes; additional information can falsify statements that were held to be true.
