      <p>
        <a href="ReedPhillips.html">ReedPhillips</a> founded KSC with the intention of offering
        products and services in the emerging <a href="KnowledgeEngineering.html">KnowledgeEngineering</a>
        market.  Reed soon found the Smalltalk market to be 
        emerging much more rapidly, probably due to the boundless
        energy of <a href="SamAdams.html">SamAdams</a>, an early member of the KSC team.

        <strong>Factoid</strong>: Reed told the graphic artist to make
        sure the company logo was easy to draw with the 
        desktop equipment of the day.

        I always thought our friends in Portland did CRC Cards (<a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, <a href="RebeccaWirfsBrock.html">RebeccaWirfsBrock</a>, others). Did KSC do the first Enterprise modeling? Am I growing senile?

        Tom, you're misunderstanding this section (Which Ward wrote!)
        <a href="WardAndKent.html">WardAndKent</a> did invent CRC cards.  However, Sam popularized
        their use and introduced them to a wider audience with a multitude
        of CRC talks at many, many conferences.

        Got it, now. I thought I had fallen into a universe where Ward and Sam worked for IBM and KSC invented CRC (also where Elvis was dead).

        But.. Elvis is dead.  He died during the "harmonic convergence" so that he could be reincarnated as Quetzalcoatl.  Watch the old B sci-fi movie 'Q' backwards for details.
