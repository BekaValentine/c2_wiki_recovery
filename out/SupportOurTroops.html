        Support Our Troops
      </h1>
      <p>
        In one of the finest pieces of mind control and spin-doctoring I have ever seen, the governments leading the invasion of Iraq managed to turn a public overwhelmingly against the war into a passive consenters. How? By starting the war, and then saying "It's too late to object now."

      <p>
        Obviously, this is true, but if we let them get away with it, they might try it again.

        <strong>Hey!</strong> Of <em>course</em> I support our troops! That's why I want them brought home now.
