        A now defunct public <a href="WebAnnotation.html">WebAnnotation</a> system, created by <a href="KaPingYee.html">KaPingYee</a> and supported by the Foresight Institute. Inspired by <a href="MemexVision.html">MemexVision</a> and the <a href="XanaduProject.html">XanaduProject</a>, it acted as a proxy; to see annotations for page <a href="http://example.com,">http://example.com,</a> you'd redirect the URL through the crit.org proxy: <a href="http://crit.org/http://example.com/.">http://crit.org/http://example.com/.</a> The same mechanism was used to add annotations. It also worked on Wiki pages. Like Wiki, there was a public monitor of the recent changes on <a href="CritLink.html">CritLink</a>.

        Annotation projects active as of 2004: the <a href="AnnotationEngine.html">AnnotationEngine</a> and, of late, <a href="WikAlong.html">WikAlong</a>.

        A very nice feature of <a href="CritLink.html">CritLink</a> was the capability to set fine-grained link targets. This ability has now also been provided with a service called PurpleSlurple (<a href="http://www.purpleslurple.net/).">http://www.purpleslurple.net/).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't let us forget, that <a href="CritLink.html">CritLink</a> was a LinkMediator, that allowed every Webpage to be an annotation to every other part of some other Webpage, i.e. nested and even overlapping annotated substrings. Once, when you were in annotation mode, you never left the annotation enclosure, when surfing the Web. Nobody has yet reached the genius of <a href="KaPingYee.html">KaPingYee</a>, imho. -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>

        <em>Old experiments with </em><a href="CritLink.html">CritLink</a> removed.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        WHY???
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Because </em><a href="CritLink.html">CritLink</a> is defunct, and crit.org is now something else.<em></em>
