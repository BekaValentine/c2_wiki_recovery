      </h1>
      <p>
        If a project isn't going to <a href="DeliverValue.html">DeliverValue</a> in excess of costs, it's better to cancel it early than late.
      </p>

        This would argue that a project that won't <a href="DeliverValue.html">DeliverValue</a> shouldn't be started.
      </p>

        But sometimes it's impossible to know the true cost (or value) of a project without trying it out first.  Experiments are worthwhile.  In these cases, <a href="EarlyCancellationIsSuccess.html">EarlyCancellationIsSuccess</a> if the team learns that the project won't be successful.  The earlier, the better.
