        The Object Of Dating
      </h1>
      <p>
        Generally always the same for a given person (determined by religion and philosophy).
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects which are DatingAntiPatterns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Marriage and nothing less.
        </li>
        <li>
           Sex and nothing more.
        </li>
        <li>
           Filling a void in one's life.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (These are listed as DatingAntiPatterns, because they are - responses below please - unless both daters want the exact same thing.  That is possible, but very unlikely.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects which are <a href="DatingPatterns.html">DatingPatterns</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Enjoying the evening.
        </li>
        <li>
           Building friendships.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Objects which are more or less neutral:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Finding out (not 'deciding') how much commitment one wants with this person.
        </li>
        <li>
           More generally, getting to know the person better.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The reason that enjoying the evening should be one's primary goal going into a date is that, prior to knowing a person well, one cannot, and should not attempt to, judge how much commitment would be appropriate. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>

        <em>Consider refactoring.  I wanted to add an antipattern, "Filling a void in one's life", but the ordinal numbers make it tough.  Incidentally, if you're that needy, consider getting a pet.</em>

        <em>Yeah, I tried to avoid phrasing it that way...  Well I've just given it another try.  Hah!  Well yes, I *am* that needy, but I didn't realize this page showed it until you pointed it out.  Oh, and I love my two cats, but not in that way.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can consider dating a specialized form of simply getting to know more people. This is a good thing, generally: You can learn things about life from other people.
