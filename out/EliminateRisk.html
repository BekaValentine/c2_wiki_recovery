        Eliminate Risk
      </h1>
      <p>
        A key to project success is eliminating risk.  We've all seen that cartoon with the big chart on the board, and in the middle is a box labeled <a href="ThenaMiracleOccurs.html">ThenaMiracleOccurs</a>.

        An <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> team identifies tasks by risk, and works to assess and eliminate risk at the beginning (<a href="WorstThingsFirst.html">WorstThingsFirst</a>).

        Turn the big thing you don't know how to do into smaller things you do know how to do.  Try a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>.  (see also <a href="SpikeDescribed.html">SpikeDescribed</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as the task isn't the biggest risk, capture what you have learned and turn to whatever is now the biggest risk. --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Eliminating risk may mean buying the program or the knowledge.  A project I'm in touch with has spent the last N months inventing concurrency and persistence.  It hasn't done anything about the application.  They are in serious danger of getting pulled up by the roots.

        Identify the right risks; reduce them quickly; get on with it.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Someone recently told me the real risk probably isn't a <a href="TechnicalRisk.html">TechnicalRisk</a>, but a PeopleRisk.  Its the things you think you know about people that ain't so. <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> won't necessarily help you with this.  A lot of watching out of the corner of you eye will.  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Oh yes.  That's kind of my job on C3 ... I just mill around watching for things going wrong.  Over the course of the project we've helped a number of people improve, and helped a couple leave.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
