        Q is (I believe) the successor to K (<a href="KayLanguage.html">KayLanguage</a>) for use with Kdb+ from Kx Systems. It was created by <a href="ArthurWhitney.html">ArthurWhitney</a>, based on K but "providing a more readable, English like interface." (Wikipedia) There is a trial version of the system (appropriate for anything other than production use) available at <a href="http://kx.com.">http://kx.com.</a>

        The Q Abridged Manual (<a href="http://kx.com/q/d/q.htm)">http://kx.com/q/d/q.htm)</a> gives a very dense list of examples. Q For Mortals (<a href="https://code.kx.com/trac/wiki/QforMortals2/contents">https://code.kx.com/trac/wiki/QforMortals2/contents</a> - anonymous as username and password) gives the long version.

        There's also a functional language called Q that had some academic success. Presently (August 2010), it looks like it hasn't been maintained since sometime in 2008. (<a href="http://q-lang.sourceforge.net/)">http://q-lang.sourceforge.net/)</a>

        I think this is the correct <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> for the language, but I would be delighted to move it to QqLanguage concommitant with a lot of whining.
