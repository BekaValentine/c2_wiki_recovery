      <p>
        If you got here, you must have come from <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.  If not, go ta <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> just once, sweet-hawt. When you keep hitting your browser's reload button in a vain attempt to find something new, that's when to worry.  And when you are editing a wiki page in one window and refreshing the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page in another, then you have to worry even more :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a> also could be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           one who also works as a <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a> (aka <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>), checking over <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s to see if they can be improved upon
        </li>
        <li>
           someone who is <a href="MindlesslyBrowsingTheNetAtWork.html">MindlesslyBrowsingTheNetAtWork</a>

        <strong>Questions</strong>: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Would a wiki be more dynamic if it didn't have <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>?  What would the impact of that change be?

        <strong>Addicted?</strong>

      <p>
        Are you one?  I have 
        <em>become one</em>
        in the course of doing <a href="ComponentDesignPatternsProject.html">ComponentDesignPatternsProject</a>.  Is there a twelve-step program for wiki addicts?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Maybe there is:  We now have </em><a href="WikiholicsAnonymous.html">WikiholicsAnonymous</a> to call upon.  ;-><em></em>

      <p>
        <em>Don't you mean the </em><a href="TwelveStepProgram.html">TwelveStepProgram</a> for WikiAddicts?<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I think I've been addicted to <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> for years.  If you asked <a href="BrianFoote.html">BrianFoote</a> he'd probably say I'm just another one of those darned <a href="NoveltyVampires.html">NoveltyVampires</a>. -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>

      </ul>
      <ul>

           Just because <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> is set as the <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> of my browser, does that mean that I am a <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a> ? -- <a href="PeteMcBreen.html">PeteMcBreen</a> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Psst! Hey you, <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>! I've got something even more addictive. Here, have a free sample:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/quickChanges?days=1">http://c2.com/cgi/quickChanges?days=1</a> (sorry, I can't help it) <em>[surely </em><a href="QuickChangesJunkie.html">QuickChangesJunkie</a>? Ed.]<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's even organized in reverse-chronological order (most recent changes first), fixing the most common complaint about the original <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> (see <a href="LazyRecentChangesJunkie.html">LazyRecentChangesJunkie</a>).

        On day one of the course I was like, wait, blogging for an english grade? Culture is dying and the world is coming to a crashing end and the prof. is encouraging it.  Less than three weeks later I'm a Recent Changes Junkie.  I heart the wiki!!!-AD

        What you do is use that addictive force to do work. We all have our individuality. We all do our own thing. We all monitor the recently changed pages for the hobby we're interested in. And we try to get more people interested in our hobby so we make our opening wiki pages the kick-assest. WikiHobbies What is a hobby but the cool thing we get to do in our spare time? 
      </p>
      <p>
        What if we could do work in our spare time. We wouldn't work, we would only do our hobby more. What if someone's hobby was agriculture and they grew all our food as a hobby? What if we sat around all day and learned shit when we felt like it WikiHobbiesDoctor. What if so many of us had the time to study the things we find interesting WikiHobbiesScience? And to always have a place we can ask questions and get answers? 
      </p>
      <p>
        If we can answer questions on this wiki thing why can't we do most of our education on this thing? Isn't that all that education is: asking questions and giving answers until the student learns to ask the questions himself.

        During the past four years of my thesis work, I've kept a running diary where I've recorded ideas, problem descriptions, algorithms, pieces of code, paper drafts etc. The entries are in chronological order (its a 150 page document by now ;) and they capture the progress of my work. Sometimes, when I browse the older entries, I feel that SomeOtherPersonMustHaveWrittenThis. Now, that's eerie... 
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, keeping a diary like this has helped my work. But it never occurred to me to make web pages - dang!

        What about when you're editing a wiki page and you do a refresh on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> every minute or so to ensure that you can dynamically reflect other folks' comments to the same page you're editing, so as to not overwrite their work.

        one by one until I'd caught up.

        A measure of how stressful and busy your day was. Equals the number of hours in a day before you get to open the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Conversely, the number of times you refresh </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> an hour is an indicator of how burnt out you are. <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a>'s <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> is bookmarked on my cellphone.<em></em>

        I assert without proof that only the <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>s and the really serious volunteer housekeeper go around cleaning up the <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> pages, and further assert that this is because only the RCJs have the organisational resources necessary to do so effectively (namely the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> pages).  I therefore deduce that <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> is not a <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>, given the statement on <a href="DeletionCandidate.html">DeletionCandidate</a> that he has never expressed an opinion on the on/off-topic matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em><ahem></em> The statement (actually on <a href="CategoryOffTopic.html">CategoryOffTopic</a>) about Ward not having expressed an opinion on the on/off topic matter is more of a question. I can't find anything that indicates Ward wants to place limits on the discourse of this Wiki. The pages he himself has generated should back me up on this, but the definitive answer awaits a revelation from The Man His Own Bad Sef.

        I'm trying to coin a wiki word but nothing seems appropriate. RecentChangesPolice (derogatory), ...

        and although these appear to be orthogonal flavours of <a href="ThingsOnWikisMind.html">ThingsOnWikisMind</a>, the first acts at a point in time on (almost) all edits, the others have effect when averaged over time and then only on their domain.
