        Flisl Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        FLISL is short for Forth Like Interpreted Scripting Language, it is meant for embedding into other programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a bit different than Forth. It is simpler, so it doesn't have as many commands, but you can add some in whatever program it is being embedded in.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few of the features are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Control-flow blocks are always delimited with square brackets, and the word that isn't a square bracket by itself actually does something, while square brackets by themself do nothing other than begin/end blocks
        </li>
        <li>
           Stack marking, allowing you to deal with many values at once
        </li>
        <li>
           Labels and GOTO, in addition to more structured programming contructs
        </li>
        <li>
           "If ... else if ... else ... end if" blocks. An example: aaa IF[ bbb ]ELSE ccc IF[ ddd ]ELSE[ eee ]
        </li>
        <li>
           Many abbreviations
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here is an example which calculates a fibonact sequence (assuming the existence of OUTPUT command, which is non-standard):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           1 [ SWAP OVER + DUP OUTPUT ]LOOP
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With abbreviations, it is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           1 [ S; O; + D; OUTPUT ]LOOP
        </li>
      </ol>
