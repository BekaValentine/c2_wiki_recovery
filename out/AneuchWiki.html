      <p>
        <strong>Aneuch</strong> (pronounced <em>uh</em>-<strong>noo</strong>kh and means "enough") is a wiki engine written in Perl by Aaron Graves. It is a single PERL script, and it uses your filesystem rather than a database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aneuch is very similar in concept to <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> or <a href="OddMuse.html">OddMuse</a> (though it is important to note that Aneuch uses no code from either!)

        <strong>History</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Aneuch was created by AaronGraves in July of 2012. While working on a project to convert internal documentation to <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> at his workplace, he wrote a QND Perl script to convert <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> syntax elements into their HTML equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
        For fun, he continued to build the project into a full-blown wiki engine, ultimately switching the Markup language used to Creole.

        <strong>Main features</strong>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Revision control</dt>
        <dd>Aneuch stores all versions of each wiki page, allowing the user to compare the current version with any older version. Parallel editing of one page by multiple users is prevented by a locking mechanism.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Plugins</dt>
        <dd>Aneuch has a plugin interface available. While no plugins have been created yet, the developer is planning to create plugins for different Markup languages (Markdown being the first planned)</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Templates</dt>
        <dd>The appearance of the wiki can be defined by a template.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Full text search</dt>
        <dd>Aneuch has an integrated search with which a user can search for keywords on the wiki.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <strong>Planned features</strong>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Caching</dt>
        <dd>Aneuch will create a cache of all pages, reducing server load on a busy site.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Access control</dt>
        <dd>ACL's are planned for per-page and site-wide usage.</dd>
