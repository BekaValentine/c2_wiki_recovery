        Norm Meyrowitz
      </h1>
      <p>
        Norm was the long time editor of the OOPSLA proceedings.
        I begged him to edit for me in 1989, and it worked out
        great. His part of the program was no problem at all.

      <p>
        He also gave a great demo of <a href="InterMedia.html">InterMedia</a> at <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a>
        at around the same time. The <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> folks were amazed at
        what he had done with their (at the time formative) work.
