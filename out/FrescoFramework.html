        Fresco Framework
      </h1>
      <p>
        Fresco is a windowing system derived from a structured graphics toolkit originally based on <a href="InterViews.html">InterViews</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fresco is designed to replace the <a href="XwindowSystem.html">XwindowSystem</a>.  <em>It can run on top of X, or standalone.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I can tell, the major difference between Fresco and the X Window system is that Fresco uses vector primitives (lines, characters, splines, etc.) to give it resolution-independence, while the X window system is pixel-oriented. <em>I'm quite sure this is not "the major difference", in part because I used to know a fair amount about Interviews (see below); googling could come up with a better description.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Fresco does have pixel-oriented extensions, and I've been told that the X Window system has some vector-oriented extensions (Render).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Fresco (<a href="FrescoFramework.html">FrescoFramework</a> is just a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>) was/is the successor to <a href="InterViews.html">InterViews</a>. It brought <a href="CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture.html">CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture</a> (CORBA) to the GUI table. Fresco had a bumpy history. It was abandoned around '98 due to funding problems (Did Fujitsu fund this?). It had been resurrected by <a href="TheBerlinProject.html">TheBerlinProject</a> in 2002. <a href="TheBerlinProject.html">TheBerlinProject</a> even renamed themselves to Fresco.

        <a href="MarkLinton.html">MarkLinton</a> was the primary designer of Fresco.

        Is <a href="FrescoFramework.html">FrescoFramework</a> a <a href="RococoSolution.html">RococoSolution</a>? <em>I assume this is a play on words. Those who work on Fresco think X is overly baroque, rather.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Does Fresco exist in any meaningful sense? I have been unable to find even second hand archives of code or documentation.
