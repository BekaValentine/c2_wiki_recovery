        Relational Projection
      </h1>
      <p>
        Say you have a table:
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>Addresses</strong><br/>
        First-Name   Last-Name    Address<br/>
        _______________________________________<br/>
        William      Underwood    Somewhere<br/>
        John         Smith        Somewhere-Else<br/>
        Jane         Smith        Somewhere-Else<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Projection lets you answer questions such as "How many unique names are there in the database?" and "What addresses are there in the database?"
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if we projected the above table to {First-Name Last-Name} we would be left with
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>Addresses.projectTo({First-Name Last-Name})</strong><br/>
        First-Name   Last-Name <br/>
        ______________________<br/>
        William      Underwood<br/>
        John         Smith<br/>
        Jane         Smith<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Likewise, if we projected down to {Address} we would have
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>Addresses.projectTo({Address})</strong><br/>
        Address<br/>
        ______________<br/>
        Somewhere<br/>
        Somewhere-Else<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that the duplicates are eliminated from the result: in relational theory, you can't have two tuples (rows) in a table which are identical; by removing the First-Name from the table, the rows "John, Smith, Somewhere-Else" and "Jane, Smith, Somewhere-Else" become indistinguishable, and so they are collapsed into one row.
      </p>

        I have not tested it, but one may be able to achieve this in SQL using something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        select first, last, combined <br/>
        from (select first, last, concat(first,' ',last) as combined<br/>
        from names<br/>
        )<br/>
        group by first, last, combined<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>It's simpler than that actually, you'd just do</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        SELECT DISTINCT First-Name, Last-Name FROM Addresses<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Not all dialects support Distinct (at least they did not used to). Then again they don't all support nested queries either.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note though, that I'm deliberately ignoring standard SQL syntax for exactly this reason. You know SQL, but yet you don't know relational algebra, which SQL is a broken implementation of. The alternate syntax makes sure that misconceptions brought from experience in query languages are exposed.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am just covering the practical side of things because for good or bad, we are stuck with SQL for a while.
