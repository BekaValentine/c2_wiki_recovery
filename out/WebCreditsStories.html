        Web Credits Stories

      <p>
        We (<a href="XpNewYorkCity.html">XpNewYorkCity</a>) need to fill in more info about the project here.  The Story Cards that we've come up with so far are transcribed here.  As these stories are fleshed out, they can be given names and split onto separate pages.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        First are the two main stories that we've chosen to focus upon for our first release:
      </p>
      <p>
        Story: A page where people can enter data about what they did on a site.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Free form roles vs a selected list? (we chose to go with the selected list)
        </li>
        <li>
           Multiple roles per person?
        </li>
        <li>
           Date Launched
        </li>
        <li>
           URL
        </li>
        <li>
           When you worked on it (memo field)
        </li>
        <li>
           What tech you used (memo field)
        </li>
        <li>
           Form validation: some fields are optional, some are required.  any that are included should contain valid data.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Task: Create HTML form and process it
            </li>
            <li>
               Task: Validate form
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Story: A page where a user can enter a name and find out all the credits relating to that person. [By Date]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What URL
        </li>
        <li>
           When
        </li>
        <li>
           What title
        </li>
        <li>
           Memo
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Now are the stories that we came up with, but decided not to prioritize for our first release:
      </p>
      <p>
        Story: A page where people can enter data about themselves, separate from CREDIT data
      </p>
      <p>
        Story: A page where people can edit information that they previously entered about themselves [not related to CREDITS]
      </p>
      <p>
        Story: A user should be able to click a result of a search / query and run the "converse" query.  E.g. if one searches for all people who worked on xyz.com, the names that come back should link to a query for all that that person did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Story: A web page for people to answer the question, "Who did that Site?" or WHAT ARE THE CREDITS FOR A SITE?
