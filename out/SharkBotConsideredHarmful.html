        Shark Bot Considered Harmful
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, run by <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>, has a high rate of false positives. Originally designed to address the problem of the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, it is now a vandal in its own right. Rather than shouldering the responsibility of preventing these false positives himself, either by improving the quality of his code or manually verifying the changes made by the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a> expects <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> to apply to him to be whitelisted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite having this abdication of his responsibilities repeatedly pointed out to him, <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a> has made it clear that he will continue to require people to ask his permission to participate on this Wiki. Those who do not will find their edits vandalized by the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until this situation is addressed by the Wiki owner or official stewards, I will not be contributing to this Wiki. This is no doubt a small loss to the many people who have been here much longer, but I would suggest that it is an indication that this Wiki is not living up to its goals of open participation and community building.

        <em>It should be noted that the "high rate of false positives", above, actually refers to a few edits under the </em><a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> of JackMollier, which -- as determined by the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> mechanisms and manual verification -- have all the hallmarks of <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> edits. There is no evidence that the edits were, in fact, not made by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, including the edits signed as JackMollier on this page. As for the "abdication of [my] responsibilities", I invite you, the <a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a>, to see <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, and the text below to decide for yourselves. I also invite comments from other <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> participants.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      <p>
        That is a lie. The edits were to ChangesInWeekThirtyFour and ChangesInWeekThirtyFive and reflected cleanup of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Any manual check would clearly show them to be legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, those are the "few edits" I referred to. And how would a manual check "clearly show them to be legitimate", when, as I've already pointed out, they are identical to </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>* edits made by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> under spoofed <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>s? How, then, is my comment above a "lie"?<em></em>

        <em>If you're the real </em>JackMollier and not <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, please email <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a> to get whitelisted by the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're the real person running the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, show some responsibility for checking the validity of other people's edits before automatically reverting them. It's rude.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Myself and the </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> must work within the limitations of the <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> software. Given that <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> has repeatedly spoofed the JackMollier <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> under precisely the circumstances which you're editing now, it is hardly surprising that the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> has identified you as <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. If you are the real JackMollier, then please accept my apologies for any inconvenience, and I invite you to read the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> and <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> pages to understand the background to this.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I read those pages. You admit that you are not one of the official Wiki stewards, yet you take it upon yourself to impose additional requirements on the other, equally legitimate users of this Wiki. I understand your frustration with people like the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, but your tools for addressing the problem are too blunt. If the official Wiki stewards agree that username cookies shouldn't be used, I'll stop using it. If they explicitly sanction the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, I'll stop complaining. Until then, you are behaving more like the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> than you are like a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>. If you want to automate fixes, that's fine, but you have a responsibility to only fix what's really broken. Expecting everyone else to accommodate your behavior is, again, rude.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I have just now attempted to edit ChangesInWeekThirtyFour incrementally, and the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> has rolled back even one line changes. This is beyond rude and qualifies as destructive, unfriendly, and, frankly, the behavior of a juvenile asshole.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ask the Wiki stewards to please make an an official statement as to whether or not they condone the actions of the person running the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>. If you don't want people helping to build this Wiki, continuing to allow this type of behavior is a good way to chase us off. -- JackMollier
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I sent you an email prior to your edits today. Have you not received it? Responding to it will help convince me that you are not </em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, and then we can end this unpleasantness. Otherwise, the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> will continue to regard you as the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, given that your behaviour thus far is indistinguishable from his.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can end this unpleasantness unilaterally if you stop being unpleasant. First, by your own admission you are not one of the Wiki stewards. You have no more right to control this Wiki than any other contributer. This Wiki supports username cookies, but you act to make them unusable. Second, my edits are clearly distinguishable from <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. With respect to the two pages in question, I'm updating them with the changes listed on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and removing those to keep the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page manageable. If your software can't distinguish between those kinds of changes and whatever it is that <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> does that gets your panties in a twist, then you are being irresponsible by running such poor quality code against this Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have wasted more of my time than <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. Should your behavior continue without sanction from the Wiki stewards, I will be very unlikely to act as a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>. For every person like me who raises the issue, there are no doubt others who simply stop participating here. You may think you're doing something good with your bot, but until you can eliminate the false positives your poorly implemented software is doing harm to this Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I see you have still not responded to my email, thus further increasing my suspicion that you are, in fact, </em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>However, for the moment, let's assume you are not </em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. I will admit to having wasted more of <strong>your</strong> time than <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, but not the time of the participant base as a whole. Had you been here when <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> was active, you would have seen how <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> wasted <strong>everyone's</strong> time. That includes time wasted by one of the stewards to bring legal action against <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, without success. That includes time wasted by a regular participant who attempted to merely edit as he saw fit, without being continuously badgered (and having his edits pointlessly reverted) by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. That includes time wasted by almost every participant who tried to engage in normal dialogue without having the discourse (or <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>) interrupted by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>'s <a href="StupidLittleEdits.html">StupidLittleEdits</a>. It has only been after long and continuous application of the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> that <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>'s activity has diminished to the point that normal activity has returned. There was a time when this wiki was in danger of becoming <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>'s wiki instead of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, and there is little question that <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> has been instrumental in preventing that from happening.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unfortunately, given the information available via the </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> software (which is no more than that available to any human editor), and given the inherent limits of any heuristic-based pattern detector (which includes human intelligence!), false positives will occur, just as they do with email spam detectors, virus scanners and the like. I make every effort to tune the heuristics to avoid false positives, but when your editing behaviour has all the marks of <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, you will be identified as <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. That includes editing <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and related pages using a spoofed <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Fortunately, this can be trivially addressed by whitelisting your IP address and not using a </em><a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie. If you would prefer to leave, then so be it. At least the rest of us can continue to enjoy <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> without being plagued by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. Eventually, someone will arrive to maintain <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> who considers the negligible effort of having his or her IP whitelisted preferable to enduring <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>.<em></em>

        This is a perfect example of you abdicating responsibility. Your code is vandalizing my changes and you expect me to jump through your hoops to stop you from doing that. You shouldn't be doing it in the first place. If your bot isn't smart enough to handle this discrimination on its own, either manually check it or stop running it.

           Jack - as a long-time participant on this wiki (from within months of it going live) I feel that you are in the wrong in your position concerning the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, and <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>' motives and abilities. You appear to be acting from a position of insufficient knowledge to understand the true issues concerning the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> and his/her actions. Perhaps you might consider simply getting whitelisted, and then editing as you choose. I suspect you won't because you've now backed yourself into a position of implacable resistance, but I ask that you consider that you might, just might, through simple lack of knowledge, be in the wrong. I, for one, would prefer on balance to see the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> continue and you leave, rather than the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> stop and the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> return, even though you are potentially a constructive contributor.

           Thank you for your comment. What do you think of the alternative that <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a> should take responsibility for eliminating the false positives of the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>? Or the other alternative that the Wiki stewards or owner incorporate the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> functionality into the Wiki code? As it stands, one participant is vandalizing the edits made by another participant and expecting the costs of his behavior to be borne by every other <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> in the form of asking permission not to be vandalized. Surely you can see the inherent rudeness in this behavior?

           <em>I </em>'do<strong> take responsibility for false positives, as the discussions on the </strong><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> page amply reveal. However, resisting the primary mechanism by which false positives of this particular kind are resolved -- as, thus far, there <strong>is</strong> no other mechanism that I can determine, and I am very open to suggestions -- is not going to resolve this.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

           No, you do not take responsibility, you require others to do so by begging your permission to participate here. Taking responsibility would mean reviewing the changes suggested by your <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> and disallowing those that vandalize edits made by other participants.
        </li>

           <em>It is not sufficient to disallow vandalized edits. Any and all edits by what -- given the data available -- appears to be </em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> must be reverted.<em> -- DV</em>

           I know, from several conversations with stewards and Ward, that changes to the code base simply won't happen. With what I know of the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, I think Dave has found a reasonable balance. Very occasionally someone, such as yourself, complains that they are being victimised. I sympathise with that. However, I remember when this wiki was quite simply dominated by the GV. Dave has put in place a mechanism to deal both with the GV, and with the few people that have problems. I'm whitelisted, I welcome the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>. I appreciate that you think this is a matter of principle, but I believe Dave has got the right balance, that he is behaving reasonably, and that it is solving the GV problem. Out of interest, your problems will all go away if you get white-listed - why don't you? And no, I don't think Dave's behaviour is rude, perhaps simply because I know the problem being solved, and I understand the limitations of the existing code-base.

           Asking every other participant to get his permission not to have their contributions vandalized is rude. He knows that his bot suffers from false positives but continues to run it without accepting his obligation to prevent those from impacting other people.

However, given the limitations of data available, some false positives can only be addressed by whitelisting. That is reality, I'm afraid.

        Since <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a> refuses to take responsibility for the false positives caused by his <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> (see <a href="SharkBotConsideredHarmful.html">SharkBotConsideredHarmful</a> for details), I am terminating my participation here. Note that my unchanging ip address, 67.86.101.207, clearly distinguishes me from GV. -- JackMollier
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Fair enough. Goodbye and all the best. By the way, your IP doesn't "clearly" distinguish you from GV; it's merely an IP address, and contains no inherent semantic content that would distinguish anyone from anyone else. How it is </em>'used<em>' here, however, is a different matter...</em> -- DV
      </p>
      <p>
        Being "unchanging" does distinguish it from GV.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not inherently. There have been times when he's used one IP address for at least several days, especially when engaged in discussion.</em> -- DV
      </p>
      <p>
        Not a normal American ip address that doesn't list as a proxy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I make no assumptions about what IP addresses he may be able to acquire or how, and though the </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> does base a portion of its decisions on characteristics of the IP (to the extent that they can be reliably machine-processed and/or checked by me), they are only one component in an overall picture.<em> -- DV</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dave, shouldn't you take into account that it is easy to register an email address and construct a plausible email exchange with yourself, but very difficult to acquire a reliable ip address in another country?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When I receive emails from trivially-registerable email domains (gmail, hotmail, etc.), where possible I examine the originating IP in the email headers (to the extent that it means anything -- which is not much -- but it's one minor component in the overall picture), and I request (via email) that my correspondent also email from a work/school/etc. address, which is far more significant. A lot can be gathered from an email conversation. Once, on another forum subject to similar issues, I made a telephone call. So far, that hasn't been a problem -- genuine participants have, thus far, been very understanding and accommodating. Acquiring a reliable IP address in another country is not difficult. I have a number of them -- some I own and some accessible through various contacts -- and with the popularity of various remote control utilities, Web proxy servers, and so forth, even without taking zombied PCs and the like into account, it becomes fairly trivial to obtain a relatively stable IP even on a home cable network. E.g., "Spleen32> Hey Bill, can I proxy through your Linux box again tonight?", etc.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If Bill agrees to that, he may agree to the use of his work email address, especially if he has web access to his work (or college) email system, as is often the case, and may also agree to receive a telephone call. Must he agree by email or telephone never to make edits that the bot would revert? You imply that you will monitor his editing indefinitely for signs of similarity to GV.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't make any agreements regarding editing behaviour with my correspondent. I don't specially monitor any individual; the </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> regards all edits equally.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's what causes genuine housekeeping edits to be reverted. An email or telephone call can do little to prove that its sender is not effectively GV; as you stated, it's possible that GV knows a helpful "Bill" from some other area. Even if you list Bill, the more housekeeping he does, the more likely it is that you would delist him later.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hi, </em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>!  Actually, merely doing "more housekeeping" is not sufficient, in and of itself -- with emphasis on "more" -- to rack up a sufficient number of (shall we say) <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> Points to be consistently reverted; it is the nature and context of the housekeeping that is significant, and for my part (i.e., not <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> itself, but my control of it) I do appropriately take into account any discussions that myself (here or elsewhere) or others (here) have had with the individual in question -- keeping in mind that the term "individual" is not quite accurate.  "Behavioural locus" might be a better phrase to describe a manifestation like <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>.  To put it simply, I can't tell whether <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> is one person or ten, but it doesn't matter.  The <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> behaviour -- as manifested through edits, obviously -- is what gets reverted.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I do recognise the possibility (hell, I expect it) that </em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> will take a stab at making every effort to appear legitimate and will try to fool me (Mollier might have been such an attempt) -- whether via IP, email, phone, or all of the above -- but then his behaviour here will no doubt "out" him. If it doesn't, well, that's fine -- in that case he wouldn't be a <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> any more, which would be an excellent result.<em> -- DV</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        FWIW, I thought you handled that in a reasonable and calm fashion. Can't say the same for Mollier, I'm afraid. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>

        Count me as one of the users who has abandoned this wiki because of <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think there are four main problems with the current <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> strategy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are trying to solve an unsolvable problem.  You simply cannot prevent an individual from editing a public wiki.  If they choose to conceal their identity, you cannot prove whether two posts are by the same person or not.  Whether or not this is <em>morally</em> the right problem to solve is irrelevant to this point (though IMHO it is not the right problem - see point 4.)  The Turing test has nothing to do with it either, since this problem in unsolvable for humans too.  Unlike spam filtering...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You (<a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>) ask users who don't know you to allow you to act as a gatekeeper for the wiki (by maintaining the IP whitelist.)  Claiming that this is a trivial and satisfactory solution is offensive.  You may not be a "control freak" trying to "hijack the wiki" as some irate users have suggested, but it is not reasonable to expect strangers to trust you so readily.  The whitelist is a flawed and (hopefully) temporary workaround for the limitations of your (hopefully) unfinished program and you should admit the fact.  I understand perfectly why some are reluctant to ask you to be added to the whitelist.  Ignore the technical implications for a moment and imagine someone else telling you "I know you know nothing about me but you must submit to my authority as gatekeeper for this public resource so I can protect you all from the bad guys."  Wouldn't you be suspicious of them?  Would you accept "But I'm one of the good guys!" or "Take it or leave it" as a satisfactory answer?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Possibly related to point 2: you make too little effort to eliminate false positives, possibly because the whitelist is a technical solution to the problem.  But the whitelist itself introduces a political problem.  Or maybe it's because you view a false negative as a disaster.  If my spam filter generated this many false positives I would have abandoned it long ago.  In fact I have had only one false positive in six years, and I am willing to pay for this with false negatives (after filtering, 25% of my messages are still spam.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your priorities are wrong.  Why focus on enforcing a <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>?  The <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a> is there to stop unwanted edits.  If a specific edit is not harmful, what do you have to lose by letting it stand?  If the banned individual can work around it only by consistently making useful edits, you have solved the real problem already.  Don't like your spelling or grammar being corrected?  Then just get it right in the first place!  And if you focused on the content rather than the identity of the poster, users would be less upset by false positives.

        I'll be back when the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> is gone.  And if <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> leaves, I won't give <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> the credit for it.

           A couple of points to consider.  The minor one is that <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> didn't just correct incorrect grammar.  He also "corrected" correct grammar.  Even that wouldn't have resulted in a <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a> if he hadn't also been changing the meaning of what people were saying.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The major point though is that the public doesn't get to decide whether or not a gatekeeper is valid.  It's Ward (or one of his representatives).  If Ward sanctions <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, then <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> is legitimate.  If not, then <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> is not legitimate.  Now, you don't have to make use of this wiki if you don't like that, and that is something Ward should take into account.  (Along with other things such as the number of false positives.)
