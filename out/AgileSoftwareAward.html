        Agile Software Award
      </h1>
      <p>
        Imagine there was such as thing as an <a href="AgileSoftwareAward.html">AgileSoftwareAward</a>, with a committee of well known folks from the agile community. A bit like the Jolt awards but not such heavy focus on developer oriented software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you think that would help people associate Agile approaches with excellent software?

        Does the Gordon Pask award meet any of the critera for your idea? <a href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2005/07/30#gordon-pask">http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2005/07/30#gordon-pask</a>

        <em>Maybe. Although I'm interested in a more direct line: the common aim of the larger software community is to produce great software. An agile award scheme should reward this and reveal a relationship between great software and the principles and goals of agile development. Since the Gordon Pask award recognises 'Contributions to Agile Practice', I would say that it only has significance within the agile community.</em>

        I'm trying to think of alternatives to an <a href="AgileMaturityModel.html">AgileMaturityModel</a>. Certification programs in general go against the grain of agile development, but that doesn't mean that great agile software development teams should not be recognised as such.  --<a href="ChrisSteinbach.html">ChrisSteinbach</a>
