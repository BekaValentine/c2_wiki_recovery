        Joseph Campbell
      </h1>
      <p>
        Joseph Campbell (1904-1987) is one of the more well-known mythographers, who formalized the descriptions of various myth cycles into some fairly consistent patterns.  He wrote a 4-volume series ( <em>Masks of God</em> ) detailing the histories of 3 major cultural areas and the overview of them (volumn 4 is the weakest, being that overview/synthesis).
        <a href="GeorgeLucas.html">GeorgeLucas</a> used his work as the basis for the plot line(s) in the <a href="StarWars.html">StarWars</a> movie series.
