        Card Walloper Languages
      </h1>
      <p>
        Languages used in the DaysOfTheDinosaurs.  Batch processed sometimes cryptic, and usually (but not always) mind numbingly long to code, test and debug.  Some of these languages, such as <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a> are still in practical use.  Would have been avoided by Mel (<a href="StoryOfMel.html">StoryOfMel</a>) as he was busy programming directly on the <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> - in hexadecimal, and <em>not</em> eating quiche.

        <em>Why are Lisp and APL included?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because these languages were used in the DaysOfTheDinosaurs.  You young'ns don't know what it's like to hack APL on an APL terminal, with all them symbols <em>printed on the keys</em>.  Ah, the good ole days...  And LISP?  We had to enter each parenthesis <em>pixel by pixel</em>.

      <p>
        Yeah, I'm joking about the parentheses...
