        Specification Masterpiece
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="SpecificationMasterpiece.html">SpecificationMasterpiece</a> is a real-world example of the best possible kind of specification of a code-to-code interface.  This is different from a <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> in the traditional sense that implies a mostly non-language-based interface for end users, though it could be argued that every code-to-code interface is also a <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> because a programmer implementing the specification could be seen as its user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Categories include programming languages, network protocols, operating system interfaces, library interfaces, and file systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good specification makes it easy and fast for programmers to write a correct implementation of the user-requested behavior.  This probably implies the lowest possible code complexity.  A good specification often has to be easy to extend without conflicts and limitations, and easy to scale without massive slowdowns in implementations.

        I'd like to nominate the whole Internet RFC process. A few very simple documents, discussed, improved, extended over time, and look what they've led to.
