        Original wiki usage of this phrase was in the <a href="CowboyCoding.html">CowboyCoding</a> page to refer to a group of cowboys working together.

        <em>It is inappropriately disparaging to companies that had to start in a garage-like place, where the workers may not be cowboys.  I do some work in a basement, and yet we don't just cowboy through everything.</em>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is Apple respectable again? I guess the iMac did it. Thankfully.</em>
