        Southern Storm Software is working on a portable implementation of <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> with Gnu/Linux as their initial target platform. The primary goal of this project is to build a stable and portable interpreter for .NET platform binaries, together with a suite of Free Software tools to build .NET applications.

        As of May 2002, Portable.NET is usable. Slightly complicated
        programs are possible. Indeed someone has written an HTTP
        Server which compiles and runs inside Portable.NET . The
        compiler is halfway to the finish and the runtime is going
        through optimisation. Still needs to smoothen out a few
        rough edges.

        True to its name Portable.NET has been ported to <em>GNU/Linux</em>
        <em>GNU/Hurd</em> , <em>GNU/Darwin</em> (Mac OS X) , <em>Cygwin</em> (Win 9x , Me ,

        <em>The question is, then, what incentive do </em><a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> developers have to contributing? With Kaffe, we've already made significant inroads into Java, which certainly gives us more that we can do <em>now</em>, as opposed to what .NET <em>promises</em>.<em></em>

        <em>Another interesting question: How is Southern Storm's work being licensed under the </em><a href="GnuGeneralPublicLicense.html">GnuGeneralPublicLicense</a> is going to mesh with <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>'s license for the portable libraries?<em></em>

        Well Mono is usable but in the typical style that pervades the open source (sic) community they have to fight and destroy andy chance of having one succeed. Once again.
