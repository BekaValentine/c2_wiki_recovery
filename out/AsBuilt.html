      <p>
        <a href="AsBuilt.html">AsBuilt</a>s are blueprints that documents how a building
        was built, <em>after</em> it is "complete".  They document
        what seem like silly details at the time:  the placement of pipes
        and ducts in walls, the exact locations of joists, etc.

        Something built by a <a href="MasterPlan.html">MasterPlan</a> can never fully 
        attain the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>.  Even
        the blueprints for large, complex buildings cannot 
        anticipate most design problems.  That means that
        blueprints can't be used as maintenance documentation
        for the building.
        An <a href="AsBuilt.html">AsBuilt</a> serves that purpose.
