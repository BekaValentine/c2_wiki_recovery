        Unit Tests Require Perfect Developers
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s require developer perfection in both their initial construction and maintenance. Without static typing you are requiring developers to write extensive and nearly perfect <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. If this were possible then <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s would be largely unnecessary. Static type checking formalized and makes automatable and makes complete a great deal of checking. Some languages like Eiffel go even farther with <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>.
      </p>

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Regardless of the static typing issue, </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are written line by line in direct collaboration with the features they tests. Per <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a>, never change a line of code without a failing test. Therefor add just enough testage to ensure failure before adding the tested ability. This tests the tests.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are not another version of <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a><em></em>

        With or without static typing, you need to write good <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s
        <em>[c.f. </em><a href="CleanroomSoftwareEngineering.html">CleanroomSoftwareEngineering</a>]<em>.</em>
        Either way, though, you don't need to be perfect. Write the tests as best you can, and then beef them up every time you learn how. When you find a hole in the tests, close it up.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a team of imperfect developers does this for X months (where the value of X depends on how quickly they learn, not how perfect they were at the beginning), I'm confident that they'll end up with good enough tests that they won't care about <a href="StaticTypeSafety.html">StaticTypeSafety</a> anymore.

      <p>
        I don't think good <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are good enough. And the waiting for them to be perfected is very painful. I think even good <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are an ambitious goal for a large percentage of developers, especially if they must replace all the tests a compiler implements. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You might be right, but static typing doesn't solve the problem. You need to write the tests anyway (or have some other method of knowing correctness other than the compiler). Does the compiler give you enough confidence that you'd be willing to ship an untested system? -- <a href="AdamSpitz.html">AdamSpitz</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, I don't find <em>any</em> difference in the kind or number of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s I write in languages with or without static typing.  If you've never worked in a dynamically typed language like Smalltalk, then you can make a number of assumptions about how things <em>might</em> work, but you'll probably be wrong.  Personally, I think that it's a <a href="RedHerring.html">RedHerring</a>.  The two are not related. -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not smalltalk but I do use perl extensively. If I don't care about catching certain errors then I won't write the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. But to catch the "I do not understand" type of errors before runtime takes a very extensive set of tests. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps you're imagining that people working in dynamic languages are writing tests like:
      </p>
      <code>
        assert(Person.hasMethodNamed("getName"))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        We're not. We just write tests like:
      </p>
      <code>
        assert(bob.getName() == "Bob Smith")<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If that kind of test (which would be necessary in both Java and Smalltalk) passes, then we can be confident that the Person class has the getName() method. We don't need a compiler to confirm it.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <a href="AdamSpitz.html">AdamSpitz</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then your <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are bad. They are assuming a level of functionality is working, that is, a name was successfully added. Personally I would prefer you have tests for everything that can fail, not "system" level tests that fail at a higher level. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at Adam's test again.  What exactly is it testing that is at too high of a level?  Calling bob.getName() when it was not been defined will throw an error if the method is missing.  So that compiler error just showed up.  If it doesn't equal Bob Smith, then the problem with setName() is revealed.  Unit tests often manage to test more than what you see on the surface.

      <p>
        The original statement above is bizarre in the extreme. I can write terrible <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s (e.g. assertFalse(collection.elements().isEmpty()) when I really mean that the collection has one element "ABC"). Therefore, <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s don't require perfection.
      </p>

        <em>[A supporting statement...]  I'm sure I put as many bugs into the tests as in the production code.  When a test fails, I look at it and determine if the test code or the production code is wrong.  I fix the one that's wrong. -- </em><a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, you're my hero. ;) I'm sure I write <strong>more</strong> bugs in my <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s than the production code. Fortunately, I rarely write a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> and production code wrong <strong>in the same way.</strong> In fact, I've only done that once. So, when the test fails, I have the occasion to step through the code to figure out what's wrong. This is the main advantage of writing tests immediately. They are a good place just to place a breakpoint so you can step through the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        But > 90% of the time, when a test fails, it's due to a bad test. That really annoys me. I wish I knew a way to reduce this ratio, but I've found that good testing is complex. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sunir, not that I know anything about your programming abilities, but personally I find that when my </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are getting convoluted and difficult, its because the classes they're testing are too complex and could stand to be refactored. <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, while they ignore the implementation of classes, put a tremendous amount of pressure on their interfaces. (In fact, I find I write much better, more deliberate interfaces now that I'm using <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s.) --<a href="FrancisHwang.html">FrancisHwang</a><em></em>

      </dl>
      <p>
        Yes and no. You create another class and that requires a whole new set of unit tests. Then you need a set of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s to test the interaction of the new class and the existing class. To a large extent <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are preserved, they just move to testing interactions of classes instead of individual classes. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've observed the same thing that Sunir has, but with 98% of failures due to problems with the tests. And it's not because the tests themselves were difficult. One reason is that test cases receive much less care than the main code, since bugs have less impact. Changing functionality and environments break tests much more often than they break the deliverables. The rare occasions when tests reveal code defects do justify the tests, but tracking down the other test failures was one of the more annoying aspects of my last job.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Though in the case of the link Sunir provides, it seems to be a special case ... writing graphics libraries for portable devices does have a pretty high need for optimization, and I can see the argument for not breaking down some of the classes.

        No, but I'm not saying <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> is unnecessary if one has a compiler. I want both. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

Didn't you just say they're unnecessary?  (Puzzled. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>  ;-)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not contradictory. The compiler catches one large category of errors. <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s catch another category. System tests check another category. Acceptance tests will catch another. And the field catches another. Making sure a system works requires a layered approach. If the question is can <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s replace a compiler then the answer is clearly yes. But it is very difficult and i don't think most people will do it correctly, just like the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> previously exampled. I simply don't trust developers to write that detailed a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> for everything all the time. I have for this opinion years of actual experience with real-life developers and not a ItCouldBeThisWayIfEveryOneBelievedAndBehaved sort of approach. Too many will not do a good enough job. I would like to move even more checking into the tools and in to the infrastructure because i do not believe in the PerfectabilityOfDevelopers. I still use locks on my car and house even though if everyone behaved i would not have to. In one location i never locked my car or house and it worked, but that's rare. Usually the world is more cruel and disappointing. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

        Suppose that without <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, 10% of your typical programmer's code was buggy. Now suppose they write test that cover 20% (at random) of your code. 10% of those tests are wrong too, from how you rated your coders originally. But now, you have 90% correct tests for 20% of the 10% of the production code that was buggy. Or in other words, you have found 18% of the bugs that were in your production code (20%*90%). A big win! Clearly there is much wrong with this argument, like code coverage being equated to coverage of 'things that need tested', and so on. But the point is that <em>imperfect coders</em> can use <em>imperfect </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s<em> to </em>reduce<em> their bug rate. To paraphrase a current ad: Tools that automate testing are priceless, but for everything else, there's writing tests. -- </em><a href="BrianEwins.html">BrianEwins</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You will never find a bigger advocate for <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing than me. It is a big win. Add to your calculations the improvement a compiler makes in the accuracy and completeness of tests and you can see why a compiler is far better than a buggy human writing this class of tests. Especially because the compiler is good at the repetitive boring tests than humans are not good at. I fail to see why it has to be either and not both. It's clear to me a human will not do as a good as compiler. Let the human spend their time on the part of the tests that relate to the semantics of the application and now you have a good division of labor that should yield the best results. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This phrase confuses me: "the part of the tests that relate to the semantics of the application." <strong>All</strong> of my tests relate to the semantics of the application. There are <strong>zero</strong> tests that could be replaced by a compiler. Any test that ensures semantic correctness also ensures type correctness, so there is no need for separate type-correctness-tests. Can you give me an example of a test that a Smalltalk programmer would need to write that a Java programmer wouldn't? -- <a href="AdamSpitz.html">AdamSpitz</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it depends on the completeness of your tests. To me making sure all methods exist, making sure only existing methods are being called, having the correct parameters and types passed, and having the interfaces called correctly are not part of semantics. It's book keeping. Yet a complete set of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s will need to test all these things. Of course you can hack around this with system style tests but i don't think that's a correct form of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>

        I'll give it a shot.  I used to be a big fan of <a href="ManifestTyping.html">ManifestTyping</a>, for the same reason <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a> is.  Once I started writing a lot of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and doing a lot of refactoring, though, I realized a few things.  First, good <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s exercise the type system pretty thoroughly as a side effect.  You don't need any extra tests.  Second, manifest types make refactoring more difficult.

      <p>
        My conclusion is that <a href="ImplicitTyping.html">ImplicitTyping</a> is less work and same quality if you're already doing a lot of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing and refactoring.

        A few points:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           DBC performs checks at runtime. So you can only check things which won't affect runtime performance. <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s can test anything, but doesn't test with live data.
        </li>
        <li>
           Static type checking is uhhh.... static. So it doesn't test dynamic behaviour. It's also limited to those checks which won't slow down the compiler too much.
        </li>
        <li>
           You missed other 'features' from the list of things which do away with the need for <em>some</em> <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s: const correctness, public/private/protected/friend, proving program correctness, automated boundary test generators (eg JTest), and so on. Generally automated techniques only reduce the number of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s you need, can't be applied to all languages, and may cost too much to apply. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I see all of these techniques as complementary, but <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing as a core technique that you can apply when none of the others is available. And I would certainly argue that DBC+static types won't give you all the coverage you can get by <em>adding</em> some <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. -- <a href="BrianEwins.html">BrianEwins</a>.

        I think we've got two separate pages trying to live on this page. One of them is about whether imperfect developers can produce good enough <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. The other is about whether a type-checker adds any value to a system that has <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. (UnitTestsMakeTypeCheckersUnnecessary, or some shorter name that I can't think of. :) The topics are related, because we're mainly trying to figure out whether imperfect <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s need a type-checker to supplement them, but I think things will be a lot clearer if we put them on separate pages.

        Does that matter? If you're adding the test afterward, you can still tweak the build/checkin environment to declare the program broken if tests fail.

        Bill, I don't understand "programmers should be unable to check code in that doesn't complete its tests."
        We agree that programmers write (untested) code, then tests are run, and only then -- after all the tests pass -- the programmer can check in that code.
        I assumed thought that was exactly what the original poster was describing.
        But I thought the original poster was complaining about the situation where a test fails (not in the checked-in code, of course),
        and it turns out the bug is in the test code, not in the application code.
        (Buggy tests *can* and often *are* checked in, right? If you have a build system that can somehow prevent that, *please* tell me how I can set up a system like that.)

        I've always held the view that unit tests aren't there to catch every single bug.  Oh sure, they make sure that things work reasonably well, and may even improve quality by forcing you to explicitly handle boundary conditions rather than mumbling IllDoItLater.

        <a href="TestFirstDesign.html">TestFirstDesign</a> forces a developer to think through and incrementally code and test software.  The developer does not need to solve the entire problem all at once, he just needs to solve one tiny piece and then go on to the next.  At any point in time, the developer is one roll back away from working code, so he will only lose a couple hours of work even with a major mistake.

        It is not <a href="ProgrammerTest.html">ProgrammerTest</a>s that require perfect developers, it is writing code without them that requires perfect developers.
