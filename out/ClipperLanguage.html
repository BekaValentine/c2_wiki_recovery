        <em>A work-alike of the old dBase platform, intending to eat its market share</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I attended a sales demonstration for DbaseFour - the big GrandWazoo release that AshtonTate was staking their future on. This was after dBase III, with its crummy little interface and poor query systems, had owned the fledgling PC market.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sales rep demonstrated dBase IV's new compiler, its little text mode windows, its language improvements, etc. Then he threw the floor open for questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone in the audience, in an innocent little south-asian accent, asked if dBase IV will support Clipper.
