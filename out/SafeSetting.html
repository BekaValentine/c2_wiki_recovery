        Safe Setting
      </h1>
      <p>
        ... the pattern community strives to develop a high
        quality body of literature that improves the quality
        of life for users, developers, managers, and others in
        the software community.
        The creative literature community uses a review format
        called a <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a> to improve the quality of
        literature that is published beyond a small circle of
        colleagues.
        Authors clearly can benefit from the feedback of their
        peers and colleagues.
        This pattern establishes a <a href="SafeSetting.html">SafeSetting</a> to provide
        free-flowing input to authors while preserving their
        dignity.
      </p>

        There are few things that satisfy authors more than
        seeing their work published and widely used.
        For works published without a critical review
        process, authors will receive their first feedback
        from the market they aim to influence, which may provide
        a rude awakening for the author.
        On the other hand, peer review can be equally frightening
        and demoralizing, as the author is open to criticism from
        peers who know the material and the author well.
        Familiarity with the material makes it possible for these
        reviewers to provide the largest volume of feedback;
        familiarity with the author makes it possible for them
        to "push the author's buttons" in the review process.
        Yet such review is important.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Provide a </strong><a href="SafeSetting.html">SafeSetting</a> where the author can receive useful<strong></strong>
        <strong>expert feedback directed at the work rather than at the</strong>
        <strong>author, with the goal of preserving the dignity of the</strong>
        <strong>author.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>*  *  *</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can help the author feel at home by using the patterns:
        <a href="WorkshopComprisesAuthors.html">WorkshopComprisesAuthors</a> and <a href="AuthorsCircle.html">AuthorsCircle</a>,
        which help provide a peer setting
        with opportunity for reciprocation;
        <a href="ModeratorGuidesTheWorkshop.html">ModeratorGuidesTheWorkshop</a>, which prevents the workshop
        dynamics from getting out of hand;
        <a href="PositiveFeedbackFirst.html">PositiveFeedbackFirst</a>, which helps the author's sense of
        contribution and self-worth;
        <a href="SuggestionsForImprovement.html">SuggestionsForImprovement</a>, which defines the tone of
        constructive feedback; and <a href="ThankTheAuthor.html">ThankTheAuthor</a>, where
        the community formally recognizes the author's contribution.
