        This is because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Until recently, high quality websites were expensive to produce. So good websites <strong>were</strong> largely created and maintained by legitimate businesses
        </li>
        <li>
           Consumers value convenience and are more willing to take risks.
        </li>
        <li>
           Overconfidence on the part of consumers, and gross undervaluation of the talents of the dark side.
        </li>
        <li>
           Consumers felt they are adequately covered by safety nets in the event of a mishap.
        </li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some fake websites are highly sophisticated. They contain mostly legitimate links that promote confidence in the users enticed to visit the sites.
