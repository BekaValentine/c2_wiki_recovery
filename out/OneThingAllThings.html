        This is when someone asks you to take action consistent with a previously stated opinion on objects not specifically mentioned in that opinion.

        <a href="RefactorMe.html">RefactorMe</a>: Is there an underlying principle behind this <strong>and</strong> <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a>?

        <em>Person 1: Fruit is good for you, so I will eat an apple.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Person 2: If you think that fruit is so good, why don't you eat those oranges too?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn't this related to the <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a>? The <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a> seems to be about arguing <em>"If you allow one, you'll have to allow all, which we don't want, so don't allow one"</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing the above example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Person 3: No! I won't eat that apple! 'Cause if I do, I'd have to eat other fruit as well, and that includes bananas, which I </em>'hate<em>', so I won't eat that apple you're offering.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        An example that's a little more relevant to this wiki: <em>"Why did you delete my page about DaveDeeDozyBeakyMickAndTich? You have a page about </em>JimiHendrix here, so you should allow all pages about musicians!"<em>  (While the </em><a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a> approach would be: <em>"I'm gonna delete that </em>JimiHendrix page, 'cause if we allow it here, we'll have to allow all pages about musicians, including DaveDeeDozyBeakyMickAndTich, which we definitely <strong>don't</strong> want here."<em>) --</em><a href="AalbertTorsius.html">AalbertTorsius</a> 
        (If I've offended any DaveDeeDozyBeakyMickAndTich fans out there -- it's a tough world <strong>:)</strong> )
