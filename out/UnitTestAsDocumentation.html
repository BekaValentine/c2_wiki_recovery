        Unit Test As Documentation

        I suppose it might make sense to proceed like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Initial CRC card requirements gathering
        </li>
        <li>
           General agreement on a VERY high level design
        </li>
        <li>
           Pick a component to start coding
        </li>
        <li>
           Prioritize the requirements for the component
        </li>
        <li>
           Grab a handful of top priority items and write <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s for them
        </li>
        <li>
           Code them, test them, and iteratively add more
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Then when you have multiple components, write your <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s to test operation between components.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, you could look at your <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s as being good documentation of the requirements, and perhaps just a tad easier to read than the code itself.
      </p>

        Almost.  I think it should never be too difficult to extract the requirements from the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, but it seems to me that the <a href="CustomerTest.html">CustomerTest</a>s are much better as a documentation of requriements because they are designed to be potentially readable by a non-programmer, and because they are directly driven from the story cards.  <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s include a lot of testing of lower level processes that have no direct connection to the stories.
