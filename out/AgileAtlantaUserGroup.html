        Agile Atlanta (<a href="http://agileatlanta.org)">http://agileatlanta.org)</a> was founded in May 2001 as XP Atlanta. The group never was strictly about XP, and so they renamed themselves in October 2004.

        Here are some notable points in our history:

        Our Jan 2, 2002 meeting was a presentation by special guest <a href="FredGeorge.html">FredGeorge</a>.  <em>Great Objects -- Cornerstone for Successful XP Projects</em>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Our guest speaker for our May 7th, 2002 meeting was <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>. More than 220 Atlanta area engineers registered for this special event. The talk was interesting and entertaining.  Mr. Fowler discussed the contents of his upcoming book <a href="PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture.html">PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture</a>, focusing upon the use of three-tier layering and the trade-offs between the <a href="TransactionScript.html">TransactionScript</a>, <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>, and <a href="TableModule.html">TableModule</a> patterns.  He introduced us to the word <em>POJO (</em><a href="PlainOldJavaObject.html">PlainOldJavaObject</a>)<em>.  There wasn't much about XP though.  </em>
