        Feedback Should Be Free
      </h1>
      <p>
        That's why we write so many <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and we run them so often.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any worker who does not receive feedback constantly can not perform well, because his effort will deviate from what he really must achieve.

        [Excellent example, you just gave him free feedback. ;-) ]

        If feedback is not free, that is, if it takes time, effort and money to get feedback, then I will do my work without asking for feedback. I will just let my work rot and when feedback is ready (there will be feedback sooner or later) I will probably hate it. Feedback doesn't need to be human, <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are a form of feedback that is almost free, unless running your tests take more than 2 hours. In that case tests are too heavy and probably you feel like doing something else instead of running them.
