        Wow.  Three is a wonderful number.  So many possibilities.  Three Musketeers, Three Stooges.  Siggy Freud and Eric Berne's tripartite views of personality.  Father, Son and Holy Ghost. The list goes on and on. <em>(and on.) (Sorry, but the very </em><a href="RuleOfThree.html">RuleOfThree</a> you're citing compelled me to add that.)<em></em>

        I'm honored to be listed in the same breath with these giants of the field. And grateful for not being named "the ranter". -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Presumably, the term "The Three Extremos" is a reference to a 1986 comedic film named "The Three Amigos," starring Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Chevy Chase.  See <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0092086">http://us.imdb.com/Title?0092086</a> for more information.

        <em>Indirectly.  The </em><a href="ThreeAmigos.html">ThreeAmigos</a> was a reference and <a href="TheThreeExtremos.html">TheThreeExtremos</a> is a reference to that.<em></em>
