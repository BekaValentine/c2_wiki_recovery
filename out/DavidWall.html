        I'll probably never remember to update this, so I'll just point to my home page: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100905092612/http://ylatis.com/darkon/">http://web.archive.org/web/20100905092612/http://ylatis.com/darkon/</a> (which is itself very rarely updated :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to be confused with the numerous other David Walls out there, such as <a href="http://davidwall.com/.">http://davidwall.com/.</a> :-) My middle initial is K; I often go by the nick darkon.

        No relation to <a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a>, although I like using <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>.

        I've made a few minor additions to this wiki, but mostly unsigned. Those have largely been things such as adding or correcting links on the <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> page or fixing broken links to the <a href="JargonFile.html">JargonFile</a>. Lately I've been removing my signature from some of the signed places so people will feel free to refactor a page if they feel it necessary.

        Mostly I just read the wiki. There's a huge amount of interesting stuff here, and references to books I can read at leisure away from the monitor. Thanks, folks.
