        What is the value of this word "Normal" in the name?  I propose that we refactor the name, getting rid of the, IMHO unnecessary, "Normal" word. --<a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>

        I put "normal" in there for a couple of reasons.  When <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> has been applied in a code base, it can be said to be normalized.  The redundancy has been removed.  The other reason was to indicate that your code <em>should</em> hover around <a href="ExtremeNormalForm.html">ExtremeNormalForm</a> when you are doing XP.. developers should consider it to be the natural state of their code; deviations during development should be considered transitional.  -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, "normal" fits well because of the redundancy angle. The analogy with 
        relational databases also brings YAGNI to my mind: I've had to wrestle too 
        many times with databases that were "denormalized" for performance in the 
        <em>original</em> design!

      <p>
        <<See <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> for more on YAGNI>>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also the more general mathematical notion of normalization. That
        brings to my mind the two steps of <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>: you 
        make it work, then you refactor to renormalize the code. --<a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>

        I really liked Michael's earlier comment about "code that is in alignment with
        the customers' needs." The word 'alignment' definitely suggested to the hint
        of geometry that I would expect from something that is a "form." I also like
        how it reminds me of OrganizationalAgility. In this case, the code is what is
        agile and responsive (almost reactive), as well as being malleable and minimal
        (a "lean, mean, refactored machine" ;-) --<a href="BradAppleton.html">BradAppleton</a>

        I am interested in this, even thinking that it can never be carried out.  But getting even faintly on the road there will prove useful.  To proceed, the XP / C3 people should be so kind as to state, when they look at a piece of code, what they notice does not look quite right, and what they replace it with (perhaps you can just grab a couple of phrases from your next refactoring, this afternoon, change the names to protect the innocent, and post them).  Such a list of replacement heuristics declare a kind of cost metric to code phrases, and would be wonderful for people in the industry to stare at and argue over. --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Alistair - <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>'s been spending oodles of time documenting just what you describe in a book on Refactoring - due out sometime in '99.  He has a catalog of refactorings, naming these small steps folks take to clean up code and showing the before an after code.  Here's an example that will be familiar to many (a similar version is in Kent's book, as well as CODE COMPLETE):  <a href="http://www.industriallogic.com/papers/extractboolean.html">http://www.industriallogic.com/papers/extractboolean.html</a> --<a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>

        Thanks for the refs.  I still think anyone who wants to back XNF needs to fill out the list for XNF.  Will <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>'s book be the definition of XNF?  I tend to think not.  What I am interested in is, what do the XP people think XNF contains?
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with XNF, there should still be lots of different factorings that meet XNF.  I checked the Extract Boolean ref you put up there, and I would assert that, of Inline and Extracted, there are some rules of XNF that say that when Inline is the XNF, and when Extracted is.  I don't know what they are (and would like someone to at least take a stab at it - I think that will make for interesting and educational discussion)
      </p>
      <p>
        Once Martin's book is out, we can make a list: #33 is XNF, #34 is not required, etc.  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Martin's forthcoming book will help folks learn <em>part</em> of the process for getting to XNF (though he doesn't explicitly speak of XNF). He also compares many refactorings as in "I would typically use X here, but if such and such were the case I might go with Y and refactor using X later."

        The thing about refactoring is that it is pretty agnostic.  Many refactorings are natural inverses of each other..  PullUpMethod <-> PushDownMethod.  It seems you use them in the service of other goals.  For instance, if you want to keep all your classes small, you may end up using both PUM and PDM to get there.  The refactorings are the tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose that ENF could be defined quasi-mathematically: "the mean of the number of methods on classes shall be between 4 and 9, the standard deviation shall not exceed X.." Do you all really want to do that? It can be done, but there are two problems.  (1) quantifying it could make it a false goal; people could freak if they are not at measured ENF even if there are valid reasons for a bit of displacement.  The real issue is how well the code base adapts to change and how happy you can keep your customers.  (2) Some of it isn't measurable.  One item: is all the code as simple as it could be?  You can only tell that by asking everyone whether they've seen anything that can be made simpler.

        The <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s tell you that your code isn't in XNF. Refactor until there are no more smells. Then you are in XNF.

        I experimented with this with Profile/V (I did one-person experiments of everything in XP), a performance profiler I sold for Smalltalk/V. We had worked on it for a couple of years without much clean up. As part of my personal conversion to XP, I decided to clean it up. I refactored for a solid week. At the end of that time, I couldn't think of anything else I wanted to do to my code. That's XNF. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies that XNF is subjective. I go lots of places where they can't imagine what else to do with their code and I tell them 100 things. However, I suppose they don't know about the <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s. --<a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        I hold that XNF is (today) subjective, although I believe that there is some kind of mathematical function one is trying to minimize. We need a code metrics person to think about this.

        Something really doesn't sound right here. I like the Aikido analogy fine ... but I wonder whether it's the process, rather than the code, that achieves a normal form.

        What could this mean to a YAGNIfied, OAOOish, RegressionTestful piece of code? Well, if my requirements change, how do I know I need this code? Or if I get two different chunks of code, how do I know it's still OAOO? And if I get someone to modify it, how do I know their tests are adequate? Without an XNF process then XNF code is worth no more or less than any other code. It will tip ...

        Conversely, I may be called on to work on pre-existing code. Say I'm supposed to use a bunch of Microsoft components. Well, there's no YAGNI in <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a>. There's no OAOO. Regression tests? Well, maybe MS have got some, but they don't share 'em. Still the components look well factored and solid; I can trust them to do the work I need from them. What does it matter that they're not YAGNI/OAOO/Testful?

        Well, my take on all this is that the essence of <a href="ExtremeNormalForm.html">ExtremeNormalForm</a> is the requirement for <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.  However, <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> is not an absolute state.  It can have a numerical measurability ; the <em>granularity</em> of the <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.  I suggest that certain levels of granularity are more suitable for maintenance than others.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example consider the following "code" fragment:
      </p>
      <code>
        <em> </em>  define printHTMLHeader (title)<br/>
        <em> </em>  {<br/>
        <em> </em> <em>  </em>	print "<html>"<br/>
        <em> </em> <em>  </em>	print "<head>"<br/>
        <em> </em> <em>  </em>	print "<title>"<br/>
        <em> </em> <em>  </em>	print title<br/>
        <em> </em> <em>  </em>	print "</title>"<br/>
        <em> </em> <em>  </em>	print "</head>"<br/>
        <em> </em>  }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This seems fairly OAOO, but is it <em>completely</em> OAOO, and if not, by how much?

      <p>
        By simple text analysis I can see several duplicates.  The "print" command appears 6 times; so refactor:

        I think that's as far as I can go in this "little language", but the language constructs ("define", "{", "}", "return" etc.) still appear more than once.  The granularity of which I spoke earlier manifests in the size of the methods and the depth of the call stack.  At the start, the granularity was that of "printHTMLHeader", six statements and one level deep.  We can assume that the rest of the system never prints HTML header info without going through this function, so that is OAOO from the perspective of the rest of the system.  By the end of the process the method is one statement, but five levels deep.
      </p>
      <p>
        To my mind this tradeoff (method size and method depth) give a possible measure of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.  The extra dimension which leads to XNF is the requirement to minimise both of the variables. A system with a measured lower (average, total, typical?) size and depth is more <a href="ExtremeNormalForm.html">ExtremeNormalForm</a>.

           XNF is language dependent.  XNF for C or Smalltalk is different to XNF for assembler.

           In real world languages there is always a size/performance overhead.  The final example above is bigger and would probably run more slowly than the first.

        Donald Knuth talks about this in <em>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1</em> (page 187, Third Edition). His point is that replacing a portion of code with a subroutine invocation is not free; one must define the new subroutine and insert the proper subroutine invocation codes. The example above demonstrates that adding subroutines indiscriminately can greatly expand your program. (<a href="InlineMethod.html">InlineMethod</a> is also a <a href="RefactoringPattern.html">RefactoringPattern</a>, remember.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Knuth actually discusses the mathematical aspects of rewriting as a subroutine, and derives a rough equation for its cost when the language is MIXAL.

        To my mind, the question of determining whether or not the code contains duplications (particularly <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a>) is of very practical concern, and I have recently been prototyping utilities which attempt to find such instances. One of the more useful ones ranked duplicated strings by the product of their frequency and their length; this rank represented the number of characters consumed by all instances, and was thus an upper bound on how many characters could be removed by refactoring that particular string. A variation which was highly successful used the product of the frequency with the square of the length (reflecting a heightened interest in longer strings). 
      </p>
      <p>
        A truly useful version of this scheme would use an actual parser for the language in question and attempt to find duplicates or similar patterns in the parse tree rather than the raw characters of the input. Ideally it should notice larger-scale structure as well, such as if "foo.bar(some expression)" is always followed by ".baz()".

        After some re-reading, and getting back into the game, so to speak, I have this to offer on ENF, OAOO, and related topics:
      </p>
      <p>
        If I have an <a href="AtomicUnit.html">AtomicUnit</a> of code (say the sequence of print statements), it should not be refactored.  Of course, I leave the definition of <a href="AtomicUnit.html">AtomicUnit</a> to that page, but I see this as a singal task in the block.  <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> would be represented by removing logic from a Non<a href="AtomicUnit.html">AtomicUnit</a> that exactly mirrors the purpose of the <a href="AtomicUnit.html">AtomicUnit</a>.  the presence of suitable <a href="AtomicUnit.html">AtomicUnit</a>s in code should be one measure of both OAOO and ENF.  <a href="WyattMatthews.html">WyattMatthews</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The code is OnceAndOnlyOnceNormalForm when it has reached zero <a href="CodeChangeResistance.html">CodeChangeResistance</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I.e. the point of the normalization (rather than reaching some OAOO metric) is to minimize the amount of update inconsistencies arising when exercising maintenance or extending the code. Factorizations that do not change the <a href="CodeChangeResistance.html">CodeChangeResistance</a> are over-normalisations and should, IMO, be considered a violation of OAOONF. Standard refactorisations are the operations with which we move the code towards and away from OAOONF. The relational model has a very convenient small set of refactorisations - the XP set is much larger, which indicates that we'll need a much larger set of antipatterns to define OAOONF.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, define the causes of <a href="CodeChangeResistance.html">CodeChangeResistance</a> and we'll have OAOONF nailed down in no-time!
