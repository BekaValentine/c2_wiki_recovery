        Cascading Dialog Boxes Anti Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here's an example of the ShowTheUserOurPrivateObjectModelAndNothingElseAntiPattern. Suppose our private object
        model looks like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        [Root Object] 1---->0,1 [Tier Object] 1--->* [Leaf Objects]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The right way might be to present that in a UI is to show the Root,
        fields representing the Tier, and a list box with the Leafs. The
        last two segments are ghosted if the Tier does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The [presumptively] wrong way to manipulate this UI is to force the
        users to add bogus details to the Tier before they add a Leaf. The
        ultimately wrong way is to ghost the Add button on the list box, and
        give the users no clue they need to put something in the fields that
        we know represent the Tier first before the Leaf system becomes
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Right Way depends entirely on what <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> or <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> you need to render. If the story says they must add a Tier before adding a Leaf, so be it. But, following the rule that "The Actors in a Story are _Not_ the Objects in a Program", then the Right Way must be considered in isolation from the object model on the inside. This is exactly where user-involvement in GUI building is so totally important.
      </p>
      <p>
        We usually get the CDB when we take an entry-level programmer (maybe
        one who got the job by demonstrating the ability to run a GUI forms
        editor), and tell them to write a UI for this Object Model that
        someone else created. Then we tell them they are too junior and
        unimportant to be allowed to disturb the August User with their
        distastefully neophytic presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Junior now goes and, after a few days struggling with SDK example
        code that raises a blank frame window with a menu, makes a menu item
        raise a dialog that represents the Root. (Keep in mind that the
        blank white client area in the middle of this frame window will
        probably remain blank forever.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then they put a button on this dialog that says Tier, and this
        raises a dialog showing the Tier object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then (can you guess?) they put a button on that dialog that says
        Leaves, and this raises a dialog showing the list of Leaf objects!
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, in an ultimate fit of championship hacking, Junior puts a
        button on THAT dialog that raises a dialog showing a LEAF!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        (Obviously, along the way, these dialogs interact with global data
        structures that non-robustly parallel what's displayed, because in
        Junior's GUI classes in college they never told anyone that each
        dialog can remember its own private data chunk to support these
        kinds of problems. But they did teach global variables.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course you can get the CDBAP in many other ways, but you can
        always bet on the combination of no UI design, a junior GUI programmer
        at the helm, and no <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> involvement.

        <em>Not entirely an </em><a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> if the cardinality on the first relationship is not 1->0/1 but 1->*, as there are few ways to achieve all of this in <em>one</em> screen which are both usable and not unnecessarily complicated.  You also end up violating <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> and the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> if you try and map two one-to-many relationships with lots of associated data onto one screen.  Not to mention confusing the user when you suddenly take everything away from them for seemingly no apparent reason.<em></em>
