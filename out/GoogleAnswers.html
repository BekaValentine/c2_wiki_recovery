        Google Answers [<a href="http://answers.google.com]">http://answers.google.com]</a> is a "pay for research" service introduced by Google in April, 2002.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users register with an e-mail address, and are then free to post questions priced between $2 and $200, and are charged a 50 cent listing fee. Freelance Researchers will then choose among questions to provide answers. Users are given the option to rate the Researcher's work from one to five stars upon completion, and may also tip the Researcher if satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the work is unsatisfactory, users may apply for a full refund within thirty days of the answer posting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any registered user may leave comments on questions, but only Researchers may post official answers. Researchers are brought on from a carefully screened pool of applicants from all over the world. The service now claims over 500 Researchers.
