        Make It
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the <strong>best</strong> freely available build environment you'll ever see. It is part of OSE, which seems like a nice C++ package including a C++ library and a documentation extraction tool (similar to <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a>) in addition to the build environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is built upon <a href="GnuMake.html">GnuMake</a>, as a library of included makefiles and a few shell scripts. As such, it does not replace <em>make</em>, but rather supplement it with structure and easy-to-use small tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical fully-featured <a href="MakeIt.html">MakeIt</a> file for all sources in a directory is about 5 lines long, consisting of just one or two settings and a very small boilerplate. Overall, a good tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get <a href="MakeIt.html">MakeIt</a> at <a href="http://www.dscpl.com.au/.">http://www.dscpl.com.au/.</a>  It's inside the tarball for the entire OSE project.

        From <a href="RecursiveMakeConsideredHarmful.html">RecursiveMakeConsideredHarmful</a> (regarding <a href="MakeIt.html">MakeIt</a> documentation):
        <em>Yes, there is a postscript version. I've just added a link to it to the </em><a href="MakeIt.html">MakeIt</a> page.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Where did said link go?
