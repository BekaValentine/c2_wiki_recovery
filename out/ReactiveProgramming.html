        Reactive Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        Reactive Programming is a style of <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a> where changes in input values are propagated through a function call graph. This should be familiar to users of spreadsheets. This is naturally expressed in <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>, resulting in <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a>.

These aren't associated with 'changes to inputs', but rather to external discrete observations; however, the relationship is a close one.

        <a href="ObserverPattern.html">ObserverPattern</a> can be used to implement <a href="ReactiveProgramming.html">ReactiveProgramming</a>, but requires explicit caching, far too much <a href="SelfDiscipline.html">SelfDiscipline</a> and knowledge to avoid problematic <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s that bite you in the arse later. Most programmers screw up. (Related: <a href="DeprecatingTheObserverPattern.html">DeprecatingTheObserverPattern</a>)

        <a href="FlowBasedProgramming.html">FlowBasedProgramming</a> may also be leveraged into <a href="ReactiveProgramming.html">ReactiveProgramming</a>, but isn't ideally suitable for it.

        A new <a href="ReactiveProgramming.html">ReactiveProgramming</a> model is under development, called <a href="ReactiveDemandProgramming.html">ReactiveDemandProgramming</a>, supporting bi-directional communication of demands (making it more suitable for open modularity, constraint programming, distributed programming).
