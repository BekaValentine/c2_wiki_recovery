        Wireless Is The Successor Of Floppy
      </h1>
      <p>
        I think a WireLess technology (<a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a>, <a href="BlueTooth.html">BlueTooth</a> or thing like that) will be the successor of Floppy, as a common and easy way to share small files.
      </p>
      <p>
        I disagree, <a href="UsbKeychainDrive.html">UsbKeychainDrive</a> is the successor. Unless you want to compromise and admit the two will work together?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Short-range wireless like </em><a href="BlueTooth.html">BlueTooth</a> has the disadvantage that both devices have to be physically near each other; if they're not, you have to use a third, mobile device as an intermediary. That's the neat thing about the floppy disk: it's small enough to carry around conveniently and cheap enough to give to someone else to copy/use later without expecting them to return it. A <a href="UsbKeychainDrive.html">UsbKeychainDrive</a> fulfils the first function, but not yet the second.<em></em>

        Obsolete.  How much data is on a magnetic tape?  My Archos holds 20 GB, and doubles as a MP3 player.
        It fits in my shirt pocket.  If I want to move a lot of data, I put it on the Archos, stick it in
        my pocket, ride my bike or fly on an airplane (remember to take it out before I go through security!),
        and take it off on the other side.  Disk is so much better than tape.  My iBook has wireless, but its
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           GB disk is fairly full already, so I couldn't use it to transport a 10 GB file.  But my Archos has
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        only a few GB of MP3s on it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't know man, you can get 160 gb cartridges (uncompressed), and you cut fit a whole lot of 'em in a backpack.  As long as magnetic storage is prominent, tape storage will have a nice advantage:  stacking (how close can you get two platters before you can't fit anything between them?)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Wireless is cool.  And files of only a few meg are handled easily that way.
        But it is the disk that blows away the floppy.
      </p>
      <p>
        When will I buy a 1TB disk for $100?  Maybe before the end of 2006. Certainly before the end of 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
        [[December 9, 2007 update: An external 1 TB hard drive (with <a href="UniversalSerialBus.html">UniversalSerialBus</a> 2.0 and/or <a href="FireWire.html">FireWire</a> connectivity) will run you about $320-$360 at many electronics chain stores.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, your generic, run of the mill <a href="UsbKeychainDrive.html">UsbKeychainDrive</a> can be obtained in 1-8 GB capacities for $10-$15 per GB.
      </p>
      <p>
        For completeness, the prices of other media (per unit) are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           4.7 GB 4x DVD+RW: $1.00 - $1.50
        </li>
        <li>
           700 MB 24x CD-RW: $1.00 - $1.20
        </li>
        <li>
           4.7 GB 16x DVD-R: 50-60 cents
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>1.44 MB 3.5 inch floppy disk: 50 cents</strong> and I'm personally amazed you can still buy them!
        </li>
        <li>
           700 MB 52x CD-R: 30 cents]]
        </li>
      </ul>

        So, the modern equivalent is "Never underestimate the bandwidth of someone carrying
        a disk in her purse."  --<a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>

           It has lots of memory for small files, and I can vpn or ssh to servers for large ones. I have triband gprs via bluetooth so have access from most urban locations anywhere in the world where I would need files. I have wifi when at home, work and coffee shops. Though I can copy files directly with bluetooth I usually just email small files to myself with a password if needed send from a desktop at home and open it on the road with the pda or other computer at work. I can also copy to the handheld with a usb cable. Plus the pda does lots of other useful things I'm using <a href="WikiOnPda.html">WikiOnPda</a> and even <a href="ProgrammingOnHandHelds.html">ProgrammingOnHandHelds</a>. A usb dongle would be redundant and take up more pocket space for me.
