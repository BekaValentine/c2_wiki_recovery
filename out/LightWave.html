        Hmm, what is it they say about first loves? My first real experience with 3D graphics was <a href="LightWave.html">LightWave</a> on a Toaster4000. Since then, I've used numerous other programs, but <a href="LightWave.html">LightWave</a> still holds a special spot with me. Now, if only I could scrape up enough money to buy a copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is <a href="LightWave.html">LightWave</a> and what is a Toaster4000?
