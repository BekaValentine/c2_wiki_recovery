        Landmines Around Landmark Books
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am sick of the really bad patterns books that have been published in the last year.  Perhaps 1998 will be remembered as the year of the really bad patterns books.  Urrrrrrr, I hate these books that make people more ignorant, while continuing to water-down the really strong and wonderful things that brought me to patterns in the first place. Maybe it is time to start going public with some harsh criticisms so that bad, would-be authors will think twice before they attempt to write another landmine around the truly useful, landmark books.

        The best way to stop bad pattern books is to help editors help authors make good pattern books. If you are asked to review a substandard book you must help the publisher understand that delaying publication is necessary and can improve their return. If the authors misunderstand patterns then no amout of editing will save the book. Make that clear. Also, be clear about what you would expect the authors to do to save the book. For example ...

           Circulate patterns on the patterns list

           Convert the non-patterns to regular prose
