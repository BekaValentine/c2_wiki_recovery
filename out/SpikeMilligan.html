        <a href="SpikeMilligan.html">SpikeMilligan</a> passed away on Feb. 26, 2002. The last and funniest scion of the famous <a href="GoonShow.html">GoonShow</a>, Milligan went on to such glorious fancies as the Q series and several extremely silly and worthwhile books.

        Very sad, but I can't help thinking, <em>"Put him in the curry!"</em> ...

        I'm sure he'd like that. His own official obit, which he wrote himself a few years back, is at <a href="http://www.lovelyjane.btinternet.co.uk/Spike.htm.">http://www.lovelyjane.btinternet.co.uk/Spike.htm.</a> Rather cheers one up.

        He also decided on his epitaph before he died; it reads "I told you I was ill", and the Gaelic translation (<em>Duirt me leat go raibh me breoite</em>) appears on the headstone of his grave.
