        This book is amazing. It's driven by the idea that you should learn mathematics using geometric intuition and refer to rigorous proof only once you have a clear geometrical understanding of something. This idea is applied to the teaching of <a href="ComplexAnalysis.html">ComplexAnalysis</a>, and the result is miraculous. The book has many successes, like its derivation of e^z and its clear explanation of Cauchy integration. The one area where it falls down a little is in the geometric description of complex differentiation, the 'amplitwist'. I found the concept unclear and and not always helpful. That aside, it's still well worth reading.

        I'm not great at maths (<a href="MathIsHard.html">MathIsHard</a>) and have recurring problems with RealAnalysis, but this book gave me a genuine grasp of <a href="ComplexAnalysis.html">ComplexAnalysis</a>, and filled my head with pretty pictures to boot.

        Absolutely a landmark in mathematics instruction. I thought the amplitwist was not as intuitive as the "right-hand rule" I was taught, but the mapping of a complex line to a curve on a sphere was mind-blowing. <a href="ComplexNumbersArePoints.html">ComplexNumbersArePoints</a> indeed. -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

        It has 616 pages and its author recommends you also read <em>Mathematics and its History</em> [[ISBN 0387953361]- 568 pages], so allow plenty of time.
