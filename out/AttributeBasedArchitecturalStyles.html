        <strong>Attribute-Based Architectural Style (ABAS)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Attribute-Based Architectural Styles (ABASs) are architecture patterns that can be used as building blocks for designing <a href="SoftwareArchitecture.html">SoftwareArchitecture</a>s. ABASs build on ArchitecturalStyles (as defined by Shaw and Garlan and elaborated on by others) by explicitly associating a reasoning framework (whether qualitative or quantitative) with an <a href="ArchitecturalStyle.html">ArchitecturalStyle</a>. An <a href="ArchitecturalStyle.html">ArchitecturalStyle</a> is a description of component types and their topology, which includes a description of the pattern of data and control interaction among the components. Reasoning frameworks are based on <a href="QualityAttributes.html">QualityAttributes</a>-specific models, which exist in the various <a href="QualityAttributes.html">QualityAttributes</a> communities (such as the performance and reliability communities).
      </p>
      <p>
        The ABAS project at the <a href="SoftwareEngineeringInstitute.html">SoftwareEngineeringInstitute</a> focuses on formalizing and cataloging various <a href="ArchitecturalStyle.html">ArchitecturalStyle</a>s (aka Patterns). This project draws heavily on the work of the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> community in order to evaluate architectures. Read these pages for more information:

        Can anyone explain this stuff? It seems to be of no practical use at all. It's like talking about cars as if they had a speed attribute and thinking that actually meant anything.
