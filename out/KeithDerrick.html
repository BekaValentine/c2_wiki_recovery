        Yes, I'm still here, though not as often as I would like.

        I am a member of the <em>Association Of C and C++ Users</em> (ACCU). I can't form a suitable <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> from the acronym, so I'll use <a href="AssocCandCppUsers.html">AssocCandCppUsers</a> instead.

        I used to be a contract software engineer operating in the UK, specializing in whatever my clients wanted me to 8). After about 12 years of this, I finally gave in to one of the frequent offers to "go permie". The net result was a year commuting to the USA and finally moving there in 2000. Since then, I've sadly not really had any spare time for newsgroups or Wiki.

        I am finally getting back into the circles of conferences etc. after 3 years and am attending OOPSLA 2003 next month. I especially looking forward to the Workshop on Re-use in Constrained Environments.

        As for <a href="VbWiki.html">VbWiki</a>, I'll see if I can find it - though I have no web space to post it. I suspect there are much better implementations around nowadays.
