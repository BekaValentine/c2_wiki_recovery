        <em>Link doesn't work on OS X with Mozilla.  IE only? Windows only?</em> (Works ok in Mozilla WinXP, sounding like bad news for Mac guys) Not quite... it works in Mozilla if you don't care to see the video :)  I might be lying, but on my xp box, it works under IE after installing some WM9 codecs, and doesn't work under Mozilla (might start working if I reset mozilla, but I'd rather not do that)

        Quothe the man, <em> Every object sort of has a little mini language around it.</em>  <a href="ThankYou.html">ThankYou</a> for giving me a short sentence to finally put into words the feelings bouncing around in my head regarding how I feel about objects.
