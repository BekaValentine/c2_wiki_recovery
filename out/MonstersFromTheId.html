        Monsters From The Id
      </h1>
      <p>
        Been watching a certain Wiki contributor for the last few weeks. Reminds me of that old movie <a href="ForbiddenPlanet.html">ForbiddenPlanet</a>. What this person does is post <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> and without <a href="GoodStyle.html">GoodStyle</a> - generally <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> stuff. Then when various people object he accuses them of all being one person, and imagines that one person is some kind of monster hounding him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good example is FlamingPages. If you look at the <a href="PageHistory.html">PageHistory</a> you can see that no fewer than 4 different people had much the same reaction to this guy. Now if you look at his reaction you'll see he thinks there's someone out there with a million different IPs hounding him.

      <p>
        Yeah, but what else can we do with him? <em>Read </em><a href="MrId.html">MrId</a>.<em></em>

        <em>For the patient: continual gentle guidance.</em>
