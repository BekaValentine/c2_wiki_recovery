        There will be an Oceania qualifying rounds for the Toyota Denso Cup held in Brisbane during the 2006 Australia day long weekend. And like the previous event held two years ago, professional players will be around for a bit of free tutoring as well. You can have some fun, free quality tee-shirt and more (last time there was a very good dinner at river front venue). Follow the link at <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ToyotaDensoCup">http://senseis.xmp.net/?ToyotaDensoCup</a> if you think you deserve a free expense paid trip to Japan as a champion of that hobbyist competition.
