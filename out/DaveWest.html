        Five years ago Dave moved to New Mexico Highlands University to start a new kind of software development program.  Finally, this fall that program has started.  It is an apprenticeship program (students get paid for working on real projects for real customers), competency instead of course based, highly agile - both in how the class is organized and the way we teach people to develop software, very very people centric - recognizing that both users and developers are people first.  <a href="http://www.nmhu.edu/softwaredevelopment">http://www.nmhu.edu/softwaredevelopment</a>  has further information about this program.
