        Not a type of dice, but a way of using them. Roll as normal, but if a maximum is rolled (eg a 6 on a D6), roll again and add the score to the six scored on the first roll. The second roll usually follows the same rule, allowing chains of rerolls; in this case, there is no upper bound to the possible score, although getting huge rolls is extremely unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example (using a D6), Alice rolls a five; she scores five. Bob rolls a six; he rerolls, gets a two, and scores eight. Charles rolls a six, rerolls another six, rererolls yet another six, and then rolls a three; he scores 21. Charles is then lynched.

        The point of all this is to augment normal (closed) dice with a small possibility of a huge score. This is congruent with the fantastic/heroic/comic-book aspect of many <a href="RolePlayingGame.html">RolePlayingGame</a>s.

      <p>
        Note that <a href="OpenEndedDice.html">OpenEndedDice</a> as described above can never score a multiple of the maximum.

        <em>Mmm... 6-sided die.  1-5 are 1-5.  5 also means reroll and add.  6 is zero.</em>

        Good point. Alternatively, map each number N onto N-1, or repaint your dice with 0-5. It's even easier with a D10 - one of the faces is already zero. However, i don't think (but could be wrong) that this is how <a href="OpenEndedDice.html">OpenEndedDice</a> usually work.
