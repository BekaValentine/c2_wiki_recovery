        I'm not too much into the personal bio thing.  I believe that my thoughts and feelings more adequately tell someone who I am, as opposed to where I've lived or what I've done.

           There are two forms of Christianity.  I used to call them Liberal and Conservative, but MarcusBorg calls them SupernaturalTheism and PanEnTheism.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Supernatural Theism is the God of ChristenDom, and served well from the 16th century to earlier this century, culminating with FundamentalIsm, a set of beliefs that came about at the turn of the 20th c.  Panentheism is God as the encompassing Spirit; everything, including us, are <em>in</em> God, and God is <em>in</em> everything. This concept was brought into thinking originally by <a href="AlfredNorthWhitehead.html">AlfredNorthWhitehead</a>, and later others.
      </p>
      <p>
        For many, including myself, we were raised with the God of Supernatural Theism, explored DeIsm, and came out with either AtheIsm or PanEnTheism.

        We are in a global economic downturn, which of course began in the fall of 1997 in the East.  It is of course, inevitable, predicted more than once by John Kenneth Galbraith.  The timing was always unclear, as large monies were able to create 'paper' wealth that artificially held up the global economy.  The question for the present is whether the artificial economy is sufficient enough to keep the recession minor, or whether because of its size it will take a larger and longer fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        George W. Bush does not seem to have done much for the United States in the economic realm.  Rather, he may have forestalled a deepening recession with the contracts for the War against Terrorism (ie--Iraq) and may continue to try to do so by continuing warfare against others, and hence stay in a state of aggression.  Ultimately, this is hurting the american economy, and will worsen the global economy because its last stable player is no longer so.  It remains to be seen whether the EEC can rise quickly enough to help keep the collapse from continuing.

        Update: I wrote the above paragraph about George W. before the beginning of the war in 2003.  I regret to say it was prescient.

           Cognitive studies have led <a href="GeorgeLakoff.html">GeorgeLakoff</a> to understand that there are two basic worldviews in America, Progressive and Conservative, and two metaphors control them, the nurturant parent versus the strict father.  My nurturant faith and the teachings of Jesus, and the movers of many world religions put me firmly on the progressive side.  What Lakoff has done is help me understand this better.

        Dale, I loved "The Genesis Question," Hugh Ross (can find at: <a href="http://www.reasons.org">http://www.reasons.org</a> )
        and "A Case for Christ," Lee Strobel (find at any book store)
        <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Genesis Question was quite an interesting read, but, ultimately, falls short in the light of the best scienctific hypotheses.  The first 11 chapters of Genesis, having multiple authors from more than one tradition, is a metaphorical compilation of stories, where the meaning is what is important, not fact.
