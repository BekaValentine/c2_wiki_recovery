        Cee Shanty
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sea shanties and other work songs seem to be natural for filking.  A good example is "White Collar Holler".  I've been setting some of my own own CeeFaring adventures to my favorite shanties.  I'll update this page as the lyrics become more fully baked.  Feel free to contribute suggestions; that's what folk singing is all about! -- <a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a>

        Well, I rise up every morning at a quarter to eight<br/>
        Some woman who's my wife tells me not to be late<br/>
        I kiss the kids goodbye, I can't remember their names<br/>
        And week after week, it's always the same<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        And it's Ho, boys, can't you code it, [huunh] and program it right<br/>
        Nothing ever happens in the life of mine<br/>
        I'm hauling up the data on the Xerox line<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Then it's code in the data, give the keyboard a punch<br/>
        Then cross-correlate and break for some lunch<br/>
        Correlate, tabulate, process and screen<br/>
        Program, printout, regress to the mean<br/>

        [Chorus]<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Then it's home again, eat again, watch some TV<br/>
        Make love to my woman at ten-fifty-three<br/>
        I dream the same dream when I'm sleeping at night<br/>
        I'm soaring over hills like an eagle in flight<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        [Chorus]<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Someday I'm gonna give up all the buttons and things<br/>
        I'll punch that time clock till it can't ring<br/>
        Burn up my necktie and set myself free<br/>
        Cause no'one's gonna fold, bend or mutilate me<br/>
