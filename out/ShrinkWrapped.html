        Many people have expressed concerns about the terms of the SoftwareLicense associated with <a href="ShrinkWrapped.html">ShrinkWrapped</a> software.  Unlike most purchased products, where you own and are responsible for what you have paid your hard-earned dollars for, manufacturers of software believe that they can bind you to certain UseRestrictions by putting words in ink on the outside of a box containing software.
