        Couldn't agree more that this is a disgusting practice, especially if you throw in documenting all callers/callees of the function. One thing that's interesting to note though is that sometimes people use formatting conventions which look cumbersome to the casual observer, but are, in fact, well supported in the author's editor of choice. Examples are aligning all the = signs in initialized variable declarations, aligning inline comments at a certain column, etc. -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>

        I once worked on a project where you had to add this huge comment template to the front of every function. The net result was that people would pile more and more code into a single function. They were reluctant to start a new function.
      </p>
      <p>
        I complained to my <a href="ProjectManager.html">ProjectManager</a> that this was leading to bad code. We came up with a compromise - the <em>small function header</em> - a lightweight template for small functions. Result: happier engineers and more code reuse.

        Another war story.  One company I worked for required a function header for every function in the corporate coding standard.  The result was the header template was dutifully copied and place in front of every function.  The template was rarely filled in; a vast majority of the function headers were merely the empty template, but we could claim compliance.

        <em>I've always found that you need to play that game with javadoc, because your documentation output ends up looking ugly if you don't state the obvious. I'm guilty of writing horribly redundant stuff like that in classes that I expect to be very user-visible. -- </em><a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a><em></em>

        As a C/C++ programmer, I've always wondered about <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a>.  It seems to require a lot of work to recreate the header files that were so reviled in C.  With modern IDEs that can pull function declarations directly from the source code, I do not see the continued value of either C header files nor of <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> inline header commands.

        As always, if you need a comment, the code isn't sufficiently simple enough. Corollary: If you don't understand it without a comment, I won't understand it at all. Function headers were/are mandated because the system spiraled out of control. People wanted to know callers and callees and side effects because they lost track of what was going on. So, they didn't understand the code that they themselves wrote. Their solution was to comment more. It doesn't help. A better solution would have been to simplify the code. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        <em>Even though using </em><a href="MassiveFunctionHeaders.html">MassiveFunctionHeaders</a> is a bad idea, <a href="SmallFunctionHeaders.html">SmallFunctionHeaders</a> may be necessary. Simplifying the code is a good idea for inline comments, but I have still not found <em>any</em> code that is simple enough to understand at high level without comments.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why should code be not understandable without comments? I have found it to be quite true that comments, documenting workarounds due to bad APIs from third party software, are an indicator of code that needs improvement.  Even <a href="SmallFunctionHeaders.html">SmallFunctionHeaders</a> get in the way of creating small functions (a necessity in eliminating comments). -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

      <p>
        <em>I remove all code too, because it is often wrong and therefore I can't trust it. Much cleaner result.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But when the code is wrong, it will become evident through a bug or a failed unit test. You know what to fix. An incorrect comment is noise at best, and misleading at worst. I'd reserve comments expressly for when a piece of code <em>does not</em> do what it seems to (due to a bad API, or what have you). -- <a href="WilliamUnderwood.html">WilliamUnderwood</a>

        When you write a function header to document your function, keeping in mind that the probable user is someone who never took part in the development, you should not explain why the code does, but how to use it. Then you never write extra stuff. <strong>Example:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        If the class was found using the above steps, and the <em>resolve</em> flag is true, <br/>
        this method will then invoke the resolveClass(Class) method on the resulting Class object.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The good point of this example is that the resolve flag is an argument of the method. The bad point is that it explains it in the Method's Javadoc, leaving the param tag to:
      </p>
      <code>
        @param resolve If true then resolve the class<br/>
