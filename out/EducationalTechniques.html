        Educational Techniques
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page discusses various contemporary educational techniques commonly used by computer science professors. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Book Reading - This is where a professor will read you a book for 1 hour a day, several days a week for an entire semester. You touchingly recall when your mom used to read you bed time stories.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Duality Rule - In this case, the professor will operate on two mutually exclusive levels:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Lectures
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Assignments
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Proxy Method - This is an administrative technique in which students are taught by other students (usually foreign grad students). These courses are often challenging, both linguistically and emotionally.  
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The Discussion Method - This is where students stare blankly at each other while the professor asks them to discuss the material "they read last night."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Lab Method - This is where professors make the labs so hard that they have as much extra credit labs as regular labs and the brightest student in the class gets a 174% in the class while about a quarter of the class actually shows up for lab and really does them at 5 am the day before they're due.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>
          My preferred method of education is that of full immersion into a computer driven learning system which is able to push the student only if he/she is able to comprehend the material and provide active feedback. The "system" would consist of the following main components.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Computer
        </li>
        <li>
           Large touchscreen plasma monitors 
        </li>
        <li>
           interactive web tablet (wireless)
        </li>
        <li>
           complex interactive software
        </li>
        <li>
           nation database to update course material
        </li>
      </ol>
