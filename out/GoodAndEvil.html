        Good And Evil

      <p>
        What is Good and Evil?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To act selfishly or unselfishly?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To act according to YourReligion or against?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To be Cruel or Kind?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Evil is taking advantage of another person for your own benefit. Good is sacrificing yourself for the benefit of another.</em> -- Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church).">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church).</a>

        So it's ok to take advantage of people for someone else's benefit?
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Probably not, because it would be evil for the beneficiary to take advantage like that. Moreover, if a group or one member of it takes advantage of a non-member, this is evil on the group level. Same for racial-level or national-level. So I'd say, just to be on the safe side, don't take advantage of other people but try to benefit them. -- <a href="EdPoor.html">EdPoor</a></dd>

        Clever is making everyone think you are sacrificing when you are really taking advantage. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        <em>Evil is treating people as things - Granny Weatherwax (</em><a href="TerryPratchett.html">TerryPratchett</a>). Pretty close, IMO<em></em>

        A misquote - it's his (excellent) definition of <em>sin</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another good definition of "sin" comes from <a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a> via <a href="LazarusLong.html">LazarusLong</a>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Sin lies only in hurting other people unnecessarily. All other 'sins' are invented nonsense. (Hurting yourself is not sinful - just stupid)."</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        I would extend this further to say that "evil" is <em>knowingly, intentionally</em> acting in a sinful manner. -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Heinlein's quote begs the question. When is hurting someone necessary or unnecessary?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hurting someone could be necessary if you're acting in self-defense - the only way to stop them from hurting you is to hurt them. That's not a sin, so long as it really was the last resort.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This too has problems: if someone is throwing pebbles at you, are you justified in knocking them about? If it causes serious injury? Permanent? Where is the line drawn?
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Heinlein, it depends on whether it was <em>necessary</em> to knock them down. <em>Necessary according to who? Heinlein has some good ideas, but he never was much of a philosopher...</em>

        Is "good and "evil" the sum of our species experiences and knowledge? Would two babies on an island contemplate good and evil without a teacher? -- <a href="PeteBook.html">PeteBook</a>

      <p>
        <em>They will not survive without a teacher.</em>

        Not good tests: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You do something you consider good and everybody around you or involved in the doing are happy with how things came out.
        </li>
        <li>
           You do something you consider good or evil and someone agrees with you.
        </li>
      </ul>
