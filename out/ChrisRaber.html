        I just took a job at Mercury Interactive as a Systems Engineer. Mercury was purchased by HPSoftware which is where I am now.

        Prior to that I was at <a href="WebMethods.html">WebMethods</a>, <a href="AvantGo.html">AvantGo</a> and <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>.

        My technology focus is object oriented and distributed computing. If I had my choice I'd rather play Hockey, but you got to make a buck some how...
