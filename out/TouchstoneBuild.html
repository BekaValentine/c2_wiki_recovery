        Touchstone Build
      </h1>
      <p>
        An application/script demonstrating bugs in the product, and possibly also how to use the product. It is intended that users edit the application/script in order to demonstrate the bug to developers - it is a form of <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a> <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example might be that you are building a library for use in an application. A sample application is often built to demonstrate how to use the library, but the 'touchstone' concept takes this as a starting point, and lets users submit patches to the application to show off bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is similar in concept to automating <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s, but it is not required that the actual test is automatable, only the demonstration of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term comes from <a href="ApacheMaven.html">ApacheMaven</a>, <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-turbine-maven/src/test/touchstone-build/,">http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-turbine-maven/src/test/touchstone-build/,</a> but other examples have been seen. Touchstone can mean "a basis for comparison; a reference point against which other things can be evaluated".
