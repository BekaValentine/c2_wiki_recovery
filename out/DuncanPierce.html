        I am one of the founders of Amarinda - a process optimization company offering our experience of XP and agile
        methods to UK companies.  I am ex-Connextra (long-running UK XP team) and have worked as an XP trainer, consultant and coach for some time.  I'm one of the founding members of the UK's XP Day conferences, and a long-standing XTC member (the London-based XP interest / beer-drinking group).
