        <strong>Dual-use Result</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In string and array "find" functions which return a position number, 1-based can return zero (0) if the item was not found in the array or string. This won't work for zero based because zero is a real position. Some zero-based languages return something equivalent to nil or null, but I've found such awkward (<a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a>) and non-intuitive. Null/nil flags are hard to debug and non-WYSIWYG. Zero-based can also return say "-1", but that's awkward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How is -1 "awkward" as an 'item not found' indicator but 0 isn't?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It just strikes me as unnatural. Another reason is that if the language uses/interprets zero for FALSE, then it can more easily be part of a conditional:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (! find("foo", myThing)) {<br/>
        print("Not found.");<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Versus:  
      </p>
      <code>
        if (find("foo", myThing) == -1) {<br/>
        print("Not found.");<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Better is...</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        if (find("foo", myThing) == NOT_FOUND) {<br/>
        print("Not found.");<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>...which works with NOT_FOUND defined as -1.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Still longer, and more dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More readable; one dependency.</em>
      </p>

        {<a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a> has the === and !== operators that test type in addition to value, so FALSE == 0 but FALSE !== 0}

        A risky visual and conceptual hack in my opinion. (I'm partial to systems and conventions that don't rely on a "hidden" "type tag", at least for dynamic languages. I prefer "WYSIWYG typing" or "tag free". [Insert topic link when found].)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So-called "dynamic" languages are frequently rife with abominations.  Few popular languages are as muddled as </em><a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Agreed. I consider flag-free to be a <a href="LiberatingConstraint.html">LiberatingConstraint</a> to simplify dynamic typing model. I'll live with the few drawbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What's a "flag-free"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, I meant "tag-free". I used to use "flag", but others here preferred "tag" and I concurred.

        <em>Of course, if you have a language with sum types, then you return "nat option" and don't have this confusion...</em>

        <strong>Closer to End-User</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The end-user will almost always want any displayed counting or itemizing starting at "1". If the internals match this, then less conversion is required between the internals and the end-user side, reducing the code size and conceptual translation steps to inspect, verify, and debug.

        When you numbering, you go 1-2-3, not 0-1-2!  
        To use the second you are in effect saying you are not here, you are the first, then you are the second! 
      </p>

           what is the zero row and the zero column?
        </li>
        <li>
           there is a difference between numbering and a number system. Zero is merely that position marking the boundary between positive and negative numbers. 
        </li>
        <li>
           you can say I have "no" apples, but that is not a count, it is an absence of a count! 
        </li>
