        I am thinking here about <a href="DoingStuff.html">DoingStuff</a>, not ThinkingStuff!
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to exposing a program I have written, which I find useful, including source, for all to see, so someone or somebody else, might also find uses for it. ("Every thing we do need not bring us "fame" or "fortune". Some things we do might satisfy a "feeling" when we have that something "given away", especially to many, something, that we will "enrich" others!)

        [<a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> did something like this when he invented and then presented "Wiki" to the world for use and for adoption and adaptation. He is now presenting a new tool for knowledge proliferation called the "<a href="SmallestFederatedWiki.html">SmallestFederatedWiki</a>". Who knows if or when it will also become widely adopted and experience several "adaptations" which will expand its user-fullness.]

        I think this is a good idea. Perhaps I should start "<a href="DoingStuff.html">DoingStuff</a>" and "<a href="DoingOutLoud.html">DoingOutLoud</a>". I can make time for it, and can do it, so <a href="WhyNot.html">WhyNot</a>!
