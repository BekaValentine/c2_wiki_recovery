        I am interested in patterns in requirements (in areas other than software). <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>'s work in architecture and town planning inspired the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a>'s work in software - why assume it should stop there?

        Software engineers include some fairly bright people - and in eliciting software requirements, you have to acquire a passing acquaintance with other domains of expertise. Each time you do that, you bring a fresh perspective to a new domain. Your naive questions can revolutionise the way your customers do their business <em>because you lack their preconceptions about what's impossible</em>. What I'm proposing may be a bit far-fetched, but it <em>might</em> just work. And TRIZ (<a href="TheoryOfInventiveProblemSolving.html">TheoryOfInventiveProblemSolving</a>) is a bag of tools that are fun to learn and might just help you make that breakthrough.

        I am also interested in OOP: first in C++, now in Java.
