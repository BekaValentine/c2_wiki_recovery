        I'm a computer programmer and have been since I graduated from <a href="CarnegieMellonUniversity.html">CarnegieMellonUniversity</a>, where I met a number of really interesting people and learned a lot of interesting stuff which I have since forgotten. I then went into programming in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, got <a href="LaidOff.html">LaidOff</a>, learned <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>, and since then have been stuffing all sorts of computing stuff into my head.
      </p>

        I'm interested in learning more about Patterns and other parts of <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>, which is how I found this. Recently I've been learning more about <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> and <a href="UnitTests.html">UnitTests</a>. I think they are quite keen.

        My current project is to create a program to allow me to better run conventions. Work continues slowly.
