        Oral Tradition
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You want information about your project to be shared amongst team members
        </li>
        <li>
           You don't want written documentation (see <a href="ProblemsWithDocumentation.html">ProblemsWithDocumentation</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Technique:</strong> Share information orally.  Establish a culture in which people communicate frequently and are willing to ask others to explain things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Forces:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All members of the team must have regular contact with each other.
        </li>
        <li>
           Newcomers will require a lot of individual help to get up to speed.
        </li>
        <li>
           The information won't survive if the entire team leaves.
        </li>
        <li>
           This technique may only work when everybody works in the same room.  My successes with it seem to have been partly because people could easily overhear others' conversations.  I haven't pushed the limits and seen where it fails, though.  --<a href="JimLittle.html">JimLittle</a>

        <strong>Concerns:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Oral explanation can be difficult for some people, physically or psychologically.  Some people simply can't explain things well, or have a severe speech impediment.
        </li>
        <li>
           In a socially broken environment, people may hoard important information that they'd otherwise be forced to write down.
        </li>
        <li>
           Oral storytelling requires that the story be re-told many times, which can introduce error, while a physical document needs to be written only once, and can be refactored.  The oral tradition might be compared with requiring each person who edits a Wiki page to re-write the entire page from memory every time they edit it.
        </li>
        <li>
           The team may have difficulty migrating to the oral tradition due to the oral tradition's lack of defined process.  This is not a problem with the oral tradition itself, but it is a factor in its adoption.
        </li>
        <li>
           Oral explanation requires at least 2 people who must be in constant contact, and most shops have enough deadline crunches that this can be difficult to arrange
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Alternatives</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use a <a href="ProjectWiki.html">ProjectWiki</a> or <a href="TeamWiki.html">TeamWiki</a> to capture information that would otherwise be <a href="OralTradition.html">OralTradition</a>.  This addresses several of the resulting forces and concerns above:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Newcomers can use it to get up to speed without requiring such a lot of individual help.
            </li>
            <li>
               The information will survive if the entire team leaves.
            </li>
            <li>
               This technique can work when everybody doesn't work in the same room (or the same time zone). (See discussion at <a href="TeamWiki.html">TeamWiki</a>.)
            </li>
            <li>
               Explanation does not require 2 people to be in constant contact: a question can be posed, the explanation Wiki'd, and the Wiki page read, at separate times.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
