        Frank Carver
      </h1>
      <p>
        Frank Carver is a software engineer currently living in Ipswich, England.  he has done a variety of other work, though, including three years in the Royal Navy and work as a lifeguard at various swimming pools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frank has been designing and writing software since about 1978, when he was introduced to BASIC on an ICL minicomputer and a Commodore PET.  He spent some time writing FORTRAN, APL, BCPL and CORAL on a Xerox Sigma-6.  He then went to the University of Warwick to study Computer Systems Engineering where he immersed himself in Pascal, C and the new C++ as well the early days of net news.  Imagine, it was possible for one person (if dedicated) to actually read <em>all</em> of a days net news.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a series of computer related employment he now runs a small but successful consultancy (see <a href="http://www.efsol.com/)">http://www.efsol.com/)</a> mainly servicing BT Labs at Martlesham Heath. BT Labs has now been renamed (at great cost, I'm sure) "Adastral Park".  It's still the same site where a large part of British telecom's computer R&D takes place though. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Frank's top skills include Object-Oriented design and programming in Java and C++.

        (which may also be found as <a href="StressFreeProgramming.html">StressFreeProgramming</a> here on Wiki) and the <a href="FrikiServlet.html">FrikiServlet</a> very simple Java Wiki.  Frank is also an active moderator and participant at the Java Ranch ( <a href="http://www.javaranch.com/">http://www.javaranch.com/</a> ), and teaches computer courses to teenagers at Suffolk College ( <a href="http://www.suffolk.ac.uk">http://www.suffolk.ac.uk</a> ).  As part of his study and teaching at the college he is in the process of building and expanding a repository of his experience and materials at <a href="http://www.education-pages.co.uk/">http://www.education-pages.co.uk/</a> .
