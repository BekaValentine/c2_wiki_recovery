        Earl Jenkins is a character from a Smallville episode. He moves really fast, and young Superman seems to be allergic to him. Bummer for Clark Kent (not <a href="ClarkKent.html">ClarkKent</a>).

        I don't come here often-- I am pretty much exclusively a writer so I don't have much to contribute-- but I felt the need to privately comment on your private comment. Looking back, no that comment was not an example of my best writing. You will be pleased, or perhaps relieved, to know that the way I write on the web is considerably more sloppy than the way I write in real life or the way I would write a technical document. You are right though. Being that I tout myself as actually having some clue about writing, I really should realize that I can't let these things fall by the wayside after hours. Would a big Mea Culpa and a major re-write redeem me somewhat?
