        Extend To Implement Interfaces
      </h1>
      <p>
        It is certainly a good technique to define separate interfaces for separate groups of clients, as <a href="RobertMartin.html">RobertMartin</a> has described in "The <a href="InterfaceSegregationPrinciple.html">InterfaceSegregationPrinciple</a>" in the August '96 issue of <a href="CppReport.html">CppReport</a> (<a href="http://www.sigs.com/publications/docs/cppr/9608/cppr9608.toc.html).">http://www.sigs.com/publications/docs/cppr/9608/cppr9608.toc.html).</a> Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that a useful class was already written without using this technique, and actually has many disparate methods, only some of which are meaningful for certain clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Java, it turns out that you can remedy this situation without touching the original class - something very useful when that class is part of a commercial library.
      </p>
      <p>
        All you need to do is define an interface which specifies only those methods of interest, and extend the original class to a subclass with no implementation - but which states that it implements the interface.  The resultant class can then be passed to clients expecting your interface, thus effectively decoupling them from the library class.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        interface SoundPlayer {<br/>
        void play( URL url );<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public class MyApplet extends Applet implements SoundPlayer ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now MyApplet may be passed to a class that just wants to play sounds, without knowing about Applet.

        Cool.  A Facade done using interfaces.

        Actually, I think this would be an adapter not a Facade

        A few students of mine recently took this idiom off in a different, but interesting direction.  They were programming with <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> from <a href="ObjectDesign.html">ObjectDesign</a>, an OODBMS that has a Java connection.  Their problem was this -- they had many places in their code that used Vectors -- unfortunately <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> requires that instead of using a Vector in a persistent class you must use a class they provide, called OSVector.  This class implements all of the methods of Vector, but is not polymorphically substitutable for Vector. Well, my students didn't want to be hard-coding all of this database-dependent code into their domain classes; they might, after all, switch database vendors at some time.

        So what they did was define a new interface (let's call it Vectorish).  They then used <a href="ExtendToImplementInterfaces.html">ExtendToImplementInterfaces</a> to make a subclass of Vector, which overrode no methods, and a subclass of OSVector, which overrode no methods, both of which implemented Vectorish.  They then used <a href="UseFactoriesToBuildObjects.html">UseFactoriesToBuildObjects</a> to create instances of the appropriate subclass whenever they needed something.  Very slick -- almost a use of the <a href="ShieldPattern.html">ShieldPattern</a>.

        Very interesting approach.  A while back I was very keen on <a href="InterfacesShouldBeAdjectives.html">InterfacesShouldBeAdjectives</a> until I saw <a href="DontDistinguishBetweenClassesAndInterfaces.html">DontDistinguishBetweenClassesAndInterfaces</a>.  The argument against adjectival naming there was more or less that it introduces new abstraction and <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.  What we are seeing here is that something like "Vectorness" is an emergent abstraction that comes specifically from the fact that we don't care whether something is-a Vector all we care about is whether it behaves like one.  This is particularly important in cases like the last one where different libraries are being used.  In this sense, I see adjectival naming , which gets at the qualities and capabilities of classes of objects as more versatile than the traditional noun-based names.  Sure enough, you can do the same work with a made up noun-phrase, but I find the adjectival phrases more appropriate although they do not sound natural yet (perhaps because of a lack of widespread use). -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>
