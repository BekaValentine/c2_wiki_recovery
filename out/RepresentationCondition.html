        Representation Condition
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="RepresentationCondition.html">RepresentationCondition</a> of measurement asserts that a measurement must map <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> entities into numbers and empirical <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> relations into numerical relations in such a way that the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> relations preserve and are preserved by the numerical relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, your numerical model must always make sense in terms of the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> model it is attempting to describe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: 
        LOC satisfies the <a href="RepresentationCondition.html">RepresentationCondition</a> for physical program size but it doesn't for functional program size because you can have a poorly written program with more LOC but same or less functionality and vice versa.

        The funny thing is that this concept arose to remind people that metrics should  be actually related to reality.  <a href="CommonSenseIsnt.html">CommonSenseIsnt</a>
