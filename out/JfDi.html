        JFDI is the abbreviation for <strong>Just F***ing Do It</strong>, and a phrase that people are liable to yell when they find their co-workers trapping them in <a href="AnalysisParalysis.html">AnalysisParalysis</a>. It can be used as a verb, as in: "Why don't you stop spouting hot air and JFDI?" or a noun, as in "I think I'm going to apply some JFDI with this one."
