        Questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1 When considering a "facade" as a simplified interface to a system, why not call it an InterfacePattern?
        </li>
        <li>
           2 Isn't there a separation of concerns associated with what you can see externally (dashboard, keyboard, screen, button), and what you can do with what you can see (and touch)?
        </li>
        <li>
           3 Doesn't a facade "hide" or cover certain of its features and capabilities?
        </li>
        <li>
           4 Isn't it possible in a facade to mis-represent (on-purpose) such that it is something completely different from what it appears (as used in mal-ware emails)? Such that a mis-direction occurs? (Who would think a <a href="TarDis.html">TarDis</a> as it appears could take you forward or reverse in time?)

           1 <em></em>InterfacePattern isn't one of the GoF patterns.<em></em>
        </li>

           2 <em>A </em><a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a> could be used to facilitate <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           3 <em>Not necessarily.  All features and capabilities may be exposed, but instead of being distributed over multiple classes, they are accessed through the single facade class.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           4 <em>In the context of OO design patterns, such a mis-direction wouldn't be a design pattern per se.  It would be a security issue.</em>
