        Have the technical leads bring in their developers. Move all the cards to one side of the board, representing "high risk". Any developer who is confident that they can readily complete the software to fulfill the story, without having to learn anything new or to break a sweat, can move the card almost all the way to the other, "low risk" end of the board. (The far end of the board, "zero risk", is empty so far. Zero risk of development failure means that you've completed the software that passes the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, and the user agrees that the software meets the requirement. Eventually all the cards for this release will be moved over there.) Any developer who thinks they can probably learn what is needed and do the job without too much trouble can move a card to the "medium risk" section.

        This sounds like a great addition to <a href="ExtremePlanning.html">ExtremePlanning</a> for high risk or single iteration projects with budgeting constraints.
