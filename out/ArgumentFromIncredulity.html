        Argument From Incredulity
      </h1>
      <p>
        It must be true because I can't believe any alternative is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also known as the divine argument - I can't think of any other explanation, so God did it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this were the person's only reason for saying God did it, I would have to agree with you.  Some people, though, say God did it because they've analyzed (sp?) the alternatives and found them lacking, but that would be a discussion suitable for a different page!  <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>
