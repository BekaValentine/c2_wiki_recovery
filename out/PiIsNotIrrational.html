        Pi Is Not Irrational
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Proposal:</strong> Irrational numbers are not necessary to describe real-world empirical matters, like "How much concrete do I need to pour this traffic circle?" Let's explore this idea and see where it leads.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a wide range of calculated quantities we might call "practical pi", or "pi-in-hand". All of these are rational. One could make similar observations about "practical root 2", "practical e", and so on.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Does the fact that we don't use irrational numbers in real-world empirical measurements mean that we can never use any results from RealAnalysis?

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="NonStandardAnalysis.html">NonStandardAnalysis</a> is working with systems that actually contain infinite quantities, as opposed to <a href="StandardAnalysis.html">StandardAnalysis</a> which is approaching them via epsilon-delta limits.

           <em>Nelson's adaptation seems relevant here, but I have to concede that analysis, standard or not, would require extensive reformulation to work without infinites.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This point is very important. If you throw out analysis, you lose the best (in the sense of the greatest utility) mathematical tools yet seen for science and engineering. You are talking about throwing out the calculus, differential equations, probability theory, etc. Now much of what I have mentioned can be done in other ways (although they certainly have not all been demonstrated rigorously). It is not clear the extent of things you will not be able to reformulate, but it is clear that this programme would be a non-trivial effort. If you want to convince people that a move like this is worth considering, it seems to me that the first step is to present an argument that the potential gains are a least larger than these losses. I don't see anything resembling that argument here...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I didn't suggest throwing out analysis. I suggested the possibility of reformulating it. But before we do that, we have some much more fundamental questions to ask ourselves. Probably starting with a </em><a href="DefinitionOfRepresentation.html">DefinitionOfRepresentation</a>. Let us try to breathe before we try to crawl.<em></em>

        <strong>Counterargument</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The statement: 'pi is not irrational' is false. pi is a real number, well defined within an axiomatic system. If what you really mean is 'pi is not physical', then that is something else entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposal makes two logical errors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The mistaken belief that analysis requires any physical support.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The mistaken belief that a model of the world *is* the world.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I *think* the original author was trying to make a case for the idea that a) the models we use in the sciences and engineering are the cause of some problems, and b) that a system that is not reliant on the field of analysis as we know it would improve things.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the original since author has not demonstrated a), and has not provided b), it is difficult to know exactly what the point of this page is.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would certainly like to see some clarification of the point, preferably without irrelevant statements about fairies and orcs. If OP is unable to resist uch inanities I suppose the chances of something useful coming out of this page are small.

        Yes it does, because the last element of the finite set fails the n+1 test. Therefore, the whole inductive proof fails.

      <p>
        Let's try for both. 1) If we'd had no infinity in describing the possible lengths of bitstrings on Turing's silly machine, we'd have had to come to grips with the basic question about just what is modelled by that tape, and just what fundamental mechanisms are at work inside that read/write head. We'd have had to ask questions about how natural computations work, and how we might model them.

      <p>
        (I've had this thought too, the one not in italics. However, I eventually had to reject it. Non-Von Neumann algorithms are <em>too</em> "powerful"; we are incapable of predicting any but the simplest of them, and if anybody has actually <em>harnessed</em> chaos <em>on a grand scale</em> (you know, chaos-based web browser or something, not a mathematical toy) instead of frantically trying to merely reduce or predict the damage it does, that would be news to me. If you can't come up with something off the top of your head that isn't VN, but could have been implemented in 1960s technology, then maybe it's not so easy. "Powerful" gets scare quoted above because again, if anybody has <em>ever</em> chosen a significant problem <em>in advance</em> and harnessed a chaotic force to solve it, it would be news to me; chaos is more powerful then VN in theory but due to the near complete inability to control it, that power is effectively powerless. (Evolutionary computation is the closest it gets, and we're a long ways from evolving even the simplest UNIX utility.... yes, in our <a href="BraveNewWorld.html">BraveNewWorld</a> we wouldn't have UNIX utilities but if you can't get to that complexity level, you can't do anything else, either; complex problems exist.) I can't prove there's no big breakthrough waiting here, but until I see some actual evidence of it, instead of endless <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a> of the <a href="NewKindOfScience.html">NewKindOfScience</a> type, I'll stick to this opinion.)

        <em>Aren't fractals a concept initially based on infinities, as well?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The mathematical objects we call fractals are the limits of infinite processes, and that would seem to stop us using them for anything, under this new scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you possess an </em><a href="IterativeFunctionSystem.html">IterativeFunctionSystem</a>, what suggests you need to iterate it to infinity? Have you ever heard of anyone iterating it to infinity? Do you in your wildest imagination expect anyone to iterate it to infinity? If not, then perhaps you would like to ask yourself whether such fantastic limits are necessary to the utility of fractals.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You appear to have missed the point (again?). Fundamentally, IFS systems rely on Banachs contraction mapping principle, which is a result from analysis, and gives you conditions under which such a map is convergent. Of course nobody is expecting you to iterate an IFS infinitely. However, it is the results of analysis which allow you to say a) this map will converge, and b) give you a bound on the error at a particular iteration.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you throw this away, you need to devise under your new system a way by which you can characterize the IFS (i.e. what maps converge and what maps don't), give a rate of convergence, and give a bound (even better if it is exact) on the error. Note that a fixed lattice representation will not necessarily be good enough for all sets you might wish to consider. Note also that in general (this is not so much an issue for fixed point iterative schemes like IFS) that merely measuring the current inter-step error is not good enough to describe convergence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you have such a result?

        They also rely on the density of the real line, complex plane, etc.

        Then again, the occurrences of fractal-like structures in nature only ever have a finite number of levels of self-similarity.

        If we could look at fractals based on finite approximations thereto, we could look at VNMs based on finite approximations thereto.

        <em>I'm afraid that's not what the author means. VNMs are very useful indeed - until we have something better.

        Well now we get down to it. Is this different from what I was talking about on ThereAreNoCircles? Seems not. Fair enough, no argument so far. What's missing for me is where this connects up with denying ourselves use of the real numbers for anything whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are no real numbers, circles, or similar boojums. They simply don't pertain to any natural phenomenon at all. Ergo anything you use 'em for is a fantasy.

      </p>
      <p>
        This is silly. Of course there are real numbers and circles, in the same sense that there are notes in a musical scale. These are not 'fantasy', they are called *abstractions*. Are you seriously arguing that abstraction is in general a bad thing? If you want to point out the simple fact that real numbers and circles are not *physical*, that is something entirely different, and hardly a point of contention. You could make an argument that particular abstractions have less utility than others, or that a particular abstraction has led to problems, but you haven't done that here.

        <dd>Of course, the same case can be made that integers do not exists, as there is nothing inherently physical about '1'. I have '2' apples, but they aren't equal, so by some definition I could say that I have 1.9999999937354364 or 2.00000000123514325 or whatever. Likewise, a 8.5x11 sheet of paper isn't really 8.5 by 11 inches, just very close to it. The same logic that denies the existence of an irrational 'pi' can be brought to bear against the existence of integers. This is why we deal with uncertainties for accurate measurements.</dd>

        <dd>The 'pi' as irrational view is useful because of its relevance to reality (which is exactly as much relevance as integers): I know that if I tie a string down, and tie a piece of chalk to the other end, it'll make something resembling a circle. As I increase various constraints, the ratio to the size of that string to the length of line drawn approaches a constant value. We call that imaginary value pi. And we use it because it has proven to be a remarkably accurate method of determining various things about various other things which resemble circles, waves and other such 'imaginary' thing. Of course, they are no more imaginary than the 3 'apartments' (another imaginary construct) on my block, the 5 'cars' parked outside my work, or the '120 000 kilometers' I've put on my 'car' with the '13 inch' 'wheels'. On the other hand, I've never seen anything which is arbitrarily similar (by which I mean as close as I care to look) to an orc, hobbit or boojum.

        <strong>Pi exists in Mathematics</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The misguided discussion referenced above confuses the world of Mathematics with the "<a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>". Of course, circles and points and pi do not exist in the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>. They are, however, very useful in modeling some real world problems so as to allow us to use mathematics to solve them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Circles in the real world are not the same as circles in Mathematics. A real world circle would probably be closer to a Mathematics cylinder, but even there the roundness is not perfect, and the sides are neither parallel nor perpendicular to the base. There is no absolute center from which to measure a radius. There is no perfect plane slicing through the cylinder to use to measure the circumference. The measure instruments are not perfect lines. The measure itself is only reproducible to a certain degree of accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two similar, but different things under discussion. 2*pi*r is an acceptable answer in Mathematics, but an irrational measurement is a meaningless term in the real world.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The biggest problem I see here is that we are conflating the 'property' and 'thing'. Infinity is a 'property' of a process in our universe, it signifies something not unlike conservation of momentum. In other words, if nothing causes a process to terminate, it will continue. 'Infinity' is merely a symbol we use to describe an observable property; sometimes we also use the word 'divergence'. In any case, no one claims that 'infinity' is an actual object.

However, Pi is mathematically derived, not based on empirical measurements (although it matches empirical measurements). Thus, they are not the same kinds of thing. Another universe will not have a different value of Pi, at least not without a completely different kind of geometry being the base model.
