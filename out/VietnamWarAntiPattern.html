        Vietnam War Anti Pattern

        I just came back from a lunch; a coworker brought up an interesting project analogy:
      </p>
      <p>
        "I was told that this was a simple project that needed to be done, and should not take any longer than a few days.  Unfortunately, it was a bigger task than envisioned so more resources were put into it, which stretched everything out, but at this point, we were committed.  Now, someone is leaving.  It's like the <a href="VietnamWar.html">VietnamWar</a>."
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to begin the classification (actually, I laughed for a bit.  I would have laughed harder had this not been so sad...)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The project begins with "This is Just..." 
        </li>
        <li>
           The project is viewed as 'important enough' to throw developers at, but not to allow time for a quick high-level analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
           By the time the project is viewed as 'too much', it is already too late to scrap it due to the resources added.  (You're committed)
        </li>
        <li>
           A 'high casualty rate' may be the result of this type of project management.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
