        Coding Is Creative
      </h1>
      <p>
        Programming is a creative act whereby a programmer applies their mind to a problem and produces a work that addresses that problem.  In this sense it is more like authoring a poem than it is like laying a brick wall or transcribing a conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some common problems have been dealt with; their solution often is rote.  Few real-world problems can be couched entirely in terms of past solved problems, meaning that programmers must employ more inventiveness than process to practice their craft.

      <p>
        <strong>But</strong> programs and data are the same thing.  <em>They're </em>homoiconic<em>, you mean? </em> <strong>;)</strong> So <a href="CodingIsJustDataEntry.html">CodingIsJustDataEntry</a>. <a href="DesignIsCreative.html">DesignIsCreative</a>.  <em>But, </em><a href="TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign.html">TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>However</strong>, data entry transcribes data.  Programming creates data.

        See also <a href="ProgrammersStone.html">ProgrammersStone</a> for a good exposition of this idea.
