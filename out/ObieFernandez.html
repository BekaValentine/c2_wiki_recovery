        My real first name is Obed. It's from the Bible. Both of my parents moved to this country from Cuba in the 60s. I was raised and educated in New Jersey.

        Currently, I am a best-selling technical book author and CEO/co-founder of a boutique web consultancy named Hashrocket, headquartered in beautiful Jacksonville Beach, FL. My book, The Rails Way (on Addison Wesley) is a hefty reference work for Ruby on Rails, and I'm also the series editor of Addison Wesley's Professional Ruby Series, which it is part of. In 2008, I finally left JRoller and started blogging on my own website: <a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com">http://blog.obiefernandez.com</a> -- it's the easiest way to stay up to date with my work and thoughts on life.

The following is my bio written for my XP presentation at the Georgia Web Developers Conference <a href="http://www.tagonline.org/gwdc,">http://www.tagonline.org/gwdc,</a> and gives a pretty good professional description.
