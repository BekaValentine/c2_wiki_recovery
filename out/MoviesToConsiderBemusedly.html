        Here's a list of movies that tickle programmers, with their (programmerly) commentary on them):
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Laugh 'Til You Pee in Someone Else's Pants:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Airplane!</strong> - routinely tops "funniest movie of all times" lists, and routinely places in "best movies of all times" lists. It will ruin the entire gritty self-important melodramatic 1970s big-star disaster flick genre for you. <em>"You can let yourself out the back. There's juice in the fridge."</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           {Both the good gags and the bad ones will stick in your mind forever.
          <ul>
            <li>
               {<em></em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/</a> Robert Stack as Rex Kramer keeps cracking up. it still works. (This typography is correct, by the way.)<em>}</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>God of Cookery</strong> - Steven Chow's mind boggling Hong Kong style Iron Chef. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Fierce Creatures</strong> - John Cleese (et al from A Fish called Wanda). In order to make a profit a (former) petting zoo must house only fierce creatures. Excellent British-like humor.

          <ul>
            <li>
               btw "don't pull on that u have no idea what it connects to" is within the realms of reasonable internal anatomical variations ...

           <strong></strong>MysteryMen<strong> is fun -- and just as you would expect</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Martha meet Frank, Daniel, Lawrence</em> - An excellent British comedy with a neatly twisted plot. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="ThisIsSpinalTap.html">ThisIsSpinalTap</a><em> - the original fake Rockumentary. More quotable than any </em><a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> movie, and more cameos than I can remember.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="SouthParkBiggerLongerAndUncut.html">SouthParkBiggerLongerAndUncut</a><strong> - brilliant. The </strong><a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a> scene alone is worth the price of admission, but any movie that makes you root for Satan has got it on the ball.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>MontyPythonAndTheQuestForTheHolyGrail<strong> - The opening credits, alone, are funnier than most comedies. This movie is most insightful silliness.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>BringingOutTheDead<strong> <em>(also Gripping and Moving)</em></strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Darkstar</strong> <em>First feature by </em>JohnCarpenter. Definitive SF parody. "congratulations, you have chosen to clean the lift. Please stand clear of the explosive bolts."<em></em>

           <strong>Scary Movie</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Raising Arizona</strong> an early Coen Brothers film. Wacky funny, but pales in comparison with <strong>The Big Lebowski</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>The Big Lebowski</strong> a hilarious bowling film by the Coen Brothers. Every time you think you know where it's going, it heads in another direction completely.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</strong> The Coen Brothers take on a jail break. Very funny and a great soundtrack.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>The Pink Panther Strikes Again</strong> <em>(uneven, but the "questioning of the estate staff" scene is rather hilarious and perhaps worth the price of admission, alone; many other amusing scenes, just a little more tiredly acted than the former) </em><a href="http://www.rabbitw.com/wavs/panther/clous004.wav''">http://www.rabbitw.com/wavs/panther/clous004.wav''</a>

           <strong></strong><a href="TheGodsMustBeCrazy.html">TheGodsMustBeCrazy</a><strong> <em>Starts off with </em>'very</strong> dry humour, but had me rolling in the aisles later. Some (Bill Cosby) thought it was racist, but that's pretty narrow-minded.<em></em>

        <li>
           The Iron Giant <em><-- a brilliant lampoon of the </em><a href="ColdWar.html">ColdWar</a> hardware fetish'' (trivia bit: based on 'TheIronMan', a book by Ted Hughes, who was British Poet Laureate and Sylvia Plath's husband.)
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Charlie's Angels</strong> <em>A helplessly camp big-screen adaptation of that popular TV show, The Power Puff Girls.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               I disagree - this is a wonderfully funny, while campy (sor of like <a href="StarWars.html">StarWars</a>, or maybe SpaceBalls in that, eh?) movie definitely worth renting.
            </li>

        <strong>Don't Listen to the Critics:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Chasing Papi</strong> this poorly-named tidbit was widely panned as a bad sitcom full of latina stereotypes, like watching Telemundo or Univision. I find those comedies insipid and I found this a delightful antidote. It sets up all the typical tired "cat-fighting over a hunk" themes and twists them to attempt to show character development. "Attempts" being the operative word, but the ensemble acting (yes, real ensemble acting & not clever editing) and the minor pratfalls between the major attempts are a scream. During a moment of reflection on one woman's life story we see an insert of another woman listening intently. But her toy dog picks that moment for an enormous yawn.

           <strong>What's Up Doc?</strong> Screwball comedy and great UFH Saturday-afternoon movie fair. Yes, the gays like it too, because it has a young nubile 30-yo Barbra Streisand stealing every scene, one by one. And who's under the tarp on the piano?
        </li>
