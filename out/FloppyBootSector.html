        Floppy Boot Sector
      </h1>
      <p>
        The funnest way to learn x86 <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> would probably have to be the manufacture of custom-built floppies, from the boot sector up. But, there are some questions that need to be answered first:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Where can one find a decent BootLoader, so one can hack away at more than the one sector of disk?
        </li>
        <li>
           Are there any handy web references for all the PC Bios calls?
        </li>
        <li>
           Where are some sample floppy disk images? Is there an image bank anywhere yet?
        </li>
        <li>
           What's the deal with x86's having emulated 8088 mode? Why do you have to <em>write to the keyboard</em> to get out of it, instead of simply adding a "go to 32 bit mode, goddamnit" opcode?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One project of <a href="MikeGodfrey.html">MikeGodfrey</a>'s is to build a <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> interpreter on a bootable floppy, using the disk area as a bunch of CONS cells or shadow blocks. Any assistance with this project, or an example of it already completed would be a tonne of fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="GrandUnifiedBootloader.html">GrandUnifiedBootloader</a> (GRUB) is a <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> bootloader, which may help.

        <a href="RalfBrownsInterruptList.html">RalfBrownsInterruptList</a> may be the BIOS reference you are looking for.
