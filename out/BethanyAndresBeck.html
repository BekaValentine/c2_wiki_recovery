        My geek-doms are all over the map; theater, economics, history, art, science fiction/fantasy and computers, which is what I do for money.  I have just begun as a programmer for a public health modeling project in Boston after spending a year doing an unrelated and boring job to pay my bills.  I graduated from SmithCollege December 2004 with my BA in Theater.  It was a great school, even if there seemed to be this nagging sense that computers were too practical for a liberal arts college.  In my spare time I enjoy my brand new AMD 3800+ processor, Alton Brown's Good Eats, reading <a href="TheEconomist.html">TheEconomist</a> and making other people feel old.

        I code not because it's fun, which it is, and not because people pay me, which they do.  I code because I can immerse myself in a logical world that puts me in a battle of wits with an infinitely stupid machine.  Nothing else I do holds the same depth of facination, the same level of interest or the same ability to miss multiple meals and not notice except books, and I have yet to find a salaried job reading.
