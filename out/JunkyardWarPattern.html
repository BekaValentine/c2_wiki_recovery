        Junkyard War Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Intent:</strong> 
        Maximize the accumulation of limited resources while concurrently designing a mechanical device in a time-limited, competitive environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> 
        On the television show <a href="JunkyardWars.html">JunkyardWars</a>, 2 teams, consisting of 4 members each, are asked to build a mechanical device in 10 hours using materials from a junkyard. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Risk spending too much time on <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> and the materials needed for the design may already be taken by the competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Risk accumulating materials up front without a design and you end up "bodging" materials together at the last moment, producing a poor quality device.

        <strong>Discussion:</strong>
        The "expert" and team captain iteratively sketch out a design at a white board while 2 other members of the team scavenge about the junkyard, receiving instructions on what items to collect over short range radio.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2 "scavengers" are given a high level, first attempt vision of the design before starting to scavenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Announcer] OK teams. Build me a snow mobile!
        </li>
        <li>
            [Expert] This is gonna be great... reminds me of a trip to Alaska in 1973. Jim Bob's clutch went out in the middle of nowhere and we had to rig up this...
        </li>
        <li>
            [Team Captain interrupting] Sounds swell. What do we need?
        </li>
        <li>
            [Expert] Oh.... ummmm. A couple skid rails, an engine, and ...
        </li>
        <li>
            [Captain to team members 3 and 4] You guys run out and look for anything that looks likes skis, or... something that skids. While you're at it keep an eye out for engines.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            [Later... Expert and Captain refine design and broadcast more detailed instructions to the scavengers. With at least 60% of the necessary materials accumulated, building begins.]
        </li>
      </ul>

        This isn't a pattern, it's a description of a <em>specific</em> and <em>unique</em> television show. You've given one example, you haven't incorporates other examples, and you have described what the forces are and how you've transformed them into a resulting context. See <a href="PatternPattern.html">PatternPattern</a>.

        <em>Ohhh .... quit being so pedantic and get a sense of humor already! OF COURSE it's a pattern. Perhaps a </em><a href="ProcessPattern.html">ProcessPattern</a>.  :-)<em></em>

        A similar (perhaps the same) pattern is found in the <a href="IronChef.html">IronChef</a> competition.
