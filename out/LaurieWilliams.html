        Laurie is doing some very interesting research trying to isolate what makes XP work (if indeed it works). She is beginning by comparing the <a href="PersonalSoftwareProcess.html">PersonalSoftwareProcess</a> with a very similar process, but including <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>.

        Laurie's August 2000 PhD dissertation (the research referred to above) was on <a href="CollaborativeSoftwareProcess.html">CollaborativeSoftwareProcess</a> (CSP), which compared pairs using a process which added pair programming to PSP, vs. individuals using PSP. A PDF of the dissertation can be found at <a href="http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/dissertation.pdf.">http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/dissertation.pdf.</a>
