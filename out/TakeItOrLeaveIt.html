        Usually a phrase which means: Either accept the item in question as it is or do not.  Either way, do not complain about it. This is not a phrase of love.

        <em>I told him I'd already written code to do the same thing he was doing but he didn't seem interested. He was clearly suffering from </em><a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a> (NIH) syndrome.<em></em>

        Just because you have worked out the logic for one little thing that happens to have a recognizable name doesn't mean that every other programmer in the world has an obligation to reuse your code. If a developer can tell by the way you talk that you don't understand his problem or care to learn about it then you will surely find a lack of interest on his part. If you call this NIH then you are just fooling yourself.
