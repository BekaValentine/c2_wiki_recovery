        An ultra-light <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> clone for <a href="VisualCeePlusPlus.html">VisualCeePlusPlus</a> has been moved from here to:  <a href="http://flea.sourceforge.net/recursiveDescentParser.zip">http://flea.sourceforge.net/recursiveDescentParser.zip</a>

        When the tests pass you'll see "All tests passed" in the Output panel. The recent bells and whistles are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A streaming class to <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> text outputting to the console and the Output panel.
        </li>
        <li>
           CPPUNIT_ASSERT_MATCH based on dirt-simple regular expressions.
        </li>
        <li>
           Disabling classes via an exception.
        </li>
        <li>
           The TEST_() macro implements <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a> in C++ (without parsing the danged source files)
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>Great!</em>

        Thanks. Please notice this code does not croak a test case just because a CPPUNIT_ macro failed. I have never seen the reason not to let the tests continue collecting clues, if you want to hit Run. --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        I believe that regex matcher could use some testing of its own.  Call me crazy, but it seems like it's not proper to have the last line read as it does since you would want to match an input string that's longer than your regex.  Set input string to 'st' and regex to 's' and it fails.  I believe the test should be against regex.  (Don't have the test harness set up yet, that's why I'm here in the first place.)

        Also fixed formatting (I hope) so that this code can be more easily followed online here; the brace matching was quite uneven. --<a href="TomPlunket.html">TomPlunket</a>
