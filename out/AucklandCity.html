        Auckland City

        The largest population centre in <a href="NewZealand.html">NewZealand</a>, with around 1.3 million people living in the Greater Auckland Area, I think.

        Home of the <a href="UniversityOfAuckland.html">UniversityOfAuckland</a> as well as <a href="MasseyUniversityAlbany.html">MasseyUniversityAlbany</a>.
