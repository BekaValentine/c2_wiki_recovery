        askMerlin is a web based AI program. When you ask questions of Merlin, he consults the WWW in order to give you a wise answer. While this script is extremely simple, it is easy for most people to understand and it will hopefully inspire new algorithms from other Pythonistas.

        Merlin prompts the user for a question, and then for options. Whether or not the user offers options, Merlin always answers the question by consulting the WWW.

        <em>Is the code still being developed? I notice that </em>EvaluationWords and SynthesisWords have no word lists included? Plus It appears that the Www is consulted only via Google, Are other searches going to be used?<em></em>
