        Season's <img src="http://www.msnbc.com/onair/nbc/dateline/global/tinywreath.jpg" /> Greetings to Ward and all of the rest of the inmates who assist in running this asylum.  I want to thank Ward for hanging in there/here in Wiki|Wonder|Land making the best of cyberspace ... and all of the thought, good houskeeping and, not to mention, the equipment and the connection to the net, must have come up from the 28k that I recall from the old days. My best wishes to Ward, his family and all for the Holiday  Season.  <a href="JohnDeBruyn.html">JohnDeBruyn</a> (November 26, 2002)
