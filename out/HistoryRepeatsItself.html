        If men could learn from history, what lessons it might teach us!  But passion and party blind our eyes, and the light which experience gives us is a lantern on the stern which shines only on the waves behind us.

        If people did listen, wouldn't loads of intellectual cruft build up after just one generation, let alone hundreds?  That is, for every time someone gives us wise advice, aren't there ten pieces of foolish advice nearby?  Questioning established knowledge has value, even though it has the unfortunate side effect of making history repeat itself.

        <em>That has a wonderful sound to it, but may end up just being some sort of tautology. Would it not be more accurate to say that people ignore </em>all<em> the lessons of history without even trying to determine what comprises wisdom and what dross?</em>

        <a href="HistoryRepeatsItself.html">HistoryRepeatsItself</a>, but that doesn't mean that it has to. Mankind can make progress in avoiding repetitions by extending memory backward to include several generations and make his forward horizon and expectations extend several generations into the future. This means, not only human generations, but also to those of its tools and technologies. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.200904162202.m06
