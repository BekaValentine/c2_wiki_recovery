        I've found the Lesstif toolkit that the Linux Personal Edition uses to be full of hassles.  It's buggy, inconsistent, and doesn't offer a native look and feel.  Is there any way to get it to use the native (KDE) widget set?  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

        <em>KDE isn't possible (or really native), but try Open Motif 2.2 for fewer bugs.</em>

        Update: <a href="LispWorks.html">LispWorks</a> 6.0 for Linux uses GTK+ instead of OpenMotif/Lesstif. -- Dave Fox, <a href="LispWorks.html">LispWorks</a> Ltd.
