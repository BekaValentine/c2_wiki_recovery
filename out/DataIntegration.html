        Data Integration
      </h1>
      <p>
        Data integration connects the applications at the data level and makes the same data available to more
        than one application. This type of integration relies on the database technologies and is ideal when
        there is minimal amount of business logic to be reused and bulk amount of data transactions are
        involved across applications. This type of integration is suitable for batch data uploads or bulk data
        sync requirements.
