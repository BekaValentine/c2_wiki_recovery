        "New World Order" is a name sometimes associated with The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria (<a href="BavarianIlluminati.html">BavarianIlluminati</a>), as documented in <em>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</em> by Shea and <a href="RobertAntonWilson.html">RobertAntonWilson</a> and elsewhere. For example, NWO is the subtitle of a trading card game based on the theories of the book. Note that the higher initiates like to conceal deep truths within humour. Or is it the other way round?

        Notably used by <a href="GeorgeBush.html">GeorgeBush</a> during the Gulf War to describe his hopes for a significant transformation in international relations. Shortly after the war <a href="MargaretThatcher.html">MargaretThatcher</a> mockingly retorted "It looks more like the <em>Old World Disorder</em> to me".

        <em>Term then used by those politically more "conservative" than Bush, after the </em><a href="ColdWar.html">ColdWar</a> ended, as a new scarecrow to frighten the masses into voting for reactionary politics with more budget for the military and less for diplomacy.<em></em>

        You're not thinking of New Order, are you? They weren't exactly a flash in the pan.
