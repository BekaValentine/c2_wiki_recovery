        Apache Wicket
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Apache Wicket is a component oriented Java web application framework. With proper mark-up/logic separation, a POJO data model, and a refreshing lack of XML, Apache Wicket makes developing web-apps simple and enjoyable again. Swap the boilerplate, complex debugging and brittle code for powerful, reusable components written with plain Java and HTML."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Apache Wicket is more than just another DevelopmentFramework:"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wicket uses a special HTML attribute to denote components, enabling easy editing with ordinary HTML editors. Like Echo, Wicket has a first-class component model. But Wicket applications are not like applications written in either Tapestry or Echo, because in Wicket you get the best of both worlds. You get the benefits of a first-class component model and a non-intrusive approach to HTML. In many situations, this combination may prove to be a significant development advantage."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wicket, more than any other framework gives you a separation of concerns. Web designers can work on the HTML with very little knowledge of the application code (they cannot remove the component name tags and they cannot arbitrarily change the nesting of components, but anything else goes). Likewise, coders can work on the Java components that attach to the HTML without concerning themselves with what a given page looks like. By not stepping on each other's toes, everyone can get more work done."
