        <em>Satyagraha means ending tyranny. It means reclaiming our ability to govern ourselves, stand for ourselves, and trust in each other.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Tyranny is generated by millions of individual compromises on truth, peace and love. It is a positive feedback effect - like the howl of a speaker playing into its own microphone. Satyagraha is the only historically proven remedy for tyranny.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Satyagraha is not a cult, organization, or political party, but an uncompromising personal commitment. It is not a prayer to recite, but a way of working to improve the quality of your life and the lives around you.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Satyagraha is the discipline of self-control and self-sufficiency whereby Mohandas Gandhi threw the British empire out of India; Martin Luther King ended racial segregation in America; and Nelson Mandela surmounted the apartheid regime in South Africa.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Satyagraha conquers by conversion, producing neither defeat nor victory, but new harmony. It entails 11 great vows:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Non-violence. Not harming your enemies but reaching out to them in forgiveness and hospitality. Non-cooperation with those who use violence and collaboration with those who do not.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Strict adherence to Truth - this includes honesty, but goes beyond it to mean living actively in accord with what you know to be true. Rather than in wishful compromise.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Non-stealing - not exploiting others and actively avoiding any practice or product that involves use of fear, violence, addiction or fraud.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Ecological chastity - not raising children to live in poverty or animals to live in squalor. Working on the quality of all lives you create, consume or displace. Studying, adapting and propagating </em><a href="PermaCulture.html">PermaCulture</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Non-possession. Not the same as poverty, this means taking only what you need and providing the rest to benefit others in need. The opposite of waste, hoarding, and indulgence.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Choosing to work only in efforts to improve the human dignity and mutual understanding of your fellow people. All other forms of work serve purposes of tyranny.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Non-addiction. Freeing yourself from all personal dependencies including cigarettes, sugar, alcohol, caffeine, mass media and artificial foods. Addiction inevitably leads to compromise.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Fearlessness - courage on all occasions. The solution to terrorism is refusing to act from fear. Acting constructively, mindfully, to own your own life.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Equal respect for any religion or philosophy that observes the Golden Rule: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself".</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Initiating and participating in grass roots economic strategies such as small farm shares, boycotting franchise stores, open sourcing, mutual credit systems, and a determination to consume only local, ethically grown produce.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Non-racism - not just tolerance, but working to combine foreign cultures fruitfully with your own. Adapting Satyagraha so that it can propagate with these.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Satyagraha isn't an easy thing to do. You can only make these vows live by consciously working on your own life.</em>
      </p>

        As for software, what is a <a href="SatyaGrahaDevelopment.html">SatyaGrahaDevelopment</a> method?

        "The word Satya (Truth), is derived from Sat, which means being. And nothing is or exists in reality except Truth."
        M.K. Gandhi, Young India, July 30 1931
      </p>
      <p>
        "Truth (Satya) implies love, and firmness (Agraha) engenders and therefore serve as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement "Satyagraha", that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or non-violence, and gave up the use of the phrase "passive resistance".
        M.K. Gandhi, Satyagraha in South Africa

        Jonathan, you were referring to this, not the band "Satya Graha", right?
