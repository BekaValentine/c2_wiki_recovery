        Ew the icky <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>! Look at that poorly factored OO. Ew! Better get <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> right now!

        Um, okay dainty-boots, now you come down here to the <a href="CodeSewer.html">CodeSewer</a> where I live. I've got 3 million lines of VB3/VB6. Half a million lines of 1980s C. Another half of <strong>old school</strong> java. Old Iron databases. Millions of flat files used as <a href="SourceOfTruth.html">SourceOfTruth</a>. None a that <a href="InversionOfControl.html">InversionOfControl</a> down here. It's plumbing, sister, miles and miles of stinking, steaming, dirty, greasy plumbing. And you can just forget about <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> it sweetie-pie - 'cause you're <a href="PolishingaTurd.html">PolishingaTurd</a>!.

        <em>Just one moment there bud. </em><a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> isn't nail-files and cuticle repair, but no one said it's the only trick in the book. When you find yourself in a <a href="CodeSewer.html">CodeSewer</a> what you want is heavy duty hydrochloric <a href="TestInjection.html">TestInjection</a>. Like a white tornado! If you don't like that then I guess you're an <a href="OldGuardDeveloper.html">OldGuardDeveloper</a> - and I'm injecting around, over, or right through you. Look out!<em></em>
