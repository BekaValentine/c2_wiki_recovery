        How Can Something Be Super Great Without Producing External Evidence
      </h1>
      <p>
        BowtieOrientedProgramming comes along, for example, and everybody is raving about it as the next <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a>. However, proponents cannot produce external, obvious evidence that is convincing, often even to other co-proponents. (Co-proponents may agree with the benefits, but not the example as a demonstration tool.) No obvious improvement in <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, no dramatic reduction in code size, etc., are produced. Often the benefit is allegedly some kind of hard-to-measure change in mental process. The New Thing makes you "think better", but only if you "get it". The burning question is, "How can something be so great, not just slightly better, without leaving a good trail of evidence"?

        Straw man. That never happens. Lisp fans are always quick to say why. You are thinking of the many, many times (including on this wiki) that a <a href="HostileStudent.html">HostileStudent</a> said "prove to me that Lisp is better than all other languages, but don't use any toy examples, because toys prove nothing, and don't give me a big program to look at because I can't read Lisp, and don't talk to me about higher order functions, multimethods, macros, homoiconicity, evaluators, lazy evaluation, etc, because I'm bored with those topics and they don't prove anything. Now come on, hurry it up." -- followed typically by a speechless silence, which <strong>you</strong> then take as proof that Lisp is all hot air. Sheesh.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The answer I would use for this would be, "What <em>would</em> you consider suitable evidence, and what other languages/paradigms/systems fulfill the requirement?" This should draw out the criteria by which the matter is being measured. In my experience, these criteria usually are not particularly objective themselves; this is because, in the current state of the art, <strong>there are no universally applicable measures of effectiveness in programming.</strong> The few rigorous measures that exist - AlgorithmicAnalysis, GoalsOperatorsMethodsAndSelectionRulesModel, CorrectnessProving - generally play a little or no role in actual programming practice, and are rarely applied even where they could be of use. - <a href="JayOsako.html">JayOsako</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               That's exactly it; there <strong>are</strong> objective measures -- which are largely ignored or distorted or otherwise irrationally and subjectively misused by both sides in any debate, even when people have good intentions (which they usually do not). As Heinlein said, "man is not the rational animal, man is the rationalizing animal"

        <em>I think that suitable evidence to the greatness of a language (in particular, Lisp, but it can work for any language) is the existence of hot applications made on it, and great availability of libraries and basic programs, which allow you to not start from zero.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Lisp is one of the older languages, and lacks the libraries. Fortran has almost the same age, and has TONS of libraries. Perl is young comparatively and has tons of libraries. PHP is even younger and has lots of libraries. Java too. Something must be bad with Lisp if only now their fans are trying to build a decent library base.</em>

        [The <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> standard is largely about what would be libraries in other languages. One of the reason you don't find many libraries out there for <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> to do mundane tasks is because they <em>come standard</em> with the language.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I can't say I believe you. Yes, there are some libraries that come into </em><a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, but there are lots of things to do out there. And you can't do it in <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, or ar least, not in a portable way. Even <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> recognizes this:<em></em>

           Libraries are one place Common Lisp falls short. There are only rudimentary libraries for manipulating strings, and almost none for talking to the operating system. For historical reasons, Common Lisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn't exist. And because you can't talk to the OS, you're unlikely to be able to write a serious program using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp. You have to use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice these tend not to give you everything you want. Hackers would think a lot more highly of Lisp if Common Lisp had powerful string libraries and good OS support.

        But people are lousy at articulating why X is so great in larger apps that they work with. You can't just say "it is good because it has higher order functions, and higher order functions are better abstraction, and better abstraction is good, therefore higher order functions are good". That is circular reasoning. (Besides, occasional use of them can easily be emulated with an "eval" operation.) When I describe why I like my favorite technologies, I often end up describing the kinds of patterns that my eyes notice (technically, the eye and brain working together). I agree that others may not spot the kind of patterns that my eyes do and <em>vice versa</em>, but at least I narrow it down to the kinds of things that my eyes favor. If your eyes are different, then at least we know where our differences lie. In other cases I find a consistency to my favored techniques that seem to be lacking in alternatives. If there is a consistency in the alternatives, then please point them out. I cannot know that they exist until they are pointed out to me. If there are selling points that compensate for the lack of consistency, then I need to know specifically what they are. I have identified a weakness, consistency, that the other party seems to agree with, but they don't counter it with something equally as specific. These are the kinds of things I hope to get out of others, but I can't. <strong>They are not doing a good job at psychology dumps.</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        [Quite aside from whether Lisp is a good or bad language, higher order functions themselves are so obviously a good thing, at least in some situations, at least in moderation, that there has never been any true counter-argument, to my knowledge, in all seriousness. One might as well demand to hear an argument in favor of floating point versus integer. Integer-only programmers may not grok the point of floating point, but that's their own private self-education problem, not by any means the start of an argument (despite the well-known problems with numerical analysis). Same thing with basic use of higher order functions. There's no debate, there are no sides, there is no subjectivity. There's knowing and there's not knowing, that's all.]
      </p>

        [I assume you personally do know higher order functions and you're just playing devil's advocate, but I disagree that that is appropriate on that particular topic.]

        [Some things are in the "RTFM" category, basically meaning "I would die of shame before flaunting abysmal ignorance of such a basic topic that I could educate myself about so easily, and you should feel the same way, so stop flaunting and start reading." The question of why the entire gestalt of a language, whether Lisp, Haskell, Java, or whatever, is thought to be an effective choice, is not necessarily an RTFM matter. Utility of e.g. floating point or higher order functions <strong>is</strong>.]

           Actually, floating point is not a good example; some very experienced practitioners in the field, most notably <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a>, <em>do</em> have a problem with floating point, because it can lose precision without warning. Moore (whose original profession was radio astronomy, where explicitly defined precision is extremely important) steadfastly opposed introducing floating-point into standard Forth, and when popular demand drown him out (in this and other matters), he abandoned the ANS Forth in favor of a new dialect, <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>. Similarly, compliant Scheme implementations which implement the full numeric tower generally (AFAICT) use a combination of rational fractions and fixed-point bignums for exact numbers instead of floating point, and often for inexact numbers as well. - <a href="JayOsako.html">JayOsako</a>

           [No, floating point is an excellent example; I am aware of the problems that both experts and non-experts have with it, and I am aware that it should be avoided for some things, yet it is <strong>still</strong> indispensable for some other things. Anyone who doesn't understand that is a perfect example of someone in need of further education, which is the point. Yes, floating point has its problems. No, there is no acceptable alternative in many application areas. No, I didn't say it is without problems, nor that it should be used for everything. <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a> is admirable in some ways, but he's enough of an extremist to verge on being a crackpot in other areas (e.g. not believing in software reuse); there is zero reason to bring up his views on this. Floating point is <strong>necessary</strong> for <strong>some</strong> things, and this is not subjective.][<em>Name one.</em>]

        One can have higher-order functions without using Lisp, I would note. Often they can be emulated in dynamic languages that don't directly support HOF with a basic "Evaluate()" function. Although a bit "hacky" in some ways, for occasional use it does the job. The difference is not the "super-great" being sought in this topic.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Many languages support <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> these days, pick one, use them, for no eval hack will be sufficient, there is no argument, <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> and FirstClassFunctions are clearly superior features of a language, and languages without them are clearly crippled in comparison.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Strongly agree. As already stated, their utility transcends language.

               <em>How do we measure "crippled" here? More code? </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> violations? I would like to see a demonstration, even if it suffers the problems of "toy" examples.<em></em>

                <li>
                   If you know what those things are, then you don't need examples, they are clearly better, lead to less code, more abstraction, more reuse. If you don't know what they are, it's your job to go learn them, follow the links, there's a wiki page about each one, no need to repeat their benefits here. But here's quick sample in javascript just to prove it: <em>[example moved to </em><a href="ArrayDeletionExample.html">ArrayDeletionExample</a>]<em>.</em>

        This whole page is about pain and pain avoidance. Fear of feeling inferior. Why not simply acquaint yourself with many a tool and transcend them?

        I'm the <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> user above. I'm not sure which place to put this answer to make the most sense. Refactoring welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have not abandoned Perl for Lisp for lots of reasons. I work at a university. What code I write is usually in the service of some other in-house project. There are several other people in-house who know Perl but do not know Lisp, and do not want to learn. We have lots of custom library code in Perl (much written by yours truly).
      </p>
      <p>
        Perl has higher order functions. It has closures. It has <a href="TailCallOptimization.html">TailCallOptimization</a> (though you need to ask for it with the <a href="MagicGoto.html">MagicGoto</a>). It has a decent package system. It has enough <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> capabilities to do what I need. It has garbage collection (although it is just reference counting). It can do some syntactic abstraction via prototypes, if you <strong>really</strong> want it to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of what I have learned in my independent studies of Lisp has been directly applicable to Perl programming. This is no surprise given that many of Perl's features originated in Lisp! I can do DataDirectedProgramming when I need to. I can do <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> when I need to. I can do <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> when I need to. I can do plain old boring imperative programming when I feel like it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really like <a href="AutoVivification.html">AutoVivification</a>. If I say something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        my(%foo);<br/>
        $foo{'bar'}{'baz'}{'quux'} = 3;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The first line declares a local hash named %foo. The second line:
      </p>
      <code>
        Creates a new hash and assigns a reference to it to $foo{'bar'}.<br/>
        Creates another new hash and assigns a reference to it to $foo{'bar'}{'baz'}.<br/>
        Stores the integer 3 into $foo{'bar'}{'baz'}{'quux'}.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is very convenient when I am building a nested data structure and new data comes in. I can just assign it to the correct place on the tree, and if the intermediate nodes don't exist yet, they spring into existence. In most other languages (including, I believe, Lisp) I would need to check for and create each of the intermediate nodes myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Trees? Yuk. Table-time, guys. Nested arrays suck -- top</em>

      <p>
        When I am talking to a Lisp interpreter, I feel like I really know what is going on in there. Even if the interpreter isn't implemented using my mental model, it still behaves like my mental model.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming in Perl is more like talking to a person. When I need to do something funky, when I need to nest behaviors, I sometimes guess at the syntax. Usually Perl understands, and sometimes I need to rephrase. <a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a> claims that this is an advantage and that he deliberately made Perl resemble natural language in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also CPAN versus macros. Frequently I don't actually need to solve my problem in Perl. I can just download someone else's solution, and fill in a few parameters. I know similar things exist for Lisp, but they are smaller and I haven't learned them yet. But with Lisp, I know that I can build <strong>anything</strong> I need. There is a nice, liberating, completely in control feeling that I enjoy when working with Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, that's where I am. Like I said, I still appreciate the truth behind things people say about <a href="LispMachine.html">LispMachine</a>s. Yes, <a href="LispMachine.html">LispMachine</a>s failed for political reasons and not technical ones. The vendors got greedy. The software was proprietary. Sure, technically they may be the best solution for many, if not most computing problems. I know that my tools are in some sense inferior to the best that they could be. That doesn't make <strong>me</strong> inferior. It doesn't make me afraid to listen to ways that someone else's tools might be better than mine, or ways that someone else's idioms might be better than mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You seem to agree with me that Lisp is a good language, maybe even the best, but *not significantly* better than other languages, just a little bit at most, especially when compared to other very dynamic languages such as Perl, TCL, etc. I do believe that dynamic languages can run rings around C++ and Java, but those are easy to beat.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don't put words into my mouth. I'll say plenty of dumb things without your help, I promise. ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that Lisp is a much better language than Perl, taken language-against-language. The thing is, the real contest isn't just language-against-language. There are also issues of culture, development environment, legacy code, and so on. There is also an issue of need. For my day job, I just don't <em>need</em> Lisp's power, no matter how convenient it would be, so those other factors tend to come to the front, especially the cultural one (other Perl programmers around) and the legacy code.
      </p>
      <p>
        BUT!  None of that is my main point. My main point is in response to the above comment to the effect that this whole page is motivated by fear of being inferior. I believe that it is valuable to discuss the relative merits of different programming languages, tools, and techniques, and I don't think that such discussion must center around fear of being inferior or desire to be superior.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied Lisp because I wanted to. It has made me a better Perl programmer. Sometimes I resort to a little <a href="GreenSpunning.html">GreenSpunning</a>, but because I have a strong understanding of what I want to do, and how I would do it if I had the tools available to me, I can do it in a minimal and targeted manner. This doesn't make me feel inferior (because I'm <a href="ReinventingTheWheel.html">ReinventingTheWheel</a>) or superior (because I know these l33t c0d1ng t3chn1qu3s). It just makes me a better programmer than I was.

        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a> too, whenever someone compliments something elegant in my code, I almost always credit either Lisp or Smalltalk for the idiom, hoping that someday they'll get the point.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>While the credit is nice; </em><a href="DoNotWorryAboutTheCredit.html">DoNotWorryAboutTheCredit</a>. The things that originally came from Lisp or Smalltalk, but can be implemented without too much hassle in a different language, aren't going to help you. What will help you is whenever you can show an example of a problem where the Lisp (or Smalltalk) solution is <strong>significantly</strong> simpler than the solution in language X, where X is what the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> has decreed. Unfortunately, most business apps don't need the algorithmic superiority of Lisp (Smalltalk is a better fit - a Smalltalk-like language that wasn't a <a href="PinkyAndTheBrainLanguage.html">PinkyAndTheBrainLanguage</a> would be a better fit still). Most business apps need simplistic data processing, the ability to speak numerous protocols <em>without</em> needing to go find the libs yourself, quick-and-dirty GUI builders, etc. Lisp can do all these things; but none of these play to its strengths.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sorry, I disagree, the Lisp and Smalltalk solutions that I credit, are always significantly simpler and less verbose than the hoops I have to jump through to fake them in my language. I write custom business apps too, and I find they do need the algorithmic superiority of Lisp and Smalltalk on a daily basis. I find myself faking features of Lisp and Smalltalk constantly, because it drastically lessens the code I have to write, though it'd be easier in Lisp or Smalltalk.

        // this is actually in the BCL, so you don't need to implement it yourself<br/>

      </code>
      <p>
        which is almost the same number of characters as the lisp example (discounting the delegate declaration, which written for you and contained in the base class library, the only difference is the required type annotation for the argument).

        The benefits of almost every concept that I consider "good" are either explainable with relatively small examples or are something I realize is purely a personal subjective preference. However, some claim that some things don't fall into one of these two categories; that benefits can only be seen after years and years of exposure to a concept, and even then they are still not easily articulatable. Being that I have never encountered this 3rd category in my entire life, I am very skeptical it exists. Either I have reached the limit of my brain or experience that keeps me from seeing the 3rd category anywhere, or claimants of the 3rd category are either deceiving themselves or are shitty articulators.

           The sad thing about <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> is, he often has a point. There are many problems, outside the domain of processing persistent business data, for which use of relational tables would be an elegant solution. The problem with Top's arguments are twofold:
          <ul>
            <li>
               He routinely confuses relational tables with RDBMS's. While the latter requires the former by definition; the former does not require the latter. Arranging transient data in a relational form is quite frequently a useful thing to do, even when you don't need ACID semantics or transaction semantics. And ACID semantics and transaction semantics are <em>expensive</em>, despite numerous advances in RDBMS technology.

        The idea that programming technologies are tools is problematic in its own way, cf. <a href="FallacyOfTheRightTool.html">FallacyOfTheRightTool</a>. One must ask not only whether some technology A supports an ideal or adequate solution for specific problems, but also whether the resulting subprograms can be effectively integrated, configured, reused, extended, deployed, ported, maintained, upgraded, and so on. A requirement to "always know your requirements" is a bad thing because our hindsight is much sharper than our foresight. A more adaptable technology that reduces the need for foresight may be a better one even if it is non-optimal for individual tasks, cf. <a href="CodeChangeImpactAnalysis.html">CodeChangeImpactAnalysis</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Focus on individual problems is terribly short-sighted; the bulk of programming effort regards integration anyway, the space between the solutions. As illustrated by Thomas Guest:

           Whatever you label it is as, can Lisp do it better, yes or no? <strong>If no, why not?</strong> The answer may reveal something. Although it may be not fully representative of any particular niche, data-driven applications tend to have a lot of SQL, for good or bad. And, just because it is a lot of SQL does not mean that all of it is. Can FP simplify the non-SQL parts, yes or no? If no, why not?

For imperative programming as an example: you could simply teach in a pseudolanguage that you made up yourself, teaching people about a list of things that happen in the program. Or consider relational: teaching kids SQL in school isn't a good idea, since SQL is a product/technology that has strayed away from relational model. Confusing students isn't a good thing, and products/technologies are often infected with confusing garbage or things that are simply wrong.<em></em>

        <em>That's not unusual, however. Any engineer should have a good understanding of the science underlying his discipline; even if he seldom employs it directly in practice. A civil engineer should have a good understanding of soil science and other relevant materials science, even though no civil engineer makes his own concrete or forges his own steel. A chemical engineer should have a good understanding of both chemistry and fluid dynamics, even though he won't manufacture pipes.</em>

        Students should also have a good introduction to relational theory and techniques. Some schools skip that, and grads end up using arrays for everything because they don't know anything else. -- top

        Yup, they use arrays and lists and pointers to them, along with structs, when they could be using relational techniques. Problem is, no mainstream product or technology out there actually makes it easy to use relational techniques in our programs. How do you do relational stuff in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> for example? Answer: you don't. You call some function like mysql_query() and then you have to work with ugly strings and convert the tables into arrays once you receive the resultset. You do iterative looping and use pointers and such low level garbage. In <a href="PredictTheFuture.html">PredictTheFuture</a> I suppose we should say something about languages of the future providing more relational abilities than our current languages.

        And, don't give me crap about "not understanding your example". It is either less code and/or less change-points, or it is not. I don't have to understand it to fricken see code size. If your "killer example" is still 90% of my version, you are toast in my book. Give me 50% and maybe I will stay around. You claim "significant", you prove it!

           If two competing technologies come in within 10% (which is statistical noise for such a comparison, unless a broad-based study is performed), I'd say they are equivalent (and thus neither should prevail). While you are certainly justified in saying "I'll do it my way" then, so is everybody else.

        As I see it, the problem is that without any external evicence produced by the current "thing", it is impossible to produce external evidence that the new thing is better.  There is no baseline of current software development approaches to compare against, so evaluations must be done based on theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Products and what people are using can act as external evidence, but it is also a </em><a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a> too. Just because millions of people are using SQL products, doesn't mean SQL is better than some other theoretical language which addresses SQL's problems. If the masses use something, that means there is massive evidence that something is extremely useful. It doesn't mean it is the best solution. OOP is used by the masses for GUI widgets so that people can reuse and inherit the widgets, and it seems that the masses do okay with these techniques. Is there a better way than OOP? possibly, but OOP works for the masses, and SQL works for the masses, so that is evidence for all of us right there that both OOP and databases are useful tools.<em> </em>

      <p>
        There is indeed something to be said about achieving years of road-testing and being at least "good enough" to get the job done. There are many tools/projects that DON'T get the job done such that getting it done does stand out. However, that doesn't mean we should stop being critical of them and stop testing new ideas. Just don't experiment on critical projects. OOP has worked fairly well for GUI's and SQL RDBMS are a clear improvement over what came before. They are that old pair of shoes that allow you to walk normally and don't hurt your feet, even as they give you that nagging feeling that they are missing newer styles/ideas.
