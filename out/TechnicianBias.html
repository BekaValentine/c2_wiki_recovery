        Technician Bias
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is to catalog reasons why technicians may be biased in their assessments of technologies and techniques. It's not an accusation, but merely a catalog of potential influences. These may be both conscious and unconscious.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="JobSecurity.html">JobSecurity</a> - We want the customer to have to keep coming back to us. This may include techniques such as:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Convoluted or confusing internal construction:
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Excessively "advanced" or obscure technique for the job at hand such that follow-on maintainers probably won't know it.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Poor design, such as partitioning that has no documented or easily-determinable rhyme or reason.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Bugs
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> - Run up the time bill and/or complicate the system with extra features not explicitly requested, increasing the maintenance costs.
            </li>
            <li>
               Misaligned goals - Example: focus on machine performance/speed over code maintainability even though customer never stated such a preference.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Tool familiarity - We want others to use our favorite tools or techniques so that we are better able to hop in and be immediately helpful/useful. This may push us to view our preferred approaches as "better", and promote them as such.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           High Barriers - We spent the effort to climb a high barrier, so expect other technicians to have to climb the same or similar barrier to be granted the "right" to participate or replace us. Example: "I had to figure out this code base without comments, so you should also, and I forbid you to add comments."

           More to come...
