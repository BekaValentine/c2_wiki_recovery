        Space Pen

        A ball-point pen invented by American chemist, PaulFisher, currently of Boulder City, Nevada.

        I met him when I was living in Las Vegas.  His factory is in Boulder City, Nevada, just up the road.  I have a collection of his pens; in fact, I no longer buy any other kind.  There are several styles, from the traditional "bullet" pen (which carries in one's trousers) to normal-looking retractables with pocket clips.

        The secret, it turns out, is in the ink itself.  It's actually closer to rubber than oil.  The ball-and-sleeve is machined to absurd tolerances to achieve a shearing effect on the ink, which is then rolled onto the paper in much the same way oily inks are.  The ink is too thick to work <em>without</em> the pressure, and the pressure without this viscosity simply results in a rapid oozing of the ink through the tip.

        A secondary benefit of the denser ink is the life of the cartridge.  I typically get more than a year (or two) from a medium point refill.  The refills are packaged with an adaptor that makes it possible to use them in Parker pens.

        <em>I had one once and found it did ooze the ink through the tip resulting in slightly splodgy writing. the often told [but false] tale that NASA spent millions developing a pen to work in space while the russian just used pencils still amuses me.</em> <a href="ObjectiveAdvantagesOfWoodenPencils.html">ObjectiveAdvantagesOfWoodenPencils</a>

        Over the last ten years I've had four faulty refills.  They have always replaced them at no charge.  I had one stop writing after nine months, two that leaked, and one that never wrote.  They simply handed over a replacement.
