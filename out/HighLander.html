        There were two sequels, which are <a href="MoviesToAvoidAtAllCosts.html">MoviesToAvoidAtAllCosts</a>: "Highlander II: The Quickening" (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0102034)">http://us.imdb.com/Title?0102034)</a> and "Highlander III: The Sorcerer" (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0110027).">http://us.imdb.com/Title?0110027).</a> There's even a DirectorsCut of "Highlander 2".

        The director's cut of the first movie makes a lot more sense then the general release.  I attended a convention where one of the producers of the TV series was commenting on their "gothic action-adventure Talmudic discussion".
