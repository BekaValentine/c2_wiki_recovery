        What Is Signal
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="SignalToNoise.html">SignalToNoise</a> is a popular concept. WhatsaDistinction between the two?

      <ul>
        <li>
           How about ... signal is that property of a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> that prevents its deletion?
          <ul>
            <li>
               A circular definition, but CircularDefinitionsCanBeValid, e.g. <a href="PageRank.html">PageRank</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A communication term used to signify a ratio between intelligent signal and random static in a received transmission containing both.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Thus useful in rating pages on a wiki, where objective facts and subjective opinions are mixed in the received transmission. But can also be applied where the noise signal is confusing and unclear, or not to the point as in <a href="ConversationalChaff.html">ConversationalChaff</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Signal refers to the content of a wiki page that is directly related to the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> and/or the relation of the page to the Wiki as a whole (e.g., category links).
        </li>
        <li>
           Signal is the useful/usable content of a page.  This will sometimes not seem to relate directly to the <a href="PageName.html">PageName</a>, but nonetheless provides useful content and/or context.
        </li>
        <li>
           Stuff that is <a href="ReFactorable.html">ReFactorable</a> to <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> (non-empty <a href="EigenPage.html">EigenPage</a>s), is signal. The rest is noise.
        </li>
      </ul>
