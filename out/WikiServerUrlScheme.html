        Wiki Server Url Scheme
      </h1>
      <p>
        A URL in the <a href="WikiServerUrlScheme.html">WikiServerUrlScheme</a> has the prefix <em>wiki-server:</em>. The rest of the URL is an ordinary URL that returns a page (probably in XML) that in effect advertises a given wiki server and the wiki script or scripts that it provides. The intention is that the user's browser will interpret a <em>wiki-server:</em> URL by reading the specified XML file and providing the user with options to subscribe to one of the scripts for the purpose of interpreting URL's in the <a href="WikiUrlScheme.html">WikiUrlScheme</a>. The user's subscription may be maintained locally, or it may be maintained on their own wiki server, the presumption being that they interpret <a href="WikiUrlScheme.html">WikiUrlScheme</a> URL's by passing the topic name to a script on their own server, which then checks which of the server's it is subscribed to have pages on that topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The server advertisement page would also contain URL's for files that list the topics that a server currently has pages on. By caching and occasionally updating these pages, a subscribing server or client can efficiently resolve <a href="WikiUrlScheme.html">WikiUrlScheme</a> URL's even when they have subscribed to hundreds or thousands of other wiki servers. -- <a href="PhilipDorrell.html">PhilipDorrell</a>.
