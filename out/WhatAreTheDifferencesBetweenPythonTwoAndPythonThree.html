        I have come across this in the context of the <a href="RaspberryPi.html">RaspberryPi</a> which has both versions of the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> in the installation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to install some packages which use <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> and need to understand any compatibility issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that the two versions can coexist on the same computer, but are there any issues to watch out for there?
      </p>

        Thanks for any replies.
