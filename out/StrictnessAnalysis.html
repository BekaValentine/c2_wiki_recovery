        Strictness Analysis
      </h1>
      <p>
        Compilers for LazyLanguages use <a href="StrictnessAnalysis.html">StrictnessAnalysis</a> to discover those portions of the code that must be executed, and implements this code using <a href="StrictEvaluation.html">StrictEvaluation</a>, avoiding the overhead with closure creation that is necessary to <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally one has to be careful about side effects.  Since you're changing the order of evaluation you may change the order of side effects.  Since is a major reason why LazyLanguages don't have side effects.
