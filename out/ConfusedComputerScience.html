        Confused Computer Science
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> has been confused. It has conflated two entirely different <a href="ModelsOfComputation.html">ModelsOfComputation</a> and put them both in the lexicon of CS.  For evidence of this confusion see <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a>, <a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a>, <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguagesTwo.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguagesTwo</a> (and One), <a href="TypesAndAssociations.html">TypesAndAssociations</a>.   If you can't make sense of it all, you now know why this page exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> got confused when Babbage's <a href="DifferenceEngine.html">DifferenceEngine</a> got lumped together with modern day computers (i.e. which are <a href="TuringMachines.html">TuringMachines</a> + <a href="VonNeumannArchitecture.html">VonNeumannArchitecture</a>). In other words: a conflation between AnalogVsDigital computers.  
      </p>
      <p>
        [Babbage's <a href="DifferenceEngine.html">DifferenceEngine</a> was not an analog computer <a href="NickKeighley.html">NickKeighley</a>]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Perhaps you're just being argumentative, but okay, let's not call it an analog computer then.  In that case, it's not a computer at all, but a machine doing <em>physics</em>, not computation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>All computers "do physics", if I understand what you mean by that, and they do computation.  That's true whether they're electrical, mechanical, digital, analog or some combination of all of these.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, computers (hardware) obey physics, physics does not obey the computer.  [Edit:  Do you say a <strong>car transmission</strong> is a computer, for example?]  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, (manual) car transmissions are analog computers that perform calculation of rational multiplication of a limited set of multiplicands.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Okay, then.  Apparently the source of confusion is the use of the word "computer".  When I say "computer", I mean a <a href="GeneralPurposeComputer.html">GeneralPurposeComputer</a>.  When you say it, you mean something more like a calculator.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>When I say "computer", I mean a computational device, i.e., a thing that performs computation.  You're thinking of a </em>'programmable<em>' computer.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>True.  No one said otherwise.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You did:  you said Babbage's engine was not a computer.  [Edit:  Sorry, again, this confusion is rooted around different semantics for the word "computer".  See comment above about <a href="GeneralPurposeComputer.html">GeneralPurposeComputer</a>.]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>No, I didn't.  Look above:  </em><a href="NickKeighley.html">NickKeighley</a> says "Babbage's <a href="DifferenceEngine.html">DifferenceEngine</a> was not an <strong>analog</strong> computer."  He didn't say it's not a computer.  He's addressing your assertion that there's "a conflation between AnalogVsDigital" computers and "Babbage's <a href="DifferenceEngine.html">DifferenceEngine</a> got lumped together with modern day computers".  Actually, Babbage's <a href="DifferenceEngine.html">DifferenceEngine</a> was a mechanical calculator -- in other words, a constrained, non-programmable, digital computer.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What I'm saying is that YOU are doing the computation:  when you look at the state of a <a href="AnalyticalEngine.html">AnalyticalEngine</a> <strong>you</strong> are putting the "equations" together coupled with the very <em>design</em> of the machine, which required so much flippin' foresight and "computation" that no one's been able to put one together.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [That's just silly. The Difference Engine produced a perfectly clear result, no further computation needed (if you added the optional printer you got a printed page! (actually something more like a type-set block)). The Science Museum in London has built a Difference Engine (two actually). Really if you are going to use Babbage's machines as examples couldn't you do some minimal research first? Wikipedia is a good start. <a href="NickKeighley.html">NickKeighley</a>]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Whether you use mechanical devices or electrical devices to create a computer, it's functionally equivalent.  The </em>'only<em>' difference is that it's possible to make electrical computers that are much faster, smaller, lighter, and easier to build than those based on purely mechanical action.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, it's not.  Because in the mechanical one, there's one more layer of processing done by the user.  It's akin to a slide-rule.  Does a slide-rule <strong><em>DO</em></strong> computation?  And here you see, why I reject your definition, not because you can't rationalize it, but because it simply is <em>less informed</em>.  Now go away.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>A slide rule is a manually-operated analog calculator (i.e. a non-programmable computer).  The </em><a href="AnalyticalEngine.html">AnalyticalEngine</a> was a proposal for a digital, programmable computer.  It would have been <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Okay, now you're drinking the kool-aid, sold by Britain (with respect and credit to Wyler's for "kool-aid"(TM)).  You're passing off the <a href="ChurchTuringThesis.html">ChurchTuringThesis</a> (which is really just <em>Church</em>s Thesis) as *fact* when it is a <em>thesis</em>, a theory.  The model of computation you're describing has no symbols, so formally it can't be said to be the same <a href="ModelOfComputation.html">ModelOfComputation</a> as a <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>, which is defined <em>specifically with</em> symbols..
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Huh?  Please read some introductory texts on </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and computer architecture.  It will help you understand our position, and why yours -- at least so far -- doesn't make any sense.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           And there you see the problem.  If introductory texts were sufficient, we wouldn't have 200+ pages of raging debate.  When you're ready for graduate school, find me.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I teach graduate study, and you've yet to give me any justification to "find you".  The 200+ pages of raging debate here are mostly between the people who have read the introductory texts vs those who haven't.  There are worthwhile, meaningful and intelligent debates -- with useful resolutions -- amongst those who have not only read the introductory texts but the advanced ones too.  Sadly, they aren't here, with the result that the lengthier debates tend to stay squarely at the 1st-year undergraduate level.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Graduate "study" -- that's about as ambiguous as "tutoring help". You teach the <em>status quo</em>. The 200+ pages of debate are people who have one point of view and people who have another.  There are not useful resolutions, only destructive ones.  Again, you are talking like an expert, but are not.  It doesn't matter if the whole Establishment agrees with you.  But you would know that if you had a real PhilosophaeDoctorae.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Please identify where I (and the others who disagree with you on this page) are wrong, and back it up with logical or empirical evidence.  If you are unable or unwilling to do so, we'll have to conclude that your criticisms are spurious and unfounded.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            "We'll <em>have</em> to conclude" (emphasis mine) <strong>is false</strong>.  You won't <em>have to</em> conclude, you simply <em>will</em> because 1) you don't understand, 2) are too lazy, or 3) are weak.  They are neither <em>spurious</em> (by fact that they arise after considerable and analysis and deduction), nor <em>unfounded</em> (by virtue that they are founded on a broader review of the subjects entailed).  Your problem is that you want find someone else to back up what I say.  And you don't feel secure enough to "jump ship", not because you can find anything wrong with it, <em>prima facie</em>.  So STFU.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>No, I want </em>'you<em>' to back up what you say, because otherwise there is no evidence for your assertions. Why should anyone believe you without evidence?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The evidence is someone using their life to propose something.  It takes energy to do that and risks losing one's reputation.  That is evidence enough.  You <strong>***"want""***.</strong>  But you do not deserve.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>You're not making sense.</em>

           To you.
        </li>

        <li>
           <em>That's right, to me.  I'm sure you make sense to yourself, otherwise you wouldn't be writing what you do.

Could you explain the relationship?<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Well, then, it seems just Top and me are "holding the fort"....  The relevance of the last statement is not about personal sacrifice as much as showing that there's "just cause" to question.  <strong>You</strong> want <em>me</em> to provide the evidence.  I'm saying that my effort to explain is justification for you to examine the argument.  If you want to lock yourself up in some private intellectual enclave of the Boundless, go ahead.  My effort to dialog should be seen as respect for your personhood.  I'm a bit aggrieved that you refuse to show the same.  But that loss hasn't been tabulated.  Anyway, moving along, tell me, how are you going to make a compiler for your Babbage Engine?  (I'll be looking forward to your bank of car transmissions compiling my C source for the Linux kernel.)

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>A bank of car transmissions is rather awkward to program.  There are obvious practical distinctions between a programmable computer built with rods, gears and levers and one built with microscopic transistors, but there are no theoretical distinctions.</em>

        As an aside, I believe there are three <a href="ModelOfComputation.html">ModelOfComputation</a> that can be enumerated: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           physical machines (composed of gears, etc.),

        For example's of each:  <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a>, DigitalComputers, and for the last see <a href="StephenWolfram.html">StephenWolfram</a>.  I don't think many have considered what kind of computation would be natural for such a model, perhaps some unnamed visual (non-numeric, non-symbolic) computation.

           Strangely, one finds this confusion surrounding the venerable <a href="DonaldKnuth.html">DonaldKnuth</a>'s idea of exponentiation of the zero; that is, zero to the zeroth power, which he set equal to 1, but it cannot be.  Zero times anything is zero.  This is a disagreement between basic algebra and limit theory for calculus (which is to say the numeric/symbolic domain vs. a geometric domain).  I put this little tidbit here to see if anyone else cares to examine why such a decision affects <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Your misunderstanding lies in thinking 0 to the zeroth power is zero times anything. A simplistic explanation is that it isn't doing "times" by the time it gets to zero. 2^3 is 2 * 2 * 2; 2^2 is 2 * 2; 2^1 is 2; so 2^0 is ...? In one interpretation, it's 1 by definition rather than by derivation. Are you in fact referring to 2^0 (two to the zeroth power)? The fact that it's 1 makes it trivial to (for example) convert binary to decimal. E.g., 11001 equals 1 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 equals 1 * 16 + 1 * 8 + 0 * 4 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 1 equals 16 + 8 + 1 = 25</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hmm, but what about this:  ln(0^0) = 0 * ln(0) = 0 * (-inf) =? 0.  Even if you don't want to want to except that it's equal to zero, it's clear that it must be indeterminate, yes (since 0 * inf is indeterminite at best)?  (Note:  taken from njguliyev @ math.stackexchange.com)

        The <a href="DifferenceEngine.html">DifferenceEngine</a> is in the same category as <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a> - neither use digital logic <em>or</em> <a href="BinaryArithmetic.html">BinaryArithmetic</a>, yet these are the "must-have", <em>defining</em> features of modern-day computers.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[Note: Originally, the above read "... </em>defining<em> features of modern-day </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>", and this was a response to that.] Neither "digital logic" nor binary arithmetic are "must-have", <em>defining</em> features of modern-day <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>. <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> is, by definition, the study of computation in <strong>all</strong> its forms. No basis in digital logic or binary arithmetic is required, though obviously both are as important as <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a>. You may be confusing <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> with computer engineering. In computer engineering, the majority of modern-day computer designs <strong>do</strong> depend on digital logic and binary arithmetic.<em></em>

        <strong>Okay, I think you and I must have a talk.</strong> If I turn a gear wheel 'round that turns a second, smaller gear, am I "calculating" or is it physics? Because I think we must draw the line somewhere. They do not have the same behaviors at all. Though they may share the same name "computation", they do not share a common computational <strong><em>domain</em></strong>. One will be constrained by physics, the other is not. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Computation is constrained by physics. Information does not travel faster than the speed of light. Information always has a physical representation, with a minimum energy dependent on ambient temperature (cf. Landauer's principle). What's with this widespread myth that computation is independent of physics? Computation is <em>mechanical</em>.

        Well then, perhaps biology is behind too, because I'm quite sure the DNA structure of fungi is going to be quite radically different than the plant Kingdom, even though the share the generic name of "life".

        What has made it even more confusing is ideas (akin to <a href="ChurchTuringThesis.html">ChurchTuringThesis</a>) is that people keep arguing that that each can be implemented in the other, so that "it's all the same".

        <strong>Stop right there.</strong> You are making a claim that is not true. This confusion <em>does</em> present an obstacle and are <em>not</em> equivalent, the exact nature of which I'm trying to elucidate.  Specifically, it is enormously expensive to design certain kinds of languages on some models of computation.  I'm not going to get much done with C on a LISP Machine -- if I could even write a compiler on it, simply because its design is for recursive models (akin to <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a>).

      <p>
        <em>I'm not convinced any serious confusion exists (casual pub-squabbles amongst equals don't count), and what is not an obstacle is basing a language on any particular </em><a href="ModelsOfComputation.html">ModelsOfComputation</a>.

           Turing completeness ensures that you can write any computable function.

Cellular automata are Turing complete, but it would be extremely difficult to write a usable operating system in one. Why do you imply such considerations are not valid obstacles?

        Among some computer scientists, you are right.

But these different domains, like say the one used for the <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> "engine" (a mirror in some way to the <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a>..?) were honed in the <strong><em>presence</em></strong> of these contradictions - they did not solve them. In any case, my consideration is for a <a href="UnifiedDataModel.html">UnifiedDataModel</a>, and these old domain (mal)adapatations are no longer tolerable and can't simply be waved-away to "get the job done".

Lambda calculus, Turing machines, cellular automatons, electrical, optical, mechanical, von Neumann cores and memory, FPGA computational fabric, neural networks...everything. <a href="MarkJanssen.html">MarkJanssen</a>, your view of the field is cripplingly narrow and limited.

           Quite, the opposite, sir.  It's actually very broad.  Do you know what you even mean when you say "computation"?  Do you mean adding numbers?  Do you mean interfacing with a user?  That's what computers do right?  What does it mean to add a number?  Is it a quantity being increased?  I'm arguing that you do not know as much as the field would confer to you.
