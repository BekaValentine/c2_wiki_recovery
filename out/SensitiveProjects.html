        <a href="SensitiveProjects.html">SensitiveProjects</a> are projects where the human problems are at least as important as the technical problems. We find this kind of problems in many disciplines.
        <a href="ManagingSensitiveProjects.html">ManagingSensitiveProjects</a> describes an lateral approach to them.

        If you have examples, I'd be grateful. I am writing patterns from my practice and from experience of an airport-builder, a minister who had to cut budget...

        I am currently managing a project with human problems. I would rather give the actual examples by email than in this public forum if you are interested. Our problems is in the areas of quickly ChangingRequirements, lack of EndUserInvolvement, UnstructuredInformationFlow and similar. I am writing a paper about the most obvious mistakes in this project which I may be able to distribute with permission from my boss.
