        I don't remember the good old days<br/>
        before this Wiki could delete.<br/>
        Pardon me while I enter the frays<br/>
        revealing my repressive streak.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        I'm a <a href="DeleteJunkie.html">DeleteJunkie</a>;<br/>
        I delete more than I write.<br/>
        I'm your topic police<br/>
        squad of one tonight.<br/>

      <code>
        If your <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> is too short,<br/>
        or your argument too long,<br/>
        if your humor too thin,<br/>
        or you ripped too much bong.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        I'm a <a href="DeleteJunkie.html">DeleteJunkie</a>;<br/>
        I get community spirit<br/>
        taking down poetry too<br/>
        'cause I don't want to hear it.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        I'm a <a href="DeleteJunkie.html">DeleteJunkie</a><br/>
        I know where you live,<br/>
        get my kicks with a click,<br/>
        and I don't want you to give.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        And I can't learn<br/>
        So I just burn<br/>
        Your low spiels<br/>
        Defying high ideals<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        I'm a <a href="DeleteJunkie.html">DeleteJunkie</a>,<br/>
        what you create I delete.<br/>
        You can't avoid my key,<br/>
        as it makes me feel complete.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        If you don't take the hint,<br/>
        and foolishly restore.<br/>
        My eyes shine with a glint,<br/>
        as I delete it once more.<br/>

        Brilliant! :-) Wonder if any <a href="DeleteJunkie.html">DeleteJunkie</a>s will get the hint....

        Just as it's easier to destroy than create, it's easier to delete than refactor. Deleting small pages is simply picking the <a href="LowHangingFruit.html">LowHangingFruit</a>.

        <em>Thanks, to </em><a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>, for mistaking as "brilliant" my attempt at DeleteBait. I was just taunting the deleters they can't delete me taunting them with terribly bad poetry begging to be deleted.<em></em>

        Delete Police they live inside of my head<br/>
        Delete Police hide out under my bed<br/>
        Delete Police they're coming to arrest me<br/>

        I'm so tempted to delete this just for the irony...
