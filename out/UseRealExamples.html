        Use Real Examples
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>This is a general point, not just a Wiki one.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a technical debate use real examples (preferably) from your own experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that someone cannot think of a real example to back up an argument suggests that the problem may not be very important.

        Specifically, in programming don't use <a href="FooBar.html">FooBar</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Absolutely right. And very difficult to do, in my experience. Most real world situations need  major abstraction and simplification to be squeezed into a normal example sized box. One important attempt at an exception to this rule was </em><a href="TexTheProgram.html">TexTheProgram</a> by <a href="DonKnuth.html">DonKnuth</a>. Does anyone know know the story of his interaction with <a href="TonyHoare.html">TonyHoare</a> at the beginning of that? And of how literate the result really was and how useful to people and for how long? Is the story already written up on Wiki anywhere? -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a><em></em>
