        A good (at least the best one present) entry point into that garden is <a href="TgpMethodology.html">TgpMethodology</a>.

        To the author of this page: What is the connection to the topics of this wiki? (See Following discussion)

        <em>Seems appropriately topical to me - software methodology. Would be nice to see more discussion, but perhaps that's what this page is an invitation to.</em>

        <em>The creation of further interlinked pages alone doesn't make it really better. I fear this might become a </em><a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>. But at least some links to external material indicate that the author tries to make some connection to the <a href="WikiBody.html">WikiBody</a> - but I still have the impression of <a href="WikiSquatting.html">WikiSquatting</a>.<em></em>

        <em>I think it can be assimilated, over time. I'm sure </em><a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> will slowly work their magic to allay your fears<em> -- </em><a href="AndrewMccormick.html">AndrewMccormick</a>

        <em>I've changed my mind. This is just shovelware. If the methodology can't be distilled into one mostly-buzzword-free page, it's not going to add a lot of value.</em> -- <a href="AndrewMccormick.html">AndrewMccormick</a>

        <em>It is pretty rude to call a page </em><a href="WikiSquatting.html">WikiSquatting</a> before giving time to connect. It is totally <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My point is/was not that it is not <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>, but that massive amounts of text are pasted into some pages, and those pages form a NotQuiteWalledGarden only provisionally linked with CategoryAgile pages (this has improved/is improving though). Also, I got (past tense) the impression that this was a disguised form of <a href="WikiSpam.html">WikiSpam</a> (with all those references to <a href="ArtwareSoft.html">ArtwareSoft</a>). Nonetheless, because it is <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> and other <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s have let it be, I will do so too. -- gz

        This refactoring is coming along nicely! A few more passes, and I might actually be interested in reading  ;)

        <em>It seems that you get quite something to read - the TGP </em><a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a> now consists of 15+ pages.<em></em>

        Hmm - one notices most the slick marketing buzzwords and general style. <em>Not just one</em>

        <em>I'm beginning to think I was mistaken in posting the following:</em>
        It seems to me too, that it could be related. I have been planning for some time to expand the explanation of how the <a href="BankOfMontreal.html">BankOfMontreal</a> screened its staff to identify those that could learn to program, when faced with the problem of building <a href="BmoMech.html">BmoMech</a> in the 1970s. I would be pleased to try to compare or contrast the historical and modern approaches. -- <a href="HansWobbe.html">HansWobbe</a>
