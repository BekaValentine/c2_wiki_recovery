        Theo Mancy

        Bringing about change in accordance to will via a god. Prayer and sacrifice are the usual methods.

        The efficacy of <a href="TheoMancy.html">TheoMancy</a> is questionable. Better techniques include hard work (ErgoMancy) and planning.

        Strange, I interpreted <a href="TheoMancy.html">TheoMancy</a> as employing and manipulating religion(s) to achieve one's ends. Scientology and "right-wing" <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a> politicians who scream about how capital-C-Christian they are at every opportunity are good examples.

        Is religious theomancy not the same as mid- and low-level managers who stick to a certain belief about "management" even though their decisions based on this "faith" produce crappy results?
