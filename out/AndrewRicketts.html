        So I was looking for function pointers in the Summer of 2010. One of the links led me to <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. I kept trying to close the tabs, but over the course of two weeks I only got down to one tab, and then it sprang back up to about 10 tabs. I was fascinated by the history of the lesser-known older brother of that other Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        I read up on Wiki Etiquette and some other things. I will Refactor this page shortly as my spelling is horrible. I have managed to spend three weeks and not check the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page and have simply seen where the links take me.

        Homework
      </p>
      <p>
        So I have this habit of making half-formed ideas that I develop later. Some work out to be very good and others should have probably never left my synapses. To reduce my rampant creation of random ideas, I will leave myself homework and a due date. If I, or someone else, have not contributed significantly to it by my self-imposed due date then... Someone show me how to delete pages.

        Greetings
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm trying to make it normal for people to leave greetings to personal pages that they visit. So feel free to leave greetings here and I'm always opened to suggested readings.
