        Funny Wiki Processes
      </h1>
      <p>
        A funny thought occurred to me while looking over <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>: if one detaches oneself a bit from the ongoing discussion, work or browsing of pages on Wiki, some processes become - well - funny.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Since I gave up following the DeletionWar over WikiBlackList some time ago, today I couldn't but laugh about WikiBlackList becoming deleted, some time later become undeleted and so on. From the perspective of <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>, this is like looking at some blinking led or something. See also <a href="WikiFlicker.html">WikiFlicker</a> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A slower "blinking" page is KurtCobainJokes, Every now and then, somebody googling for Kurt deletes the page (that is, I guess these are mostly external deletes as opposed to the <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> deletes above).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> updating <a href="AbandonedHomePage.html">AbandonedHomePage</a>s, which is like more and more leds going on and forming a longer and longer chain or line.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wiki after a downtime. Suddenly, a lot of pages appearing on <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wiki in the night (strange enough, given the worldwide web, the American night is meant). Sometime, there are bursts of edits by some <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>, separated by a 'gap' from the next burst. Again, best seen in <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           With the advent of <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> and WikiReductionism, one sees this common pattern:  An <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> page is corrected or modified.  This brings it to the attention of a <a href="WikiReductionist.html">WikiReductionist</a> <a href="QuickChangesJunkie.html">QuickChangesJunkie</a>, who then promptly deletes it (optionally labelling it <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> or <a href="PleaseMoveThisToTheAdjunct.html">PleaseMoveThisToTheAdjunct</a> first).  This has introduced a stifling force for any non-<a href="WikiReductionists.html">WikiReductionists</a> to leave pages to stagnate.  "The nail that sticks out is hammered down!" -- <a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course, many social processes become funny when one looks at them from an appropriate distance. I think, it must be somewhat like looking at a - more or less unusual - animal society.
        Probably, aliens looking at human intercourse would wonder about us that way all the time. :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        Historical note: These patterns (spotted sometime in 2004) are no longer present, probably due to the <a href="EditCodeWord.html">EditCodeWord</a> and other changes.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        With the advent of <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>, it is even easier to spot these processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiWikiSandbox.html">WikiWikiSandbox</a> is in constant turmoil. It is by far the most edited page and has always a long tail in <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>Work (renamings, additions) can be seen as long lists of pages with a small constant change in them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Each ongoing <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> can be spotted by its long tail of EditPingPong with its "+ - + - + -" pattern (or in the case of a DeleteWar by its "del, new, del, new" pattern).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           AboutAtheism was a very funny special case: it remained deleted some time, then came up again, and now has an accompanying AboutAtheismTrollFlag page. The pattern blink-blink-blink - pause - blink-blink-blink - troll-blink-troll-blink-troll. I can even hear Jingle Bells in that pattern.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The repercussions on <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> of the current <a href="EditWars.html">EditWars</a> remind of a thick dust cloud, that lies over the landscape of useful changes.
        </li>
      </ul>
