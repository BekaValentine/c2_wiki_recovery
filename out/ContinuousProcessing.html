        <a href="MonthEndClosing.html">MonthEndClosing</a> makes it hard to get up-to-date data, 
        since all data tends to be a month old.  
        <a href="MonthEndClosing.html">MonthEndClosing</a> tends to hide all the mistakes in the 
        data until the end of the month, and it is then hard
        to find them because they are buried in so much data and 
        because one mistake can mask the effects of another.

        <a href="MonthEndClosing.html">MonthEndClosing</a> usually has a lot of programs for checking 
        the consistency of data.  
        We could duplicate them for everyday use, or we could
        simulate month-end closing every day.  
        Even better, we could change month-end closing.

        <strong>Therefore,</strong> process all transactions completely as soon as they are
        entered into the system.  This amounts to posting them to accounts,
        updating the attributes of the accounts to which they were posted,
        and then checking for any dependencies or actions that depend on the
        attributes that are updated.

        I wrote some programs at the Cornell Campus Store that would
        simulate the checks of <a href="MonthEndClosing.html">MonthEndClosing</a>, and they had a dramatic
        effect.  Problems would be spotted and solved
        long before the end of the month.  This made <a href="MonthEndClosing.html">MonthEndClosing</a>
        go much more smoothly than it had before.  It also helped me to
        find some problems in my own code, and made me a lot more bold
        about installing fixes, since I knew that errors that I made
        would probably be caught by the checks that we were soon running
        nightly.

        Unfortunately, this duplicated a lot of checking jcode.
        <em>Accounts</em> avoids duplicating code by processing all 
        transactions right away.
        It only uses <a href="MonthEndClosing.html">MonthEndClosing</a> as a way of keeping people
        from changing data.
