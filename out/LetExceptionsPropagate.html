        Let Exceptions Propagate
      </h1>

        <em></em><a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: this is approaching the status of a <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a>.  Perhaps refactor into one of the canonical <a href="PatternForms.html">PatternForms</a>?<em></em>

      <p>
        <a href="LetExceptionsPropagate.html">LetExceptionsPropagate</a> is a call to let exceptions propagate higher up the call chain, rather than handling them right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reasoning goes like so: Code nests. Frequently, the core decision making code isn't at the "grunt-work" level of outer function invocations. Rather, core decision making code lies in deeper, more fundamental levels of the call chain. The decision making code should be informed of failures, and decide what to do with them, not the grunt-work code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore:
        Let exceptions propagate higher up the call chain, rather than handling them right away.

        <strong>Languages with Throw Clauses</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In languages that support "throw clauses," maintaining throw clauses can become cumbersome. Read <a href="HomogenizeExceptions.html">HomogenizeExceptions</a> to learn about the problem and a solution to it.

        The pattern should be used in combination with <a href="ConvertExceptions.html">ConvertExceptions</a> and <a href="HomogenizeExceptions.html">HomogenizeExceptions</a>; see <a href="AvoidImplementationSpecificExceptions.html">AvoidImplementationSpecificExceptions</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        An interesting case: <a href="InterruptedException.html">InterruptedException</a>.  For a thread to be interruptable,
        every long-running method it calls should declare <a href="InterruptedException.html">InterruptedException</a>.  When a thread is interrupted, the exception propagates up to the thread's run() method, which halts (perhaps logging an error).  In practice most interfaces don't declare this exception.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a method cannot let <a href="InterruptedException.html">InterruptedException</a> propagate, a workaround is to
        call Thread.currentThread().interrupt() and continue.  The interrupt will be handled the next time wait() or sleep() is called, which is hopefully responsive enough.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        A thread can <em>only</em> be interrupted by an <a href="InterruptedException.html">InterruptedException</a> when it calls wait() or sleep(), so making a long running method declare <a href="InterruptedException.html">InterruptedException</a> will not automagically make it interruptable.  Long running methods should call the Thread.interrupted() method to test if another thread wants to interrupt their activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to wait() and sleep(), thread can be interrupted by InterruptedIOException whenever it calls a blocking I/O-operation.
