        Code Obfuscator
      </h1>
      <p>
        A tool that mangles source code into a human-unreadable form without changing its function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Possible applications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Source code is a contracted deliverable and customer relationship has soured.
        </li>
        <li>
           Makes an interesting input to a peer review ... "Well, it <em>compiles</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Intermediate code language (.NET or Java) contains intellectual property.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Especially useful when the <a href="CodeObfuscator.html">CodeObfuscator</a> produces a key and is combined with a deobfuscation tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        A major problem with obfuscation is that stack dumps generated when errors occur are meaningless.  Some obfuscators provide (to the code author) a utility that allows the obfuscated names to be mapped back into the real names for this purpose.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The OpenSourceInitiative definition of <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> specifically excludes any project whose source code has been obfuscated.

        I once wrote a "variable substituter" that replaced meaningful variables and function names with hard-to-remember names.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before:
      </p>
      <code>
        result = countMessages(criteriaArray)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        After:
      </p>
      <code>
        ruwsgfk = kjwtpd(bjkjwwvc)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It had an optional "leave it alone" list for items that were not substituted, usually for external interface reasons.

        If you want to obfuscate your code, just use OOP :-) (<a href="CategoryJoke.html">CategoryJoke</a>, really)
