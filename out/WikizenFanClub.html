        <em>From </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>' home page, in response to unusually mild sarcasm from RK asking about Dave's taste in subgenres:<em> [3]</em>
      </p>

        Yay! This part of my home page needs more sarcasm! Years ago, I read every bit of science fiction I could get my hands on, without care, discrimination or selection. At one point, I helped fund some poor sot's drinking habit by purchasing, for the price of a crate of cheap vodka, his entire science fiction collection -- several hundred books -- and read every one of them. These clearly belonged to two subgenres: Stuff I liked and stuff I didn't. There is no identifiable pattern to what I like and what I don't, and if there are other identifiable subgenres in there somewhere, I don't know what they are. I read voraciously, but your average sample of illiterate trailer trash knows more about Literature than I do.

        By the way, you may find it helpful to note that I'm an idiot with a subnormal IQ. I may appear intelligent, but that's only because of my savant-like capacity for articulate writing. In fact, my interests -- outside of certain programming esoterica that (oddly enough) keep me amused -- mostly involve fast cars and beer. Attempting to engage me in something as highbrow as literature is a lost cause, despite the fact that I edited -- no doubt in a drunken stupor -- a page about science-fiction and fantasy authors. -- DV

           Truly masterful curmudgeonly jab; my hat's off to you. You should write a book on the technique you use. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        Hehe. Yes, that was a good riposte. Seriously, though, why should I answer an anonymous question like that? For all I know, he might have been asking "Is your browser vulnerable to a sploit I want to put on your home page"? -- DanM

           Also unusual was that RK's sarcasm was not uncalled for under the circumstances. In any event, Dave's response is masterful.

           "circle quadratures" is the key wonderfully sarcastic phrase, here.
