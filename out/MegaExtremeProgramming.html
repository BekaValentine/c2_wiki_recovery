        Mega Extreme Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        This topic is a place to explore how <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> can be used or adapted for very large scale projects.  This was a special topic in a general purpose <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> workshop held on 4/11/99 in PaloAlto. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Mega" is defined as problems that are very large in either cost ($25-200M) or in effort (more than 50 people).  
      </p>
      <p>
        We observed that it would be good to start the project with a regular XP team and stabilize the early user stories and the general structure or the system through a number of iterations before growing more teams.  How new teams are built/organized was an open issue (MegaExtremeProgrammingTeamOrganization).  Another issue raised by the participants was how <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s would need to be adapted (<a href="MegaExtremeProgrammingAcceptanceTests.html">MegaExtremeProgrammingAcceptanceTests</a>).

        Was this a workshop where people were discussing their experiences trying to adapt XP to large projects, or a workshop where people were theorizing about how to do it if they ever got a chance? <see revision above>

        How does <a href="MegaExtremeProgramming.html">MegaExtremeProgramming</a> relate to <a href="ExtremeProgrammingMayScaleUp.html">ExtremeProgrammingMayScaleUp</a> and <a href="LargeExtremeProgramming.html">LargeExtremeProgramming</a>?

      <p>
        Try breaking up a large project into a number of smaller projects that small teams can work on simultaneously.
        This is how <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> does it:  Windows NT is written by a bunch of small teams, each having about half a dozen people.
        You may need some form of "team code ownership" and formal "releases" of functionality cross-team.
        <em>This violates XP values, but it may not be as bad as you think because you can...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        On big multi-team XP projects, you might try pairing cross-team to make some changes.
