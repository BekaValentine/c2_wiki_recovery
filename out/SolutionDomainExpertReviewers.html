        What is the difference (in your mind) between a programmer and a software engineer? I consider myself the latter, whereas I think of a programmer as someone who simply cuts code and has no involvement in the analysis or design of the actual application. --<a href="KeithDerrick.html">KeithDerrick</a>

        Software engineers are either failed programmers or
        programmers who are stuck in hopelessly unproductive
        legacy settings, and need to compensate with a title
        that speaks to their FormalismEnvy.

        The term was first proposed (by <a href="PeterNaur.html">PeterNaur</a>, I believe) at an
        early conference as an intentionally provocative term
        that evoked the kind of discipline programmers might aspire
        to;  it wasn't originally intended to be a serious
        field of endeavor.  Some people still don't get the joke.

        I'm not sure that I follow how a recent graduate can be 
        an <em>experienced</em> programmer.  On the other hand, I 
        consider myself a programmer (and think of the term 
        software engineer as a synonym -- with apologies to 
        those who feel otherwise as I don t mean to offend).
