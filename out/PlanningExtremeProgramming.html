        Gee, I went to Amazon hoping to find a blurb about this book, and I find more information here on the Wiki.  So much for Amazon's helpful service... <em>How are they supposed to keep up with Wiki?</em>

        How is a reader to know when something in this book is no longer up-to-date with what is known?  In other words, is the <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">http://www.extremeprogramming.org</a> the final word?

        <em>Your experience is the final word. The community's ideas will always grow beyond what can be captured in any book-shaped snapshot. If there's something patently wrong or unworkable, expect to find errata here. Did you have a particular concern?</em>

        I want to know and try <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> by the book before I try modifying what is not even known yet.  So... in the context of <strong>doing it by the book</strong>, what is the final book or <a href="WebSite.html">WebSite</a>? Since Kent is known as the Alpha Male (see <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/xpVariation.html">http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/xpVariation.html</a> and search for "alpha male"), perhaps he is the final word for now?  -- <a href="MichaelFinney.html">MichaelFinney</a>

        Its probably fair to say that books written about very dynamic subject areas such as <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> should be good as a base to start from.  I'm hoping to get those books very soon
