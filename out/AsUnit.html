        As Unit
      </h1>
      <p>
        ASUnit is a <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a> written for <a href="MacromediaFlash.html">MacromediaFlash</a>'s <a href="ActionScript.html">ActionScript</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a serious-looking <a href="AsUnit.html">AsUnit</a> framework at <a href="http://www.debreuil.com/FrameworkDocs/UnitTestingOverview.htm">http://www.debreuil.com/FrameworkDocs/UnitTestingOverview.htm</a> - I haven't tested it yet, but wanted to put up the link so people can at least try it. -- <a href="HarlanWood.html">HarlanWood</a>

        <em>I just noticed the link to this page on </em><a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a>. I was working on something like this myself a few months back, and had a very basic version working well enough to be promising, but not quite well enough to use regularly. I've since been distracted by other things, but if someone else is attempting a <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a> for Flash I'd dearly love to see it. I'd also be glad to dig up my old code, if it would be useful. -- <a href="MossCollum.html">MossCollum</a><em></em>

        I was the original author of this page. Unfortunately, I may have misled you, since my version is probably more half-baked than yours. To be honest, I use the <a href="JunitCooksTour.html">JunitCooksTour</a> to learn how to program in a particular language, but that usually only works if I actually have a project coming up in that language. I haven't had a full-blown project in Flash yet, but I definitely intend to revisit <a href="AsUnit.html">AsUnit</a> when I get a chance to work on a Flash demo.

        <em>Actually, that sounds not unlike what I was doing, so our versions are probably both equally half-baked. I believe what tripped me up at the time was </em><a href="ActionScript.html">ActionScript</a>'s lack of support for exceptions.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I got sidetracked on the fact that if you try to call a function that doesn't exist (maybe you misspelled it), it doesn't throw an error of any kind, it just ignores it completely. Not that that should have stopped me, but then I got a real project.
