        C/C++ is a mythical programming language that in spite of its nonexistence is nonetheless frequently chosen for software projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term 'C/C++' can be legitimately used to refer to a codebase that includes both <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> source or code that is both valid C and valid C++, or perhaps a toolset that includes both C and C++ compilers.  It's also acceptable for indicating skill required or possessed, as in a job requirement or on a résumé.
      </p>
      <p>
        The erroneous usage is to suggest that there is a single language known as C/C++.  There is not.
