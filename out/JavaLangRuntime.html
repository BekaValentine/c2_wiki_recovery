        Java Lang Runtime
      </h1>
      <p>
        Every <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> application has a single instance of class Runtime that allows the application to interface with the environment in which the application is running. The current runtime can be obtained from the getRuntime method.
      </p>
      <p>
        While <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> has many Singleton-like classes, java.lang.Runtime is a by-the-book example of a singleton. 
      </p>
      <code>
        public class Runtime {<br/>
        private static Runtime currentRuntime = new Runtime();<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        /**<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Returns the runtime object associated with the current Java application.
        </li>
        <li>
           Most of the methods of class <code>Runtime</code> are instance
        </li>
        <li>
           methods and must be invoked with respect to the current runtime object.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        *<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           @return  the <code>Runtime</code> object associated with the current
        </li>
        <li>
                    Java application.
        </li>
        <li>
          /
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        public static Runtime getRuntime() {<br/>
        return currentRuntime;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        /** Don't let anyone else instantiate this class */<br/>
        private Runtime() {}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        'private static Runtime currentRuntime = new Runtime();' is a Java implementation of "Make the class itself responsible for keeping track of its sole instance." As those familiar with Java/C++ already know, the key word <em>private</em> means that only this class may access the field currentRuntime. The keyword <em>static</em> denotes that only one instance of particular field may exist. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first method in the class goes on to implement, "There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point." Both of these idioms are further reinforced by the privatization of the Runtime constructor, as the author notes in her comments.
