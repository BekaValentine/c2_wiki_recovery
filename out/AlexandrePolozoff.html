        Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people call me Alex.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an employee of IBM in the AIM Services group. I work on the architecture and development of large scale systems based on Websphere technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was introduced to Wiki's from <a href="WayneBeaton.html">WayneBeaton</a> and found <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a> in the process. This is an interesting use of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up until Feb 2001, I have worked as an independent contractor (since 1986). My work has taken me around the world but you can read about that at <a href="http://www.alexandre.polozoff.com/">http://www.alexandre.polozoff.com/</a> if you care to. I still have <a href="AspexInc.html">AspexInc</a> because I run a couple of WAP sites (see OfficeServant and FootballServant).
      </p>
      <p>
        I got my introduction to <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> on a Digitalk/V PM project in 1989 at IBM Austin. To the uninitiated that is Smalltalk on OS/2. I loved Smalltalk and what became known as <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> (it was inevitable someone was going to label it, with, fortunately, <a href="NotAnotherAcronym.html">NotAnotherAcronym</a>). We even prototyped os-level hyperlink capabilities into OS/2 years before the http protocol came into existence. But the world wanted <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>...
      </p>
      <p>
        I then floated around primarily in network management and <a href="TelecommunicationsManagementNetwork.html">TelecommunicationsManagementNetwork</a>. I got to do some interesting stuff here. And when the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> started up it was neat to see the same set of code run on different platforms.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll try and update this with more stuff... my testing below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I am testing
          <ul>
            <li>
               should be 2nd level and it is...
            </li>
