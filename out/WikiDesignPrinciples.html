        Wiki Design Principles
      </h1>
      <p>
        Wiki has turned out to be much more than I'd imagined! That is not to say that I didn't imagine a lot. These are the design principles I sought to satisfy with the first release of Wiki. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
        Note that this page is only a reconstruction from memory of intentions I held at the beginning. Additional principles, like server robustness, have been forced upon me.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Simple</strong> - easier to use than abuse. A wiki that reinvents HTML markup (<em>[b]bold[/b]</em>, for example) has lost the path!
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Open</strong> - Should a page be found to be incomplete or poorly organized, any reader can edit it as they see fit.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Incremental</strong> - Pages can cite other pages, including pages that have not been written yet.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Organic</strong> - The structure and text content of the site are open to editing and evolution.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Mundane</strong> - A small number of (irregular) text conventions will provide access to the most useful page markup.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Universal</strong> - The mechanisms of editing and organizing are the same as those of writing, so that any writer is automatically an editor and organizer.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Overt</strong> - The formatted (and printed) output will suggest the input required to reproduce it.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Unified</strong> - Page names will be drawn from a flat space so that no additional context is required to interpret them.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Precise</strong> - Pages will be titled with sufficient precision to avoid most name clashes, typically by forming noun phrases.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Tolerant</strong> - Interpretable (even if undesirable) behavior is preferred to error messages.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Observable</strong> - Activity within the site can be watched and reviewed by any other visitor to the site.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Convergent</strong> - Duplication can be discouraged or removed by finding and citing similar or related content.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are many Wiki authors and implementers. Here are some additional principles that guide them, but were not of primary concern to me.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Trust</strong> - This is the most important thing in a wiki. Trust the people, trust the process, enable trust-building. Everyone controls and checks the content. Wiki relies on the assumption that most readers have good intentions. <em>But see: </em><a href="AssumeGoodFaithLimitations.html">AssumeGoodFaithLimitations</a><em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Fun</strong> - Everybody can contribute; nobody has to.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Sharing</strong> - of information, knowledge, experience, ideas, views...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Comments:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Interaction</strong> - This enables guest interaction.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Collaboration</strong> - We believe that this could make a good collaboration tool, both synchronously and asynchronously.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Platforms</strong> - We like the cross-platform implications.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Social Networks</strong> - Its power for supporting collaboration is great.
        </li>
      </ul>

        In the list above <em>Unified</em> and <em>Precise</em> are the least generic and convincing points, especially if one thinks of how they apply to non-English wikis or to other engines like <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a>. Perhaps they can be reformulated as sub-points of <em>Convergent</em>? Cf. its opposite: «<a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a>:<a href="ViewPoint.html">ViewPoint</a> is nothing like a wiki».
