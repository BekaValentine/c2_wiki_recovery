        <a href="BusinessModeling.html">BusinessModeling</a> does not appear to be within the portfolio of <a href="StrategicManagement.html">StrategicManagement</a> in many companies, even though all companies have a "Business Model" they rely on, for their continued existence.

        Many of us would readily concur with the <a href="AllAbstractionsLie.html">AllAbstractionsLie</a> statement, but to dismiss the utility of something that is obviously flawed can be worse. It is like dismissing weather reports altogether because they are often wrong.

           The connection between <a href="BusinessModeling.html">BusinessModeling</a> and <a href="BusinessSystemsAnalysis.html">BusinessSystemsAnalysis</a> is minor.
