        From the <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> reference manual:
      </p>
      <p>
        "The <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>(R) language is a simple interpretive programming language with powerful graphics capabilities. Its primary application is to describe the appearance of text, graphical shapes, and sampled images on printed or displayed pages. A program in this language can communicate a description of a document from a composition system to a printing system or control the appearance of text and graphics on a display. The description is high level and device independent."

        <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> is not just a file format. In fact, it is not a file format at all, it is a full-fledged programming language in every sense of the word; <a href="DonLancaster.html">DonLancaster</a> has long been one of its most outspoken advocates.
      </p>
      <p>
        EPS (Encapsulated Post Script) <strong>is</strong> a file format, sort of, but basically it is just a simple wrapper around <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> programs that annotates simple things such as page boundaries.

        <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> the language was the basis of the <a href="NetworkExtensibleWindowSystem.html">NetworkExtensibleWindowSystem</a> and <a href="DisplayPostscript.html">DisplayPostscript</a>.

        <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> is an explicit postfix-operator stack language, as is <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>, but they are otherwise unrelated

        A while back I saw an example in a UK computer magazine of a <a href="MandelbrotSet.html">MandelbrotSet</a> generator that was written in <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>. You'd download it into the printer, and when it wasn't printing, it would generate the Mandelbrot fractal. Results could be retrieved via a bidirectional parallel cable.

      <p>
        <em>A friend of mine was fond of doing this in the late 1980s. Adobe hired him, and eventually a large percentage of their in-house printers were running Mandelbrot (and later Pentaminoe-solvers) in their spare time.</em>

        <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> is cool. I learned it from the books and used it to write a guitar tablature typesetter in PS some years back (<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/packages/TeX/support/pstab/).">http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/packages/TeX/support/pstab/).</a> It was written in PS to be <a href="WriteOnceRunAnywhere.html">WriteOnceRunAnywhere</a> because at the time, at least with the university-based 'net community, you were more likely to have access to <a href="GhostScript.html">GhostScript</a> or a PS printer than any particular computer platform. Output is fairly poor by todays standards but someone wrote to me from NZ to say it had been used to typeset a book of banjo music...since it was written from the start to support any number of strings. After that, generating the EPS diagrams for my thesis was easy! -- <a href="BrianEwins.html">BrianEwins</a>
