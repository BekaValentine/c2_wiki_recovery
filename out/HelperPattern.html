        Helper Pattern

        Context:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           One or more additional operations on a type are needed beyond what the type's interface supports.
        </li>
        <li>
           The language/platform you're working in does not allow dynamic modification of types as by a <a href="MetaObjectProtocol.html">MetaObjectProtocol</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Refactoring the type is inhibited because your project/team/company lacks <a href="CodeOwnership.html">CodeOwnership</a> over the type:
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="MoveMethod.html">MoveMethod</a> is impossible because you can't modify the definition of the type.
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="IntroduceLocalExtension.html">IntroduceLocalExtension</a> is not an option because either you can't modify the code that creates instances of the type or the type forbids extension (final, sealed, or otherwise not inheritable)
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="WrapperPattern.html">WrapperPattern</a> is painful because you have to write huge amounts of wrapping and unwrapping code dispersed throughout your project to make it work
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Therefore: collect the operations as <a href="ForeignMethod.html">ForeignMethod</a>s into an auxiliary class or module.  It's the wrong place for them from an <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> point of view, but at least it's the <em>only</em> such wrong place they end up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resulting context:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The operations against the type are split into two places.  Better than repeating stuff all over the place, but not perfect.
        </li>
        <li>
           You don't have to touch the code for the offending type.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Helpers may proliferate due to <a href="CodeOwnership.html">CodeOwnership</a> issues.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you need <a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a> you'll probably have to fake it with a <a href="TypeCase.html">TypeCase</a>; this is more of a <a href="MissingFeatureSmell.html">MissingFeatureSmell</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is a pattern in the sense that it is often a "least smelly" approach to the problem, and tends to reduce to a <a href="LanguageSmell.html">LanguageSmell</a>, typically the odor of compilation-fixed types with overtones of binary delivery.  A few languages manage to reduce or nullify the smell:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a> provide special support for this in the form of the 'class helper' declaration, the methods of which appear as additional methods on the targeted type.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> allows method categories to be tacked onto a type so long as they don't add fields
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> can usually be hacked to add non-virtual methods without breaking binary compatibility, but the cure may be worse than the disease
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> provides <em>type classes,</em> which are 100% statically checked and ensured by the compiler, but you're free to define your own type classes and declare <em>instances</em> of them, for <em>any</em> type, in any module.  This allows you to literally add functionality to any data type you need, as it's needed, without violating the type safety already established in other modules. <em>But this might not be the same kind of situation as in the article. The article talks mainly about OO languages which have a certain set of methods that "belong" to each class. In a functional language like Haskell, all you have is plain functions; they do not "belong" to a type; of course you can always define new functions anywhere that operate on whatever types they want. Not sure if this counts as providing new functionality for the type.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="NiceLanguage.html">NiceLanguage</a> does away with the call-time distinction between member methods and utility methods; x.f(y) could have been declared as f(y) within x or as a free f(x,y).
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> version 3 supports (non-virtual) helper methods where the first argument is tagged with 'this' as a modifier.  If you need virtual helper methods you're stuck writing a <a href="TypeCase.html">TypeCase</a>.
        </li>
