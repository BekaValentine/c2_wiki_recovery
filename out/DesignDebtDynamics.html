        This is the <a href="DesignDebt.html">DesignDebt</a> dynamics roughly sketched in diagram of effects. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ellipse represents a measured phenomenon.
        </li>
        <li>
           Clouds represent a measurable, not actually measured phenomenon.
        </li>
        <li>
           An arrow from A to B means : A increases B.
        </li>
        <li>
           An arrow with a gray dot means : A decreases B.
        </li>
        <li>
           Two arrow from A and B joining before C means : A and B have a multiplicative (non-linear) effect on C.
        </li>
        <li>
           A white square means A effect increasing B effect depends of management action.
        </li>
      </ul>

        In any attempt to describe the <a href="DesignDebt.html">DesignDebt</a> to people who are not very familiar with the non-linear sides of software development, the hard part is having the mere existence of such a <a href="DesignDebt.html">DesignDebt</a> acknowledged. Other points made in order to resist to or deny the <a href="DesignDebt.html">DesignDebt</a> effect include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Escaping the debt: This change will be the last, so we won't have to recover the debt in the future. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Confusion with <a href="TurnOver.html">TurnOver</a> effect. We'll keep the same people on the work so the debt will not be so high after all.
        </li>
        <li>
           Borrowing more: We need to get the job done, not the perfect design quality.
        </li>
      </ul>
