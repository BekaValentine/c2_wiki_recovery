        Hmm, I have serious doubts whether the idea of an <a href="XpFrame.html">XpFrame</a> is valid; it seems to be based on a misunderstanding of either <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> or <a href="ProblemFrame.html">ProblemFrame</a>s, or both. A <a href="ProblemFrame.html">ProblemFrame</a> relates more closely to <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>, and I would assume that there is more than one <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a> (eg it would seem there are at least <a href="EightSystemMetaphors.html">EightSystemMetaphors</a>) which suggests there cannot be one <a href="XpFrame.html">XpFrame</a>! The idea of an <a href="XpFrame.html">XpFrame</a> suggests that XP can address only a very small class of problems, and that standard frames such as the <a href="JspFrame.html">JspFrame</a> are excluded. In truth, many systems are better viewed as <a href="MultiFrameProblem.html">MultiFrameProblem</a>s. -- <a href="KevlinHenney.html">KevlinHenney</a>

        I agree that a <a href="ProblemFrame.html">ProblemFrame</a> is more like a <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>. This sounds more like requirements. -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        Excellent! Thanks Kevlin (didn't I attend one of your excellent C++ CORBA courses a couple of years ago?) and Robert. I think you're right, there isn't an XP frame. This realization came to me not long after starting this and the other Jackson-related pages. It's the idea of a <a href="ProblemFrame.html">ProblemFrame</a> that I'd misunderstood, I think. Anyway, its great to see your comments here since 1) I <a href="ReserveTheRightToBeWrong.html">ReserveTheRightToBeWrong</a>, and 2) maybe there'll be more discussion of <a href="ProblemFrame.html">ProblemFrame</a>s on Wiki now. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>
