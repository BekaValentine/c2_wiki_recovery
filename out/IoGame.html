        Io Game
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="IoGame.html">IoGame</a> is a game I wrote as an entry in the <a href="IoLanguage.html">IoLanguage</a> game programming contest. It is a multi-player web based card game loosely modeled on Target. If you play <a href="IoGame.html">IoGame</a>, consider posting your high score here. You can run up points forever so we are looking for high points per card averages too. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For information on the contest see <a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/blog/blog.cgi?do=item&id=43">http://www.iolanguage.com/blog/blog.cgi?do=item&id=43</a> ; to read a review of Target see <a href="http://www.enginuity.com/target-review.htm">http://www.enginuity.com/target-review.htm</a> ; for a write up of my experience and the source code see <a href="http://c2.com/~ward/io/IoGame.">http://c2.com/~ward/io/IoGame.</a>

        <strong>Q:</strong> But where can we play it?  Are you going to host it on the c2 server?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> I'd like to, but I ran into dependencies when I tried to install Io there and I've yet to figure them out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> And when can we see the source?  I get nostalgic for <a href="NewtonScript.html">NewtonScript</a> every time I read some <a href="IoLanguage.html">IoLanguage</a> source... -- <a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> The source, 1000 lines of Io, is available under BSD license from the ~ward link above.

      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> I am trying to host <a href="IoGame.html">IoGame</a> by myself with IoServer20051017. But <a href="IoGame.html">IoGame</a> does not start with error, 'Sequence: does not respond to html'. Is there a patch?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes. <a href="http://ruseel.cafe24.com/iogame/iogame.diff">http://ruseel.cafe24.com/iogame/iogame.diff</a> (broken link)

        I cooked up a new kind of unit testing while writing this game and wrote this report about it ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://c2.com/~ward/io/IoGamesUnitTests.pdf">http://c2.com/~ward/io/IoGamesUnitTests.pdf</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>from the paper ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This report classifies the various forms of unit tests present in a single application developed using an experimental unit-testing 
        framework for test-driven development. We find that there are 17 different kinds of asserts that fall into 6 broad categories. We 
        consider this diverse for a 1000 line application and consider it a confirmation of the utility of embedded unit tests.
