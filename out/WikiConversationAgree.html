        Wiki Conversation Agree
      </h1>
      <p>
        So the contributions on <a href="WikiConversation.html">WikiConversation</a> agree on some things, and this is the
        page on which to say it.  If you don't agree with what's here, <strong>remove it</strong>
        and pay a visit to <a href="WikiConversationArgue.html">WikiConversationArgue</a> to say why.
        That needn't stop us being a bit contentious here - to seduce someone into
        taking the topic off in that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's advantages in a threaded discussion that flow from continuity - I only
        need to read the bottom of the page (hey, who fancies threaded conversations 
        with the convention of additions <em>at the top</em> ?) 'cos I've already read all
        the stuff before my last post.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's advantages to a synopsis - I can catch up with what folk think about
        the topic without having to wade through all that vigorous contending, thesis
        and antithesis.

        What else might we agree on ;^)
