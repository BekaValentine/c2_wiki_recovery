        Page Printable

      <p>
        On the <a href="TechnicalMemo.html">TechnicalMemo</a> pattern it says, "Maintain a series of page-printable technical memoranda". To the question what exactly does "page-printable" mean? we have "It could mean <a href="PaperPort.html">PaperPort</a>. That is having the appearance of printed on paper, but not so wasteful - displayable as a page."
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea being specified as page-printable might be a puzzle to some, who have been immersed in traditional documentation.  Of COURSE documents are page-printable! They are maintained in MS Word files using the carefully designed and maintained templates held in the corporate technical documentation system repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after working in an agile team for a while a developer will learn that documentation takes many forms. As <a href="ScottAmbler.html">ScottAmbler</a> notes in <a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/agileDocumentation.htm,">http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/agileDocumentation.htm,</a> documentation doesn't have to be  a "document", as long as it communicates useful information about the software between project members.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key to understanding why the pattern would specify page-printable is to turn the idea upside down and ask "when and why would an agile project communicate and record information in a traditional document?"
