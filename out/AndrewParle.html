        G'day. I'm a programmer (surprise!) who thinks that programming is the coolest fun to have and is still amazed that people will actually <em>pay</em> me to do it. I started commercially while still a student (a <strong>long</strong> time ago - my first employer had just junked his PDP-8 for an Apple II) but only went full time after a doctorate in theoretical physics and a few years in a guv'mint institution researching software engineering. Finally decided it would be more fun/profitable to do it rather than research it or teach it, and haven't looked back since.
