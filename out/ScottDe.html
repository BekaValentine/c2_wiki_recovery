        What do I do? My father majored in math, he's in computers. My sister
        majored in math, she's in computers. I wanted to become a mathematician,
        so I majored in computers. But it didn't work. Judging from computer science
        departments, you need a Ph.D. in computer science before you can become
        a mathematician.

        So...what do I do...It's the first question people ask. I never noticed
        until I didn't have a good answer. Well, in a fit of wild optimism, I quit
        my job and set off to write the Great American Software Product. What is
        it? I've been working hard for a very long time, and you'd think I'd know
        - but I don't. Right now it is just a lot of code, not a product. A product
        solves somebody's problem. What I have is a nice framework for building
        diagram editors. I need to decide soon. I also do consulting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have built a couple of interesting pieces of software:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An automated microscope framework. I also built a specific microscope application using this framework. It was interesting work. It involved using image processing and pattern recognition to automatically find and recognize different things under a computer controlled microscope and camera. Most of my consulting involves image processing and pattern recognition.
        </li>
        <li>
          I built a 2D structured graphics/computational geometry library. I originally built it to use with my diagram editor, but it stands up well on its own. I am currently working on version 3.0, a major upgrade.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="SceneGraph.html">SceneGraph</a> based with nodes for layout, hiding subtrees, level of detail, clip rects, transforms, pens, etc. (and regular drawable graphics, of course).
            </li>
            <li>
              O[lg n] point hit testing (in progress).
            </li>
            <li>
              O[lg n] visible in rect testing (in progress).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A diagram editor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code for doing <a href="DoubleDispatch.html">DoubleDispatch</a> in C++ (useful for the visitor pattern). I've used this code in a couple projects and it works well. It handles inheritance correctly, has constant-time overhead, and can be used in a framework (no dependency between "node" and "visitor" classes). See <a href="http://www.determan.net/articles/doubledispatcharticle.pdf">http://www.determan.net/articles/doubledispatcharticle.pdf</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
