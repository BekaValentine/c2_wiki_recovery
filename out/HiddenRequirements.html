        Hidden Requirements

      <p>
        This <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> comes into play when system requirements are not adequately documented, either through carelessness, ignorance, or malice. <a href="HiddenRequirements.html">HiddenRequirements</a> often arise from use of <a href="SpecifyNothing.html">SpecifyNothing</a>; In extreme cases, <a href="SpecifyNothing.html">SpecifyNothing</a> can be used as an excuse to retroactively create <a href="HiddenRequirements.html">HiddenRequirements</a> in order to sink a project or damage a career ('Your subsystem doesn't implement the XYZ protocol?!? What do you mean, you "didn't know it was supposed to"?').

        [Note: This particular malady is easily defeated with an approach such as <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>.]

        If your work site is not amenable to advanced practices, getting things in writing is a big help. Not only does it help the recipient to be sure what to do, but the intimidation factor of getting an email that "here is what I understand the task to be" often gets the hider to come clean with requirements.

        If nothing else, it is good to be able to say: I sent you ten memos from August 10 to November 15, and you never mentioned the XYZ protocol once in your responses.

        <em>Perhaps that is true for full time, captive employees, but consultants need to employ these measures profusely. Nobody at the client's site is there to protect me. I am on my own.</em>

        <em>Of course, it helps to ask to see the architecture, design, and implementation notes </em><strong>before</strong><em> getting into a peat bog. If nothing has been written down before I am asked to start then I need to insist that I do some writing myself to make sure everybody is singing from the same hymnal. If management says there is no time for that then I need to decide if this is really a job worth doing.</em>
