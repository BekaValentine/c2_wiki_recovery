        Quote Mining
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="QuoteMining.html">QuoteMining</a> is the action of browsing current writings on a topic, and looking for quotes which will support a certain point of view. Using this method, almost any position can be supported, by deliberately taking the quote out of context to duplicitously show apparent support of the quoted authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is usually done using Google. Before the Internet, many have done it by browsing journals, magazines, and books.

        Well, some authorities in the field obviously hold a different opinion about quote mining: <em>Each and every one of these quotes was accurate and truly reflected the opinions of the authors</em> [from <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html]">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html]</a>
