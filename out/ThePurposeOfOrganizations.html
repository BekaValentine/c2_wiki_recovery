        The Purpose Of Organizations
      </h1>
      <p>
        On <a href="MoreEfficientFormOfOrganization.html">MoreEfficientFormOfOrganization</a>, there's a lot of discussion about whether we can do better than today's corporations. In order to interpret "better" correctly, we need to understand what organizations are for, and so what they can be better at.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that page, the following possibilities are mentioned for being better:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          	To make a return on investment // <em>make money</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          	To make a profit // <em>lots of money</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          	To be productive // <em>for as few people as possible</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          	To be sustainable // <em>for as long as possible</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most of the above are from the point of view of investors, perhaps. Other people might say they are to
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          	provide employment // <em>if we have to</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          	provide career development // <em>whaaat?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          	supply a product or service // <em>preferably just branded water</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          	keep their customer satisfied // <em>preferably addicted</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please add more <em>preferably without the over-cynicism</em>
      </p>

        On a wind up the libertarians note. The first group are the reason why capitalists start capitalist organizations, the second group are why states let them.

        This seems to be only about CommercialOrganizations -- what about NonProfitOrganizations??
