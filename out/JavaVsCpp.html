      <p>
        <strong><em>There are pros and cons to all of these, of course. Java and C++ fill somewhat different niches:</em></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           With C++, you can control what version of build tools will run your compiler. This gives you a lot more control than Java, where you may not know which version of whose <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a>/JIT your code is going to have to work with.
        </li>
        <li>
           Despite all that JIT stuff, C++ code is still much faster on average (this point is not so clear cut; discussion at <a href="IsJavaSlow.html">IsJavaSlow</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           C++ is standardized by a committee, and is not a political football (see <a href="CppStandard.html">CppStandard</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           C++ makes at least an attempt to provide genericity with its "templates", which are, although horribly difficult to use, at least better than casting from "Object" all the time (see <a href="UsingTemplates.html">UsingTemplates</a>). <em>This has been improved in Java 1.5 with it's generic/parameterized types.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           On a related vein, C++'s collection classes work at least with all basic types, no need for silly wrappers around "int" as if any half-semi-intelligent compiler couldn't provide them automatically. <em>This has been improved in Java 1.5 with auto-boxing.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           In C++, <a href="OperatorOverloading.html">OperatorOverloading</a> makes it possible to create custom types that behave like the built-in ones, whereas Java's built-in types are obviously God's last message to humankind, so they are set in stone. Of course, if you really want to fake your own class in C++ with an "int"-like protocol, you often end up overloading the assignment operator, the <a href="CopyConstructor.html">CopyConstructor</a>, and a whole herd of assignment-like things like +=, -=, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Integration with <a href="LegacyCode.html">LegacyCode</a> is far easier. Today, some <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> coders even bother to make their headers "<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> safe".
        </li>
        <li>
           Whereas C++'s standard lib doesn't handle things like GUI's and networking, it at least cares about basic functionality like formatting floating-point numbers. <em>(Java has had java.text.</em>DecimalFormat since forever, and printf since Java 1.5)<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           C++ has idioms for reliable resource management without need for explicit close/release methods, and treats memory the same as any other resource. <em>You mean rely on object destruction instead of release? You could do that but if you did start using GC its likely that all the non-memory resources would be exhausted first, java doesn't have release()-less resources explicitly because it uses GC. You can write code in java so that there is no </em>public<em> release() on a resource though.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Car Analogy</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Using C++ over Java is analogous to driving a manual car over an automatic one for car racing.
        A manual car is used because it has more control to make tighter turns to go faster, similarly C++ has more lower and finer level of control and can run much faster than Java.
        Its much more easier to use Automatic for the purposes to get to the final destination, similarly using Java can develop higher level applications much more easily.
        One can easily misuse a manual car compared to an automatic one just as you can easily crash in C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java provides garbage collection; C++ must account for all objects created/destroyed.
        Although, it's much easier to forget objects, it adds overhead of tracking objects, costing the software in size and memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects are referenced in Java where C++ has in addition pointers and value objects. Simplifying to have all referencing makes things easier but altogether passing by references, pointers and values are still valid and can be more convenient. Pointers can be much faster than references generally as it has little overhead especially when it is scaled.
        <em>This is a confusing mishmash of potentially wrong information.  Java "references" are much more analgous to pointers than </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>'s references.  "Value objects" have nothing to do with pointers or references, it's an OO pattern (<a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>).  "Pointers can be faster than references" isn't true in any case that I know of, because a pointer must be de-referenced before it can become a reference.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Java has simple single inheritance with multiple interfacing whereas C++ has multiple inheritance.
        It can resolve some problems of multiple inheritance and dilute the complexity, but multiple inheritance can still be more appropriate.
      </p>

        I enjoy and drive a 4x4 C++ but sometimes prefer to cruise along in a brand new Java.

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Having significant OOA/OOD experience I still <strong><em>choose</em></strong> Java over C++ because it makes me much more productive and lets me write safer, more bug-free code faster. In the cases where I don't need the speed and generic programming, it's a great choice. Its true that Java can't transform a bodge-job into a good project but that the facts that it forces you to deal with exceptions for instance and checks things like array bounds and forces you to think and write OO code make you write better programs. Is it the savior and the end-all of computer languages as Sun promotes? <em>No.</em> But one must separate Sun's hype from the reality. And the reality I've seen is projects written with Java instead of C++ are developed on the order of 4-5 times faster and have less errors.

        As a programmer, I prefer to use C++; it gives me great power and control. As a project manager, I prefer Java, as it's easier to get skilled developers and harder to shoot yourself in the foot. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        As a programmer, I prefer to use Java, for exactly the same reason: C++ gives me great power and control; But it also makes me pause more often and deliberate on the non-essential things. C++'s power is like carrying a cannon - very powerful, but rarely usable... I'd rather carry a swiss-army knife (Java) - does all the routine stuff quickly, and fits in my pocket.

        ApplesVsOranges it most definitely is! The comparison is over simplified. Example: "They eliminated manual memory allocation and deallocation" - is this a good or bad thing? If you answered good - you're wrong, if you answered bad - you're wrong. It just isn't that simple. You have to decide these things on a case by case basis, which C++ does allow BTW <em>(not so much allow as require</em>).
        The comparison implies that OO is always good, and other paradigms are always bad. If you think this, I would suggest you break out of your OO tunnel-vision, and read a few more books.

        If reading the paragraphs I've written below, note that mostly I've written a lot of Java code, and continue to do so - as a *language*, Java is weaker than C++, but as a framework it's stronger. The real considerations when choosing between Java and C++ for a project are nothing to do with the language features as such: stability of specifications (favours C++), availability of tools (probably now favours Java for many situations, but C++ for others), availability of competent developers (I don't know which way that goes), internal politics (CTOs are more likely to feel comfortable with the marketing-driven Java for some reason), and of course, irrational opinions. That said...
      </p>
      <p>
        "Java has no pointers" is untrue in any real sense. User-defined types in Java can be accessed via pointers only, never by value. <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a>'s name gives the game away. Java does not have arithmetic operations defined for pointers, which does avoid a large class of common C/C++ errors, but C++ has value semantics for UDTs, which avoids a large class of common Java errors (as well as often helping performance).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Java forces you to deal with exceptions" is somewhat true, but misleading. The most common exception to plague Java code is a <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> (because Java lacks a way to express within the type system the non-null nature of a pointer, whereas C++ can express it just fine), and <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> is one of the many exceptions which are "unchecked" in Java. Others include array bounds violations; in general, Java pushes checking off to run-time where C++ prefers to do it at compile time. One exception is that C++ doesn't do much compile-time checking of exception specifications, but Java doesn't do it in most of the important cases either. -- <a href="JamesDennett.html">JamesDennett</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> isn't common: either your objects are expected to be null, and you can simply check it without exceptions (if(foo==null){...}), or your code is flaky or untrusted and you need a condom around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, not checking <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> and the other <a href="RuntimeException.html">RuntimeException</a>'s is a good feature to have around. You shouldn't always need to write code that expects ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException's. Every method that accessed an array would have to declare (or catch) it.

      <p>
        This <a href="LanguagePissingMatch.html">LanguagePissingMatch</a> stuff is worthless. Both Java and C++ are excellent languages (as is C#, Smalltalk, and others) that each have very distinct and different roles in someone's toolbox. -- sg

        You People should not forget, that Java is a _platform_, same as Win32 or Linux or Mac. Java, that people generally relate to, is a programming language, a platform, and a big class library. Java was introduced with tremendous marketing efforts, and obviously a lot of people have fun programming it. 
        So it all comes down to the decision whether your solution has to run on the Java platform, so you use the Java language. 
        Java has a stronghold on the serverside lately, J2EE seems to take over very fast, and for me, when thinking of web-apps, I think about the Java platform and its advantages.
        The argument about Javas class libraries and its richness is quite an odd one, since a C++ user basically can use *any* API he wants to, from C to real C++ libs. So, it's nice to have a standard GUI, but on the other hand, how many GUIs are there for the Java platform in comparison to the GUIs available for a C++ Developer? 
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest advantage of java is the stability of the runtime (I know it leaks every now and then) and the ability to find a lot of developers quickly that can communicate on a same level.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest disadvantage is the platform itself, and the limitations of real-life problems I can solve and real-life products I can sell on the java platform. 
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ obviously has to be backward compatible all the time. Just look at how much code on your desktop is C or C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use whatever language that solves your problem best!

        Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. It matters how you use Java. Any language is a beautiful, marvellous creation of genius and allegorical brilliance, and just like a plastic toy can be destroyed or well-used by a baby, it is the acumen of the user/programmer/developer to make the flexibilty of the language. So, in my opinion, C++ and Java are having equal grades and so is any language.

           Array boundaries are easily protected; <a href="SgiStl.html">SgiStl</a> and most other modern STL implementations provide a debug-time bounds checking facility. Likewise most modern STLs will give you neat reference-counting pointer types, courtesy of operator-overloading, that prevent trouble. And anyway, who doesn't purify their code as a <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>?

           Just like macros, operator overloading is good. It's our friend. It lets us put good syntactic sugar in our code. It's even easier to abuse, but that's what <a href="ProjectStandards.html">ProjectStandards</a> prevent.

           Unions and typecasts ... well, okay, you got me there. Language warts. Necessary on occasion because of assymetries inherited from C. But minimize and encapsulate their usage, and they're no trouble either.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Typecasts are not warts, they are necessary for the tasks that C/C++ are designed for. Ok, C pointers confuse three different concept - language-level pointers, low level addresses and iterators - but the basic mechanisms are available in all system programming languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the best implementation of pointers vs addresses is that of Modula-3. One needs to import a specific module to be able to get and manipulate the low-level addresses of objects. Also, modules can be marked as safe or unsafe, depending on whether the API allows one to break the type system by using these low-level features.

        <a href="DeviceDriver.html">DeviceDriver</a>s. Gotta love 'em. I've written them in Assembler, C, and C++ (oh, yes, also Forth).
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually prefer assembler (oh, yes, and Forth).
      </p>
      <p>
        Have used C for more (and more varied) drivers than I have assembler, but still, assembler is *the* driver language (oh, yes, along with Forth).
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ (IMO) really wasn't made for driver stuff, although it acquits itself well in that context. I've done some multi-threaded stuff in it for serial and sockets data acquisition, and I could just have easily written that in C. However, when I had to write an XML DOM package, C++ began to make more sense.

      <p>
        The idea that an abstraction *must* be better than having pointers leans too much in the "protect silly programmers from their own shortcomings" direction.

      <p>
        It is my belief that you're not supposed to have unskilled programmers. Yes, give me a tool that can pull a bearing without forcing all the mechanics of that exercise on me, but don't hide all my drills, wrenches (spanners), and screwdrivers in the process.

        The main problem with Java is that it enables automatic managament for memory, while making automatic managament for other resources practically impossible. See <a href="http://www.hackcraft.net/raii/">http://www.hackcraft.net/raii/</a>

        <em>Not true! Locks are also cleaned up automatically using syncrhonized blocks.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although, when it comes to system programming like device driver, C++ is must, I like structured and standard ways of dealing with string and other utility classes in java.

        I don't know what it is about Java - it just feels too much like an interpreted language to me, due to the whole code to bytecode transformation. How is reading the bytecode <em>really</em> any different to reading the source? It's just like separating between reading human-readable codes and reading machine-readable code. Byte-code is called "machine independent", but machine independent code generated from one source requires that source to be machine independent too! In essence, unless there are levels of hardware which read the Java byte-code for themself (as someone mentioned above), it's practically an interpreted language.
        It just feels wrong to me. -- ArlenCuss

        Try reading <a href="TheDragonBook.html">TheDragonBook</a>, it may change your perspective...

      <p>
        <em>Actually according to </em><a href="TheDragonBook.html">TheDragonBook</a> (chapter 1.1) interpreter is a program that takes as input some source program and its input and executes it to produce output. So by this definition Java virtual machine is definitely an interpreter. Well, you save execution time because you don't do syntactic and lexical analysis, but no one said the compiler must do them either. -- YakovGalka<em></em>
