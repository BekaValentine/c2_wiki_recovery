        Kent is an excellent teacher. He is patient and knows how to lead people to understanding. Patterns are about conveying knowledge, this is also known as teaching. Therefore, Kent is good at writing patterns and teaching. <a href="mailto:sdrew@pulsar.sps.mot.com">mailto:sdrew@pulsar.sps.mot.com</a>

        I met Kent at OOPSLA 97 in Atlanta. He and <a href="ErichGamma.html">ErichGamma</a> did a tutorial called "AdvancedDesignWithPatternsAndJava". Great job! They left me with the impression that they were seriously considering collaborating on a new book on Patterns and Java. I wonder what is the status of the JavaAndPatternsBook?

      <p>
        I gave that one talk but never really followed up. I think the design principles in the <a href="PermaCulture.html">PermaCulture</a> world are far more advanced than those in the software world and I would love to learn to apply them to software. However, I figure I should stop killing trees with my beginning attempts at <a href="PermaCulture.html">PermaCulture</a> first.

        Kent, I noticed that you're an ENTJ and began to wonder how one might capitalize on available MBTI in attempts to build hypereffective XP teams. Are you (or is anyone else) aware of empirical or anecdotal data which might suggest patterns for building highly compatible XP teams? At the very least, the creation of a set of unbiased type-centric patterns (or anti-patterns) could be established and shared which might offer insight in how extra "extremeness" can be wrung from a team composed of highly compatible players. Any thoughts on the relevance of such an idea or if it even makes sense in the context of human factors when applied to agile methods? -- BillCraun

        Professor MichaelHolcombe at the UniversityOfSheffield has been working with the Department of Work Psychology to measure the psychological and emotional effects of working XpStyle.

        Kent, please make the text from the "The Metaphor Metaphor" presentation available (OOPSLA 2002). The discussion of the use of the war metaphor in our attempts to fight terrorism as opposed to a disease model are important and timely -- WatsonCrick

        "Go out of one's way to do something that may be harmful" and "worry needlessly"
        So I went to the OED2 - <a href="http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50025423">http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50025423</a> (borrow v.1.b.) endorses the first definition, as a U.S. colloquialism.  It seems well attested (back to 1854), but it is no wonder non-US English speakers are unfamiliar with it.  I marked up the <a href="BorrowingTrouble.html">BorrowingTrouble</a> page appropriately.
