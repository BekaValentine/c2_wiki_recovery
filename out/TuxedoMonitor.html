        Anybody knows whether Tuxedo is used much in a <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> shop (i.e. no significant <a href="JavaPlatform.html">JavaPlatform</a> presence) for transaction management purposes? And what advantages one can get over the "free" MS equivalent?

        Tuxedo is now an <a href="OracleCorporation.html">OracleCorporation</a> product since BEA was bought by Oracle.
