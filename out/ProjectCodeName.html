        Project Code Name
      </h1>
      <p>
        How do your code-name your projects?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm trying to think of a nice code name for the project so I don't have to type "Barcode Terminal Service for Oracle Applications 10.7" over and over and over again. I thought about: some random anime character, a word out of the dictionary... but perhaps a project code name should have at least some semantic resemblance to the project's purpose. Or maybe I'm just putting too much thought into it, period. :-)

        <em>Just pick an easily pronounceable anime character name. There are enough of them... Giant Robo, A-ko, Lina Inverse, Gally, Lain, San, Rei, Setsuna, Nene, Rabby, etc.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Or rearrange your acronym to be pronounceable.  For example, BTS for OA 10.7 becomes BOATS 10.7, or even just BOATS.</em>

        <em>Name it anything at all, except an acronym.  If you're an anime fan, follow the above advice, for it will serve you well. -- </em><a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a><em></em>

        Do like machine names - pick a theme and run with it.  We've used National Parks, and cars.  Or pick interesting words and <a href="BackroNym.html">BackroNym</a> them. --<a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>
