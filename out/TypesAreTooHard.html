        Types Are Too Hard
      </h1>
      <p>
        What is so hard about understanding types and their advantages in programming?
      </p>
      <p>
        I hate to resort to an analogy, but since <a href="TypesAreTooHard.html">TypesAreTooHard</a> for some to understand, I will regretfully resort to an analogy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a child sees fruit in the fruit bowl
        </li>
        <li>
           the child notes different types of fruit in the bowl
        </li>
        <li>
           the child sees advantages of distinguishing between different <strong>types</strong> of fruit
        </li>
        <li>
           not every fruit is the same type, nor is each fruit a string or blob, they are different fruits with different properties and classifications
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The child then becomes a programmer when he has reached the age of 18 years, now an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
        The adult sees the advantage of type systems for the same reasons we see advantages to distinguishing different fruits in the fruit bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
        The adult is not a <a href="HostileStudent.html">HostileStudent</a> who rejects types; he understands types both at a programming level, and at a real world level. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different <strong>types</strong> of fruit. This is a fact. ThereAreTypes
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As somebody who likes "type-light" languages, I don't disagree that "types are useful", at least to varying degrees. My disagreement is that there is </em>'no clear-cut consensus definition<strong>. </strong><a href="DefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfLife</a> and <a href="WhatIsIntent.html">WhatIsIntent</a> illustrates other concepts we commonly use but don't necessarily have a clear-cut definition. We may agree most of the time, but there are often border-line cases or ambiguities. In short:<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        Fuzzy != Useless<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>As far as type-light versus type-heavy programming, we already have plenty of topics on that. Let's not duplicate those debates all over this wiki if possible. And I don't appreciate your name-calling. It's unprofessional. Perhaps I've done similar at times, but two wrongs don't make a right. -t</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Another Example</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Different types of files exist on your computer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some files are PNG, JPG, and others TXT. Having different <strong>types</strong> of files is useful. <strong>Extremely useful</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Logically we therefore conclude that ThereAreTypes and they are very very useful for humans (and computers).
      </p>

        <em>That can also be considered an attribute. Further, we can have other "dimensions", such as "image usage type": icon, thumbnail, photograph, facial portrait, illustration, etc. Where's the borderline? Just about every other image attribute could be "seen" as a "type" or as an "attribute": size, orientation, border "type", border color, shadow type, shadow depth, link technique, rollover behavior, etc. And I disagree it is "logical" because it hasn't been subjected to the scientific method.</em>
