      </h1>
      <p>
        Born Barnstaple, UK, 1973.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now live in Cheltenham PA, USA, about four blocks from Philadelphia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Desperately trying to get myself out of a <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> career hole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Married with 2 year old daughter, with another child being released June 2003.

      <p>
        I have a green card (in case anyone wants to offer me a job :) )
      </p>
      <p>
        From 1990 to 1997 I worked at what is now called Qinetiq, the scientific research agency of the UK Ministry of Defence.

        After that I moved to <a href="UnitedStatesOfAmerica.html">UnitedStatesOfAmerica</a>, and have since been introduced to a different style of software development - ie, the style favoured by those who can't code and don't know anything about computers.  That alone wouldn't be so bad, the true annoyance is the attitude that it is in fact a bad thing to pursue those qualities.
