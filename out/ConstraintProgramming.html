        Constraint Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DeclarativeProgramming.html">DeclarativeProgramming</a> paradigm/technique where a problem is specified in terms of a <em>constraint system</em> (a set of variables and their respective domains, and list of predicates ranging over the variables which must be true of all of them), and a type of <a href="TheoremProvingSystem.html">TheoremProvingSystem</a> called a <em>constraint solver</em> is employed to find solution(s) (a set of values which satisfy all constraints) to the problem.

        A good introduction is <a href="PrinciplesOfConstraintProgramming.html">PrinciplesOfConstraintProgramming</a>.

        Constraint programming is an emergent software technology for declarative description and effective solving of large, particularly combinatorial, problems especially in areas of planning and scheduling. See also <a href="ConstraintModels.html">ConstraintModels</a> and <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a>.

        <em>Since it's been around for decades (e.g. </em><a href="IvanSutherland.html">IvanSutherland</a>'s <a href="SketchPad.html">SketchPad</a>), or even longer in pure math, why is it "emergent"? Is there some measure of popularity that it just achieved?<em></em>

        Just quoting <a href="http://kti.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/constraints/">http://kti.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/constraints/</a> , probably I should have made it clear?
        Anyway I think that it is _emerging_ now. Operational Research is strictly related to CP, and new general purpose languages such as <a href="AliceLanguage.html">AliceLanguage</a> or <a href="OzLanguage.html">OzLanguage</a> integrate constraint programming as a building block.
        Traditional languages also are getting their CSP packages, I just stumbled across a package for Java and one for Python in the last week, and various <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> implementations such as GnuProlog integrate modules to do CSP.

        Finally I can see the growing of groups such as CoLogNet, the Constraint Programming Organizing Committee, and the Constraint Programming Industrial Association.

        What's the difference between this and <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>, humans program both the constraints and solution to those constraints, and the language implementation checks that the solution is valid. In <a href="ConstraintProgramming.html">ConstraintProgramming</a>, you specify only the constraints, and the language implementation finds the solution for you. In <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>, the purpose of constraints is to ensure correctness. In <a href="ConstraintProgramming.html">ConstraintProgramming</a>, the constraints ARE the program.

        See <a href="http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/euler_9.mzn">http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/euler_9.mzn</a> for an example in <a href="MiniZinc.html">MiniZinc</a> of a solution to ProjectEuler problem 9. Notice that there are no loops anywhere, and only the
        output section contains anything imperative. <a href="MiniZinc.html">MiniZinc</a> translates the constraints into a form that can be understood by a constraint solver, and after it is solved, converts the solution according to the format given in the <a href="MiniZinc.html">MiniZinc</a> program.
