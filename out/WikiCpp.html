        Platforms are still EGCS or VC++, and any Web server that does CGI. Any deviations of my code from Standard C++ (plus CGICC) would interest me.

        The client agent is any HTML browser. However, if you use <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 4 or greater, you can edit the pages as rich text (<a href="WysiWyg.html">WysiWyg</a> style). Try it. I use it all the time at work. My colleagues' minds are blown. They think I have this Web site on my workstation that grows all the times and answers all their questions, and I can update it from anywhere.

        Wiki++ uses pristine Standard ANSI/ISO C++, CGICC, and some cool libraries I'm working on whenever I can manage to get sacked.

        This is an interesting concept.

        <em>Thanks. But going from a 1 dimensional to 2 dimensional interface increases the UI burden by an order of magnitude...</em>

        This project is generally abandoned. I'l turn over the keys to anyone with a <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a> account and a Windows computer anywhere in their life. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        There is a version called Wiki++ at <a href="http://www.eelpi.gotdns.org/Wiki.html">http://www.eelpi.gotdns.org/Wiki.html</a> - minor modifications to make it easier to paste in C++ code.

        Which burden was that? The programming burden? The processing burden? <em>The </em><a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> burden. The burden that one spend time tweaking the details via the UI instead of just authoring wiki content.<em></em>

      <p>
        Neither is actually the case -- <em>Nothing is quite so damaging to a good theory than an inconvenient fact...</em>

        Why is styling markup available in regular wikis? Presumably because it's considered a desirable feature. But there is a burden - remembering the syntax. This burden is removed in a good <a href="WysiWyg.html">WysiWyg</a> <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a>.
