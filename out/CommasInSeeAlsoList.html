        Commas In See Also List
      </h1>
      <p>
        There seems to be a low-level <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> going on in this wiki between putting comma's between topic names in "See Also" lists often found at the bottom of topics, and between only separated them with a space. I personally prefer comma's, they make it easier for my particular set of eyes to read. But, how about we vote?

        Comma's:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No Comma's:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
