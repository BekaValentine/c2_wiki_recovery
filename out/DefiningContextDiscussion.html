        Defining Context Discussion

        <em>Purpose (WhatForWhy)</em>

        The original context of this pages seems to be a technical computing one, but it seems to me that the discussion can be widened to include in the context the ways in which the writer wishes to influence the readers. This widens further if the item is to be broadcast via the internet or even a radio interview.  Purpose can then include some wider objectives.

        Many of these can be heard in the course of interviews with political figures or in political satire.

        <em>Expanding the context of (Who), one might also apply the list as used in interviews of sports figures, or of business figures, or of religious leaders, in fact of almost any one of renown in a specialty area, and within a more immediate context -- this wiki, of Wikizens. In the above list, it appears that half of them fulfill under the context of (Why) the use to discredit, defame or disrespect. </em> -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

        Context also has a meaning within a computer program, for example each member exists within the context of its class (and its object if instantiated). Each column exists within the context of its table. TechnicalContext? -- <a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>
