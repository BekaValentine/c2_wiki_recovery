        There is a lot of latitude in html to make different kinds of space. So I want to make<br/>
        it clear when you've entered or left this space. There are many doors leading both in <br/>
        and out. That's why it has identity.<br/>

        Remember when URLs pointed to Web pages filled with static text and images? How simple<br/>
        and quaint to put all information in a network of separate Web pages called a website. <br/>
        New Web apps are front ends to large databases filled with content. When the Web app <br/>
        wants information, it pulls it from the database and pours it into the local mold. <br/>
