        Two Hours Two Weeks Or Two Months

        It is said <em>(source, please?)</em> for every feature there is a two hour, a two day and a two week version.

        I believe <a href="SteveMcConnell.html">SteveMcConnell</a> said this in <a href="RapidDevelopment.html">RapidDevelopment</a>, and used the example of a graphing subsystem. You can hardcode the colors (for the individual bars/lines) and symbols for points (star, cross, etc.), which is the 2 hour version, or you can use an increasingly more flexible scheme, up to where you have a GUI for choosing colors & symbols (the 2 week version).
