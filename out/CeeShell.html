        Cee Shell
      </h1>
      <p>
        C shell is a common <a href="UnixShell.html">UnixShell</a>, whose command language is alleged to resemble <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>. In truth, it bears only a superficial resemblance to the C language.

      <p>
        C shell is a very popular interactive shell; one of the common Unix <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>s is C shell vs <a href="KornShell.html">KornShell</a>. (The <a href="BourneShell.html">BourneShell</a>, at least traditional implementations of it, is often regarded as a lesser shell for interactive purposes; kept around mainly for root to use when bootstrapping or repairing a system; many initialization utilities and scripts depend on the <a href="BourneShell.html">BourneShell</a>).

        As a <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>, however, the <a href="CeeShell.html">CeeShell</a> is widely regarded as terrible. It has been the subject of at least one <a href="ConsideredHarmful.html">ConsideredHarmful</a> paper; its flaws are legendary. Its syntax is unforgiving; the diagnostics are terrible, and many of its semantics are baroque or just plain broken.
