        Of the co-producers, one is familiar with Unix systems programming, business plans and presenting technical material to non-technical audiences. The other, meanwhile, is knowledgeable regarding psychology, elements of story and presentation to a general audience. Both are experienced with differing aspects of film-making and the related industry.

        <strong>Q:</strong> The working title `Forest versus Trees' is in reference to other disciplines losing sight of one for the other. What does this title mean to you? Does it apply?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It does apply, but it risks alienating the cautious doubters. "Well, you may have doubts about <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, but you're just missing the forest for the trees."

        <em>As an isolated comment, yes, it risks alienating the audience. The full context is that while working on a project, </em><a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> helps the team achieve the task. Through pairing, one individual focuses on the big picture (the forest) while the other deals with certain details (the trees). This will be explained early within the presentation.<em></em>

        This last group, Booch, Rumbaugh, Jacobson... They are generally well respected software engineers, and rightly so, but there is a clear conflict of interest here. They run RationalSoftware, and have to protect RUP. Also, I don't think that Weinberg or <a href="DeMarco.html">DeMarco</a> would be critical of XP. I think that one of the best critics I've spoken to in recent years is <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> - he's a fan of XP, but not a sheep. -- <a href="BryanDollery.html">BryanDollery</a>

        How about <a href="BarryBoehm.html">BarryBoehm</a>. He just recently commented on XP in IEEE Software I believe.

        I suggest the team working on the <a href="XpDocumentary.html">XpDocumentary</a> find and read <a href="TheSoulOfaNewMachine.html">TheSoulOfaNewMachine</a>, by <a href="TracyKidder.html">TracyKidder</a>. Similarly, read some of the books by BobWoodward, of Watergate fame. Interestingly enough, Kidder's next book was "House" - following the same approach. Very appropriate, given the metaphor you suggest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then please consider following a similar methodology. In other words, go find an Xp project and become a fly on the wall. Follow it from start to finish, as an observer. Then create the <a href="XpDocumentary.html">XpDocumentary</a> from what you learn. I think the entire industry might benefit from a reasonably objective documentary of a real project and project team, told by narrator who has no particular axe to grind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, I encourage you to resist the temptation, apparently lurking in these pages, to jump into "metaphors that [have]major problems" in order "[get] non-technical people to understand". This is bad education practice, bad communication practice, and bad business. Your prospective audience will likely leave shaking their heads and wondering what you wanted them to remember and what you wanted them to forget.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, show your audience something real. Give them something they leave wanting to tell their friends about. The C3 project was a genuine success story, and its reality was an important part of establishing the credibility of Xp as a whole.

        Agreed! Actions speak louder than words. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a project already in the works to serve the purpose of demonstration.  The documentary will feature elements of that project from beginning to end.

        I'm familiar with <a href="TheSoulOfaNewMachine.html">TheSoulOfaNewMachine</a>. I understand your point.

        The metaphors were to be used for setting up the demonstration for non-technical audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you feel non-technical audiences can get by without metaphor?

        Who is the intended audience for this documentary? The top of the page says "a wide audience", but just how wide? Is this documentary targeted at "business decision makers", or is it truly for a general audience (people who watch Nova, for example)? -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

      <p>
        Yes. The PBS (US) or BBC (UK) viewer is the profile.
