        Sarcastic Guy
      </h1>
      <p>
        Played by David Foley in a "Kids in the Hall" skit:

      <p>
        You have to see/hear the skit to fully appreciate it.

        My point in adding this page:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The skit is funny
        </li>
        <li>
           Shows how harmful sarcasm can be if taken to extremes
        </li>
      </ul>

        I don't understand how <a href="BrutalSarcasm.html">BrutalSarcasm</a> could ever be useful when communicating with a fellow programmer. What is wrong with just saying - "this is the wrong way to do this and here's why"?

        Use of <a href="BrutalSarcasm.html">BrutalSarcasm</a> puts you dangerously close to falling into this category: <a href="MicromanagingSadist.html">MicromanagingSadist</a>

        There was a similar character on TheMaryWhitehouseExperience (a UK comedy series of the early '90s), called Ray (first seen on 1992-03-09), who was afflicted with a permanent sarcastic tone of voice. It's an easy joke, but it was actually very funny.
