        True Relational To Pseudo Relational Mapping
      </h1>
      <p>
        A software layer on top of a PseudoRelationalDatabase (like all those based on SQL) that hides the <a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a>, and allows the user to interact with the database as if it were a TrueRelationalDatabase. An example of this could be <a href="AlphoraDataphor.html">AlphoraDataphor</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the other hand, since it doesn't follow all indications in the </em><a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>, maybe <a href="AlphoraDataphor.html">AlphoraDataphor</a> should be considered an AlmostTrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalMapping.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Several questions come to my mind... 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Did Sql artificially created an <a href="TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalImpedanceMismatch.html">TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalImpedanceMismatch</a>?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is it too late to for <a href="TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalMapper.html">TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalMapper</a> now that we have lots of ObjectRelationalMappers and microsoft even added ObjectToPseudoRelational capabilites to <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a> with LINQ (<a href="MicrosoftLinq.html">MicrosoftLinq</a>)?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Putting a "true relational" front end in front of the industry standard SQL interface to "relational databases" strikes me as ironic, and inefficient -- because, as I understand it, the major relational database products work by converting SQL to an internal query language </em>'which is Truly Relational<strong> so that they can do real relational calculus on it.  So it seems to me that the real solution to the problem would be to define a real relational language -- something to replace SQL.  You'd have to do this anyway, to have a "True Relational" API to convert to the ANSI Standard </strong>PseudoRelational SQL API that is the current standard.  If you could define a good "True Relational" API, then all that would have to happen next is that the major database vendors (including Oracle) would have to support it.  ...by doing a simple translation to their current internal "Truely Relational" representations.  -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you know that the internal query language is <strong>Truly Relational</strong> (why should it? why it can not be as lacking as SQL? AFAIK it might be closer to the particular implementation details of the DB, but that doesn't mean it is closer to being <strong>Truly Relational</strong>, I agree with you that we need to use a real relational language, for example <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> (like in <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>). The book explaining how to build a <strong>Truly Relational</strong> has existed for quite some time ( look at <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>)...so... what is keeping everybody from abandoning SQL? IMO 3 things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Backwards compatibility (That are lots of applications built in SQL, and lots of developers that already know SQL, love nulls, haven't heard of relvars, etc) 
        </li>
        <li>
          The internal engine of a database that uses a query language that is not truly relational doesn't have to be closer to being relational, it may be lacking features in many areas that would need to be improved to fully support a Truly relational query language (See <a href="TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalImpedanceMismatch.html">TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalImpedanceMismatch</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="VendorLockIn.html">VendorLockIn</a> (Why support a Truly Relational query language when you can force your customers to keep using your product because they can not get rid of all those stored procedures written in your particular SQL/PSM dialect?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Therefore, I think the community needs to show the database vendors that it is interested in having a Truly relational query language, and that it is truly interested in having a higher level of compatibility between database vendors, and while we cannot directly mess with the code of Oracle or <a href="DbTwo.html">DbTwo</a> and add native <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> support in to them, we can create mappers (or perhaps I should call them drivers?) to wrap the access to  the pseudo relational databases, making it possible to use a more robust and powerful language. I believe that after people start seeing the advantages of this new language, and start creating solutions using it, the <a href="WordOfMouth.html">WordOfMouth</a>  will finally reach the database vendors, and they will start to be interested in adding this new language  natively in their databases (and perhaps start creating extensions as libraries and not as language modifications that can not be ported between databases?).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why should I want Truly Relational Query Language and results?  What benefits would it give me?  ANSI SQL standards and related library APIs give me a high level of compatibility between database vendors, and they also enable useful performance and portability tradeoffs too.  Please list some benefits that would inspire 'the community' to want Truly Relational over the kinds of things they have now.</em>

        For starters, lets remember <a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a>... then read <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> and <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>...

        [I wonder if the <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a> responsible for the recent spawning of various *RelationalTo*Relational* pages would consider deleting the others and consolidating them into a single page, such as this one?  That would foster and encourage discussion -- without the imposed structure, disappointing lack of content, and generally unwelcoming nature that an empty collection of topics inevitably creates.  When the content grows, refactoring can be based on actual content rather than a predetermined structure.  Keep in mind that <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> and <a href="YouArentGoingToNeedIt.html">YouArentGoingToNeedIt</a> apply to Wiki content as well as code.] -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        In his defense,  sometimes modularizing pages is the only way to remain sane. People passing by a huge <em>mother sized page</em> aren't going to read it. Keeping it simple sometimes means making short articles and pages, instead of long drawn out flamewars that span 30 pages on a single page. Whether that applies to this page and those other relational pages or not, I'm not sure. Some people on this wiki seem to be thinking in StandardPascal and just like to throw more and more procedures and comments at the end of the program. Some of us think in Modula and like to create separate topics, even if they are related to other topics in <em>some ways</em>. Since the earth is one single place, why not have one single page for all topics, since earth ultimately relates to all and everything here on earth?

        [I agree; I'm simply suggesting that the refactoring be done after there's content, not before.] -- DV
