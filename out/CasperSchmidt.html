        <em>The eyelids was torched as the water was forged and the yellow snow fell up (from the less-</em>
        great Heaven below). A brain imploding scenario of no proportions, an epiphany's false
        perception with immense distortions. The creative outburst from the elephants hole. The
        growing wind by the tree-gophers who sips tea at the waterside and greets the devil with "On
        another side; thats a tad odd".

        Leopard filled snowflakes with a crispy sound of garlic wounds. It rains all together too soon. An
        abstract strife in a literations rule which break all the rites from the black rows to the execution
        room. Around the crows just weep and the cows just smile through their fence with their small
        sense of real feed. Bleed the blood and wipe it blue, the fisher will bash your head right through
        the tight skull of a paranoid pig. I just got to hold Hillary's wig.

        The men and the women and the children and the babies all got the rabies from the hot rabbi.
        They are all singing and miming of womens findings by the pale Apple tree. Come see joykids

        source (of forgotten black light). Three minutes past, lasting all night and I might see the last of
        my feets. By now I have stopped making sense of it and George too. I just go with the tide and
        smile by the side where the busy children plays by order. The floor is ice and the roof is on fire,
        the mice' on my desk sings christmas songs in choir.

        Detective Wilson come joining me just as an sobbing ad from beyond the sea, that place where
        the trees are free and mail comes in a flee. I have a flee, in fact I have two, shoe too, sea,
        heal to peal, peak and sneak and rob the bleak. You divine glowing gadfly on the river, the
        soldiers tell you to quit and your ear becomes too sensitive to stay up so late. Perhaps you
        arent welcome past eight, or perhaps I should just quit.<em></em>
