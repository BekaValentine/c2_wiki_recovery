        An alternative classification could be:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The name of the rose</em>:
        A book about books made of stolen snippets and crossing levels, whose real topic may be "smiling and truth".

        A novel about creativity and building reality by expressing it in some form (i.e., narrating it).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The Island of the Day Before</em>:
        Classic voyage as introspection theme, mixed with the semiologistic "the only truth is narration".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Baudolino</em>:
        Do lies determine truth? And is the action or imagination which can keep you young forever?

      <p>
        Eco spent many years telling lies, trying to make the deeper truth emerge. You can think of it as writing tests, but he still did not struggle to get a <a href="GreenBar.html">GreenBar</a>.

        The following excerpts are from an English translation of Umberto Eco's back-page column, "La bustina di Minerva," in the Italian news weekly "Espresso," September 30, 1994.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>...Insufficient consideration has been given to the new underground religious war which is modifying the modern world. It's an old idea of mine, but I find that whenever I tell people about it they immediately agree with me.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The fact is that the world is divided between users of the Macintosh computer and users of MS-DOS compatible computers. I am firmly of the opinion that the Macintosh is Catholic and that DOS is Protestant. Indeed, the Macintosh is counter-reformist and has been influenced by the 'ratio studiorum' of the Jesuits. It is cheerful, friendly, conciliatory, it tells the faithful how they must proceed step by step to reach--if not the Kingdom of Heaven--the moment in which their document is printed. It is catechistic: the essence of revelation is dealt with via simple formulae and sumptuous icons. Everyone has a right to salvation.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>DOS is Protestant, or even Calvinistic. It allows free interpretation of scripture, demands difficult personal decisions, imposes a subtle hermeneutics upon the user, and takes for granted the idea that not all can reach salvation. To make the system work you need to interpret the program yourself: a long way from the baroque community of revellers, the user is closed within the loneliness of his own inner torment.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You may object that, with the passage to Windows, the DOS universe has come to resemble more closely the counter-reformist tolerance of the Macintosh. It's true: Windows represents an Anglican-style schism, big ceremonies in the cathedral, but there is always the possibility of a return to DOS to change things in accordance with bizarre decisions; when it comes down to it, you can decide to allow women and gays to be ministers if you want to.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And machine code, which lies beneath both systems (or environments, if you prefer)? Ah, that is to do with the Old Testament, and is talmudic and cabalistic...</em>
