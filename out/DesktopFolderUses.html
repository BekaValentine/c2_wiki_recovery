        The most frequent use made of folders by users is as a place to collect and store files. There are other collections and ways to store files, and other artifacts which require just a little memory space and a great deal of flexibility in making your way around this wiki
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the other ways folders may be used is to quickly and easily personally organize internet artifacts using the artifactory known as a shortcut. Shortcuts are not new, but here is a way you can save them using your own personal External Categories system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a top level folder called wikisites. In it create another folder representaing this wiki, call it c2, or <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, or whatever you like. It is in this desktop subfolder wikisites/c2/ that you will create a grouping of folders organized under whatever topics or categories you like.

        I can suggest several:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Projects
        </li>
        <li>
           Programming
        </li>
        <li>
           People
        </li>
        <li>
           AgileAndExtreme 
        </li>
        <li>
           UsingWiki
        </li>
        <li>
           Roadmaps
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The good thing about such organization is that it places little loading on the wiki server.

        Here is the good part:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           While it is not <a href="AutomaticExternalCategorization.html">AutomaticExternalCategorization</a> it is <a href="ExternalCategorization.html">ExternalCategorization</a> and can be reduced to a drag and drop operation 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Drag the link from the page be it 
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                   Category List such as one might find when backlisting of a topic of interest - like <a href="CategoryWiki.html">CategoryWiki</a>, or CategoryRoadmap
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Drop it into the folder into the desktop folder representing the external category you have created for it
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
