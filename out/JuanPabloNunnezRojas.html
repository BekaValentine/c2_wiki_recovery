        Hello <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> World!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science Student from Chile, University of Chile more precisely. I have a part time job as a java programmer. English is just my second language, so you must excuse my strange style. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I encountered the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> some months ago while googling for patterns information...I think that if someone searches for this, sooner or later will arrive to this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        My participation as a writer on this wiki has been very shallow; being a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> some times, asking questions here and there the rest. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One page I find myself coming back time and again is <a href="HowCanSomethingBeSuperGreatWithoutProducingExternalEvidence.html">HowCanSomethingBeSuperGreatWithoutProducingExternalEvidence</a>, which I find extremely irritating. The notion that a language has been around for 40 years, and lacks libraries, has many different incompatible implementations, and lacks examples of RealLifeApplications, is very disturbing. If your language is so great, why doesn't it rule the world already? It has had more than enough time. (take, in contrast, Fortran. Yeah, there are also a lot of implementations, but they are somewhat compatible. And Fortran still rules the Mathematician/Physics World).
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, I'm talking about Lisp. No, The fact that <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> says that he used it for creating some online store, which runs ServerSide, and of course, whose code we cannot expect to see, doesn't count as proof. However, since I'm still young, and just entering the industry, I will giver <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> some credit, and I am willing to try the <a href="ArcLanguage.html">ArcLanguage</a>...whenever he feels it is ready to rock.

          <em>Maybe you should try a good book about Lisp, SML or Haskell. There are many things which are so easy in functional languages, while they are hard or impossible in others. If you wonder why mediocre languages take the market, there was a time when BASIC was the language of choice and now it is </em>VisulaBasic or VB.NET as I think it is now called. There is a paper in which it is argued that <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a> which even tries to explain why Unix (which is considered worse) which is written in C (again worse) took the market instead of some well designed operating system/programming language. Before I studied at the UniversityOfChile I thought UCSD Pascal and Ada were the right languages. The problem: They were not open source. ITS is mentioned in the paper as an example of an excellent <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>, but I had never heard of it before. If worse is better then we are in the right market and in the right country. ;-)<em> -- </em><a href="GuillermoSchwarz.html">GuillermoSchwarz</a>.

          Yes, that is exactly what I'm looking for now. I started with <em></em><a href="OnLisp.html">OnLisp</a><em> by Paul Graham, but he assumes you already know lisp, and goes right to the crazy stuff.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Perhaps you should take a look at <a href="StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.html">StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms</a>. -- <a href="JosephDale.html">JosephDale</a>  [<em>I'll heartily second that; note, however, that SIPC deals with Scheme, which is a slightly different variant of Lisp than the </em><a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> about <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> writes. --<a href="TimLesher.html">TimLesher</a><em>][yeah, I noticed that too.]</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> has made some impression on me, and I have my own wiki! It is about <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a>, and...is in spanish. It is in very early stages, but the site looks cool already :) If you are still interested, here is a link. There is a short story I wrote there.

        Thank you for letting me know you deleted it.  I plan to add, but had to post a note saying this is just a Plan since I have another deadline.

        So, only (more or less) open-source software counts ?

        In an ideal world, the <a href="LanguagesOfChoice.html">LanguagesOfChoice</a> would all be <a href="MainstreamLanguage.html">MainstreamLanguage</a>s.
        Why are they different ? Like you, I wonder why.

        <a href="JuanPabloNunnezRojas.html">JuanPabloNunnezRojas</a>!  Just wanted to drop by and thank you for your thoughts on my Life's Blood Ministry site (<a href="http://LBministry.org).">http://LBministry.org).</a>  I finally solved the problem of the crowding at the top of the pages.  I'm very new at this and appreciate your inputs.  I've enjoyed your challenging thoughts on the issues on my Wiki page as well.
