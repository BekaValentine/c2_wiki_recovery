        Ward Hates Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WardHatesWiki.html">WardHatesWiki</a> now, irrespective of his sentiments towards <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> in early years. It is just that he is too embarrassed to come out in the open, with so many keen supporters of wiki around earlier.

      <p>
        The situation is definitely getting better [worse?], endless wars and responses help diminish enthusiasm. Sure, there are <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> people coming to give morale boosts here. But you can see long-term supporters leaving one by one, or others no longer using their UserNames, etc., etc.

        Keep in mind that this is meant in the same sense that <a href="GoogleHatesWiki.html">GoogleHatesWiki</a>. He doesn't actively hate it - he just seems no longer aware that it exists.

        <em>It is normal to expect somebody to go through periods of heavy involvement and light involvement. It is probably cyclical.</em>

        Well, everything that has a beginning has an end... does Ward really hate Wiki? Can you hate your own child? ... You surely can disapprove of the direction it's taking, but hate?

      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WardHatesWiki.html">WardHatesWiki</a> because more people are leaving wiki as a result of <a href="ZeroTolerance.html">ZeroTolerance</a> towards the actions of WikiStewards
