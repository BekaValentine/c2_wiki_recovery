        Chris Da Silva
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>I am Chris da Silva.  Maybe you are 'Chris da Silva', too...</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ChrisDaSilva.html">ChrisDaSilva</a> is, in fact, one of many so-named <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s on <a href="PlanetEarth.html">PlanetEarth</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may or may not be well-known that the last name "da Silva" (or its alternate iterations "Da Silva", "Dasilva" or even "daSilva") is quite common -- try searching for it using any good <a href="SearchEngine.html">SearchEngine</a> (e.g. Google).  Similarly, last names "de Silva", "di Silva" and "d'Silva" (including iterations/combinations thereof as illustrated above) can also be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, in many cases, people have chosen to completely <em>drop</em> the 'da'/'de'/'di'/etc. (<em>I do not know what this part of the </em>NameConstruct is called, though the grammatical term 'conjunction' <em>incorrectly</em> comes to mind.<em>)</em>
        i.e. had I chosen to drop the 'da' from my name, it would read 'Chris Silva' instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The combination of last name "da Silva" and first name "Chris" is quite common also because of the numerous names for which "Chris" is short -- Christopher (mine), Christian, Christine, etcetera -- and all their "foreign" counterparts, such as Christoforo, Christovao, Christianou, Christobal (if spelled with an 'h'!, which I think not normally!)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>So what is your point?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If <em>your</em> name is <em>also</em> <strong>Chris da Silva</strong>, then let me first WELCOME you, my name-brother/-sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Secondly</strong>, let me ask this of you:
      </p>
      <p>
        As I hereby <em>stake my Wiki Territory</em> in the name of further self-education (about all things <strong>Wiki</strong> (<a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>), in a <a href="WikiWikiSandbox.html">WikiWikiSandbox</a> sorta way), might I ask that if you share the same name and wish to create a page about YOU - your own <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> - please choose another <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> for use in <a href="WikiSpace.html">WikiSpace</a>.  Consider using your middle name as well, or append an abbreviation for your country -- until May'04 I was in Hong Kong; you are more likely to be in Western Europe or South America, if not North.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Thirdly</strong>, if your name <em>is</em> also <strong>Chris da Silva</strong>, and you <em>do</em> choose to create your own <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> to describe yourself in <a href="WikiSpace.html">WikiSpace</a>, I would be <em>delighted</em> if you added your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> as a Link.  Right here, between the HRs:

      <p>
        (None, so far, have ventured into <a href="WikiSpace.html">WikiSpace</a> and/or left their mark here...)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But </em>'Peter<em>' da Silva hung out here some years back...</em> -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks, Doug!  I've heard the name 'Peter da Silva', but it's possible that it's almost as common as 'Chris da Silva', so the probability that <em>your</em> 'Peter' and <em>my</em> 'Peter' are one and the same.. seems quite small. -- <a href="ChrisDaSilva.html">ChrisDaSilva</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        So it seems (Q3,2005) that, while many <em>exist</em>, few - if any - seem to be aware of <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>..
        Or perhaps it is simply because those who <em>are</em> aware of <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> are making more direct (and perhaps valuable) contributions to this <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>, and the overall theme of programming and its parallel topics, <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>. -- <a href="ChrisDaSilva.html">ChrisDaSilva</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Fourthly</strong>, and in the interest of adding more signal to (admittedly what amounts more to) noise, would anyone care to <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a> on methods to increase efficiency, when working with <a href="SearchEngine.html">SearchEngine</a>s, of searching for people by name, when their names are, like mine, prone to being mis-typed, mis-represented, or otherwise?
      </p>
      <p>
        The thought here being -- with a barely perceptible nod to <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> -- that the many different ways a ThirdParty may "write" (for example) the name 'Chris da Silva' could, in all likelihood, get lost in the vast ocean of data that is the <a href="PublicDomain.html">PublicDomain</a> of the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a>.. such that if I, for example, were to attempt a WebSearch for topics / website content mentioning my name, and if the author of such content mis-typed my name, I would either
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a) miss the content entirely; or
        </li>
        <li>
           b) need to attempt searches, myself, of each possible iteration I can think of to try to find it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The greater difficulty being -- in <em>my</em> case especially -- that my name is <em>far from unique</em>!  Not only would the <em>correct</em> spelling (using <em>both</em> 'Chris' <em>and</em> 'Christopher') result in numerous <a href="SearchEngine.html">SearchEngine</a> results, but the 'mis-spelling' of <em>my</em> name is just as likely to offer hundreds of results, most of which would be for the 'correct spelling' of someone <em>else</em>s name.
      </p>
      <p>
        So HOW would I approach any sort of 'filtering' to find <em>only</em> pages that mention <em>me</em>?   :)
        (Q3 2005)

        <strong>More directly in line with Programming and </strong><a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a><strong>, I seek guidance and hope someone might </strong><a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>:
        (and fully realising that if/when this section grows, it may be moved to a separate <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> of its own; I can only hope that such editor / <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a> / <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> will leave a link here - thanks!)
      </p>
      <p>
        With regards to programming for, say, GameControllers, and considering an example where both MouseDevice and JoystickDevice are Active and concurrently recognised by the system (and hence the game), so far most games allow for a choice of one or the other. XOR situation.  (If I'm not mistaken, those games which use OR rather than XOR allow each device to 'interrupt' the other.. whether or not that was intended.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Question</strong>, then:
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming <strong>two</strong> (identical, by brand and model) MouseDevices connected via two main USB ports (as opposed to two USB ports on a USB 'hub' connected to <em>one</em> 'main' USB port(i.e. motherboard)), HOW should one approach the coding so as to <em>differentiate</em> between the two incoming signals?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine, for a moment, reverting to older games like <strong>Pong</strong>, but using one MouseDevice per person.
        Or perhaps combat / fighting ArcadeGames (a la Street Fighter, or the older Double Dragon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Concern?
      </p>
      <p>
        USB allows for multiple devices (up to a limit) to be connected via one main (motherboard) USB port. The USB hardware, in communication with each device, is able to distinguish between each.  Once you attach MultipleInstances of essentially the 'same' device, how does one guarantee the ability of the computer to distinguish between signals of each of the twin devices?
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, so I think I've asked rather a lot.  My search technique may be so utterly rubbish such that someone may even <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> by saying that this has 'already been done'.  I hope that if you do, you might provide me with a URL for reference?  I'd greatly appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks!

        <strong>NOW</strong>, a bit (a nibble, a byte, or more?) about <em>me</em>, <strong>Chris da Silva</strong>:

      <p>
        Hong Kong-born Portuguese, British educated, with a University degree in a business major from Purdue in Indiana (USA); I've been <em>messing with computers</em> since my dad sat me down in front of a Sinclair ZX-81 Spectrum...

        Long story short, I <em>discovered</em> Wiki (<a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>) around the end of 2003, and had only taken time to learn more about it around April 2004 -- hence this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am, inherently, a ProofReader -- much thanks to all friends and dorm-mates at college who came to me to proof-read their works -- and I'm looking forward to contributing to all forms of Wiki (<a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>) and to encourage its acceptance.
        (Q3 2005) Looks like I can contribute as a part-time <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>. A great opportunity to learn while reading/editing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll let you know when any Wiki-related <a href="CultureShock.html">CultureShock</a> hits me..!

        Right.  (Q2 2004)  First 'draft' -- let's see how this goes.....
