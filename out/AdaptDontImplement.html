        <em>Context</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> style application programming in Java, using Swing (the Java GUI standard), or a similar MVC-like GUI toolkit. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Problem</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have some object, nicely modeled to represent your solution domain. Then you have to visualize the object (the model) with more than one widget (view/controller). Each widget has its own set of Events, Listeners, and requires the model to implement a widget-specific model interface. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can now start to implement one model interface after the other in your class. This creates two problems: 
      </p>
      <p>
        The class gets cluttered with all the model interfaces, the required listener firing, and event creation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can not use all the Default/Basic/Abstract... implementations of the model which already exist in Swing. So you start to code esp. all the listener handling from scratch. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Solution</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't implement all the interfaces at your data model. Instead, 
      </p>
      <p>
        Design the interface of your data model in a generic, domain-specific way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Provide the data model with a notification/listener interface, allowing the data model to receive notifications specific for the model (see also <a href="ObserverObservable.html">ObserverObservable</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the <a href="AdapterPattern.html">AdapterPattern</a> (e.g. described in the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a>'s book <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>) to provide widget-specific model interfaces. Adapt the model's get/set methods, as well as its listener/notification methods to the ones needed by the specific widget. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The adapters can be derived from the Default/Basic/Abstract model implementations existing for the widgets under discussion. This gives a head start in listener and event handling. 
        The adapters take an instance of the "real" model as argument in their constructors. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Example</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Try to write a class that can be displayed with a JTree, and a JTable (not using the JTreeTable2 stuff currently under discussion).
