        Processes And Data
      </h1>
      <p>
        Except for the very first thing, whatever that was, all things are the result of a process.
      </p>
      <code>
        Actions are processes.<br/>
        Things are data.<br/>
        Processes act on things.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Existence of any data implies that there has been a process which created it. The first thing created may have been a process but before the instant that the process became active, it existed as data. The process which created that data is a mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why I like the simplistic view of this form as a contemplative view of all data processing programs -
      </p>
      <code>
        Result = Process(Data)<br/>
      </code>
