        Mike Smith Name Change

        <strong><em>The Story Thus Far</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OnceUponaTime.html">OnceUponaTime</a>, <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a> seemed to be inactive on the wiki, AnotherMikeSmith was quite active. AnotherMikeSmith contacted <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a> to see if he could 'take over' the page. Once permission was obtained, AnotherMikeSmith dropped his 'first name'. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Heh, yeah, and then</em> TheNewMikeSmith <em>(that's me) kinda went away, too, sorta.  ;-)  I've been doing the </em><a href="QuickChangesJunkie.html">QuickChangesJunkie</a> thing, but haven't had a whole lot so say lately.<em> -- </em><a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Moved</em></strong> <em> </em>'here from <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>, after the switch from AnotherMikeSmith<em></em>'
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OK then, I heard back from the fellow who "had" this page, and he's given me the go-ahead, so that's it. AnotherMikeSmith is no more; he's now just plain </em><a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>.  I think I'm going to leave all my old sigs in place, and just redirect through AnotherMikeSmith to this page, unless anyone thinks that's unwise. -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a><em> (It's unwise only when/until another </em><a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a> shows up. -- <a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a>)

      <p>
        Welcome! (I guess that's what you say in a situation like this.) Do other folks have permission to make the name changes as they see them? It would almost feel like rewriting history. -- <a href="SteveHowell.html">SteveHowell</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Uh...sure, if you like. I guess I'll probably end up doing the same.</em>

        He didn't change his name, He just dropped his first name.

        <em>Hee, hee. Someday, I will evolve into a mononominal, then maybe someday just an unpronounceable symbol, perhaps 'ï¿½' - although then, I'll only be able to participate in Wikis that have been modified to recognize a solitary 0xA7 as a </em><a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>.<em></em>

        <em>Did you change your cookie to just</em> <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>? <em>Oops! No. Thanks for pointing this out.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the original <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a> left any signatures lying around Wiki, you should probably remove them so that they become anonymous, and not linked to you.  <em>Good point, thanks!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps just change them to OldMikeSmith? <em>Turns out there aren't any, anyway.</em>

          -04-15: Thanks to a fit of procrastination, I've hunted down the remaining AnotherMikeSmith backlinks.
