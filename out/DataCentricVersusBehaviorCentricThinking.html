        Data Centric Versus Behavior Centric Thinking
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some have concluded that OO is about behavior-centric thinking, but I have gradually leaned further toward <a href="DataCentricThinking.html">DataCentricThinking</a>, which is probably one of the reasons I have distaste for OO. Past attempts to explore this issue were deleted for some reason. I am curious about behavior-centric thinkers and would still like to explore it, hopefully without another shouting match. Let's try to focus on the psychology of our minds <strong>without getting into value judgments</strong> about which psychology is the "best". -- top

        It doesn't matter how I think. Programming is not data entry. Programming is the creation of new behavior. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        <em>I take exception to that definition. Programming *is* data-entry. However, in past debates with you, we never saw eye-to-eye, and possibly never will. We are stuck in a </em><a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> loop over <a href="DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing.html">DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing</a>.<em></em>

        I dunno, it seems to me that it only makes sense to think about <em>both</em> how data will be structured and will "flow" through a system, <em>and</em> what kinds of operations will be performed upon and using that data during its lifetime. I don't think it's an either-or proposition.  And this is precisely what I like about OO; objects are data <em>combined with</em> behavior. -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        <em>Well, I think there are benefits to the separation. Data-managing tools can be optimized for data-centric things, and the same with behavior-managing tools. If you mix them, you drag both down to the lowest-common-denominator. Managing attributes in a code editor is rather ugly and inconsistent in my opinion. (Note, there may be existing topics that describe this complaint, but I cannot find them right now). Further, the relationship between behavior and data is not nearly as tightly-coupled as many here seem to assume in my observation. I don't know where that belief originated from. I generally view behavior and data as a many-to-many relationship in the longer run. The ADT view does not extrapolate to real-world entities for the most part. -- top</em>

        If we cannot find some new insight beyond past discussions, then I am all for deleting this topic after about a month or so and moving the content to other topics. -- top
