        Best Way To Know

        Something in the last few pages I've read inspires me to ask this question:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>"What is the best way to be sure whether you have a good design for a program to solve the customer's problem?"</strong> </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        Who is <strong>the customer</strong> ? The act of phrasing the question that way ("I'm in the business of solving the customer's problem") indicates a certain mindset.
      </p>

        Out here in the land of audacious dreams and high-concept architectures, where people constantly try to convince me that someday I'll be leasing my security model to an agent living in the extra memory on my dishwasher (actual scenario from actual conversation that I found quite bewildering), many would find the idea of solving a well-defined and solidly articulated problem for a known customer quite, well, mundane.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, there are days when I <strong>long</strong> for concreteness...

        The trick is getting paid. Of course there are a lot of smart guys out there that go from situation to situation, getting paid a lot because they're smart guys. Trouble with here in the midwest is that the folks who want to pay generally want to pay for <em>something</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even when leasing your security model, aren't there things you're supposed to get done? Aren't there people who need to be satisfied with your progress?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I know that sometimes the people who should be concerned with your progress are only concerned about the IPO or the next round of financing or the next demo.
