        Search Engine Resistant
      </h1>
      <p>
        A word is <a href="SearchEngineResistant.html">SearchEngineResistant</a> if typing it into a <a href="SearchEngine.html">SearchEngine</a> will return millions of hits that have nothing whatsoever to do with what you are looking for.  Given that e.g.  <a href="AltaVista.html">AltaVista</a> ignores punctuation, this set is even bigger than it otherwise would be.  Here are some:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Self (<a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a>, 5 million hits)
        </li>
        <li>
           COM (<a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>'s <a href="ComponentObjectModel.html">ComponentObjectModel</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           .Net (<a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a>, returns ~37 million hits)
        </li>
        <li>
           C++ (<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, 57 million on <a href="AltaVista.html">AltaVista</a>, works on <a href="http://google.com)">http://google.com)</a> <em>* See below</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           C (<a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>) <em>and all other one letter names like B, K, J (</em><a href="JayLanguage.html">JayLanguage</a>)<em></em>

        </li>
        <li>
           Windows (<a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>.  Is becoming less resistant, as the old uses of the word are being phased out.  <em>Which means the "old-timers" looking for physical windows are having this word added to their list</em>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Access (<a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Python (If you're looking for the snake, or, if you're looking for the language but wanting to avoid Monty Python references)
        </li>
        <li>
           Clarinet (Use to be bad [1994], but no longer -- only in that <a href="http://www.clari.net/">http://www.clari.net/</a> comes up as the top result because Google orders by how linked-to a page is; if you're looking for anything ELSE relating to it, good luck!)
        </li>

           Forth (<a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>)
        </li>

           Beaver, if you're looking for animals of the genus <em>castor.</em>

        <li>
           Keynote, Pages (AppleComputers) -- I keep finding this when I want to watch Steve Jobs tell me how awesome MacOS X Tiger is going to be.  And Apple's usually so good about being searchable, with their one-letter prefixes (iPod, iPhoto, etc).

        <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> seems especially proficient in choosing <a href="SearchEngineResistant.html">SearchEngineResistant</a> words for their core products.

        Yeah, but Sun is no better. ONE ([Sun] Open Net Environment)...

        Workarounds:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>: Add extra terms for context, especially within quotes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "word document"
        </li>
        <li>
           C programming
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Category Search</strong>: If you're looking for physical windows, you're better off to search beneath a "Construction" or "Home" category than all of the web, which will return MS Windows stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Subtract Terms</strong>: Use Google's "-" feature to nix out the words you don't want.  For instance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           python -monty
        </li>
        <li>
           +forth -"so forth" -"bring forth" -"brought forth"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Related Terms</strong>: Rather than the term itself, use synonyms or closely-related words
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           rather than searching for ".NET", search for "Common Language Runtime" or "Microsoft CLR"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        That's why I like it when single-letter prefixes are used -- iMac, iBook, JPython, ZSNES...
      </p>

        A note about C++ working on Google:
      </p>
      <p>
        In early 2001 I submitted a bug to Google that C++ didn't search correctly (URL's treat "+" as a space by default.  I could effectively find C++ stuff by searching for C%2E%2E, but that was lame).  I got an auto-responder mail minutes later.  After only ~3 weeks, the bug was fixed.  They rock.

        Please. That's so last-century.
