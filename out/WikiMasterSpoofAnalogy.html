        A theoretical entity whose existence is deemed logically necessary by many, from the known fact of the existence of the <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a>. Others say quite the opposite. Because there is clearly no real life referent for <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a>, no <a href="WikiMasterpiece.html">WikiMasterpiece</a> could ever exist, by definition. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Others are more cautious. It may be worth looking for evidence for both <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a>s and <a href="WikiMasterpiece.html">WikiMasterpiece</a>s although, even after the highly subjective arguments this entails come to a conclusion, it may still be impossible to argue successfully about the relationship, if any, between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others are brashly confident that <a href="WikiMasterpiece.html">WikiMasterpiece</a>s still exist or that one, at least, once existed. The lack of contemporary consensus on "clear cut objective evidence" is put down to wilful blindness, the philistine tendencies of the <a href="TvWatchers.html">TvWatchers</a>, or possibly somebody monkeying around with the original documents.

        Nobody feels more angry about the concept of <a href="WikiMasterpiece.html">WikiMasterpiece</a> than the brave resistance who realized immediately that it is merely another subtle "trojan horse" from the stupid bigots who wish to foist the unbelievable yet potent doctrine of <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a> upon the gullible masses, in their laughably futile yet deceitfully dangerous plot to wield political power in the mature, post-modern Wiki. The naive yet cunning "believers" they must expose at all costs have amazingly not even realized that they have no chance of attaining their well-known yet carefully hidden goal of total domination of Wiki (in the form of a ruthlessly censored virtual super-state called WikiMasterdom). No sarcasm, <a href="StrawMan.html">StrawMan</a> argument or sordid analogy is beneath the dignity of the noble few as they surgically pulverize and hold up to public ridicule the crass inconsistencies of this shocking yet so so predictable attack on the inalienable right of anyone who happens upon Wiki to produce not only heaps of ugly <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> but also the stink appropriate to it when anyone tries to deal with it.

        As for me, I hold the concept of <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a> lightly. I would never wish to offend those for whom this belief has become a treasured cornerstone of their understanding and experience of the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a>. But the moment I coined the term I realized: we should always have talked more about <a href="WikiMasterpiece.html">WikiMasterpiece</a>s than about <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a>s. <a href="UseRealExamplesForWikiOnWiki.html">UseRealExamplesForWikiOnWiki</a>. Especially positive ones. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>
