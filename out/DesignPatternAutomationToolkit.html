        It seems to support C# and VB.NET at this time.
        There's mention of Java support, but it's not clear if it can recognize or generate Java at this time.

        Hey jeff, it allows u to use design patterns in ur design, when u can view the class diagrams , generates code stubbs (in java too!! dear wiki), and help for reverse engineering for .net aware languages!!

        I can see how a tool like this might make it considerably <strong>harder</strong> for me to effectively utilize design patterns in my code. For a pattern to be most useful, it should emerge from the needs of the design, right? A tool like this encourages me to think hammer-first: "Well, I need a Composite pattern here. Let's get one from the toolkit! Now, how to shove this into the rest of the code...."

        Other aspects of this project seem interesting, if a bit ambitious. If it can data-mine a pattern out of a snarl of old code, it might give me an interesting perspective, perhaps a direction in which to move. But code generation would not sit so well with me.

        Refactorings are basically mechanical. Design is much less so. Give me a power screwdriver (or a <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a>), but not a blueprint-generator. -- <a href="PhilGroce.html">PhilGroce</a>
