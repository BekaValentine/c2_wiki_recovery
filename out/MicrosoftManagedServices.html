        Note: This page has moved to <a href="MicrosoftManagedCode.html">MicrosoftManagedCode</a>. ManagedServices actually refer to an entirely different subject and pertains to matters like Offsite hosting, etc. Apologies to people who I have managed to confuse. 
        A further note is at the end of page

        Question: Any characteristic of  Managed code beside the implications of requiring the use of <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        Question: Is it possible to have a service which is not managed?
      </p>
      <p>
        Question: What the heck do they mean by service anyway?

        <em>Managed Services from Microsoft</em> is also found in use by trade press at times. In <a href="http://www.zdnet.co.uk/print/?TYPE=story&AT=39143730-39020387t-10000006c">http://www.zdnet.co.uk/print/?TYPE=story&AT=39143730-39020387t-10000006c</a> ZDNet UK reporter said <a href="DonBox.html">DonBox</a> was using that term to refer to the "service oriented" nature of <a href="MicrosoftIndigo.html">MicrosoftIndigo</a> technology. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Still it will be less confusing today to refer to <em>Managed Code</em> instead of <em>Managed Services</em>.
