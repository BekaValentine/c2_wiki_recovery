        Escape Hatch Mechanism
      </h1>
      <p>
        An example of an <a href="EscapeHatchMechanism.html">EscapeHatchMechanism</a> is the exec function offered in some languages.  Rexx for example has the ability to have a program automatically generate a program and then load and run it.  This is a general capability of interpreted languages.  The ability to both create and launch an arbitrary program in the context of an already developed system is a very powerful albeit dangerous capability.

        I used to criticize C on the grounds that it gave the programmer too much freedom to muck with the internals.  But it is dirty work and someone has to do it.  This came from <a href="EscapeHatch.html">EscapeHatch</a>es and I'd appreciate it if others would elaborate on the <a href="EscapeMechanisms.html">EscapeMechanisms</a> they are familiar with and use. --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>

        The escape hatch out of a framework or object hierarchy are virtual functions. This is why almost everything should be made virtual unless you have a very good reason not to make it virtual.
