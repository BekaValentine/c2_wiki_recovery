        Piet Hein
      </h1>
      <p>
        Danish Renaissance man: philosopher, mathematician, scientist, inventor,
        artist, author and poet.  Lived 1905-1996.
      </p>
      <p>
        Piet (pronounced like the English name "Pete") Hein created a new geometrical form,
        the "<a href="SuperEllipse.html">SuperEllipse</a>", which is something in between the rectangle and the ellipse.
        The form also came in a 3D version called the "super-ellipsoid" or "super egg".
        Hein created the super-ellipse in 1964 to solve the problem of building a traffic loop
        in a roughly rectangular street intersection in Stockholm: a circle would not fit,
        an ellipse wasted space in the corners, and a rectangle would not allow fast traffic flow.
        <a href="DonKnuth.html">DonKnuth</a> used super-ellipses in Metafont in lieu of circular arcs (which are
        apparently harder to draw efficiently using integer arithmetic).
        More prosaically, <a href="AndrewKoenig.html">AndrewKoenig</a> used super-ellipses as part of his kitchen counter 
      </p>
      <p>
        (The use of the superellipse in font design is better attributed to Hermann Zapf, who employed it in designing the Melior face in, I believe, 1952.)

        <a href="PietHein.html">PietHein</a> also invented the Soma puzzle cube (see <a href="http://www.fam-bundgaard.dk/SOMA/SOMA.HTM).">http://www.fam-bundgaard.dk/SOMA/SOMA.HTM).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PietHein.html">PietHein</a> wrote thousands of pithy epigrammatic poems for which he coined
        the term <em>grooks.</em>  They became popular all over the world in the late
        nineteen-sixties and early seventies.
