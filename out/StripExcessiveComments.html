        Strip Excessive Comments
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've always found that until I remove all the javadoc lines (and many of the inline comments), I can't make much progress grokking even relatively simple code, and I think I've finally figured out why: I can't rephrase the code (refactor?) easily. You know, the stuff extracting a variable or a method, basically reducing it to its constituent parts. I suspect it might largely be a mental block of some kind, but when I see a 15 line function, I get scared off, even when 8 lines are comments and 5 more are blank.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand the javadoc adds some significant constraints, but that makes me wonder about the usefulness of javadoc in general... until proven otherwise, I go by the function name and parameters to find what I need. Admitedly, the javadocs are good for that, but then so are a lot of smart editors. Then there's the case of implementation details - i.e. method foo must be called before you bar this - but then I find I prefer to look at the source: why must I call foo first?

        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a> too. I am fairly new to the game too so maybe it is a problem not a skill. Not sure yet. :) But I find removing comments an integral part of <a href="RefactoringForGrokking.html">RefactoringForGrokking</a>?. And as much as I know I can never believe comments, I still can't stop myself from reading them. That's why they distract me so much! -- <a href="PaulMitchellGears.html">PaulMitchellGears</a>

        I'm starting to notice this sort of thing even outside of programming.

        When I see a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> that's more than a few screens long,
        I often give up halfway through,
        but when the same content is split into 2 or more pages, I'm happy to read the whole thing and add some comments, and/or edit it to make it more concise.

        Many people are scared away from learning programming, because of the perception that it will take "too long" to learn, no matter how useful it may be.

        Rather than removing comments from the source altogether (unless the comments are <em>wrong</em>, I consider this a questionable practice), might it be better to configure your IDE to hide them from you?  If that isn't an option right now, I'm sure it could be added to <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> or <a href="IntellijIdea.html">IntellijIdea</a> without too much difficulty.  Or, if syntax highlighting is available, change the color to something close to the background color.
      </p>

        But remember... <em>other</em> people on the team may find the comments valuable.  Unless the rest of your team agrees, deleting comments because <em>you</em> find them to be a distraction is surely an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>.

        I've heard people rave about editors with a "folding" feature that hides dross (as defined by the user in some cases); if one viewed code with something that could hide/unhide comments at the click of a button, it would probably help. (For all I know, both emacs and vim support such a thing; I've never checked.)
      </p>

      <p>
        I had that thought and rejected it.  It would mean we put in necessary comments, fold them, forget them, and let them drift out of sync with the code because we never look at them.  if it's important enough to be there, it's important enough to keep visible.  if it's not important enough to keep visible, it probably shouldn't be there.
      </p>
      <p>
        That does beg the question of what "should" means, which depends on context.  For instance, it might be better to leave in a comment that is excessive for you if you know this code may have to be maintained by a less experienced programmer who would, in fact, need it.  Of course, if the code can be refactored to elimiate all need for the comment, regardless of the audience that's preferred.

        I believe that this may be missing the point a little.  <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> should, after all, be describing in depth the inputs, outputs, and side-effects of a method.  It should explicitly not be discussing the implementation.  If you're refactoring code within a method then almost by definition the <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> becomes more useful because it should remain completely true after the refactoring, requiring no changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, when refactoring any code, I would suggest that the first step be to read the code and determine exactly what its doing.  The <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> block would be a good place to note this, although it should already be correct.  After completion of the refactoring, you should check to make sure that your code doesn't behave any differently (to external users).  Again, since you have to have some kind of notes in order to do this, <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> should serve that purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your refactoring means that you're changing the comments then either you're doing a lot more than what is normally considered refactoring, or your public comments are exposing your private implementation.

        <em>One of </em><a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a>'s built-in refactorings is "ChangeMethodSignature", so having to change comments doesn't imply doing more than is normally considered refactoring.  If you find you need to document side effects, consider removing side effects.  If you find you need to document inputs, consider renaming the inputs to better reflect your intention.  If you find you need to document outputs, consider renaming your methods to better reflect your intention.  -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a><em></em>
