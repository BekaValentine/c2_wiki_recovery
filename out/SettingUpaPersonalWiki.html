        Setting Upa Personal Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        What is the easiest way to set up a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>? How can one set up a wiki on one's own PC, keeping compilation, coding and learning curve down to a minimum?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Many have done it. Here are their stories:</strong>

        <strong>Caveats on setting up your own wiki</strong>

        Mine is only accessible within my house, yet I got trolled after the second day of use. Now working on PGP signatures to provide AuthorAuthentication. I use <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a>. -- <a href="AndrewMcMeikan.html">AndrewMcMeikan</a>

        <em>Are you pulling my leg? You're going to force each member of your own family to authenticate exactly which one she is before editing your wiki?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course I don't trust my family members. I know them all too well!!! ;->

      </p>
      <p>
        I'm kind of torn on whether a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a> should be private and behind a firewall or not. I mean, when you get right down to it, what percentage of the things you add to your wiki really need to be private? And there's always the chance it'll be useful to someone else.

        Are there any personal wikis out there that don't need to share a public TCP port? Perhaps a personal wiki with its own Web browser? -- <a href="BlakeMason.html">BlakeMason</a>

        My <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a> stays on my hard disk. People can't edit it over the Net. I do publish
        everything, though. I just encrypt private stuff with my key, so not everyone can read
        it. =) -- SachaChua

        I am trying to get my current client to use some sort of Wiki for project documentation and support, but they are extremely paranoid about trade secrets. Therefore, any Wiki we would run needs to be inaccessible outside of the company intranet. -- <a href="HowardLeeHarkness.html">HowardLeeHarkness</a>

        As a skunkworks project, I installed <a href="WxWikiServer.html">WxWikiServer</a> and used it to do some project documentation at work. This program is a minimal web server attached to a minimal Wiki database, written in C++. It was written by Eddie Edwards, with various improvements by Ryan Norton. It is trivially easy to install, works quite well, and there are no known exploits. My installation is entirely behind a firewall. -- <a href="HowardLeeHarkness.html">HowardLeeHarkness</a> (25 April 2005)
