        Candidate Key
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <em>candidate key</em> is a set of attributes, taken from the header of a relational table; with the property that no two records/tuples/rows in the table may have the same <a href="CandidateKey.html">CandidateKey</a>.  In other words, were a table to be projected by any of its candidate keys, the resulting table would always have the same cardinality.  A table may have multiple candidate keys; but it must have at least one (consisting of <em>all</em> attributes in the header); otherwise it would be a bag and not a set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, one is only concerned with <em>independent</em> candidate keys; if a relation with attributes (columns) {NAME, RANK,  SERIAL_NUMBER} were to have {SERIAL_NUMBER} as a candidate key; then {NAME, SERIAL_NUMBER}, {RANK, SERIAL_NUMBER}, and {NAME, RANK, SERIAL_NUMBER} would also be (trivial) candidate keys; however since these are covered by the {SERIAL_NUMBER} <a href="CandidateKey.html">CandidateKey</a> we usually don't care about the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many RDMBS's limit the number of candidate keys to one (or otherwise designate one such key as special); this is often called the <a href="PrimaryKey.html">PrimaryKey</a>. In some implementations, additional keys can be simulated using indexes with a uniqueness constraint.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's worth noting that <em>keys</em> are not a part of the fundamental <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, which requires only that tuples (rows) be unique. Candidate keys are just a way of identifying a subset of the attributes that, taken alone, satisfy this requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        A candidate key can also be considered as the determinant of a <a href="FunctionalDependency.html">FunctionalDependency</a>, a more general concept which, like the candidate key notion, is useful in the analysis and design of database schemas and query algorithms.
