        The book is logically organized into five comprehensive sections all of which focus on specific, related issues. The first section begins with an in-depth examination of the core structures of XML documents and thoroughly describes the techniques for creating rules about those structures. The second section focuses on the tools XML provides for creating documents and DTDs using both highly reusable smaller components and non-XML content. The third section examines the bigger picture of XML structuresfrom architectural issues to documentation considerationgiving you a clear understanding of the tools needed to create elegant documents with maximum flexibility for interchange and integration. Section four explores the sometimes misused or misunderstood features of XML and the last section concludes with an enlightening discussion of XMLs ability to create documents that can be used in multiple scenarios as well as its ability to connect different systems and processes.

        I like this book because it gives practical advice, and a balanced perspective on the "rules" for making "good" XML, and the "whys" behind each.
        In several cases, it gives several options, and the advantages & disadvantages of each, where other books will just say "do this" ("this" being one of them) and not tell you why.

           Now (Mar05) that Xml is being used more in <a href="EnterpriseApplicationIntegration.html">EnterpriseApplicationIntegration</a>, would the community recommend other resources that provide excellent advice to Xml coding, similar to the manners (list whys of certain style) discussed in this book? -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>
