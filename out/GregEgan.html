        Greg Egan
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the best sci-fi writers to emerge in recent years, if not the best. You can read some of his stuff for free on his Web site <a href="http://www.netspace.net.au/~gregegan/">http://www.netspace.net.au/~gregegan/</a> and elsewhere. His themes include body and neural modification, artificial evolution, gender and personal autonomy, quantum physics, cellular automata, and experimental philosophy. Even better, <em>he gets the science right</em>, and raises the right questions.

        Also a computer programmer, which makes him more <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> than <a href="IainBanks.html">IainBanks</a>. So there. ;)

        I was introduced to <a href="GregEgan.html">GregEgan</a> through one of his books of short stories, <em>Axiomatic</em> (ISBN 0061052655). I still consider it the best science fiction I have ever read, and I urge everyone to read it: every story has a twenty-megatonne idea in it. UnstableOrbitsInTheSpaceOfLies is one of the finest titles I've come across (it's sort of about <a href="ChaosTheory.html">ChaosTheory</a> applied to religion - it helps if you know what a <a href="StrangeAttractor.html">StrangeAttractor</a> is). See <a href="http://public.logica.com/~stepneys/sf/books/e/egan.htm#axiom">http://public.logica.com/~stepneys/sf/books/e/egan.htm#axiom</a> for a one-line description of each story. -- <a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a>

        Some of Egan's shorts are the most unsettling I have read.  As a parent I found "The Cutie" almost unbearable.  -- <a href="TomAyerst.html">TomAyerst</a>
