        <strong>The Three Way Model</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Things you 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           must do - "Thou Shalt"
        </li>
        <li>
           must not do - "Thou Shalt Not"
        </li>
        <li>
           might do - "Thou Decidest Upon" (<a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Actually the third one, might do, is composed of the first two, within an operating context of IfThenElse something, or When something, or While something, or generally Conditional something.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first two are the clearest of the decisions. It is the last one that presents more trouble, because it is left up to you to decide, and as a result, you are to construct a decision model. It involves not only the when, while or if, but also many other obvious conditions, and includes all that is doable which you are not mandated to do or not to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why it is necessary that I, the programmer, must have mind at least the start, if not also the end, before deciding <a href="WhatToDo.html">WhatToDo</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some might call this specification, others might call it planning, but in either case it is to be an activity before decision. It involves the consideration of not only what you do, but also how that might affect others, other things, and other activities.
