        Bob Cratchett Syndrome
      </h1>
      <p>
        When an employer, employee, or someone else believes that an employee's primary duty is to the employer; above any duty to anyone else--and that employee ought to be thankful for having a job, no matter how bad the pay or working conditions are.  Named after the character Bob Cratchett in the novel <em>A Christmas Carol</em> (AchristmasCarolBook) by <a href="CharlesDickens.html">CharlesDickens</a>, who put up with all sorts of abuse (and a slave-wage) from his employer EbenezerScrooge and was generally quite happy about it.  In one scene in the novel (over a meager Christmas party and no bonuses), offered a prayer for Scrooge as the "founder of our feast"--which sent Mrs. Cratchett into a tizzy-fit.
