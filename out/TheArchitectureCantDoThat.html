        The Architecture Cant Do That
      </h1>
      <p>
        A common <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, wherein an unexpected request for a new capability, causes an assumption or requirement of an existing architecture (software or otherwise) to be violated.  The usual retort from developers when such occurs, is:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sorry, but the architecture can't </em>'do<em>' that!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is seldom true--unless the request is something truly impossible (like solving the halting problem), the system probably <em>can</em> be reconfigured to meet the new request.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in many cases, it's expensive:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Invalidation of an architectural assumption may cause significant rework
        </li>
        <li>
           The rework may provide a major maintenance nightmare, if compatibility with currently-deployed systems must be made
        </li>
        <li>
           Given constraints of schedule and budget, the claim "we can't do that" may become true.
        </li>
        <li>
           If memory or computational power is an issue; resolution may require a more powerful computing platform.  Whether or not the development team provides the platform or the customer does; either way this is a major PITA.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Common causes of this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some parameter, field, protocol, or other entity which doesn't provide ample room for expansion--the <a href="FixedQuantityOverflowBug.html">FixedQuantityOverflowBug</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Going from one to <em>n</em> (<em>n</em> > 1) instances of some thing--the SingletonAssumption.  (Going from <em>n</em> to <em>n + k</em>, where <em>n > 1</em> and <em>k</em> isn't so large as to introduce scalability issues, is usually a minor deal, providing proper coding practices are followed--such as not hardcoding <em>n</em> in a million different places).
        </li>
        <li>
           Overtaxing CPU and/or memory.  This is a major issue in <a href="EmbeddedSystems.html">EmbeddedSystems</a> especially (though where I work; FPGA space is usually the resource that gets exhausted first, and we often buy the biggest FPGAs we can).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the context of UI or <a href="InteractionDesign.html">InteractionDesign</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use of a graphics framework or toolkit with a fixed set of widgets, and which makes it difficult to create new ones.
        </li>
        <li>
           Introduction of context-dependent UI elements where they are not expected.  Many toolkits/frameworks (and the programmers that use them) consider context dependencies to be icky.  Modular software design often explicitly discourages context dependencies.  Users often love them, however.
        </li>
        <li>
           Change of UI paradigm, or introduction of UI elements which require such.  A "back" button, for example--ubiquitous on web browsers, but often a royal beyotch to deal with in heavily stateful frameworks that don't anticipate such a feature.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ways to mitigate:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Anticipate future requirements--not just functional, but interface requirements to.  Make sure current requirements are well-known.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Parameterize dependencies. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Document the limitations of the architecture.  No systems design is limitless; so make sure the limitations are known to all stakeholders.
        </li>
      </ul>
