        <a href="UniversalParticipation.html">UniversalParticipation</a> (as one of the <a href="SingularitarianWikiPrinciples.html">SingularitarianWikiPrinciples</a>) allows any capable programmer to alter, hopefully improve the underlying <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> of the <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a> in which the programmer is active. -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>

        A fully programmable engine would allow users (editors) much more control over the information presented, to the extent possibly even of making it completely unreadable (trivial example: white text on white background). How could editing access be moderated?

           Permission could be given by a voting module. But first the new modification should be presented on a WikiEngineSandbox -- fp

           The "white lettering problem" could be resolved with a minimum of friction by integrating a private local profile-file, controlling the local appearance for each user -- fp

           SmartWikizens (the inhabitants of a <a href="SmartWiki.html">SmartWiki</a>) must learn new levels of acting with sensibility in a much more sensible environment. Otherwise they eliminate themselves. -- fp

      <p>
        Wikis as forums with <a href="ContentEditableByAll.html">ContentEditableByAll</a> may still shock many people in the Web who experience them for the first time. <a href="SmartWiki.html">SmartWiki</a>s qualify for upstepping in the <a href="FutureShockLevels.html">FutureShockLevels</a>. I bet, in five years, there are a lot of them,  populated by friendly humans (at the same compatibility level as in this forum) accommodating themselves to the next future shock. -- fp
