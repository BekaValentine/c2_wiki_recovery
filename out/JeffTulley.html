        I am currently a software engineer for Fast Search and Transfer.  Previously I worked for Novell for about 5 years.
        I've done a lot of work in Java with various Web <a href="ApplicationServer.html">ApplicationServer</a>s.

        This page started out as ramblings about how to do <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a> when creating GUIs, a problem I keep butting my head against. I found one paper on this: called "Is GUI Testing Difficult", at <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/events/2002/wtixp/papers/Swan.pdf">http://www.cwi.nl/events/2002/wtixp/papers/Swan.pdf</a>
        This was somewhat useful, though I'd like some more details (or maybe it is simply experience I lack).

        I also at one time created a <a href="JavaGuiUnitTesting.html">JavaGuiUnitTesting</a> page to summarize what I learned, being able to be more specific to Java than <a href="GuiUnitTesting.html">GuiUnitTesting</a> or <a href="GuiTesting.html">GuiTesting</a> can be.  (Since Java has its own quirks).
