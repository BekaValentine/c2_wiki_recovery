          /2001 I've moved to Temple, Texas to join McLane Company in developing its core business projects in Java/<a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a>.

        Before that I was an MIS developer supporting marketing at Reliant Energy formerly Houston Lighting and Power.  My degree is in chemistry (oh so long ago) but I quickly got into app development in a plastics engineering group out of school.  Then I developed "end-user" apps for financial planning, using things like SAS, Focus, Nomad, and dBase.  Then I moved to IS in about 85, but as an 'Account Executive' (sort of a liason between IS and a given segment of its internal clients).  I moved into Systems Development in about 91.  I mostly do powerbuilder DB<-->UI apps and unix shell scripts.  My c++, java, smalltalk, and python education I've done on my own.

        I had just taken a course in BusinessProcessAnalysis when I learned about OO in about 92.  The semblance was so striking, I felt that this was a 'hat I could hang my career on'.

        Hoping that decoupled objects allow for decouple-able business.

        The Compiler's new role:  Recompiling the company, rather than the program.  Hmm.
