        Cee Parens Language

      <p>
        Properly spelled C().  An interesting C++ "dialect".
      </p>
      <p>
        And guess what?  You probably already have a compiler for it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What is it?  It is, in many ways, the opposite of <a href="EmbeddedCeePlusPlus.html">EmbeddedCeePlusPlus</a>.  It's essentially <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, minus the following things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The "virtual" keyword...in other words, C() lacks subtype polymorphism, and thus doesn't qualify as an OO language (for the same reason that <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> and <a href="MlLanguage.html">MlLanguage</a>--excluding O'Caml--aren't OO languages).  An exception might be made for the exception hierarchy, as there is no template version of "throw".  :)  Use of libraries which contain non <a href="PlainOldData.html">PlainOldData</a> classes is OK; but creating your own is not.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Inheritance may be used, but only for reuse and not for polymorphism.  Casting from derived classes to base classes is generally discouraged (consider <a href="PrivateInheritance.html">PrivateInheritance</a> so the compiler disallows such) as it results in <a href="ObjectSlicing.html">ObjectSlicing</a> in such an environment.  Multiple inheritance is OK; virtual base classes are not. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of C style casts and reinterpret_cast are discouraged (though they are generally discouraged in C++ as well).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Likewise with "native" arrays and <a href="CharStar.html">CharStar</a>s, other than literals for initialization purposes (The STL vector and string classes are preferred).  <a href="PointerArithmetic.html">PointerArithmetic</a> is also obviously frowned upon.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Templates are highly encouraged--with subtype polymorphism being deleted, generic polymorphism is used to take its place.  Use of things like <a href="StandardTemplateLibrary.html">StandardTemplateLibrary</a>, <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a>, etc. are also highly encouraged.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Feel free to link in your favorite <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> library.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note.  This isn't being advocated as a <em>replacement</em> for C++, instead it is suggested as an interesting functional dialect of C/C++.

        Don't look for references on google (yet), I just made this up.  :)
