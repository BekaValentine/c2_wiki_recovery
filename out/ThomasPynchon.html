        Thomas Pynchon
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ThomasPynchon.html">ThomasPynchon</a> writes his own quirky brand of fiction with fractured plots, a zoo of characters, and a rich network of references to mysticism, recent or ancient history, and above all, music and it's rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has written <a href="GravitysRainbow.html">GravitysRainbow</a>, his densest work, but also VineLand, TheCryingOfLotFortyNine, and more recently, MasonAndDixon.
      </p>
      <p>
        He reads like a mix of <a href="RobertAntonWilson.html">RobertAntonWilson</a>, Philipp K Dick (<a href="PhilDick.html">PhilDick</a>) sometimes, and can be difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        He's worth the effort.

        Not much is known about the author. Some believe <a href="ThomasPynchon.html">ThomasPynchon</a> is a pseudonym for a famous author who wouldn't otherwise write <a href="ThomasPynchon.html">ThomasPynchon</a> books. Other people call him the Greta Garbo of Letters.
