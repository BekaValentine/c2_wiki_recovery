        Watch Your Six
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Watch Your Six</em> is the term used by military aviators of which <a href="CoverYourAss.html">CoverYourAss</a> (CYA) is the civilian analog. I put it in as a euphemism for such things as CYA, which is the motivation for things like <a href="PearlHarborFile.html">PearlHarborFile</a>(s). The issue is that when you are directed to do stupid things, you need to be sure that the system isn't setting you up as the fall guy. <a href="GetItInWriting.html">GetItInWriting</a> is probably one of the related ideas. <a href="BlowingTheWhistle.html">BlowingTheWhistle</a> is a nice strategy, but tends to shorten your employment and make you unemployable to boot. So the next best thing is to make it obviously dangerous to make you the fall-guy so that such predators will search elsewhere for targets. If this sounds cynical, I've got a lot of experience watching the unscrupulous prey on the unwary. <a href="CaveatEmptor.html">CaveatEmptor</a> is good advice in all domains. -- <a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>
