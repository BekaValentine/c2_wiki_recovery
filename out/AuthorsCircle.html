        Authors Circle
      </h1>
      <p>
        ... the reviewers are assembled <a href="SittingInaCircle.html">SittingInaCircle</a>,
        ready for the review process.
        The circle brings the full community in direct
        contact with the author and with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has become common practice to invite observers
        to writers workshops:  where do they sit?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>*  *  *</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bringing non-authors into</strong>
        <strong>the literal and figurative inner circle might cause</strong>
        <strong>discomfort for the author, and can be contrary to a</strong>
        <strong></strong><a href="SafeSetting.html">SafeSetting</a>.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On the other hand, the </strong><a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a> is a<strong></strong>
        <strong>good learning opportunity for those outside</strong>
        <strong>the literary community, and they should be welcome.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But just because they are in the</strong>
        <strong>room doesn't mean that they are part of</strong>
        <strong>the community of trust.  If they are made</strong>
        <strong>part of the circle, they will feel like</strong>
        <strong>participating; yet they don't yet know the</strong>
        <strong>conventions for effective participation.</strong>
        <strong>Excluding them altogether is disengaging.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Arrange the room in two circles.  The inner circle</strong>
        <strong>contains the authors and the moderator.  The outer</strong>
        <strong>circle, or "gallery," is for non-authors.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Authors that wish to remove themselves from active
        participation should also remove themselves to the
        outer circle, rather than sitting passively in the
        inner circle:  The author being reviewed (and the
        moderator, representing the author's interest) should
        expect participation from all members of the inner circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>*  *  *</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This pattern strongly recalls <a href="WorkshopComprisesAuthors.html">WorkshopComprisesAuthors</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The circle makes it easy for everyone to see
        the author eye-to-eye during <a href="AuthorReadsTheWork.html">AuthorReadsTheWork</a>,
        <a href="SuggestionsForImprovement.html">SuggestionsForImprovement</a>,
        and <a href="ThankTheAuthor.html">ThankTheAuthor</a>.
        All the reviewers can see each other during
        the <em>dialog</em> of <a href="SuggestionsForImprovement.html">SuggestionsForImprovement</a>.
        The outer circle also provides a context for
        the <a href="FlyOnTheWall.html">FlyOnTheWall</a> author to retire to
        (behind the <a href="AuthorsCircle.html">AuthorsCircle</a>) as the work is being
        reviewed.
