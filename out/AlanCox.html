        Second in command for linux development.  <em>Or was; these days his position within the Linux hierarchy seems to be a bit lower.  Not sure why; don't follow the linux kernel mailing list enought to know the politics behind it.</em>

        Alan is always interested in getting more different hardware running with Linux.
        He is collecting both the hardware and software that makes this hardware run. He seems to accept almost anything that is electrically powered and any driver that would run this equipment.

        Because he wants to test this in a stable environment he creates his own patches to the current stable kernel. The well known -ac kernel patches. A lot of work in there is very experimental but every stable kernel release includes a lot of code from his development tree
