        How often have you heard the expression "You'll just have to learn to live with it" offered as a remedy to a problem which is assumed to have no easy solutions.

Here is a short list of problems and possible approaches with some online resources which may prove to be helpful:

        Handling difficult situations by negotiations:
      </p>
      <p>
        The principles of negotiation and conflict management are based on the assumption that we value relationships and the people we do business with, work with, and the people we live with.

        Handling the "To much to do" drain:
      </p>
      <p>
        Pressure and stress can threaten your effectiveness.  Take control of your priorities, maintain a usable "to do" list. Be confident of your abilities to make sound decisions under pressure. Be flexible while at the same time being mindful of your goals. Be willing to say "No", or "I don't have available time", when needed.

        Moreover, if a person is happy there is more stress tolerance. And a person can be happier if they have more compassion towards other people around them (source Discovery channel program on Happiness).
        It would be difficult to image people to develop compassion for others, if they are continually involved in different <a href="FragileRelationships.html">FragileRelationships</a>. --dl

        <em>A healthy dose of laughter and a sense of humor</em> - I read that a child laughs 400 times a day on the average, while an adult laughs only 15 times each day.  Which is puzzling since laughter feels so good and is so good for us! - Hugging is practically perfect: there are no movable parts, no batteries to wear out, no periodic check-ups; it has low energy consumption and high energy yield; it is inflation-proof; it is non-fattening; it requires no monthly payments and no insurance; it is theft-proof, non-taxable, non-polluting and, of course, fully returnable. Now, let's go practice! - This and more at: Gnome Thoughts & Philosophy <a href="http://www.gnome007.fsnet.co.uk/gnothout.html.">http://www.gnome007.fsnet.co.uk/gnothout.html.</a>

        What are your suggested solutions?
      </p>
      <p>
        Adopt a way of looking at life that includes recreation and diversion. Realizing that we work to live, not live to work.
        Try to balance activities in such a way as to encourage physical exercise on a daily basis. When away from work, don't be working and planning, be involved with family, friends and community.

        I find that the little things matter.  In the same way that over time a bunch of little stressors add-up to overload, so can little stress relievers add-up to stress unload.
