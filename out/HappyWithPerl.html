        Happy With Perl
      </h1>
      <p>
        Everybody seems to be making a fuss about this <a href="WebTwoPointOh.html">WebTwoPointOh</a> business and how <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> or <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> or EmeraldOnPylons or what-have-you is the <a href="NextBigThing.html">NextBigThing</a>. I'll stick to my good old sturdy reliable <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, thanks.

        <em>This seems to be the </em>DecadeOfSlaggingPerl, for no reason that I can find. I use Perl and seem to get things done faster than my Python colleagues. I like how <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s are so tightly integrated into the language. Of course the object system sucks, where sucks is defined as not the same as <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.<em></em>

           I find it ironic that the tone of the previous two comments implies that their authors don't even know <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, or anything else comparable to Perl. To know whether it's worth the switch, don't you have to know a little about what's out there? --<a href="MarnenLaibowKoser.html">MarnenLaibowKoser</a> (whose own view is strikingly similar to <a href="RobertFisher.html">RobertFisher</a>'s comment below), 13 May 2011

        I'll stick to my good old sturdy reliable BashLanguage, thanks. ;)

           If it works for you, fine and dandy, and I'm no Perl fanatic, I'm not even Yet Another Perl Hacker (although I do hack perl on occasion), <strong>but</strong> for <strong>non-casual</strong> purposes, shell languages like Bash are not in the running. I prefer Bash (or even tcsh/csh) when the goal is simple enough, but not for non-trivial purposes. Programmability of Unix shells is important, but an afterthought, in a very real sense; as complexity increases, it begins to make sense to move to a more powerful programming language that is still shell-like, whether that is awk, perl, python, ruby, or other. (I first implemented a Unix shell from scratch circa 1978, so although not ex cathedra, I do say the above advisedly.)

              I'm happy with Perl. It is perfectly <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a> for many tasks that are too complex for Bash, too simple for a "big project" language, & not worth doing in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>. I have, however, come to prefer <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> for most tasks I used to use Perl for. (Although I'm actively exploring to see if I find something I prefer even more... to the point that I don't actually write very much Ruby at the moment.) If there's a convenient CPAN (<a href="ComprehensivePerlArchiveNetwork.html">ComprehensivePerlArchiveNetwork</a>) module that'll make the task easy & I can't find an equivalent Ruby module, I'll happily use Perl. Likewise if (for some brain dead reason) I have Perl available but not Ruby.
