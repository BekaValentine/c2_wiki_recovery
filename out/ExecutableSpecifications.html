        Executable Specifications

        When I started to do <a href="StorytestDrivenDevelopment.html">StorytestDrivenDevelopment</a> (SDD) in 2002-2003, I began to think of the storytests as being mini specifications.  That naturally led to calling them "executable specifications" since we were automating them.

        When I discuss <a href="ExecutableSpecifications.html">ExecutableSpecifications</a> with newbies, I often make the distinction that regular old specifications can easily get out of synch with what a system actually does.  By automating the specifications, we ensure that essential system functionality behaves as its customers expect it to.  --<a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>

        A related thought: I tried to explain to an enquirer today as to how workers in an establishment might use RSS. I used the example of using it as a means of keeping up to date with the changes in governing documents which might be posted to an intranet site, such as specifications. I explained using RSS would enable the interested individuals to have a method of synchronization as to "what is going on here". -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> 20070818
