        <a href="MicrosoftExchangeServer.html">MicrosoftExchangeServer</a> is an email server from MS, and it has special capabilities when used in conjunction with <a href="MicrosoftOutlook.html">MicrosoftOutlook</a> on client PCs (e.g. OutlookWebAccess).

        The oldest supported version is 1997 introduced v5.5 which will be deprecated by end 2005, however third party support from the likes of Dell is becoming available.

        Sites that use <a href="MicrosoftExchangeServer.html">MicrosoftExchangeServer</a> but have hung on to the soon retiring V5.5 are probably those that have not committed to using <a href="ActiveDirectory.html">ActiveDirectory</a>, as this would have been a massive undertaking for any sizable organization.

        Exchange Server 2003, code name "Titanium", has not yet been in widespread use as at 2005. This is supposedly built on the same code base as Exchange 2000, with a <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> touch added to it. Some of its improvements over Exchange 2000 is integrated support for <a href="MobileInformationDevices.html">MobileInformationDevices</a> (e.g. <a href="SmartPhone.html">SmartPhone</a> or WAP (WebApplicationProtocol) enabled <a href="MobilePhone.html">MobilePhone</a>), and enhancements that support more "server consolidation" (e.g. more mailboxes per server).

        The next version of Exchange is code named "Kodiak", and supposedly linked to the <a href="MicrosoftSqlServer.html">MicrosoftSqlServer</a> Yukon.
