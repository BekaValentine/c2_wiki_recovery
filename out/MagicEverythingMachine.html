        "It's easier to turn features on than add them from scratch."
      </p>
      <p>
        [insert reference]
      </p>
      <p>
        Answering that with rigor would require a large volume of usage surveys, which I cannot afford. But in general it boils down to how many collection-oriented features/operations (<a href="CollectionOrientedVerbs.html">CollectionOrientedVerbs</a> or COV) one needs versus scalar or single-cell kind of features/operations. Let's call this CTSR - Collection-To-Singular Ratio. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If I am doing heavy processing on strings as collections of characters or phrases, I tend to load them into tables. I've built a fair number of special-purpose table-oriented parsers over the years. However, most of the time we don't need many COV on strings, so we can treat them as single things without too many problems. The CTSR for strings is usually low <strong>in practice</strong>. If it grows high or possibly will be high in the future, then it may be better to table-ize the string, or at least use a collection system more powerful than strings and string operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's take trees. If we are only doing tree-oriented things and will likely stay only doing tree-oriented things, then a dedicated tree may be satisfactory. But in my experience in my domain, no non-trivial structure of lasting use will escape the need for <strong>usages not originally anticipated</strong>. This is a huge fact of life that always hangs over any developer. The ability to adapt to non-anticipated uses is one of the strongest features of existing RDBMS, even with their current limits. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Why limit yourself to just a tree if you don't have to? If you pre-limit yourself to just a tree and then later need non-tree features, it's often labor-intensive to convert the info and software to use something else. IS-A has a high cost if you pick the wrong IS-A. I'd rather toggle features on and off as I need them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer is performance. Single-purpose structures or collection-systems can generally out-perform RDBMS. But, <strong>this is a "physical" reason, not a logic one</strong>. If horsepower was not an issue, why not <strong>take something that has every collection-oriented feature in the world so that we get any feature we want without abandoning our tool</strong>? If you want to turn a feature off, you either don't use it or change some config setting to disallow it. Turning features on or off is a lot easier than adding them from scratch or abandoning our structure for a new "kind". (An exception may be if the volume of features is so large as to overwhelm us. Feature catalogs can perhaps help here so that we can disable banks of features at a time.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But this <a href="MagicEverythingMachine.html">MagicEverythingMachine</a><strong> does not exist. We'd all use the MEM if it existed, agreed? The problem though is its lack of existence. However, the closest collection-oriented thing on the market is a RDBMS of some form. Thus, if you can get a Tree System AND a Relational System all-in-one, you should take it. The only excuses left not to would be:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Price-tag 
        </li>
        <li>
           Machine Performance - too slow or a resource hog
        </li>
        <li>
           Some special need where you know for sure your needs will forever be limited to a known dedicated structure "type". 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now back to strings. If I had a new need to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string in order to generate titles and my string functions don't have such an operation, it would be nice to write something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        update myString set letter=Ucase(letter) where position_in_word = 1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If we had our <a href="MagicEverythingMachine.html">MagicEverythingMachine</a> we could perhaps do that without much hassle.

        <em>"But in my experience in my domain, no non-trivial structure of lasting use will escape the need for </em>'usages not originally anticipated<em>'."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this is a crucial sentence, and one that possibly highlights the differences between:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The domain that you work in vs other domains, and 
        </li>
        <li>
           Your approach to programming within that domain vs other approaches.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since the domain you work in involves creating end-user oriented business applications -- which I presume are driven by <a href="CrudScreens.html">CrudScreens</a> and are used to generate reports -- I can easily see how the inevitably-dynamic nature of business would impinge on development decisions.  Indeed, having worked in that domain myself, I know that <em>anything</em> in the business assumed to be fixed and immutable today will change tomorrow.  In that context, the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> is ideal -- I know of no other implemented model that provides the same positive flexibility-to-effort ratio for implementing and maintaining business applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, outside of that domain -- or even <em>within</em> that domain using a development approach that focuses on creating invariant computational abstractions, in order to more effectively handle end-user requirements than existing tools currently support -- various container requirements may be identified. E.g., we need to represent an abstract syntax tree, or represent a hierarchy of nested function calls, or model dependencies in order to avoid deadlock.  These require structures that do not map neatly onto tables -- the first example is a tree, the second is a stack, and the third is a graph.  These are also invariants.  They will only change if there are such wholesale changes in the application requirements that altering the container representation is the least of our worries.  For example, we don't need to represent an abstract syntax tree if we're no longer implementing an embedded scripting language.  However, the changes needed will far exceed the relatively minimal effort to switch from one data structure to another, which in such contexts, does not occur anyway.  In implementing an embedded scripting system, the likelihood of needing to change an abstract syntax tree into an abstract syntax graph is vanishingly small.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, the <a href="MagicEverythingMachine.html">MagicEverythingMachine</a> already exists for <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-oriented end-user general business applications, and it's currently represented by a <a href="SqlLanguage.html">SqlLanguage</a> DBMS combined with (typically) a 4GL language designed for the purpose.  For domains outside of <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-oriented end-user general business applications, a <a href="MagicEverythingMachine.html">MagicEverythingMachine</a> may simply not be appropriate, though <a href="AdaptiveCollection.html">AdaptiveCollection</a> and <a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a> certainly imply a greater degree of integration and generalisation than are currently typical, and define unifying structures that are more general-purpose than tables.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, I would hardly agree that the average RDBMS is the closest thing we have to a <a href="MagicEverythingMachine.html">MagicEverythingMachine</a>.  In terms of implemented models, I'd be more inclined to vote for virtually any OO language and its container/collection classes, plus (and this is the important part) whatever interfaces and other abstractions are used to distinguish abstract collections from concrete container representations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OOP out of the box has no collection-oriented abilities, and encapsulation makes adding them difficult. In OO you have to add features to just about every class that wants to use them. In relational you subtract features, not add them. OOP is designed around encapsulation and tight association between operators and entities. These get in the way of collection-oriented thinking.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Production OOP environments certainly provide collection-oriented abilities, in the form of collection and/or container classes, interfaces, and iterators.  Whilst it is certainly true that a typical general-purpose OO language is more of a do-it-yourself construction set than the average SQL DBMS, you can write an operating system (or a DBMS) in a general-purpose OO language, but you can't write an operating system in any DBMS that I've seen.  Thus, a general-purpose OO language is more of a Magic<strong>Everything</strong>Machine than a DBMS.  A DBMS is, at best, a MagicDataProcessingMachineForBusiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you add sufficient collection-oriented features to OO, it will then just about *be* a database, a navigational database of sorts. Thus, with your extensions, we are not comparing OO to relational, but rather OODBMS to RDBMS. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not talking about what can be added to OO; I'm talking about features that <strong>already exist</strong> in popular OO languages like Smalltalk, Java, C#, C++/STL, and so on.  These are not considered databases, and good OO programmers don't focus on modelling domain objects, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And I would indeed looove to have a relational-oriented OS. It would make it easier to track down mystery processes and files. Whether the *entire* OS would be relational though is a sticky matter. We could make relational </em><a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> by adding recursion, but in my opinion it would cause more problems than it solves. The ability to add domain-specific relational operators is sufficient. Relational shouldn't entirely replace app languages, but can do a lot of the heavy lifting.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know what you mean by "[i]n relational you subtract features, not add them", nor do I know what you mean by "encapsulation and tight association between operators and entities [...] get in the way of collection-oriented thinking."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In relational you generally provide operations that can operate on ANY table/tuple-set. In some cases there may need to be limits on this, such as requiring some kind of "parent key" for tree operations, but in general any table that fits the needed characteristics for a operation can participate in that operation. In OOP you have to give it to each class one at a time. Multiple inheritance gets messy when used en-mass, and is not a requirement of OOP.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiple inheritance is not required.  The mechanisms to support containment vary from language to language, but generally involve -- at a minimum -- either identifying, or defining, the mechanism by which one class instance can be compared to another.  This is necessary in order to determine duplicates, find values, etc., in a given container.  This can, of course, be described via inheritance but there are other mechanisms as well.  None necessarily require that you "give it to each class one at a time" unless each class requires a distinct comparison mechanism.  Implementations of the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> that support user-defined types require precisely the same explicitly-defined comparison mechanism, for precisely the same reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind, by the way, that classes and tables/relations are <strong>not</strong> equivalent or even rough analogues.  This is a common blunder (common enough that <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> refer to it as the <a href="FirstGreatBlunder.html">FirstGreatBlunder</a>) and a notable source of confusion and misunderstandings.  Classes are, however, roughly equivalent to attribute type definitions; instances are roughly equivalent to attribute values; and container class instances are roughly equivalent to tables/<a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>s.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I think I see what you're aiming for:  You'd like a <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> general-purpose procedural language that provides self-optimising (in the <a href="AdaptiveCollection.html">AdaptiveCollection</a> sense) persistence-capable tables as its sole container type.  Indeed, you might like these tables to be the primary mechanism by which all abstractions are defined, including types, wrappers around system resources (e.g., tables of files, tables of email messages, tables of mountable volumes, tables of socket messages, tables of lines in a text file, tables of characters in a string, tables of bits in an integer, etc.), and anything else that can be represented as a table.  Yes?
      </p>
      <p>
        If so, that's fine, but please don't call it "relational", because it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Where specifically does it "violate" relational (any more than SQL)? And the dynamic thing is not true because I'd separate the "domain math" from the relational math for the most part. I wouldn't dictate typing (or lack of), at least on the "cell" level.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't violate the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> any more than SQL, but SQL isn't an implementation of the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>.  SQL was inspired by the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>.  Similarly, your ideas are clearly inspired by the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, but as they are often not in keeping with it, it would be helpful (for the sake of accuracy) if you'd refer to it as <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> or some such.  Also, you'd probably draw much less ire from some of us, as your inaccuracies about the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> would no longer be inaccuracies as such, but merely characteristics of Top's <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> model.

        A choice of schema also has a high cost if you pick the wrong schema, it's often labor intensive to convert the data to use something else. Your line of argument depends upon two fallacies:

           An invalid assumption that schema are somehow 'easier' to convert than other data structures.

            <li>
               <em>The operators and "environment" are still the same even if the schema needs a change. But that may not be true with dedicated structure types.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Huh? Is that "<em>may</em> not be true" in the same sense that "<a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> <em>may</em> be the sort of moron who spreads poop all over his monitor and keyboard between eating it?" I smell an allegation made without any evidence or reason. I would suspect that any DBMS that provided functions and constructors necessary to support user-defined types wouldn't suddenly "lose" these operators when the "schema needs a change" or even just for transitional transforms for joins and such... but I suppose that "<em>may</em> not be true".

               RE: <em>every structure having access to every operator UNLESS...</em> - haha, of course you do. I'll humor you: if you truly believe this, then show me where in SMEQL you support the abilities to compare a relation less than a date and intersect two integers. Anyhow, I seriously doubt you can defend the statement that this approach offers <em>"more powerful change-friendliness and better reuse of concepts".</em>

            <li>
               RE: <em>How are you deciding which structure "kind" gets tree operations, which gets relational operations, and which gets both?</em> - I'm not clear on what sort of fubar'd <a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a> you're imagining, but I have never seen one where associating structures with operations is a problem. <a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a>s with user-defined types usually have each type belongs to one of a few basic classes of type (such as [sum-type, tuple-type, function] in Haskell, or [struct, array, class, int, double, float, union, pointer, fnpointer] in C). Each type implies the set of operators associated with it, and each operator has a return value that also has an associate type (usually dependent on the type of the input, sometimes dependent on the instance of the input for <a href="DependentTyping.html">DependentTyping</a>). For example, one can project on a C structure by asking for a particular entry by name. Further, in most languages (even those without user-defined types), one can usually construct more complicated operators in the form of functions or expressions. It's worth noting that a perfectly valid class of type is 'relation', and relations would be the types over which relational operators apply. <strong>At no time is it unclear which operations are valid.</strong> More relevant is whether this type-safety is provided statically, dynamically, or not at all, and perhaps whether the type information can be deleted.

Perhaps you can clarify two things for me: (1) What technical advantages do you believe using "relational-friendly sets to manage restrictions" offer over non-set types such as those based on <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>?

        Converting data structures to other domain types <em>including relations</em> is the task of user-defined functions. Generalized relational aggregation ((A->A->A)->A->(T->A)->{Rel T}->A, first argument commutative and associative) allows one to convert relations - it's effectively the <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a> of relational programming. (Similar to <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a>, one can implement relational 'map' function, filtering, etc. using 'relational union' and the 'empty set' as the first two arguments to the aggregator.)
