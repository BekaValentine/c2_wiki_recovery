        Arithmetic If
      </h1>
      <p>
        Arithmetic IF is a kind of conditional command used in some programming languages such as <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>, FocalLanguage, and <a href="TeXnicard.html">TeXnicard</a>. It is considered a old (obsoleted) feature of FORTRAN. It means a conditional based on whether a number is being negative/zero/positive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some programming languages may use a imperative arithmetic IF, which takes line numbers (or line labels) to jump to based on the result being negative/zero/positive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some use functional arithmetic IF, where it takes the number to check and the three responses to give, one if negative, one if zero, one if positive; rather than causing flow control or side effects.

        I happen to think that <a href="DeeCee.html">DeeCee</a> would be better if it used arithmetic IF rather than how it actually uses.
