        About 6 months with average wear and tear. After that it decomposes into lint, which is forever. Now 6 months =~ 183 days * 24 hours/day * 60 mins/hour * 60 secs/min * 300,000,000 meters/sec * 39 inches/meter = about 2*10e17 inches. But the width varies.

        <em>Ah, that finally clears up my misunderstandings about </em>CosmicStringTheory!  Clearly they all degrade into CosmicLint, which is why my office desk gets so dusty.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But why on earth is the duration multiplied by m/s?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, obviously, 300 000 000 m/s is the speed of light, the standard constant for converting time units to space units. Geez, what are you, dense?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Smells like the horses legs "joke".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Which is?</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        ISO or ANSI string?
      </p>
      <p>
        Depends on the piece of string.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depends if it's null-terminated or not._{A#5d?\12^1>[4+bn\003dv~% 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's knot-terminated, of course!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as the ends are far apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as the ends <em>could be</em> apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just this long.
      </p>
      <p>
        One string long.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Half as long as two pieces of string.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twice the length from the center to either end.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one I have was 100 feet long when manufactured, but It is a little longer now, The paper binding came loose and I had to rewind the loose end. I rewound it with a little extra tension. You can purchase as many as you need to fly your kite. But do not fly your kite around power lines. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Just make sure that if it has one end, it has another end. Otherwise it's really not string and any measurement is going to be invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the string if I weld the ends together so that it no longer has any ends, given that it's not a string. This suggests that the length is some kind of line integral ...
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, what if the string is shaped like a lower-case sigma?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or a super-string?
      </p>
      <p>
        string  someString;
        int     length = someString.size ();
      </p>
      <p>
        Does the length of a string vary when we use a proportional font?
      </p>
      <p>
        The string is of <em>infinite</em> length -- it is only meaningful to measure its fractal dimension.

        Ah, but it's not how long is a string. It's <a href="HowLongIsaPieceOfString.html">HowLongIsaPieceOfString</a>. Pieces of strings these days come in units of 8 or 16 bits. But of course this isn't really long enough for all earthly alphabets, much less the weird and wonderful alphabets that will happen along once the <a href="SeTi.html">SeTi</a> project succeeds. Anyone care to take a ball-park stab at how many bits pieces of a universal string might measure?
      </p>
      <p>
        Its not long at all. Piece of string (i.e. char) and long are incompatible primitive types.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SeTi.html">SeTi</a> characters can <em>(of course ;-)</em> be identified by "Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs)".
        (<a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> more sensibly calls these GUIDs.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So it's "how long is a substring?"</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        Len(Mid$(someString,3,8)) = 8?<br/>

      <p>
        Is it a variable length string?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Depends on how hot or cold it is.
        <em>(Expansion/contraction of physical substances when heated/cooled.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Depends on how fast it's moving.
        <em>(Relativity.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Depends on where it is.

        ...And for CHF 50,00 ISO will tell you what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Depends on how hard you pull on it.  (Even cold rolled steel has some elasticity.)
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Depends on the piece of string.

        Doesn't the <a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a> specify a standard length ?

        There's bound to be a lower limit at which point the braiding isn't enough to hold it together - would a string segment of this length be a definitive "piece"?
