        Chair Continuity

      <p>
        Going from total immersion in a conference, to isolation
        from the conference, is good neither for the conference
        nor the chair.  The chair accumulates a wealth of experience
        during her tenure, experience that should not go to waste.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chair deserves a rest after a year of hard work on
        behalf of a conference, yet should be given a place of
        honor and influence in the successor conference:
        Many cultures find esteemed positions of
        background influence for leaders whose
        formal responsibilities come to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>  Invite last year's chair to
        a prominent position on the ProgramCommittee.
        The former chair can advise the current chair
        in areas of the current chair's inexperience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chairs from prior years can add much to a program
        committee as well, as long as one can avoid the
        problem of too much leadership and not enough workers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The authority of the current chair and wisdom of the
        immediate past chair come into balance under the mutual
        respect fitting their stations.
