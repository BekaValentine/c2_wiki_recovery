        Any Thing

      <p>
        <a href="AnyThing.html">AnyThing</a> is a data type for representing simple values (integers, real numbers, strings) as well as sequences and dictionaries of AnyThings. <a href="AnyThing.html">AnyThing</a> was invented by <a href="AndreWeinand.html">AndreWeinand</a> (and some others simultaneously).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Smalltalkers say they prefer either <a href="OrderedCollection.html">OrderedCollection</a> or Dictionary as their preferred class for collecting things. <a href="AnyThing.html">AnyThing</a> is both combined into one.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has a great benefit for developers. They do not need to think what data structure to select (e.g. from the huge STL options), they just use <a href="AnyThing.html">AnyThing</a> without the need to make a decision. In those cases where <a href="AnyThing.html">AnyThing</a> performance is insufficent, those clever enough to recognize are usually aware of alternative options.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition <a href="AnyThing.html">AnyThing</a> makes an ideal catch-all parameter and context implementation in request processing systems. I wonder why the Java guys didn't use such a single universal mechanism when they still had the choice.

        Gee, such a great idea. I wonder why LISP doesn't have it...
