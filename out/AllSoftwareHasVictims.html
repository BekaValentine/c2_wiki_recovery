        All Software Has Victims
      </h1>
      <p>
        All Software Has Victims? I thought only military software had victims? No, every use of software advantages someone and disadvantages someone or something else. Prove otherwise, if you think you can:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is true for the use of anything. So why pick on software?</em>
      </p>

      <code>
        Advantage for the actual user -> Fun, if that's what you want to call it.<br/>
        Disadvantage for whoever pays the user -> wasted work-time.<br/>
      </code>
