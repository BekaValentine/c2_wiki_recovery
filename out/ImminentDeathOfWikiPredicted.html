        Back in the good old days of <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>, predicting the "imminent death of the 'net" was a popular sport (wherein the "net" could, depending on context, refer to <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> or the Internet as a whole). The phrase "imminent death of net predicted" was originally coined by BradTempleton in his 1989 <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> posting "Net History In Brief" (<a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/nethist.html).">http://www.templetons.com/brad/nethist.html).</a>

        Lots of things have, over the years, been suggested as the cause of the ImminentDeathOfTheNet, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Spam
        </li>
        <li>
           Providing college freshmen with net access (back before the GeneralPublic found out; indeed, before the general public <em>could</em> get on the Net, at least not without spending thousands of dollars)
        </li>
        <li>
           Net kooks (especially the notorious SerdarArgic)

        I remember screaming "No! Don't tell 'em" at the TV set back early in Clinton's first term, where SlickWillie gave his first "information superhighway" speech (this is not where Al Gore allegedly claimed to have <a href="InventedTheInternet.html">InventedTheInternet</a>). Like all good residents of an exclusive resort, the thought of a technological trailer park moving in next door was terrifying...

        Obviously, the Internet is still alive, though wildly different. <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> has arguably been spoiled by spammers, though it still occasionally is useful. The net media that best carries on the tradition of <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> are portal sites (though they do so poorly), 'Blogs, and Wiki.

        So imagine my horror to find the following article on cnn.com:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Wikipedia: The know-it-all Web site" (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/08/03/wikipedia/index.html)">http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/08/03/wikipedia/index.html)</a></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        (No mention of <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> or <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, though. You've escaped becoming the next <a href="TimBernersLee.html">TimBernersLee</a> <em>this</em> time, Ward...)
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the signs of the WikiApocalypse is, of course, mass media coverage of Wiki. Therefore, in grand <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> tradition....
