      <ul>
        <li>
          It can be organized like an application instead of a document.
        </li>
        <li>
          It reads like application code instead of text markup, HTML, or XML . 
        </li>
        <li>
          It is easier to manage than a document, due to it being geared for application.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is more complex than a document.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is <strong>not</strong> driven line by line, line after line, by carriage return, like in a document.
        </li>
        <li>
          It uses precise screen positioning like in offline software applications who use forms with Left, Top, Width, attributes or properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          It uses properties, an object-oriented way of accessing a control.
        </li>
        <li>
          It uses widgets and components as a basis instead of text or rich text or marked up text.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is not embedded in a document. It is not an e-brochure or a flat enriched document. It is a true application on the screen, similar to offline software applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          It can load documents into widgets or components. Loading applications into documents is <a href="AssBackwards.html">AssBackwards</a>, so CAWBL loads documents into the application's widgets.
        </li>
      </ul>
