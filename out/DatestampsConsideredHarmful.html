        Datestamps Considered Harmful
      </h1>
      <p>
        Date stamps make sense when you're talking about something specific to a point in time. The newest release of <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a>, for example. You'll find that most things discussed on Wiki aren't like that, however, so it's probably best to avoid datestamps generally.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good rule of thumb might be to imagine strangers reading your words in a year. Will they care about the date? If so (for example, a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> running down backlinks to <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> or <a href="DeletedUnlessDefended.html">DeletedUnlessDefended</a>), put it in. If not, leave it out. Better still, write in a way that doesn't require datestamps.

        If on the other hand you use Datestamps to identify the page version in a stored filesystem or database, DatestampsAreUseful. Also as recorded on the bottom of this page, a Datestamp is used to indicate the last edit, certainly <strong>not</strong> harmful. <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a> on the User and Use as to whether Datestamps are useful. If harmful to you as a user, don't, if useful to you as a user, do. If you don't like a Datestamp on a page, Delete it. ThisIsWikiAfterAll. If someone deletes a date you want to remain, restore it.
