        Programming Is For Morning
      </h1>
      <p>
        Same idea as <a href="ProgrammingIsForNighttime.html">ProgrammingIsForNighttime</a> but many of
        us are morning people.

        Some of the peace argument also remains, since
        many people who have the choice, will elect
        to arrive at work late rather than early. If
        you arrive early, you can get a sort of head start
        to a day before more people arrive and get some
        things done. There will be a little less
        interruptions, at least.
