        Ron Jeffries Is Evil
      </h1>
      <p>
        When a little angel appears over your left shoulder saying "I think you can get by only turning the knob to 9.75 there", a little red <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> with horns appears over your other shoulder...
      </p>

      <p>
        Ron recently expressed disappointment on the <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a> that he had not achieved evil status yet. This page is in dedication of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This has got to be the funniest page I've seen here in a while.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's nice, but should I then fear him?  In other words, is RonJeffriesConsideredHarmful?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or is he <a href="MostlyHarmless.html">MostlyHarmless</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        More importantly, Who is <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> ?
      </p>

        He's a <em>methodologist</em>. Of course he's evil. ;) -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I thought he was the SpeedSeduction guy ... Oh, that's <em>Ross</em> Jeffries. But yes, he's evil too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Come code with me sometime, Young Shahwalker. We'll see who's a methodologist.

        How can anyone so cute and cuddly truly be evil?
