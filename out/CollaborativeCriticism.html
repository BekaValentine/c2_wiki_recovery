        Collaborative Criticism

      <p>
        <a href="CollaborativeCriticism.html">CollaborativeCriticism</a> is using a community to examine and potentially produce better understanding of a writing, work, missive, political speech, debate, law, media article, etc....
      </p>
      <p>
        It is especially important if the community is in some way out of balance with the author of the work.

        I have some fragile code based on a <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> running at <a href="http://drf5n.freeshell.org/piki.cgi">http://drf5n.freeshell.org/piki.cgi</a>

        I see it as using the power of a wiki to enable many eyes to make small criticisms and feedbacks to public speeches and policies. I also see it as kinder, more useful, and ultimately more effective than the blogger practice of Fisking: If 10-100 people research, criticise, and collect their arguments in a wiki focused on a political statement, business, media publication, or journalist, the criticism is likely to be of high level, and the original writer would have to take notice.

        <a href="DavidBrin.html">DavidBrin</a>'s "The Transparent Society" made me see wikis as a possible method for ensuring accountability of the powerful.
