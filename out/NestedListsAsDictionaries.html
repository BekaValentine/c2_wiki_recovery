        Nested Lists As Dictionaries
      </h1>
      <p>
        Largely for top's benefit, a quick illustration of how nested lists can be used to express dictionaries and even (*gasp*) tables.
      </p>
      <code>
        ;; A key -> value mapping, called an alist (association list) in Lisp<br/>
        (setf an-alist '((employee-name   "George")<br/>
        (hire-date        "10/10/1951")<br/>
        (salary           1000.0)))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; Fetch the 'employee-name' field<br/>
        (cadr (assoc 'employee-name an-alist))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; Give him a raise<br/>
        (setf (cadr (assoc 'employee-name an-alist)) 1100.0)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; Now, suppose we have a whole list of employee records like that one . . .<br/>
        ;; Find all of the employees with a salary greater than 1000.0<br/>
        (find-if (lambda (employee) (> (cadr (assoc 'salary employee)) 1000.0)) employees)<br/>
      </code>

        <em>Whether tables can be encoded as </em><a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a> (or using any other reasonable data model) is not the issue. How prevalent is language or standard library support for using <a href="AssociationList.html">AssociationList</a>s as RelationalTables -- for example, doing <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a> on them? -- <a href="DavidSarahHopwood.html">DavidSarahHopwood</a><em></em>

        It ain't exactly SQL, but I fail to see that there's anything tables can express better than sexps.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sexps require one to align stuff up in columns to see 2D nature. Table browsers do this automatically. Something is either in a cell or not in. There is no visual ambiguity, and no alignment bumping issues such as </em><a href="TabMunging.html">TabMunging</a>. Sexps and tables are <a href="TuringEquivalencyForDataStructures.html">TuringEquivalencyForDataStructures</a>, so <strong>the issue is human convenience, not ability</strong>. -- top<em></em>

        That's true when you print out the tabular data. But that is also true for Sexpr if I define a pretty printer for it, right?
        In case of typing in the 2D structure, I see no different between the Sexpr solution and The table solution (you will both need to indent it by hand, or use editor, in source code).
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't dispute sexps <a href="TuringEquivalencyForDataStructures.html">TuringEquivalencyForDataStructures</a>. It is not so much printing, but also editing, I would note.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But editing capability of Dictionary and Nested List are both as convenient in source code.</em>
        <em>How is the nested list version below harder to edit</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        #list version<br/>
        (setf dict '(<br/>
        (employee-name "George")<br/>
        (hire-date        "10/10/1951")<br/>
        (salary           1000.0)))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>than the dictionary version?</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        #dictionary version<br/>
        dict = Hashtable new <br/>
        dict[:employee-name] = "George"<br/>
        dict[:hire-date] = "10/10/1951"<br/>
        dict[:salary] = 1000.0<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Some languages can use dot-notion if there are no special characters in key:
      </p>
      <code>
        #dictionary version<br/>
        dict = Hashtable new <br/>
        dict.employee_name = "George"<br/>
        dict.hire_date = "10/10/1951"<br/>
        dict.salary = 1000.0<br/>
        dict['stuff#with#special#characters'] = "bar"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And, yes I do prefer that over sexp's because all sexp's look the same, but array assignments stand out as being visually different, as described in <a href="LispLacksVisualCues.html">LispLacksVisualCues</a>. Ideally, however, some kind of grid-based (tabular) entry is my preference. (Ideas for incorporating spreadsheet-like features into a language or IDE are described under <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Okay, then what if it define := macro so that I can do</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        (:= dict employee-name "George")<br/>
        (:= dict hire-date           "10/10/1951")<br/>
        (:= dict salary           1000.0)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>what is the different? And you completely miss the topic. because what I was pointing to was that the code "dict[:employee-name] = "George"" or "dict.employee_name = "George"". Can not be browse by Attribute browser or Table browser, whatever you use.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That is a separate issue. I did not mean to apply they were related. As far as visual-ness, the ":=" in the middle helps visually separate the key from the value faster, at least for my eyes. One has to "read" the pre-fix version, whereas with the infix version, I immediately recognize the separator without going through the "read" step. I want to glance and have brain's pattern recognition identify patterns rather than wait for the word-at-a-time mental parser to do the work because it's slower. - top
