        Oblique Question
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a question where you listen to the form of the answer, not the answer itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is there a hyphen in 'anal-retentive'?" If they try to answer, you know they are. After all, who really cares from hyphens? OTOH...
        <em>[And see </em><a href="AnalRetentive.html">AnalRetentive</a> if you <strong>just have to know.</strong> ;-> ]<em></em>
      </p>

        Thanks to the <a href="UnknownAuthor.html">UnknownAuthor</a>, that was good for a laugh at the end of a long day :-)

        A related technique is <a href="ListeningForTheQuestions.html">ListeningForTheQuestions</a>, since the questions people ask are indicative of their concerns and priorities.

        ...As in the question I got about use cases the other day, "And is there any experience to show that this approach does not have, uh, catastrophic after-effects?"  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Is this distinct from the ObtuseQuestion?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>oblique</em> as in slanted. <em>obtuse</em> as in blunt or not sharp. methinks distinct!

        <em>Can someone provide an example, I'm having trouble coming up with one.  "Is there a hyphen in 'anal retentive'?" isn't an example, at least as given, since you </em>are<em> looking for the answer itself--"yes" or "no".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        MeAnswer: "yes" "no" or "idunno". The first two are the same answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        "idunno" can also be the same answer (if the questionee then proceeds to research the answer!).  I like "who cares".
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example that is sometimes done in interviews for C programming jobs:
      </p>
      <code>
        what does "x = a+++b" do?<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The answer you want has nothing to do with the values of variables or how the compiler parses code -- the answer you want is basically "what kind of a crazy person writes expressions like that?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Another from interviewing C++ programmers:
      </p>
      <code>
        which CASE (ComputerAidedSoftwareEngineering) tool do you prefer?<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        After all, we're looking for programmers, not UML jockeys :-)
