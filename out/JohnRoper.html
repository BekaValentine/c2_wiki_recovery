        Programmer, websurfer, cyclist.  I once had three rules for living:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Drink a beer every day,
        </li>
        <li>
           Ride a bike every day,
        </li>
        <li>
           Never watch television.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I up with 1 pretty well, 2 is catch-as-catch-can, and 3 is hopeless.

        Got started in the programming game writing a FORTRAN prime-number generator for an IBM 7094 (<a href="ReallyOldIron.html">ReallyOldIron</a> !).
