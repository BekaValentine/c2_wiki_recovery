        Text And Attribute Based Messaging
      </h1>
      <p>
        Text and attribute-based messaging is a useful technique for sharing information and services between <strong>diverse</strong> application languages. The technique was made popular in Unix/Linux but is not exclusive to Unix/Linux. Characteristics include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The text message can be viewed as a discrete unit of text. It can be thought of as a file.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The text is human-readable without special viewers or browsers other than a plane-jane text editor. (Although the meaning of the structure may be context-sensitive).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Any data-structures used are relatively easy to parse.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is mostly declarative information rather than commands.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Markup text or files, such as HTML or XML
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Comma-separated value files
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An HTTP message 
        </li>
      </ul>
