        Boy do I get <em>ticked</em> when I hear this. Consider all the assumptions implicit in the statement:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           an employee's value decreases over time
        </li>
        <li>
           every 5 years, they will have to be replaced with newer, better models
        </li>
        <li>
           the old ones can be given to charity for a tax write-off
        </li>
      </ul>

        To paraphrase <a href="PatrickMcGoohan.html">PatrickMcGoohan</a> <em>I am not an asset, I am a free man!</em>

        Hey, it could be worse. Here, they call us <em>intangibles</em>. We were so amused, we named the company band "The Intangibles"!

        How about having a department of <em>Human Capital</em>?

        It also implies that employees are property of the company. Ditto <em>resources</em>. Of course, any better term that gets used will get turned into <a href="CorporateSpeak.html">CorporateSpeak</a> and corrupted. --<a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>
