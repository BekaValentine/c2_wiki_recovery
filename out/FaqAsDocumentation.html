        Faq As Documentation

        It seems to me that a FAQ could very well be the best form of documentation for a system. -- <a href="OleAndersen.html">OleAndersen</a>

        I tried this on <a href="WyCash.html">WyCash</a>. After answering questions or solving problems I turned to an early version of wiki and made a page about the problem-solution (See <a href="WikiWikiHyperCard.html">WikiWikiHyperCard</a>). On my departure I left the company with a well written program and fifty pages of hyperlinked notes about essoteric things that didn't just jump out at you while reading the source. Later I was aked to help train some new recruits. I came in for a day to answer architectural questions. I asked if they had read the source? Yes, very helpful. And had they read the hypertext faq? Yes, not so helpful. (Not so helpful <em>yet</em>, I thought.) Then we talked about the source and the hypertext for an hour or so.  Did they learn anything more? Just one thing: yes, they really did know the system. There isn't more to know. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        p.s. I often interrupted the system and read the traceback to see what it was doing. Our architecture was so well factored that the traceback read like a document. I once wrote a document by just annotating a copied traceback. There is not much chance of doing this with java, I'm sorry to say. Oh how far we have slipped away from real object-orinted programming since this was written ten years ago.

        p.p.s. <a href="WyCash.html">WyCash</a> is still in production generating revenue after a decade. The hypertext faq was lost with the company's eventual elimination of Macintosh computers.

        There are FAQs, and then there are documentation efforts using a QA format with the word FAQ in their name. Real FAQs are answers to questions that a real forum actually frequently answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be reviled are bogus FAQs containing questions the author guesses, or wishes, would be frequent. Have you ever tried to install something, got stuck on a first stupid question that should be frequently asked, surfed to the vendor's Web site, and read a FAQ where the first question was "Why is this product clearly superior to the competition's?"?

        <em>In my day, we used to call those things press summaries, which were part of press kits. Now, they are called FAQs, part of brochureware websites. Bah.</em>

        The book <em>C++ FAQs</em>, though its answers are excellent, falls into the hypothetical-question category.  --PCP

        <em>If I recall correctly, that is an unfair characterisation of </em>C++ FAQ's<em>.  It has been a long time since I looked at it, but isn't that the book that was built from the comp.lang.c++.*  FAQ's?</em>

        I answered that newsgroup's questions for 2 years or so. But other than that I might not know what I'm talking about ;-)
