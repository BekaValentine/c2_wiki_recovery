        Else If Is Select Case
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>"ElseIf" is a "select-case" -- for use when, due to limitations of the programming language, you can't do select-case. -- </em><a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some languages, like C, C++ and Pascal impose a rather restrictive limitation on select-case statements, that each "case" value must be a scalar constant.
        In C/C++, this means that the "case" values can't even be strings.
      </p>
      <p>
        A commonly used idiom to get around this is to use an "else-if" syntax: Write the next "if" right after the "else" of the previous "if", and don't consider the "ifs" nested.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Example:</em></strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        if (stricmp(pzStatement, "select") == 0) {<br/>
        // Handle SELECT statement.<br/>
        } else if (stricmp(pzStatement, "insert") == 0) {<br/>
        // Handle INSERT statement.<br/>
        } else if (stricmp(pzStatement, "update") == 0) {<br/>
        // Handle UPDATE statement.<br/>
        } else if (stricmp(pzStatement, "delete") == 0) {<br/>
        // Handle DELETE statement.<br/>
        } else {<br/>
        // Some other command.<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Many coding standards "recognize" this construct and recommend formatting it as above instead of something closer to the way the syntax tree would look:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (stricmp(pzStatement, "select") == 0) {<br/>
        // Handle SELECT statement.<br/>
        } else`<br/>
        if (stricmp(pzStatement, "insert") == 0) {<br/>
        // Handle INSERT statement.<br/>
        } else<br/>
        if (stricmp(pzStatement, "update") == 0) {<br/>
        // Handle UPDATE statement.<br/>
        else<br/>
        if (stricmp(pzStatement, "delete") == 0) {<br/>
        // Handle DELETE statement.<br/>
        } else {<br/>
        // Some other command.<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        <em>Anything wrong with using a function to convert the string to an int and then using the number in a switch statement? I tend to prefer that to huge if-then-else blocks. -- </em><a href="BruceIde.html">BruceIde</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. Where are you going to get the integer from? You'll end up with something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        int choice;<br/>
        if (stricmp(pzStatement, "select") == 0) choice = 1;<br/>
        else if (stricmp(pzStatement, "insert") == 0) choice = 2;<br/>
        else if (stricmp(pzStatement, "update") == 0) choice = 3;<br/>
        else if (stricmp(pzStatement, "delete") == 0) choice = 4;<br/>
        else ... ;<br/>
        switch (choice)<br/>
        { case 1: ... break;<br/>
        case 2: ... break;<br/>
        case 3: ... break;<br/>
        case 4: ... break;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        default: ... break;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You can get the integer using basic, ordinary math.
      </p>
      <code>
        int choice;<br/>
        choice =    (stricmp(pzStatement, "select") == 0)<br/>
        | 2*(stricmp(pzStatement, "insert") == 0)<br/>
        | 3*(stricmp(pzStatement, "update") == 0)<br/>
        | 4*(stricmp(pzStatement, "delete") == 0);<br/>
        switch(choice) {<br/>
        case 1: ... break;<br/>
        case 2: ... break;<br/>
        case 3: ... break;<br/>
        case 4: ... break;<br/>
        default: ... break;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Some alternate approaches:
      </p>
      <p>
        Use discrete methods and merge the if-then-else and the case statement, for example,
      </p>
      <code>
        if (stricmp(pzStatement, "select") == 0) Select();<br/>
        else if (stricmp(pzStatement, "insert") == 0) Insert();<br/>
        else if (stricmp(pzStatement, "update") == 0) Update();<br/>
        else if (stricmp(pzStatement, "delete") == 0) Delete();<br/>
        else UnknownCommand(pzStatement);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Push the string comparison into the methods, for example,
      </p>
      <code>
        if(Select(pzStatement)) {}<br/>
        else if (Insert(pzStatement)) {}<br/>
        else if (Update(pzStatement)) {}<br/>
        else if (Delete(pzStatement)) {}<br/>
        else UnknownCommand(pzStatement) {}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Or, using the binary ternary, my favorite </em>GccIsm, you can do:<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        Select(pzStatement) ?:<br/>
        Insert(pzStatement) ?:<br/>
        Update(pzStatement) ?:<br/>
        Delete(pzStatement) ?:<br/>
        UnknownCommand(pzStatement);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>This is completely idiomatic and shouldn't be used in shared code without warning... but I find it quite nice, actually. I read ?: as "or else"; so the above is "select the statement or else insert it or else update it...". -- </em><a href="AdamBerger.html">AdamBerger</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> version reads even cleaner <em>(hehehe)</em>:
      </p>
      <code>
        Select($Statement) or<br/>
        Insert($Statement) or<br/>
        Update($Statement) or<br/>
        Delete($Statement) or<br/>
        UnknownCommand($Statement);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Create a set of function classes, put them in a collection, and iterate through the collection.
      </p>
      <code>
        for(aFunction = myFunctionArray.begin(); aFunction != myFunctionArray.end(); ++aFunction)<br/>
        {<br/>
        if(aFunction.Do(this, pzStatement)) break;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Java provides a hashCode() method which can be quite handy when one is switching on strings. Okay, that might constitute a <a href="CodeStench.html">CodeStench</a>, but since Java specifies the hash function precisely, one can hard code hash values into a switch without risk of being burned by runtime implementation issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually there are many more complicated cases, some of them are below. <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>s provide a construction called <strong>cond</strong> to deal with this kind of stuff. Here is an example using the <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define describe (lambda (x)<br/>
        (cond<br/>
        ((integer? x) (display "x is an integer") (newline))<br/>
        ((string? x) (display "x is a string") (newline))<br/>
        ((character? x) (display "x is a character") (newline))<br/>
        ((and (procedure? x) (= (arity x) 0)) (display "x is a thunk") (newline))<br/>
        ((and (procedure? x) (= (arity x) 1)) (display "x is a monad") (newline))<br/>
        (else (display "x is something else") (newline)))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        LISP's COND is completely general. Since it selects the first passing case, it is more like a series of if-then-else's than like a C switch. The order of test cases can effect a COND's result, unlike the order of test cases in a C switch. LISP's cond clauses are evaluated in sequence and C's switch clauses are (conceptually) evaluated in parallel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way of stating that is C's switch statement requires there to be only one matching case for a given value. Since there is only one matching case, there is no benefit to evaluating them in a particular order. Since Lisp's COND allows for more than one match, the programmer must order the cases to resolve ambiguity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="DylanLanguage.html">DylanLanguage</a> has both select, which works like a C/C++/Java select-case statement, and case, which is exactly like the Lisp COND. Of course, Dylan picked it up directly from <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, and many people consider Dylan a Lisp dialect.<em></em>

        <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> doesn't need this idiom because of the <a href="VbFlexibleSelectCase.html">VbFlexibleSelectCase</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        COBOL also doesn't need it because its select-case is a combination of everything one could imagine for select-case statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Cobol's EVALUATE statements are among the most flexible </em>SelectCase syntaxes I've ever seen, comparable to VB's definitely. Even the "Select Case True" idiom translates, which is kind of a SelectCaseIsElseIf. But in this case, repeating the pzStatement, and especially the stricmp function call, seems to violate <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, the best way is to use <a href="CollectionAndLoopVsSelectionIdiom.html">CollectionAndLoopVsSelectionIdiom</a> with thunks as the payload. It's also more efficient in terms of byte size. True me, I spent hours each day looking for these kinds of things and then optimizing them for the Palm. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

      <p>
        The COBOL select-case is by far the most flexible I've ever seen. (Scary flexible, in my opinion.) -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

      <p>
        <em>Incidentally, </em><a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> has no select-case statement, but it does have an "elif" reserved word that keeps the indentation from getting out of control.<em></em>

        The idiomatic Python approach is to use a dictionary:
      </p>
      <code>
        def this_func():<br/>
        print "this func"<br/>
        def that_func():<br/>
        print "that func"<br/>
        def main():<br/>
        func = "this"<br/>
        switch = {	"this" : this_func<br/>
        "that" : that_func }<br/>
        switch[func]()<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>See the </em><a href="SnuspLanguage.html">SnuspLanguage</a> page for a version of this in <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> as used in a SNUSP interpreter. With perl's anonymous sub feature, there is no need for the intermediate names like "thisfunc", "thatfunc", etc...<em></em>

      <p>
        Actually, pascal case statements work on sets not single constants, so you can test for multiple values in a given line
        e.g.
      </p>
      <p>
        case x of
        begin
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          .10 : DoSomething;
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        SomeSet : DoSomethingElse;<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          , 22, 24 : OrDoEvenThis;
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        SetB - SetA : DoSomethingAsWasInAButNotB;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        end;
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        One semantic difference between "if" blocks (and elif, else, etc.) and "case" blocks - at least conceptually - is that "if" statements are sequential (the conditions are tested in order), whereas case blocks are parallel (though in many languages, case statements are sequential as well).
      </p>
      <p>
        The parallel nature of case causes some interesting questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How to handle duplicate and missing cases. Duplicate cases are generally an error in most language (some languages use nondeterminism instead); missing cases are either an error, or else an "otherwise"/"default" clause is provided which runs serially if nothing is selected. (Another interesting choice might be to have case return an unsorted list containing the results of <em>all</em> matching branches; this list would have more than one element if more than one branch was taken, and be empty if none were. Side effects might still be an issue).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When are the "choices" evaluated? Many languages punt here and make the choices be known ahead-of-time; in other words, code like:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        case (x):<br/>
        of (foo()) then (do something); <br/>
        of (bar()) then (do_something_else);<br/>
        esac<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        where the "of" clauses contain function calls, is not legal. If it were, would all the "of" clauses be evaluated in advance? In what order?
      </p>
      <p>
        The sequential nature of if-statements is an artifact of non-functional programming languages.  In functional languages, <a href="AbstractStateMachine.html">AbstractStateMachine</a>s, and hardware description languages, <em>all</em> if statements are to be treated <em>as if</em> their conditions were evaluated in parallel.  Guarding some if-statements with others can always be rewritten by the compiler.  E.g.,:
      </p>
      <code>
        if cond1<br/>
        then if cond2<br/>
        then conseq1<br/>
        else altern1<br/>
        else if cond3<br/>
        then conseq2<br/>
        else altern2<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        may safely be rewritten as:
      </p>
      <code>
        if cond1 & cond2 then conseq1<br/>
        if cond1 & ~cond2 then altern1<br/>
        if ~cond1 & cond3 then conseq2<br/>
        if ~cond1 & ~cond3 then altern2<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In fact, this is the <em>normal</em> to write conditions in ASMs and HDLs.
