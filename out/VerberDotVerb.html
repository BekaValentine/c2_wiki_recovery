      <p>
        A pattern of names you'll see in objecty code:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Parser parser = new Parser(...); parser.parse();
        </li>
        <li>
           WebFetcher webFetcher = new WebFetcher(...); webFetcher.fetch("<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges</a>");
        </li>
        <li>
           ...and so on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I consider it a smell, but I'm not sure if I'm justified. It's redundancy, to be sure... but is it the bad kind? What are your alternatives?
      </p>
      <p>
        Looks to me as if the root cause of the odour here is not so much redundancy (that's merely the symptom) as sloppily chosen abstractions. How about this style:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           LanguageStatement e = new Expression(...); e.parse();
        </li>
        <li>
           Document recentChanges = new WebDocument("<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges</a>",...); recentChanges.fetch();
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is not a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>. It does not imply anything about the quality of the abstractions or structure of the code; it only reflects the arbitrary nature of available words in the vocabulary of the domain. For example, <em>Pilot.controlAirplane()</em> seems like a perfectly reasonable class/method name combination. But what if English didn't have the word 'pilot', or the programmer just didn't have that word in his/her vocabulary? Then the obvious choice would be <em>AirplaneController.controlAirplane()</em>, which is exactly the same abstraction but would be a smell. Similarly, saying that <em>General.command()</em> is fine but <em>Commander.command()</em> smells doesn't make sense. Reorganizing the code to avoid these obvious and clear choices of class/method name would be inappropriate. <em>This even applies to the page title itself. The word "Verber" here is used to refer to something that more commonly called an "agent". Is there a problem with AgentNounDotVerb constructions?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It could even be argued that, rather than being redundant, <a href="VerberDotVerb.html">VerberDotVerb</a> actually increases consistency and strengthens the relationship between class and method. After all, if you want to find the the parsing code in a program, you would look for a class named <em>Parser</em>, and not for <em>Expression</em> or <em>LanguageStatement</em>. (In fact, I think <em>Expression.parse()</em> smells: expressions don't parse things.) For classes that only have one significant method, this pattern makes a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="VerberDotVerb.html">VerberDotVerb</a> is a little ugly, especially when every class you have follows the pattern. But it doesn't signify anything fundamentally wrong that needs fixing.

      <p>
        <a href="VerberDotVerb.html">VerberDotVerb</a> constructs appear in my code when a class has one public method that does all of the real work. In that case, it makes sense to name the class Verber and the method Verb. Though I make the class name more specific when it's feasible, such as XmlParser.parse() -- <a href="JaredLevy.html">JaredLevy</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If a class has only one public method, it should just be a function. </em>ParseXml(...)<em> is better than </em>new XmlParser(...).parse().
      </p>

      <p>
        Are you objecting to Fooer.foo() or fooer.foo()? A member function foo() of a class Fooer is probably not usually the best thing but I may choose to use: Baz fooer; fooer.foo(). I would use this if fooer is passed in as a parameter to a function that only cares that fooer has a method foo. -- <a href="AndrewQueisser.html">AndrewQueisser</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More to the class one than the instance one. Though, I can't say I wouldn't sniff around if the instance one had the </em><a href="VerberDotVerb.html">VerberDotVerb</a> pattern. Why not use its class's noun name?<em></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        It may say more about your choice of implementations than anything else. In C++, you would normally use operator (), such that
      </p>
      <code>
        Verber verber<br/>
        verber.verb(args)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        becomes 
      </p>
      <code>
        Verber verb<br/>
        verb(args)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If the former smells, but the latter doesn't, this suggests to me that the <a href="VerberDotVerb.html">VerberDotVerb</a> pattern is a language smell, rather than a code smell.
