        Be Brave Little Piglet
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's hard to be brave when you're a very small animal.

        A little context for those who may have had a <a href="WinnieThePooh.html">WinnieThePooh</a>-deprived youth: Piglet is about to be swept away in a raging torrent. Owl, instead of grabbing little Piglet and flying him to safety, hovers above pontificating about bravery. I have said "Be brave little Piglet" in a humorous vein before when I wanted to make it clear I really wasn't offering any help.
