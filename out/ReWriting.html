        <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> is improving the style and structure of your text, while preserving its intended meaning. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the word processor, it meant manually copying the original text and incorporating changes. Similarly, before interactive work stations, <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> a program also included manually copying the original. Perhaps this explains the confusion between the terms writing and <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> in common programmer usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        To many programmers, <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> a program, means <a href="WritingCodeFromScratch.html">WritingCodeFromScratch</a>. This opposes the term <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> in general usage which is a cornerstone of good writing; see <a href="WritingIsRewriting.html">WritingIsRewriting</a>. Perhaps one intention is to help distinguish <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> and <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> which are otherwise similar practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much as <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> is to text, <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> is improving the style and structure of existing source, while preserving its meaning to the computer. Also like <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a>, <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> rarely involves throwing the source away and starting over. Although, see <em>Substitute Algorithm</em> in <a href="RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode.html">RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode</a> for an exception.
