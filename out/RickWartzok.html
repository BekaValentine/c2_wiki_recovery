        <dd>Ward, I've been looking at the wiki wiki web for some hours now. I am impressed with the friendly but scholarly feel of this spot. There seem to be a lot of high-level thinkers here. I find it interesting to see what you have been doing, even though I have nothing to contribute. However I keep thinking how I might apply pattern thinking to stuff I'm doing - building, manufacturing, and office layouts, <em>etc.</em> Maybe I'll add something later.</dd>
