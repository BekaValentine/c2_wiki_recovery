        I am a grad student at Oregon State University in Corvallis, OR. In May 2005, I will have my Masters Degree in Adult Education.

        Currently I am a software tester for a local company, but I want to educate adults.

        I am still working on my research paper on how Wiki can be a great tool at work and in my future trainings.  I hope to post my notes on the Internet then link it to this wonderful site. Thanks
