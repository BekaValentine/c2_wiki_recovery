        Rest In Soap
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Rest In Soap sounds better than Rest in Peace, or Rest in Pieces, or ...</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is some REST in <a href="SoapProtocol.html">SoapProtocol</a>, despite <a href="SoapRpcBreaksRest.html">SoapRpcBreaksRest</a>. Most REST implementations without SOAP are not "pure" anyway. And this page is a discussion of the two main <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> implementation paths.

        Both REST and SOAP appear to be important in the realization of <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>, and both speak Xml. See, for example, XML Europe 2004 report at <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/05/05/xmleu.html">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/05/05/xmleu.html</a> for more details. Another Amazon.com <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> regarding REST and SOAP is discussed a bit within <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2003/10/30/amazon_rest.html">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2003/10/30/amazon_rest.html</a> or <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3005.">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3005.</a>

        REST is an architectural style (see <a href="RestArchitecturalStyle.html">RestArchitecturalStyle</a>) and SOAP (<a href="SimpleObjectAccessProtocol.html">SimpleObjectAccessProtocol</a>) is an implementation. <a href="RestArchitecturalStyle.html">RestArchitecturalStyle</a> includes an intense discussion on whether SOAP can or cannot converge with REST.

        <strong><em>Without getting buried in philosophy, there is a purely pragmatic rationale favoring REST.</em></strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        SOAP needs a whole new suite of tools for development, whereas REST services can be built with existing web application development tools. SOAP involves a significant learning curve, whereas REST is a minor variation on everyday web architecture. Since SOAP entails a significant investment compared to REST, it needs to justify its existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Would you see REST being used to implement security provisions as easily as SOAP based implementations where addons like </em><a href="WebServicesSecurity.html">WebServicesSecurity</a> are being standardized? -- dl<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm no expert, but seeing that SOAP extends the function call paradigm, we'd expect it to need exceptional security.  REST rides on HTTP protocols that already have confidentiality, authentication and authorization taken care of. What's missing? --mt
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I would not use the word "missing" in the sense that REST should include these. However modern day business transactions have many additional concerns (e.g. performance). For companies who have bitten the bullet to use "international standards" (e.g. those of </em><a href="OasisOrganization.html">OasisOrganization</a>) there are probably better shared understanding of how to address the additional concerns (caveat: standards are moving targets). For companies that dont do that, they have to liaise with the individual partnering firm how to build the necessary provisions (e.g. reliability). And probably a different mechanism with a different partner. The cost of these "separate, link specific interfaces" can add up quickly. -- dl<em> </em>
