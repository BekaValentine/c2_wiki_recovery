        Ass Backwards
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ass Backwards is when something seems to be done naively backwards. The Ass in <a href="AssBackwards.html">AssBackwards</a> symbolizes the naive sector, and the Backwards symbolizes the stupidity sector.

        An example would be putting socks on your head while putting a shirt on your legs, and actually agreeing that this might work as a long term solution.

        Another example is using HTML or RTF, both rich document mark up languages, as the basis to develop a text editor, spreadsheet, email client, or online service center (banking, shopping carts).

        Another example would be building the second story of a house before the first story, and then moving on to the basement last.

        Another example would be engineering an automobile that has 5 reverse gears and one forward gear. The bumper may also be located on the roof to protect crashes from upward direction. We have a picture for you, but our camera won't upload it since the cable was sending the bits backwards.
