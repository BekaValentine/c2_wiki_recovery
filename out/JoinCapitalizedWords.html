        <a href="JoinCapitalizedWords.html">JoinCapitalizedWords</a> is the act of creating <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To create a link to a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>, <a href="JoinCapitalizedWords.html">JoinCapitalizedWords</a> to form <a href="WikiCase.html">WikiCase</a>, <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> or <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>, also called <strong></strong>SmashingWordsTogether<strong> on </strong><a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a>.

        If you don't want joined capitalized words to become a link, use <a href="SixSingleQuotes.html">SixSingleQuotes</a>. -- <a href="AluoNowu.html">AluoNowu</a>

        Since capitalization is significant to the software, you've got to count on it being less significant to the reader. For example, instead of "CRCCard" try "<a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>". It doesn't have the capitalization you want for CRC, but it's pretty close.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two cases <a href="JoinCapitalizedWords.html">JoinCapitalizedWords</a> doesn't handle well:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Initials.</strong> I'm usually "Paul S. R. Chisholm," but don't know how to make that into a reasonable Wiki link. For names in software, some of us sometimes turn acronyms and abbreviations into words, such as <a href="TcpIp.html">TcpIp</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Single words.</strong> On Wiki, "Cope" becomes <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>. This is known as the <a href="WikiSingleWordProblem.html">WikiSingleWordProblem</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer "<a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>" as a program variable name. With "CRCCard" its hard to tell where the acronym part ends. For Wiki, I think some more explicit link pattern would be worth having. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I used a pretty simple rule for an intranet wiki: initial capital and at least one other capital. It wouldn't hit on 'Cope' or 'I', but it would on '<a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>', 'CRCcard', 'CRCCard' or even 'CRC'. Of course, whatever rule is used embodies the tradeoff between the effort to concoct valid <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> and the number of bad accidental names. -- <a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CvWiki.html">CvWiki</a> did the same; this works well except that often you really don't want to define commonly used acronyms. This doesn't do a lot of harm, but it shifts emphasis unnecessarily and actually doing the definitions is a little annoying. So is leaving the trailing ?. Maybe the rule should be "At least two capitals and at least one lower case"? -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        By "actually doing the definitions" you mean creating a page behind the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> to get rid of the trailing ?, right? -- Kiel

      <p>
        In my <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a>, I treat numbers as lowercase letters.  Makes spelling out numbers unnecessary (e.g. <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a>).  Also, why not render with spaces between the words? -- <a href="LouFranco.html">LouFranco</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely some kind of Escape character would be suitable, and not too much trouble? e.g. Precede the link with something in the <a href="EditPage.html">EditPage</a> window (I nominate the string '->'), and the Wiki converts it to a link when you hit <em>Save</em>? -- <a href="PaulBennett.html">PaulBennett</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        How about using a leading question mark "?" before the link word or link string? For example: ?Wiki or ?"Wiki Name Plural Problem" or ?<a href="JoinCapitalizedWords.html">JoinCapitalizedWords</a>. This way, the link fragment looks like the last part of the Wiki URL. -- <a href="AndrewMartin.html">AndrewMartin</a>
