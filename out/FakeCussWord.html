        Fake Cuss Word

        <em>Frag, Smeg, Felgercarb, Blatherskite, Dadgum, Fnord, Smurf</em>. I also knew a Mormon who used clever phonetic disguises to turn sinful expletives into squeaky-clean fun for the whole family. i.e. "Crystal Reports is such a piece of shiz. The way it interfaces with VB really kicks my trash." And sometimes I wonder if widely-accepted jargon words like <em>cruft</em> and <em>mung</em> apply. (<em>and foobar</em>)

        FUBAR is an abbreviation for "F'd up beyond all recognition"  so it's actually a disguised cuss word.  And the son of SNAFU -- Situation Normal All Fouled Up, 
        from GI's in Europe in World War II...

        Harmless as they may appear, in conversation, they display the same uncomfortable emotions and probably aren't appropriate in job interviews, or formal design documentation. In code, however, they might make good dummy variable names. Especially in Perl. -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        Absolutely. The point of them isn't to avoid offending. The point is to express anger and frustration, exactly as one would with a real curse, but distract oneself from doing so by expressing creativity at the same time. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>

           The current (2001) fashion for writing pr0n instead of porn has been suggested as being intended to defeat text scans, but the most common attribution is that the term (like "newsfroup", "cow orker" and "grilfriend" before it) is the perpetuation of a faux-l33t misspelling.

           Science fiction and SF-based comics seem to be a prime breeding ground for <a href="FakeCussWord.html">FakeCussWord</a>s. <em>2000AD</em> magazine is a case in point, probably because it prints material that is very distinctly British - harsh, grim adult sci-fi laced with a particular black humour that still has to be acceptable for somewhere besides the top shelf. Of its many regular features, Judge Dredd has "Grud" and "drokk"; Sinister Dexter has "funt", which is one of my favorites, and there was a one-off strip whose name escapes me mocking the video game "Urban Strike" that introduced "motherfunsters" to the world. "Lobo", another British SF comic, part of the DC stables, gave us "bastich".
        </li>
        <li>
           Another great example from 2000AD was the use of the word "snut" in RoboHunter. It apparently became a source of complaints, as it sounded ruder than the words it stood in for.

           Bowdlerized re-voiced movies on TV. Britain's channel ITV is notorious for its editing of movies; many people of my generation will recall such immortal gems as "I say we grease this <strong>rat fat</strong> son of a bitch right now" (from <em>Aliens</em>) and "Yippie-kay-yay <strong>kemo sabe</strong>" (from <em>Die Hard</em>) from the movies they would show on a semi-regular basis.

               I used to be a part-time comic dealer in high school (yeah, I was dealin' in high school!) and shortly after Wizard magazine came out there was an article in there from some comic author (can't remember the name) who discussed some of the odder aspects of comic book storytelling. He relayed the complaint he received from a mother regarding an issue he had written in the 1970s where the villain tells the hero "I'll defeat you as easily as I'd flick a fly from my shoulder!" (great dialogue they had back then, too) Anyway, this mother wrote in and complained, asking how he could use such foul language in a comic book meant for her young boy, and she had filed complaints with the publisher and would never buy the comic again. Completely and utterly confused, he scoured the issue in question and finally found the culprit: "...AS EASILY AS I'D FLICK A FLY..." Because, as said above, the FLI looks like FU when written out and read quickly. Needless to say he commanded aspiring authors to never, ever name a character "CLINT FLICKER", for obvious reasons! :)

           Disney's <em>Recess</em> cartoon has an episode about this very concept: A character invents his own fake cuss word, "whomp", to avoid getting into trouble when he injures himself. One day, when using it, he runs into a faculty member who figures that the word must be naughty. The kid is punished and brought before the school board. Take it from me, the episode does not whomp.

           A classic episode of <em>The X-Files</em> (the one with the Air Force pilots flying around a fake flying saucer, who end up getting captured by real aliens, and Alex Trebeck portraying a Man in Black) featured a local redneck sheriff who swore like a longshoreman who'd just gotten kicked in the crotch. He strung together curse words like poetry, except--as <em>The X-Files</em> was a family show - every not-fit-for-TV word was replaced with the word "blank", as in "I'm gonna blank your blankin' blank, you God damn motherblankin' blank!"

        On talk radio, an idiom seems to be emerging to substitute the F-word and the S-word by actually saying "eff" or "ess". For example, "that really is a piece of bull-ess" or "un-effing-believable." I've heard this on Loveline (Adam Carola and Doctor Drew) and I think Howard Stern.

        And we cannot forget the Orbits gum commercial where the characters rattle off long streams of fake cuss words:
        You son of a biscuit eating bulldog!
        What the french toast?
        Did you think I wouldn't find out about your little doodoo-head cootie-queen.
        Who are you calling a cootie-queen, you lint-licker!?
        Pickle you kumquat! and so on...

        In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Olivia's butler Malvolio receives a letter written by Maria but in Olivia's handwriting; analyzing the script, Malvolio says, "By my life this is my lady's hand. These be her very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her great P's." With the 'and' sounding like N (n'), just a gag the writer employed to get around actually spelling out cunt, and  referencing its common use.

        In high school I remember using 'speds' rather than 'retards' or 'tards' as a derogatory term for the special education students.

        When I lived in the Los Angeles area, some morning DJs (Kevin & Bean from KROQ, I believe) came up with the insulting noun "Jackhole" -- clearly a combination of ass hole and jack ass -- to describe a jerk.  Sounds dirtier than those from which it was derived.

        In an episode of Jim Henson's Dinosaurs, a TV station airs the word 'smoo,' and the later adds 'flark' and 'kiss my glick.'  The episode parodies the FCC.

        Some examples from The Wheel of Time novels include "light", "burn me", "blood and ashes", "flaming", "blasted", "peace", "son of a spavined goat", "mother's milk in a cup", and "sheep swallop and bloody buttered onions!".
