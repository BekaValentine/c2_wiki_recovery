        <a href="EricGill.html">EricGill</a> was the designer of <a href="GillSans.html">GillSans</a> and many other <a href="TypeFace.html">TypeFace</a>s. This book contains his thoughts about the relationship of craft and mass production. He champions the humanity-sustaining aspects of craft. That's what makes the book interesting to me. He also has some loony ideas about the future of type, which are fun reading.

        <em>Contrary to popular belief, the face used by London Transport is not by Gill, but by his teacher, </em><a href="EdwardJohnston.html">EdwardJohnston</a>. Johnston's face was part of the inspiration for Gill Sans, however.<em> </em>

        <em>The face used on British road signs is a fairly standard "european modern" face anglicised by the substitution of a Gill style 'a'.</em>
