        Maybe this is a pattern, maybe even a new one. I'll just write out my experiences and see if others have solved the same problem in similar ways ...
      </p>
      <p>
        When you're programming a website, often it makes sense if a non-programmer can change text without asking you to do it. The common solution for this is to use a language that allows you to imbed small pieces of code into markup: <a href="AllaireColdFusion.html">AllaireColdFusion</a>, <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> .rhtml parsing,
        <a href="JavaServerPages.html">JavaServerPages</a>, <a href="JakartaStruts.html">JakartaStruts</a>
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first started using this stuff, I thought it would be enough to have the markup lie on top, and then strive for a clean separation between the markup and the code it calls. The relationship between the two, however, is strictly subservient: Code serves text.
      </p>

        I'm realizing it's more complex than that. There are a number of cases where the client needs direct access to text that's deeply embedded inside of your logic. Examples I've encountered include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The text of the "Thank you for your order" letter that gets emailed to the customer of an ecommerce site when the credit card transaction clears.
        </li>
        <li>
           Random teaser ads that get displayed to a Web site user.
        </li>
        <li>
           Very specific HTML design requirements for code-generated forms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The solution I'm starting to use is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Isolate the text in an external text file, perhaps in the /inc/ directory.
        </li>
        <li>
           Have the code load in that text at runtime.
        </li>
        <li>
           Tell the client where the external text file is.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        That is, <a href="TextInsideOfCodeInsideOfText.html">TextInsideOfCodeInsideOfText</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have other people done this? What have your experiences been like?

        This sounds a lot like the i18n problem - you know the intent of the messages, but not the content, so you provide the hooks to allow user alteration of content at code-specified points of intent.
      </p>

        In some cases the "inside text" can be a parameter to an embedded function call.
      </p>

        <em>But one of the requirements I'm trying to satisfy is giving a non-programmer the ability to change the text parts -- inside or outside -- without knowing how to program and without asking a programmer to do it for em. Making them parameters often isn't sufficient.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        In many programming environments, this is solved using "resources" -- (lines of) files, each of which contains a text string or image. For example, Windows resource files.
