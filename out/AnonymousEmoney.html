        <a href="AnonymousEmoney.html">AnonymousEmoney</a> is potentially possible but seems elusive.

        The basic elements needed for <a href="AnonymousEmoney.html">AnonymousEmoney</a> is for someone to anonimize the money by accepting real money and issuing a trustable certificate redeemable for that value.  Obviously the more untraceable as to the hands it has passed through the more anonymous the transactions using the certificate.  The trade off is that to avoid double spending and be sure the certificate is still unspent you need to reveal that you are the new holder with securely signed proof of transfer.  Using PGP or equivalent then this is certainly possible without revealing any identities, so long as a secure (and anonymous) communication forum exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        To exchange <a href="PromiseNote.html">PromiseNote</a>s as payment you must maintain a secure signing method and get the certificate re-issued from the source if receiving from an un-trusted (read total stranger who might be trying to rip you off) source.

        EZCMoney seems to what you are looking for. Their website seems rather content-light, but here are some specific details:

        Just found a big list of internet payment methods <a href="http://ganges.cs.tcd.ie/mepeirce/Project/oninternet.html">http://ganges.cs.tcd.ie/mepeirce/Project/oninternet.html</a>

           <a href="http://www.technocash.com.au">http://www.technocash.com.au</a> works in Australia  (can use to buy e-gold)
        </li>

           <a href="http://www.technocash.com">http://www.technocash.com</a> to open soon in USA

        TechnoCash is a bunch of numbers that holds a value and can be purchased (in Aus at least) at any post office using cash no ID required, a limit of $1000 per number and a $2 fee to purchase. Once purchased splits, joins and re-issues can be made, as well as spends to merchant sites.

        After e-gold was seized by the US government, security of assets held at a central location became very suspect.  The development of an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> system to decentralize storage while maintaining global transaction reach was undertaken.  Testing started from mid 2009 of a PublicKeyTransactionProcessor at <a href="http://pktp.co.cc">http://pktp.co.cc</a> 
        This is not quite a DigitalBearerCertificate or <a href="AnonymousEmoney.html">AnonymousEmoney</a> (although it can be used similarly as anonymous bearer of a key), not quite a <a href="PromiseNote.html">PromiseNote</a> (although signed instructions and receipts are used) but it is <a href="GoldBackedElectronicMoney.html">GoldBackedElectronicMoney</a> (as well as other metals)
