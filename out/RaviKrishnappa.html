        WIKI is an excellent knowledge management tool. I have been researching knowledge management from two perspectives. Learning technical subjects is one area. The second area is about documenting everything during the software development life cycle.

        I am a mechanical engineer from NationalInstituteOfEngineeringMysoreIndia. During the five years of learning, we learn more than 60 subjects. In the semester scheme we hardly get 3 months of class room, the remaining time is spent on exam preparation and exams. With 3-4 assesment tests, labs, Workshops and homeworks, the learning becomes demanding. One does need a quick reference guide as well as summaries, tips and shortcuts. WIKI could be effectively used in such scenarios.

        OrganizationMemory is a frequently used word to explain the repository of process knowledge gained/practiced by team members in any organization. The practioners work with in the scope of Written rules but still show higher throughput in their work. The techniques they adapt while dealing with internal and external customers become the guiding light for others. When such people are partnered with during SDLC, the end product becomes less bug-prone and more practical. I want to develop methods and techniques to document such knowledge. Such documents can replace the BusinessRequirementDocument in many cases.

        OrganizationMemory could also mean the collective knowledge that needs to be in place for operations and maintenance of Information systems. Effectiveness of new team members depends on how quickly they can learn the existing application. It would have taken years of effort to develop the applications. New members may miss the intricate design details if they just study the BRD and the data model. When a bug appears, context sensitive search is very much needed to trace all the design discussions that were held.
