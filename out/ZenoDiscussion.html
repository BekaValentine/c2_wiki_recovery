        Abstract:
      </p>
      <p>
        The ZENO process, as described in the paper, is "an open-source platform supporting e-discourses."
        ZENO provides a high degree of structure to content and participation in on-line discussions.
        If one were to view wiki on a continuum with ZENO, wiki would 'probably' be on the unstructured, free form end, while ZENO would appear on the formal, structured end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both 'systems' provide value in promoting human interaction, while the difficulty is in when and where implementation of either or both is appropriate, and who decides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please refer to the following link for accurate information on ZENO.  Corrections to the Abstract are probably necessary and encouraged. --<a href="RobChamberlin.html">RobChamberlin</a>

        The Zeno producers ("Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft") claimed it to be "open-source" - but now the old Zeno page <a href="http://zeno.berlios.de/">http://zeno.berlios.de/</a> leads to its fully commercial successor project "dito" which is based on Zeno. You can download a 30-day trial version, but the license conditions are only available on request - typical practice in european science.

        The new Zeno project page <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/projects/zeno/">https://developer.berlios.de/projects/zeno/</a> is still called "open-source", but there I found today only the .jar executable from 2002-01-21 without any documentation. They use the sourceforge software, provide an empty wiki, a missing screenshot, but at least some email adresses from the developers (which I didn't try out). The "Project Home Page" link leads - as you guess - to dito.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zeno as "open-source" project is dead.
