        Compound Object Programming

      <p>
        If a <a href="CompoundPattern.html">CompoundPattern</a> is a <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a> made up of multiple <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> then <a href="CompoundObjects.html">CompoundObjects</a> would be concrete realizations of the abstract idea of a <a href="CompoundPattern.html">CompoundPattern</a>, and <a href="CompoundObjectProgramming.html">CompoundObjectProgramming</a> would be the act of creating, extending, and leveraging <a href="CompoundObjects.html">CompoundObjects</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CompoundObjectProgramming.html">CompoundObjectProgramming</a> has many similarities to regular object-oriented programming.  There can be encapsulation, the grouping of otherwise distinct language constructs into a singular entity, i.e. the class library.  There can be inheritance, the layering of specialized capability on top of generic mechanisms, i.e. the library that links against another library.  And there can be selective derivation, where choices are made as to exactly which patterns and classes of the base mechanism are to be overridden, which are to be reused untouched, and which are to be wrapped or altered with other mechanism.
