        I am only going to present information about Visionaries and Pragmatists here. For more information, get <a href="CrossingTheChasm.html">CrossingTheChasm</a>, it's only $16.00 and it will give you a completely new perspective on development, in spite of what <a href="GeoffreyMoore.html">GeoffreyMoore</a> says on page 207. 8^)

        You can probably see the chasm beginning to form; risk-taking vs risk-averse, quantum leap vs incremental improvement, etc. The real chasm though lies in the way these two groups make their buying decisions. Visionaries reference Innovators and other Visionaries. Pragmatists only reference other Pragmatists in their market segment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visionaries and Pragmatists don't have a lot of respect for each other. Visionaries get too much attention, too much credit, too much of the budget, and when their project is over, they disappear only to leave some poor Pragmatist to clean up the mess. Pragmatists are too cautious, don't get the new technology, and in general worry about trivial stuff like legacy systems way too much.

        In <a href="InsideTheTornado.html">InsideTheTornado</a>, Moore gives an easy test for visionary vs. pragmatist:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>The visionary says, "I see!" with his eyes closed.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>The pragmatist says, "I see." with his eyes open.</dd>
