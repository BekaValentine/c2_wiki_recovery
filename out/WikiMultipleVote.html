        Wiki Multiple Vote
      </h1>
      <p>
        One vote per person for each candidate allowed. Permissible votes include "y", "n" and "o" (for "other", normally meaning never heard of it/them).

        <strong>Example in progress</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Which <a href="WorldGeniuses.html">WorldGeniuses</a> would you choose to go on holiday with?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [yynonnnyyooynnyyo] y:7 n:6 o:4 TheFirstKnotMaker
        </li>
        <li>
           [nyyynyyyoynyo] y:8 n:3 o:2 <a href="JethroTull.html">JethroTull</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           [yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy] y:17 n:0 o:0 Dionysus, inventor of wine
        </li>
        <li>
           [nnnnnynooynnnnnynn] y:3 n:13 o:2 <a href="JohnStuartMill.html">JohnStuartMill</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'll bet Dionysus was grumpy and annoyed that it took so long to get wine accepted as a legitimate beverage compared to backyard still beverages. Not a fun guy to be with, in that case. Don't confuse the inventor with the invention.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You obviously never read </em><a href="EddieCampbell.html">EddieCampbell</a>'s "BacChus". Dionysus may be older and grumpier, but he's still more fun than anyone else on the list.<em></em>

      <p>
        These questions seem odd. Multiple choice with four tristate answers?!

        <strong>Adding questions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What's the ettiquette on appending a question after votes have been placed?  I imagine that within reason, some folk will return and fill in their missing vote.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Maybe it would be useful to put [??????y] for your </em>yes<em> vote on the new question, to  indicate the missing ones?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is usually appropriate to add questions only when simultaneously self-searching. In such cases, the insertion of the missing question marks is considered not only good manners but the only way to uphold the high integrity of the <a href="WikiBallotBox.html">WikiBallotBox</a>.
