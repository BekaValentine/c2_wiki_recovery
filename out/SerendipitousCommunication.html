        Serendipitous Communication
      </h1>
      <p>
        Increased productivity due to one person overhearing another person's conversation and commenting on it.  This happens a lot with <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> because people are <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> (thus talking a lot) and are all located in a single room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each case of <a href="SerendipitousCommunication.html">SerendipitousCommunication</a> saves many minutes of work (anywhere from ten minutes to several hours), and can easily happen a dozen times in a day.  It adds up quickly.
