        Imagine if you will the replacement for costly and scenery-hiding Advertising Billboards: By DigitalElectronicAdvertisers (<a href="HyperTags.html">HyperTags</a>) transmitted so they can be displayed on your <a href="HandHeld.html">HandHeld</a> or VehicleMounted InformationDevice instead. They would be called <a href="InfoPosts.html">InfoPosts</a>( in the form of slender transmitting poles or on towers, water tanks, tall lighting standards, at heights of from 20 to 100 feet, designed to broadcast a series of DigitalInformationTransmissionPackets of limited range (say 1 to 7 miles) which could be received, interpreted and displayed on Devices (hand and vehicle types). Instead of relying on outdated information in a GPS Map information Database, the local information could be contained in a transmission tied to the GeoCoordinates in proximity of the <a href="InfoPosts.html">InfoPosts</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data could be made via two media: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           once via radio frequencies
        </li>
        <li>
           secondarily via LocalePages on the Internet being mapped to a 
          <ul>
            <li>
               NameOrTypeAndGeoCoordinate

        Example: (Making working example this morning 20091112): 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="InfoPosts.html">InfoPosts</a> at Union Station, Kansas City, Missouri 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>This page allows enlargement, expansion and relocation of map center along with the other things the Google portion of the page provides.</em> 
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <a href="http://donaldr.noyes.com/HyperPlaces/InfoPosts/UnionStationKcMo.htm">http://donaldr.noyes.com/HyperPlaces/InfoPosts/UnionStationKcMo.htm</a> 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The dual nature of this would allow out-of-range access to the information of <a href="InfoPosts.html">InfoPosts</a> beyond its broadcast range, before being encountered in a travel path.
      </p>
      <p>
        They would have advantages of being inexpensive, networked, replaceable, remotely updated and thus easily maintained, while remaining unobtrusive, not detracting from existing and natural surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        They could also have another means of access, via a messaging cellular telephone module and/or limited range Rf transmission. The posts could also have second and third functions such as relaying camera information from one camera, or a named group of cameras, and to provide WeatherInformation. (temp, barometric, wind dir and speed, relative humidity and solar intensity (brightness). The posts could be designed to serve simple advertising functions only or include enhanced functions, depending on provider or location.

           The physical part of the above scenario, (the placement of transmitters on water tanks, etc. has become possible by technology as a component (SixMileWiFi), or via rapidly developing 4G technology, and the increasingly national and complete geographical coverage planned for the same. The <a href="InfoPosts.html">InfoPosts</a> can be included as a Virtual Post on a Map, accessed via <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> or 4G technology. 
        </li>
        <li>
           This is already possible in many areas, as demonstrated to me in a test conducted in a journey from near Columbus, Ohio to Lees Summit, Missouri that I took with my brother, <a href="StephenNoyes.html">StephenNoyes</a> in March TwoYearsAgo 2011. 
        </li>

           We employed two Internet Sites, Skype and Glympse, He used an air-card and a laptop computer and I used <a href="MultipleMonitors.html">MultipleMonitors</a>, one for the windshield view from Skype and the other for the overhead view from Glympse.
        </li>
        <li>
           We found except for 4 or 5 short periods, we were able to stay in touch, I became a VirtualPassenger in his car, looking through the windshield at the passing scenery, while also being able to trace our traverse on Glympse, where I could zoom in and out in the satellite mode as if I were above us, viewing the small triangle representing his vehicle location, and seeing it from whatever altitude (map scaling) desired.
