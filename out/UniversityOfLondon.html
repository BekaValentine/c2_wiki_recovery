        University Of London
      </h1>
      <p>
        The University of London is a federation of about a dozen universities in London, UK. It has been formed as a centralised institution 
        providing oversight over quality assurance in teaching and research among its memeber colleges. It has also become the focal point
        of providing common services to students of its universities (e.g. gym, student societies, host of the UniversityOfLondonUnion?, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not a university in itself and has a very impressive building (the Ministry of Peace in the movie version of 1984 by Orwell) in the centre of London.
