      <p>
        <em>From </em><a href="CommunityLifeCycle.html">CommunityLifeCycle</a> where the (mis)use of the word "pattern" caused some potential confusion. Or maybe this is about what constitutes appropriate content for Wiki. Suddenly I'm not sure -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [This] is not a "pattern", at least in the sense of <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>'s work, the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> book, and the <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a>. The life-cycle above is an interesting and possibly useful description of several communities. It is not "a solution to a problem in a context". It does not seem to fit any other definition of "pattern" commonly used in this community. Not all good ideas are patterns. -- <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        At least one person objects to my objection above. Perhaps the old definitions of "pattern" are too confining. Perhaps the C2 wiki should become a "good idea" rather than just a "pattern" repository. In any case, I think it is proper to point out that "pattern" has a specific meaning to many people here. -- <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a> (who encourages more discussion on this topic, and would love to learn something)

        I'd call <a href="CommunityLifeCycle.html">CommunityLifeCycle</a> a descriptive pattern as opposed to a prescriptive pattern, in that it abstracts a description of ways in which problems have been solved or not solved in a variety of contexts. In some ways, now that I think of it it's very similar to the ProjectLifeCycle described in most <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> textbooks. -- <a href="LarryPrice.html">LarryPrice</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was something I noticed after the fact, but it's not so strange given that any project involving more than a few people starts to form a community.

        And lets not forget about patterns capturing the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>. Lest we forget, Qwan is an aspect of living communities.

        Patterns are generally confused with <a href="PatternForm.html">PatternForm</a>. Many non-patterns can and have been written in <a href="PatternForm.html">PatternForm</a>. It would seem patterns are something more than the structure imposed on them. Then, a <em>pattern</em> could be considered to be a story with <a href="ThreeExamples.html">ThreeExamples</a>. This is a useful distinction to make because stories are usually interesting in their own right. I suspect this could lead to an internally consistent set of stories. This set might be referred to a StoryLanguage, a much weaker cousin of a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>. Patterns are a subset of stories. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I think that a pattern has to describe a problem and a solution as well, at very least, to be a Pattern. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>

        I wonder if maybe the alexandrine form and it's derivatives are a bit too constrained of a definition of patterns, clearly <a href="CommunityLifeCycle.html">CommunityLifeCycle</a> is not a pattern in the classical sense, yet it does expose PatternsAndAntiPatterns in a way that seems productive. Perhaps we need investigate not just the <a href="MetaPatterns.html">MetaPatterns</a> of <a href="DefinitionOfPattern.html">DefinitionOfPattern</a> and <a href="ValueOfPatterns.html">ValueOfPatterns</a> but dig down into the roots of what makes a pattern, at least in the software world. -- <a href="LarryPrice.html">LarryPrice</a>

      <p>
        Aside from any <a href="DefinitionOfPattern.html">DefinitionOfPattern</a>, could we ask what is the <a href="ValueOfPatterns.html">ValueOfPatterns</a>? How do they contribute and what do they contribute?
