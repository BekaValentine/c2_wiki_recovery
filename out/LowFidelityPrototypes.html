        <a href="LowFidelityPrototypes.html">LowFidelityPrototypes</a> are paper mock-ups of GUI screens.  We draw them on standard 8 1/2 X 11 pages and use post-it notes to represent dialog boxes and pull-down menus.  This often gives users a very good feel for what screens will look like and how they will interact with each other, without giving them the false impression of "completeness" that a screen-based prototype gives.

        A great way to walk through use cases.
        Arrange the paper mockups on a wall (or on a
        white board), then "walk through" them to simulate a user experience. -- <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>

        <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>s provide a low-fidelity prototype of objects. An Apple <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> User-Interface Guidelines document had suggested prototyping stacks with index cards. I already had a <a href="WikiWikiHyperCard.html">WikiWikiHyperCard</a> stack for recording designs (see <a href="BezelMenu.html">BezelMenu</a>). From this it was only a small step to paper. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
