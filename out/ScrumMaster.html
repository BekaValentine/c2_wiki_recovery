        Scrum Master

      <p>
        In the <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a>, this is the person responsible for keeping the team following the process.  This is somewhat similar to a <a href="ProjectManager.html">ProjectManager</a> role. However, because Scrum asks the team to organize itself, this person may or may not be the perceived "leader" in a given Sprint.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ScrumMaster.html">ScrumMaster</a> is the team member responsible to interface with the world outside the <a href="ScrumSprint.html">ScrumSprint</a>, and to remove/resolve blockages that impede the team's work within the <a href="ScrumSprint.html">ScrumSprint</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, term used for a graduate of the <a href="ScrumMasterCertification.html">ScrumMasterCertification</a> program.
