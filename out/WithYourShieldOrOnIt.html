        With Your Shield Or On It
      </h1>
      <p>
        Spartan women would tell their husbands and sons to return - before they were to head off to war - "With your shield, or on it."
      </p>
      <p>
        Honor in battle was cherished. Spartan warriors carried large shields into battle. If a man came home without his shield, it was obvious he had dropped it to run from the battle. If a man fell in battle, his friends carried him home on his shield.
      </p>
      <p>
        The saying told the men that they were to return victorious (with their shield), or injured or dead (on it).

        <em>I think that not returning injured is somehow implied in the saying. Regarding software, that makes much sense. I wouldn't want a function returning 'injured'; not completely successful, but not completely unsuccessful either.</em>
