        All right, I'll start it off here:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Secure enough in his/her talents to be able to give reasonable estimates of the time it will take to finish a task.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Secure enough in experience to be able to say when he/she is too busy to take on any more tasks without sacrificing quality.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Skilled in being able to quickly resolve what he/she does *NOT* know in order to solve the problem at hand. (Ex. knows where the RFCs are found in order to know what "421 connection dropped by remote host" means.)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Knowledgeable of the fact that management and customers rely on his/her particular expertise and decent enough to not rape them for those answers.
        </li>
      </ol>

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Knows that <strong>ANY</strong> solution he/she implements alone is <strong>not</strong> the perfect solution and can be improved through communication with others.
        </li>

      <ol>
        <li>

      <ol>
        <li>
           When encountering an unknown programming domain, googles to find relevant sample code, assimilates the information and incorporatees and adapts it to the task at hand.
