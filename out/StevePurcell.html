      <p>
        I am <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a> at heart, obsessed with instilling sanity into the software development process.  To that end, I work as a senior technologist and agile practices coach, now independently (<a href="http://www.sanityinc.com/),">http://www.sanityinc.com/),</a> and previously at companies such as <a href="ThoughtWorks.html">ThoughtWorks</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've helped clients in most corners of the industry, have dealt with more technologies, languages and politics than is typical, and have done so in Luxembourg, Munich, Sydney, London and elsewhere.  I am currently available for consulting and coaching work in Munich and elsewhere in Europe.
      </p>

        Learning new and productive languages keeps me interested in programming, and I wrote the <a href="PythonUnit.html">PythonUnit</a> testing framework (<a href="http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/)">http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/)</a> that is now found in the python standard library.  A long time advocate of open source projects, I tinker with various projects in languages including C, Ruby, Erlang and Common Lisp.
