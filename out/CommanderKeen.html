        Commander Keen
      </h1>
      <p>
        A landmark computer game released on December 14 1990 which forever changed PC computing. <a href="CommanderKeen.html">CommanderKeen</a> was <a href="IdSoftware.html">IdSoftware</a>'s first big game. It should be noted that <a href="IdSoftware.html">IdSoftware</a> developed and released quite a few popular titles before their next major landmark, Doom. The rest, as they say, is history.

        It's worth noting that this game engine performed just fine on a 286 with generic VGA. The subsequent WolfensteinThreeDee engine also ran well on a 286.

        The Doom engine was, however, derived in the <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> environment (Unix->Next-><a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a>), and required at least a 386.

        The animation was somewhat stilted, and the color depth was shallow by today's standards, but the GamePlay itself was outstanding.

      <p>
        This lesson is largely lost in the "bigger, faster" world of game development today. If you're writing a game, GamePlay should be JobOne. SpecialEffects should be secondary, and should only enhance, never interfere with, GamePlay.

        And that's true if you're writing an accounting package or a <a href="WordProcessor.html">WordProcessor</a>.
