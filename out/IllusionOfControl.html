        Illusion Of Control
      </h1>
      <p>
        I like CASE tools. I just have to draw the boxes and those CASE guys think of everything else. I like hierarchical management. That way I can do the work of thousands by sending a single memo. I like a PERT/<a href="GanttChart.html">GanttChart</a> - just look at all those little tasks lining up like ducks. I like a heavy methodology, something that tells my team exactly when and how to do their jobs. Yes, my life is sweet because all these things mesh like an oiled machine, swift, orderly, and responsive. Why, since I bought a few books and tools and consultants, I hardly need to work at all to remain in complete control ...
