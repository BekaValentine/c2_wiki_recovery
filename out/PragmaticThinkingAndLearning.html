        This makes a lot of use of the <a href="DreyfusModel.html">DreyfusModel</a> of <a href="HubertDreyfus.html">HubertDreyfus</a> about levels of competence. It is clear that the ideas have been around for some years. There is also a mention of <a href="ShuHaRi.html">ShuHaRi</a>.

        Although the title does not say so, this book is very relevant to thinking about expertise in programming, and in other disciplines too. This book has been a <a href="BookStart.html">BookStart</a> for me. I have been talking about it for more than a year, ever since I first found it. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
