        Context Object
      </h1>
      <p>
        A context object encapsulates the references/pointers to services and configuration information used/needed by other objects. It allows the objects living within a context to see the outside world. Objects living in a different context see a different view of the outside world.
      </p>

        If you need to use a mail service, for example, where does it come from?
        You can imagine using a singleton, a global variable, a
        registration mechanism, a context object, creating a new service
        for every user. Any others?
      </p>
      <p>
        Each approach has their own advantages and disadvantages.

        So are there any patterns for avoiding singletons then?

        Check out the <a href="MonostatePattern.html">MonostatePattern</a> in C++; make all the data members static.  I haven't used it at work but I know a guy who swears by it -- <a href="BillWeston.html">BillWeston</a>

        If I have a bunch of these 'there should be only one of these' type objects I generally throw them on a palette or workbench that gets passed around. Instead of passing a bunch of parameters in to classes I can just pass the Palette or Workbench. This also lets folks that are maintaining the code know my intention.

        An alternative to passing a palette/workbench around (which couples the whole system to the palette) is to have a singleton Registry from which you obtain all the other singletons. Yes, the registry is a global variable but it's the only one (within that layer/subsystem) and all the things you get from the registry can just be normal easily-tested classes. Ensuring proper usage is just a matter of making sure that no-one ever calls the constructors of these classes but instead use the registry.
      </p>

        Note that this alternative to raw singletons is also known as <a href="RegistryPattern.html">RegistryPattern</a> (in Fowler's <a href="PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture.html">PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture</a>) and even mentioned in passing in the GoF book itself.
