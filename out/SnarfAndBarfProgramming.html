        <a href="SnarfAndBarfProgramming.html">SnarfAndBarfProgramming</a> is like what happens when you do some refactorings.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Copy a mess of code from another area that just about works (the Snarf)
        </li>
        <li>
           Paste in into a new area (the Barf)
        </li>
        <li>
           Make it work for the new context
        </li>
        <li>
           Find the similarities
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> like a madman
        </li>
      </ul>

        I think that "<a href="SnarfAndBarfProgramming.html">SnarfAndBarfProgramming</a>" should really does (or should) only refer to the copy and paste steps.
        You should do the refactoring part, but that doesn't strike me as something deserving the term "<a href="SnarfAndBarfProgramming.html">SnarfAndBarfProgramming</a>."
