        Discussion On Engines Of The Future
      </h1>
      <p>
        What follows on this page represents a partial skeleton, a first step in a process categorized as "Success Orientation". It is a conceptual discovery.

           This page is intended to complete  clarifications on the good points made earlier by <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>. I intend to extend this page to include Engines which reside in different settings and intends to include cooperative classification and indexing which will exist external to the normal "Search Engine". It was not clear, incomplete, and represented Present Thinking.
        </li>
        <li>
           Incompleteness and lack of clarity usually occur in progression and transition. This is inherent in presenting new, ground-breaking discoveries. One many have failed to see the tree because of the forest. It is also like the seeking for a particularly useful tree. When Thinking one is introducing what seems possible but not apparent or visible, it is still a discovery, even though the introduction is about an existent rather than a non-existent technology.
        </li>
        <li>
           I will continue modification and enlargement of this page. What I see as the <a href="SearchEngineOfTheFuture.html">SearchEngineOfTheFuture</a> may in fact be so close as to already exist. In the process of presentation I discover and integrate concepts which may exist in other spaces. (Example: <a href="TopicMaps.html">TopicMaps</a>)) This does not detract from nor denigrate thoughts originating in the Idea Space. Ideas originating in a thought process of one individual which happens to parallel or coincide with thoughts and ideas of another individual, happen all the time.
