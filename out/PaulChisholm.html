        About 1.5 years (as a Principal Software Engineer, then Manager, C++ Foundation Classes) at dynamicsoft,
        and then (still as a manager) at Cisco Systems after they bought dynamicsoft.
        Neither my ACM nor Lucent addresses work any more; my Yahoo! ID is p.s.r.chisholm (but without the periods; isn't it sad what we do to protect ourselves from spam?).

        No home page outside Wiki (at the moment).

        I attended PLoP '94 and loved it, but unfortunately have missed the conferences since then.
        I was at <a href="OopslaInSanJose.html">OopslaInSanJose</a>, moderating a panel (see <a href="SoftIssuesAndOtherHardProblems.html">SoftIssuesAndOtherHardProblems</a>) with <a href="LarryConstantine.html">LarryConstantine</a>, <a href="LukeHohmann.html">LukeHohmann</a>, <a href="NormKerth.html">NormKerth</a>, and <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>.
        And organizing a workshop with <a href="NormKerth.html">NormKerth</a>
        (along with <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> and <a href="LukeHohmann.html">LukeHohmann</a>).
        I had a pattern language on <em>tracing, logging, and alarming</em> reviewed at the TelePLoP workshop;
        (and did some significant development for the AirMedia network to back it up!);
        I need to get that thing published somewhere.
        I went a lot of years between conferences, but recently attended SD Best Practices (formerly Software Development East) 2004 in Boston;
        good stuff.

        Paul provided much of the inspiration and rationale for the <a href="MercenaryAnalyst.html">MercenaryAnalyst</a> pattern, which some of us were just discussing using on our project.

        <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> has mentor'ed Paul in object technology in general, C++ in particular, and got him interested in <em>patterns</em> over beers at OOPSLA '93 in Washington, DC.

        I was an usher at the wedding of <a href="MichaelLindner.html">MichaelLindner</a> and LoAnnLindner (nee Reiling).

      <p>
        I've maintained my <a href="GadFly.html">GadFly</a> status in the object, patterns, and agile communities by being a technical reviewer for the "Gang of Four" <em>Design Patterns</em> book; <em>Multi-Paradigm Design for C++</em> by Jim Coplien; Kent Beck's <em>Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change</em>; <em>Extreme Programming Applied: Playing to Win</em> by Ken Auer and Ron Miller; <em>Pair Programming Illuminated</em> by Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler; and Kent Beck's <em>Test Driven Development By Example</em> (listed in acknowledgements of each book).

        I'm currently using <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> (the software used for Wikipedia) at Cisco. It's amazing how quickly people go from never having heard of a wiki to not knowing how they ever lived without one.
