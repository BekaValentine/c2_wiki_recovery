        Activation Record
      </h1>
      <p>
        A data structure containing the important state information for a particular instance of a function call (or something that resembles a function call). May exist entirely in memory, or be partially stored in registers. Typically, an <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a> contains the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A pointer to the <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a> of the caller (commonly known as the DynamicChain), though in a language with <a href="ContinuationPassingStyle.html">ContinuationPassingStyle</a> even this isn't necessary (when the function returns, it does so via the supplied continuation; rather than the DynamicChain).
        </li>
        <li>
           In languages which allow nested <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>, a pointer to the <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a> of the enclosing scope (aka the ReferencingEnvironment) - this pointer is called the <a href="StaticChain.html">StaticChain</a>. In most such languages, it is generally a requirement that <em>somewhere</em> up the call chain, the enclosing function have been called (but in concurrent languages it may have been called in a different thread). In languages like C/C++ where nested <a href="LexicalScope.html">LexicalScope</a>s are disallowed (or restricted), a <a href="StaticChain.html">StaticChain</a> is unnecessary. Java <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a>es also seem to be designed in order to avoid a <a href="StaticChain.html">StaticChain</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Local variables (frequently cached in registers)
        </li>
        <li>
           Actual parameters to the function (also frequently cached in registers)
        </li>
        <li>
           Space for the (eventual) return value of the function.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <add anything I forgot>
      </p>
      <p>
        In many (most) programming languages, <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>s maintain a strict <a href="LastInFirstOut.html">LastInFirstOut</a> discipline and are thus stored on a stack (often referred to as <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a>). For this reason, <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>s are also commonly known as <em>stack frames</em>. In the context of languages (like C) where a stack is always used; this terminology is correct. As other languages don't use stacks for this purpose (many Smalltalk implementations, <a href="StacklessPython.html">StacklessPython</a>), <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a> is a more correct term when talking about languages in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scheme works well, unless you have the following features in your language (which violate LIFO discipline)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>s (a closure can outlive its referencing environment)
        </li>
        <li>
           Continuations, excluding UpwardContinuations
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CoRoutine.html">CoRoutine</a>s, BlocksInSmalltalk, and a few other control structures that are found in various languages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In languages with these, other arrangements are often used, see <a href="ContinuationImplementation.html">ContinuationImplementation</a> for examples.
