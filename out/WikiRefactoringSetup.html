        Wiki Refactoring Setup
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you see a set of Wiki pages that should be refactored, but you don't have time, and cross link them with "see also" hoping that others will see all the similar names in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and look into it if they are so inclined and think it is needed. Like a setup in volleyball or a pass in football - you don't get to "score" but make it easier for someone to finish it.
