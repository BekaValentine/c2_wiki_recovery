        I like <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, and am trying to follow it at my work place.
        I find the connection between and Aikido and Extreme Programming very fascinating. I have written about it at <a href="ExtremeProgrammingAndAikido.html">ExtremeProgrammingAndAikido</a>.

        I've read <a href="LateralThinking.html">LateralThinking</a> by Edward DeBono, and can't help noticing the Lateral element in Extreme Programming. Check <a href="LateralThinkingInExtremeProgramming.html">LateralThinkingInExtremeProgramming</a>. Recently read the book FiveDysfunctionsOfATeam - and I think it holds explanations as to why XP manages to succeed and build great teams.

        <em>Somik, Thanks for the discussion about XP and Aikido!  I have been interested in some time in learning Aikido because I had heard some about its content.  But I had not heard before of its unique self-paired teaching style.  That makes it even more interesting!</em>

        Perhaps others would want to compare other programming styles (waterfall methodology, etc.) to other martial arts?<em></em>
