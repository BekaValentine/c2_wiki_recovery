        Shell Vs Ide

        In general, if you were raised using a shell, you prefer a shell. If you were raised using an IDE, you prefer that. Seems to be a ReligiousWar even deeper than <a href="EmacsVsVi.html">EmacsVsVi</a>.

        I was "raised" (odd word to use for something that I learned without help...) using an IDE, but now find shells vastly preferable.  There are two other posts here made by people sharing my first name, and I wholeheartedly agree with both.  That, and with a command line I can replace the shell and keep the tools the same; you can't replace an IDE and keep its plugins the same. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>

        I strongly disagree.  I was raised using a shell (and a line editor), but I rarely use them today.  I can be much more productive with a good IDE.  And I don't mean Unix. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        Does this hold for those raised on punched card decks (IBM 7094 mid-70s assembly language), then punched tape (PDP8/I), then DECTAPE (PDP11e) and so forth before ever encountering a shell (Unix V6 on PDP11/70)? Never saw an IDE until Smalltalk came along (which I've never used but admired). Immediately switched to <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> around 1998 because because it was simply more productive. Do people really argue about such things. Why not just use the best tool for the job? --<a href="BradCox.html">BradCox</a>

        My take is that the IDE often gets in the way - I cannot tweak something, or cannot copy the project easily, or cannot transfer to another environment easily.  Often, IDEs impose a lot of their strictures on my project - like J++ having some oddball way of spacing GUI components that I could not easily modify without having to use the tool again.  I found I was vastly more productive with 3 xterms and vi than with Visual Cafe.  In short, for me the shell <strong>is</strong> the best tool for the job. -- Pete Hardie

        Quality (i.e. "betterness") is neither intrinsic nor subjective; it's objective.  Sometimes an IDE is better, sometimes a shell is better.  Use whichever one best helps you get done the job you're doing.  The answer to which one is better presupposes that the following questions have been answered:
      </p>
      <p>
        Better <em>for whom?</em>
        Better <em>by what standard?</em> --<a href="DanHankins.html">DanHankins</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        (It would be interesting if you could give examples of each situation. What are some common situations where an IDE is better, and some common situations where a shell is better?)

        I spent 7 years with Unix before learning Smalltalk.  Although I still use
        the shell when I am not doing Smalltalk, I don't miss it when I am.
        That's because I can hack the Smalltalk IDE any way I want.  I think the
        problem with the other IDEs is that you don't have source for them and
        can't hack them, not that they are IDEs.  Demand source! --<a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>

        It appears that most IDE's are geared towards Java and C++, whereas I do most of my programming in <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a>. I didn't yet find
        an IDE that is helpful when programming O'Caml. But there
        <em>is</em> a Vim mode for O'Caml, it comes even standard with the
        distribution. -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>

        For me this has something to do with <em></em>MentalEconomy<em>: using the command line and a good editor (my vote's for vi) feels more incremental, learning one tool at a time, than getting an ide which I won't be able to make full use of until I've learnt enough to get into the </em>culture<em> of this particular ide. If I change programming language I know I will have lots of use for the command line tools and editor I've learnt, but to be able to use what I learnt with an ide I probably have to find an implementation of the same ide for this language. ~- </em><a href="DanielLundin.html">DanielLundin</a>

        Ye verily, CLIs are so much better than GUIs. That's why everyone is using CLIs exclusively.
