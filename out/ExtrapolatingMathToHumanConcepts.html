        Extrapolating Math To Human Concepts
      </h1>
      <p>
        Humans and Mother Nature don't always act the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under topics such as <a href="ThereAreNoTypes.html">ThereAreNoTypes</a> there seems to be a recurring issue of applying math concepts to non-math concepts - <a href="RealWorldEntities.html">RealWorldEntities</a>.  For example, in "traditional" math you can safely say things like "x will always be a subset of y" and rely on that assumption forever and ever. One does not have to consider the cost of changing that assumption later. But with real-world things that is not always the case. Marketers, managers, lawyers, law-makers, <em>etc.</em> can get pretty creative (in a good and bad sense) and turn the tables on previously-established concepts. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Of itself that doesn't mean math is out of luck on such things, see <a href="NonMonotonicLogic.html">NonMonotonicLogic</a> for one example of a system designed to deal with such things. There aren't inherent limits on what can be analyzed by mathematics, because it is just a way of formalizing how we think, in a way that allows rigorous conclusions to be drawn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, there are often multiple ways to model something with math. A given approach may make an interesting mental exercise, but not necessarily be the final word.

        Changing technology is another monkey-wrench: before we had PDA's as one device and a cell-phone as another. Now a given device can be both. If there were laws governing cell-phones before, now the issue of whether cell-phone laws should cover a dual device pops up. An actual case of this type of thing is Canada courts trying to make a distinction between voice phone lines and data phone lines. The lines are so blurred now that Canada is thinking about overhauling huge chunks of its telephone laws.

        A similar thing is happening in the US; the traditional telcos are arguing that various <a href="VoiceOverIp.html">VoiceOverIp</a> services are in fact telephone companies, and should be taxed and regulated as such.  The <a href="VoiceOverIp.html">VoiceOverIp</a> companies disagree, of course.
