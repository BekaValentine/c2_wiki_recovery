        Question On Configurable Fields Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        The question is how to design a system that has configurable
        forms? Think of a bug tracking app that can add fields, change labels,
        etc. I can think of two approaches.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Use a field table that maps field instances to a form
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        which is mapped to a project.
        Several difficulties. Presentation. How do you make
        this look good? Queries. How do you make decent
        queries? Is the field a union type? Or is it only
        a string?
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Generate custome code for each project, ala
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        MDA. In this approach you would generate new
        schema definitions and the code to use them, like they
        were done by hand. This level is dynamism is hard.
        It also makes it difficult to do cross configuration
        reports. Let's say project A has a bug configuration,
        project B has one, how to do reports combining A and B?
