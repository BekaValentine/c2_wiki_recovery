        Merge Sort
      </h1>
      <p>
        Consider the first two elements (0 and 1) as being lists of length 1 (and therefore sorted) and merge them. Then do the same on elements 2 and 3. Now merge the two 2-lists you have, and repeat. Time-complexity is O(n log n). Stable. Requires extra space, about half the size of the actual dataset. On typical numeric data, uses fewer comparisons than <a href="QuickSort.html">QuickSort</a> but has enough more overhead that it ends up being slower; a good algorithm, then, when comparison is slow for some reason. There are sophisticated variants of mergesort that do better at taking advantage of patterns in the input data; see <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-July/026897.html">http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-July/026897.html</a> for a description of one. (This is probably the best algorithm if you have to sort a <a href="LinkedList.html">LinkedList</a>; try to write it in <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> to fully appreciate it)

        If your data is much larger than RAM, and you have (at least) 3 disks or tapes you can shuffle the data between, <a href="MergeSort.html">MergeSort</a> is the fastest possible sort (see <a href="TheArtOfComputerProgramming.html">TheArtOfComputerProgramming</a> for details - including a fold out with data layout on the discs; compare <a href="AlgorithmsDealingWithMassiveData.html">AlgorithmsDealingWithMassiveData</a>).

        <a href="MergeSort.html">MergeSort</a> can also be implemented non-recursively; attempting to write a non-recursive <a href="QuickSort.html">QuickSort</a>, as best I can tell, ends up producing something that looks very suspiciously like the non-recursive <a href="MergeSort.html">MergeSort</a>.

        Did you confirm that the article definitely is available via such a free account, or does it just look at first glance like it might be? I was under the impression, from experimenting a few months ago, that such things always required the $168 per year fee ($84 membership plus $84 service fee). <em>Yes, confirmed it is free. Initially, I had difficulty saving the document locally, but I succeeded eventually.</em>

        <em>I don't understand the logic behind all of the above comments talking about </em><a href="QuickSort.html">QuickSort</a> and <a href="MergeSort.html">MergeSort</a> suddenly becoming similar if non-recursive versions are done. That seems to miss the whole point.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They are similar to start with; both use <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a> to split input lists into two sub-lists, and each sub-list is (conceptually) recursed upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference between the two is how they treat the sub-lists and their relationships with the whole. <a href="MergeSort.html">MergeSort</a> (simplest form) splits a list into two-roughly-equal-sized sub-lists and merges them; recursively (in concept), this guarantees a final complete order. <a href="QuickSort.html">QuickSort</a> splits a list into two sub-lists based on comparison of sub-list values with a pivot element chosen (simplest form) randomly.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are lots of variations on the theme for both algorithms, but skipping that, I really do not see why anyone would claim that <a href="QuickSort.html">QuickSort</a> starts to look like <a href="MergeSort.html">MergeSort</a> if one implements the recursion by hand. It does not. <a href="MergeSort.html">MergeSort</a> does not use pivots, period.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a side note, <a href="QuickSort.html">QuickSort</a> is not <strong>inherently</strong> a ternary <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a>, but it's perhaps the most common approach, whereas <a href="MergeSort.html">MergeSort</a> is clearly most commonly a binary <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a> (it would be interesting to see a pointer to a ternary version; none come to mind), so that should probably be addressed as well. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
