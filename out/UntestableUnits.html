        Imagine its a few years ago, and you're asked to write a program to
        disprove Fermat's Last Theorum. Within you code, you have a function:
      </p>
      <p>
        bool fermatIsWrong(x, y, n)
        {
      </p>
      <code>
        // return true if n > 2 and nth root of (x^n + y^n) is an integer<br/>
        // else return false<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time you are writing this function, you do not know whether
        there exists a set of numbers, {x, y, n} which lead to a true
        result. (We now know that a valid implementation would be
        to simply "return false" because the theorum is true; but it
        is possible to find other examples for which the answer is
        currently unknown)
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it possible to write unit tests for such a function?

      <p>
        Here's an attempt ...
      </p>
      <p>
        If the nth root of x^n + y^n is an integer, it is surely less than some easily-computed value like, say, x^n + y^n. (Better bound left to the reader.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore if fermatIsWrong(x, y, n) answers true, this test checks and should return true also:
      </p>
      <code>
        sum := x^n + y^n;<br/>
        for ( i=1; i++; i<sum) {<br/>
        test := i^n;<br/>
        if (test == sum) return true; }<br/>
        return false;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Similarly for the function returning false.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had the function computed and thrown away x, y, and n internally, we couldn't have done this. In general, you can't test a function whose answer you don't know.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

      <p>
        Which means, of course, that the definition given on <a href="HowDoYouKnowWhenYouAreDone.html">HowDoYouKnowWhenYouAreDone</a>
        ("you're done when the tests run") is inadequate for this type of software. --<a href="DaveWhipp.html">DaveWhipp</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course. If you can't know if the software even works, you definitely can't know when you're done.
