        Java Proponent
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="JavaProponent.html">JavaProponent</a> is someone who tries to convince the huddled masses that: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Objects are good 
        </li>
        <li>
           The Internet is here 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Therefore: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I changed the original from </em><a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a> because it didn't mention Java, just "Objects", which doesn't necessarily mean Java. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a><em></em>

        Very similar to an <a href="XmlProponent.html">XmlProponent</a>.

      <p>
        Are objects good? Compared to functional programming or even prototype-based programming? Does the Internet really matter? (After five years of failures, maybe it doesn't.) Even if the premises are true, is Java the answer? Maybe it is, but should it be the answer? If it isn't the answer, will it be the answer?

        What does the Internet have to do with it? Many people are trying to use Java for non-connected embedded devices, GUIs, etc. A Java proponent is just someone who is bigoted towards Java; in the long history of language bigots, this isn't surprising. COBOL is still actively being upgraded. Smalltalk people still waft around the corridors. Isn't this really a "no definition required" page? -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
