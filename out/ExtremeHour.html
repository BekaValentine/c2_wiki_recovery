        Extreme Hour
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> is an hour-long presentation in which <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is demonstrated using a sample project and involving the audience. Basically, the audience gets one hour to completely develop (and test!) a product using <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> principles such as <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        We'd been introducing Xp organically. We'd got a few developers pairing, a few stakeholders making <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, an automated test framework in use on a project, and a <a href="CommitmentSchedule.html">CommitmentSchedule</a> in use on another project. Kent's book has been flying around the place, and so has <a href="PeopleWare.html">PeopleWare</a>. A lot of the practices were in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we weren't extreme. The pieces weren't connected. I've had excellent buy-in from upper management, and they wanted to accelerate adoption. The question was, how?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well of course a series of presentations were planned. Many members of management stood up and gassed on how they saw this working. But the day was long and the seats were hard and it was plain that some of the management misunderstandings were muddying things. What was really missing was a vision of the process in process to tie it all together.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we saved the day with the final one-hour session, and this was so effective and fun I figure it's worth recording for others to try.

               <em>Stakeholders wrote single sentence </em><a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>(s) on a whiteboard, though napkins would do. QA wrote their functional tests on napkins. For example, we had one <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> "must be usable by the blind". This led to a good debate on ambiguous requirements - blind mice? For a QA example, we had a corresponding test: "We blindfold Mark. Can he figure out whether the trap is full without getting hurt?"<em></em>

           Meanwhile 4 Developers assign Ideal Minute costs to Stories based on Spike experience 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Use max story size 10 ideal minutes, or else make Stakeholders split/clarify.

            <li>
               <em>This means there are 4 x 10 = 40 Real minutes; 40/3 = 13 Ideal Minutes per Iteration using initial load factor.</em>

          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Presenter, practice beforehand so you can do this quickly! Use Load Factor = 40 Real Minutes / Ideal Minutes of stories that passed QA in first iteration (9 in our example => Load factor 40/9 = 4.4); Ideal Minutes for the second Iteration then = Real Minutes / Load Factor ( 40 /4.4 => 9 in our example ) </em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Hrm. Actually I was silly here. Of course if they got through 9 ideal minutes in the first iteration then that's the size of the second iteration. Unless they decide to include more developers, in which case you need that <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> calculation after all.

           Can we use more Developers? Or will that make <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> rise?

        We got through this whole presentation in 80 minutes, including presenter explanations. Of course it skips a lot of details, but it was most compelling to see all the major players going through their paces, and the universal impression was that we were going <em>really fast</em>. Benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the whole organization has a mental <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> of the way things coordinate
        </li>
        <li>
           there's real excitement and forethought about working this way.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> flew up to 4 for the second iteration. Everyone instantly understood it.
        </li>
        <li>
           it was easy to see how quality improved over multiple iterations
        </li>
        <li>
           it was easy to see how responsive this is to change
        </li>
        <li>
           it was easy for people to see where they fit in the process
        </li>

        It seems as if it would be difficult to get enough releases into a presentation to allow delivered stories and committed-to stories per release to converge in any very compelling way. I may be wrong.

        Even without that change this is still a superb idea. Kudos to Peter et al.

           The customer wrote fuzzy stories and had to make them concrete before they could be estimated

        We did the Extreme Hour today at our weekly development meeting. We had our marketing director and the QA person on our XP project as Stakeholders and assigned developers and QA to their same roles. We found that the marketing person wrote very fuzzy requirements such as "Build a humane mouse trap". Many of the developers had trouble working with just a single story at a time and wanted to design and develop the trap all at once. The QA people had a hard time sticking to testing the story and would go off and test stuff that wasn't covered in any stories. Many people had trouble working together. Most wanted to do it their way and would often argue about design and implementation details.

        People got involved at different levels. Some were really into it and contributing while others just sat and watched.  Overall everyone seemed to enjoy it. Now we will see if it translates into more support for XP in our department. -- <a href="JohnUrberg.html">JohnUrberg</a> & <a href="JaimmeYork.html">JaimmeYork</a>

        I led an <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> for educators primarily at <a href="XpUniverse.html">XpUniverse</a> 2000 in Raleigh, NC in July. My results and some of the documents I used are in my alternate write-up of <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> at <a href="http://csis.pace.edu/~bergin/xp/planninggame.html.">http://csis.pace.edu/~bergin/xp/planninggame.html.</a>

        <em>I wonder whether Joe is right in characterizing the </em><a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> as IckyPoo. I think it's more an RPG (Role Playing Game) pattern than a kid's game pattern. RPGs have a very different dynamic - effective, but oriented more towards pushing people inside a process than just show-and-tell.<em> -- Pete</em>

        The point of an IckyPoo is that it is very dramatic and unexpected by the students, not that it is derived from a kid's game. -- <a href="JoeBergin.html">JoeBergin</a>

        We did a "pretty adventuresome" <a href="ExtremeHourWithActualProgramming.html">ExtremeHourWithActualProgramming</a> using 90 minutes instead of 60, and with a rehearsal in front of it. The report's a bit long, so I broke it into its own page. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        I don't understand the bit about drawing stuff on the white board. What sort of drawing can be said to "fulfil" a requirement? How does the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> (or should that be <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>) correspond to that drawing? Is it simply (as in the example of "usable by the blind" above) that the drawing must show a plausible way of satisfying the test? --<a href="IainLowe.html">IainLowe</a>

        <em>Yes.</em>

        <a href="RobMee.html">RobMee</a> introduced me to a refinement - TestDrivenExtremeHour. Before you start drawing the coffee maker itself, the customers draw the test rig - there will be a coffee cup here, we will push a button there, the coffee will go so high. On a separate sheet laid over the top, the developers draw the coffee maker itself. There is certainly an art to drawing the test rig to constrain only important constraints, like weighing the coffee cup to check for the correct amount of brewed coffee instead of measuring physically.

        My emotional reaction when I saw this astonished me. "That's too easy. That's cheating. That's too much work for the customers." In short, exactly the reaction folks have to acceptance testing in advance of implementation. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        A post-Sardinian variant we've been using is for test fixture writing to be done iteratively by developers. Always first, of course - 10 minutes writing tests, 10 minutes drawing solution, etc. But Rob's idea is more in the spirit, and I bless it. -- Pete
