        Bloop Floop And Gloop
      </h1>
      <p>
        Programming languages devised by <a href="DouglasHofstadter.html">DouglasHofstadter</a> to demonstrate, IIRC, <a href="GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem.html">GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem</a> and the <a href="ChurchTuringThesis.html">ChurchTuringThesis</a>. Hofstadter described them as follows: <em></em>BlooP, FlooP, and GlooP are not trolls, talking ducks, or the sounds made by a sinking ship -- they are three computer languages, each one with its own special purpose.<em> They belong to that class of languages (?</em><a href="TuringTarpit.html">TuringTarpit</a>), such as <a href="UnLambdaLanguage.html">UnLambdaLanguage</a>, which provide a bare-minimum of facilities while remaining <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>. Trying to do something non-trivial in such a language can be an interesting exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a sample program. Note that <strong><=</strong> is the assignment operator, and <strong>output</strong> represents the return value of the routine:
      </p>
      <code>
        define procedure ' 'factorial' ' [N]:<br/>
        block 0: begin<br/>
        if N < 0, then: quit block 0;<br/>
        output <= 1;<br/>
        cell(0) <= 0;<br/>
        loop N times:<br/>
        block 1: begin<br/>
        cell(0) <= cell(0) + 1;<br/>
        output <= output * cell(0);<br/>
        block 1: end;<br/>
        block 0: end.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The syntax is admittedly verbose, and the facilities are primitive. The only data type is a (potentially unlimited precision) unsigned integer, the only operators are add, multiply, less/greater than, and equals. You can do subtraction, if you're willing to work a little:
      </p>
      <code>
        define procedure ' 'minus' ' [m,n]:<br/>
        block 0: begin<br/>
        if m < n, then: quit block 0;<br/>
        loop at most m + 1 times:<br/>
        block 1: begin<br/>
        if output + n = m, then: abort loop 1;<br/>
        output <= output + 1;<br/>
        block 1: end;<br/>
        block 0: end.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        BlooP does not have unbounded loops, and so can only implement what is known as <a href="PrimitiveRecursive.html">PrimitiveRecursive</a> functions, i.e. functions that can be expressed as combinations of loops with fixed iteration limit. It's still
        possible to do interesting work in BlooP, though.
        The following code returns the next <a href="PrimeNumber.html">PrimeNumber</a>
        after <em>n</em>:
      </p>
      <code>
        define procedure ' 'divides?' '[d,n]:<br/>
        block 0: begin<br/>
        output <= 0;<br/>
        kd <= d;<br/>
        loop at most n times:<br/>
        block 1: begin<br/>
        if kd = n: output <= 1;<br/>
        kd <= kd+d;<br/>
        block 1: end;<br/>
        block 0: end.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        define procedure ' 'prime?' '[n]:<br/>
        block 0: begin<br/>
        output <= 1;<br/>
        d <= 1;<br/>
        loop at most n-2 times:<br/>
        block 1: begin<br/>
        d <= d+1;<br/>
        if divides?[d,n]: output <= 0;<br/>
        block 1: end;<br/>
        block 0: end.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        define procedure ' 'prime-beyond' '[n]:<br/>
        block 0: begin<br/>
        output <= n + 1;<br/>
        loop at most n times:<br/>
        block 1: begin<br/>
        if prime?[output], then: abort loop 1;<br/>
        output <= output + 1;<br/>
        block 1: end;<br/>
        block 0: end.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        FlooP adds the <strong>mu-loop</strong>, which is equivalent to Java <strong>while(true) {...}</strong>, and so can solve problems outside BlooP's reach, such as computing the <a href="AckermannFunction.html">AckermannFunction</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are still problems FlooP cannot solve, and Hofstadter proposed a mythical language, GlooP, that could solve them. But then he concludes, <em>In fact it is widely believed that there cannot be any more powerful language for describing calculations than languages that are equivalent to </em>FlooP.  This hypothesis was formulated in the 1930's by two people, independent of each other:  <a href="AlanTuring.html">AlanTuring</a> ... and <a href="AlonzoChurch.html">AlonzoChurch</a>, one of the eminent logicians of this century.  It is called the "<a href="ChurchTuringThesis.html">ChurchTuringThesis</a>". If we accept this thesis, we have to conclude that GlooP is a myth -- there are no restrictions to remove in FlooP, no ways to increase its power by "unshackling" it, as we did BlooP.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        B/FlooP, IIRC, does not support recursion. If it did, the beer song could be implemented without subtraction:
      </p>
      <code>
        define procedure ' 'beer' ' [i, limit]:<br/>
        block 0: begin<br/>
        if i < limit, then:<br/>
        block 1: begin<br/>
        output <= beer[i+1, limit];<br/>
        print [i, "Bottles of beer."];<br/>
        block 1: end;<br/>
        print [i, "Bottles of beer on the wall,"];<br/>
        print [i, "Bottles of beer,"];<br/>
        print [i, "You take one down, pass it around,"];<br/>
        if i = 1, then: print["No more bottles of beer on the wall."];<br/>
        block 0: end.<br/>

        The <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> didn't exist when <a href="GoedelEscherBach.html">GoedelEscherBach</a> was published, but the numbered blocks correspond nicely to Java's labelled statements. <strong>quit block <em>n</em></strong> and <strong>abort loop <em>n</em></strong> could be implemented with a labelled <strong>continue</strong> and <strong>break</strong>, respectively. The only local variables are <strong>output</strong> and a (possibly unlimited) array called <strong>cell</strong>, reminiscent of unnamed local variables in the <a href="PlanKalkuel.html">PlanKalkuel</a>.

        Hofstadter's syntax calls for a pair of single quotes on either side of the procedure name in its declaration. The Wiki engine converts the name to italics.

        Surely BlooP is not <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>. It can't emulate FlooP, for example, and the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> is solvable for BlooP.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's a one-liner even: print "halts" :-)</em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>While BlooP isn't Turing-Complete, it could emulate all FlooP programs which complete within an specified large amount of time on a finite-speed computer. This may include all programs that interest anyone but mathematicians.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Suppose that the computer can complete a billion (10 ^ 9) operations/second, and you want to emulate any FlooP program which terminates in less than 31 years (a bit less than a billion seconds, in which 10 ^ 18 operations are possible). You could replace all mu-loops with "loop at most 1000000000000000000 times:". The translated BlooP program would only diverge from the FlooP original if the FlooP program required more than 10^18 operations (taking over 31 years).</dd>

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>If you want to get ridiculous, you could loop for at most 10^(10^9) times, and get a "practically infinite" loop. Close enough for me, anyway. :-) -- Bloop</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <em>"Practically infinite" is right - you've made a nice analogy between practice and theory, Bloop. If in practice the program uses all 19^18 operations, then in practice I would say the program ran forever! In practice it didn't halt, and (presumably) in theory neither did the </em>FlooP program it was simulating.    -- <a href="LexSpoon.html">LexSpoon</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless. <a href="DouglasHofstadter.html">DouglasHofstadter</a> comments somewhere that it is quite hard to design a language in which one can do useful work, yet which is not Turing Complete. BlooP is such a language. This is what makes it interesting and remarkable.

        <em>In practice, we get impatient with our Turing-complete non-terminating loops, anyway, and press BREAK or something. Especially if we don't know how long the program was going to take. We just don't know what N is going to be until we </em>do<em> press BREAK. Then there's the risk that you might press BREAK immediately before the thing would have printed its answer.</em>

        Since BlooP is powerful enough to compute primitive recursive functions, it is capable of expressing "The sequence of statements <em>X</em> is a proof of statement <em>S</em>" in the language of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, using the encoding devised by and the construction given by Goedel in his proof of the incompleteness of PM. FlooP is necessary for the next step: expressing the predicate "<em>S</em> is provable". But if you want the implementation to actually be effective (including when <em>S</em> isn't provable), you have to do it in GlooP.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we added <a href="PimcPiflPire.html">PimcPiflPire</a> to FlooP, we might have GlooP.  Of course, it is impossible to implement <a href="PimcPiflPire.html">PimcPiflPire</a> on any hardware that we can either build or simulate...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The four basic operations used in BlooP/FlooP are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Adding two natural numbers
        </li>
        <li>
           Multiplying two natural numbers
        </li>
        <li>
           Checking if two numbers are equal
        </li>
        <li>
           Checking if one number is less than or greater than another number
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However (assuming CELLs can be indexed by non-constants), we don't actually need any of these; just one basic operation, the successor or a number, is enough. Also, conditional blocks are not needed. All four of these can be computed using only the successor.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It is not true the Hofstadter's formulation of BlooP included only an unsigned integer type. He also describes a Boolean type with values YES and NO, used in predicate procedures distinguished by the "?" suffix on the procedure name.
