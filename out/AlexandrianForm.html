          <ul>
            <li>
               The name of the pattern. Alexander's names can name the thing created by the pattern, the process of creating it, or some attribute of the solution.

          </ul>
        </li>

            <li>
               One sentence per pattern that can be expected to precede this one.

           Discussion

               Anywhere from 4 to 40 paragraphs that illuminate the system of forces resolved by the pattern.

           A paragraph

               ties the pattern to all the <em>smaller</em> related patterns that round out this one

        I ran across this as I've been chronicling <a href="PatternForms.html">PatternForms</a> for the <a href="PatternWhitePaper.html">PatternWhitePaper</a>, and it struck me as much more explicit than I remember from my first reading of the book. -- <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>

        I've been reading it for the first time, and what strikes me is that the problem definition doesn't identify the forces explicitly. It explains the problem, but without breaking it down into forces or explaining why. I would like to see the forces. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
