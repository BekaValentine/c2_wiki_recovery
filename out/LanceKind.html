        This agile developer has been so effective at producing code that his boss sent him to help others as an agile coach.  (For some reason, he keeps being sent as far away from the workplace as possible.)  Now that Lance has been locked out of source control, he wanders up and down the western seaboard helping teams with agile engineering practices.  He's even convinced his bosses that they needed to produce a monthly comic book, <a href="http://ScrumNoir.com.">http://ScrumNoir.com.</a>

        When he's not doing freelance coding with Java and .Net, or conducting strange experiments on his $200 Lindows machine, (I don't even want to get into what he does with Tivo), he teaches people to slide down mountains on a plank of wood and writes science fiction novels (<a href="http://www.LancerKind.com).">http://www.LancerKind.com).</a>
