        I'm a Java developer, having worked commercially in the language for around five years. During that time, I've had lots of titles, and the printable ones include SeniorArchitect, TechnicalDirector, ConsultingProgrammer. Some of my peers reckon the last of these was more likely InsultingProgrammer. :)

        Before all that, I did some unspeakable things with other unspeakable languages. But not COBOL; never COBOL.

        My current interests include most things Java, although I admit that is becoming more and more difficult as time progresses. I tend to be most interested in construction topics, but then that's the same thing, isn't it?
