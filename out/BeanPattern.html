        Bean Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        Should the bean pattern (ie. <a href="JavaBean.html">JavaBean</a>) be considered its own pattern?
      </p>
      <p>
        Briefly:
        An object has parameters (private fields) that are modified by public MutatorMethods getSomething() (GetterMethod) and setSomething(something) (SetterMethod)
      </p>
      <p>
        public class Bean {
      </p>
      <code>
        private Object something = null;<br/>
        public void setSomething(Object something) {<br/>
        this.something = something;<br/>
        }<br/>
        public Object getSomething() {<br/>
        return this.something;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        What are getSomething and setSomething but new names and code for "something" as an r-value and "something =" respectively? All we're doing here is overriding those basic implementations and renaming them. Admittedly this does give us finer-grained control over access as well - we don't have to expose both methods.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        The SetterMethod may include access restrictions to:
      </p>
      <code>
        public void setSomething(Object something) {<br/>
        if(!isValidSomething(something)) {<br/>
        throw new <a href="IllegalArgumentException.html">IllegalArgumentException</a>(something + " is not foo enough.");<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        this.something = something;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
