        I am a recent Masters Student in Artificial Intelligence, currently working as a Java Developer doing Data Mining stuff. This is my first job in industry as a developer, so when I started working I discovered that the knowledge of computer science I acquired in school does not always translate into the knowledge of software engineering I need in industry. Studying patterns in this group has helped me greatly to round my more theoretical training and become a good software engineer.
