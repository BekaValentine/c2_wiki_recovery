        We have a bunch of HierarchicalWikis. But they're a bit peculiar. There's a <a href="SubWiki.html">SubWiki</a> concept that any page you like can become a <a href="SubWiki.html">SubWiki</a>. A wiki/subwiki is then an association of pages that link together in a directed graph. And these groups are assembled into a tree. Why? Well, because we're used to thinking about trees ...

      <p>
        Define a bunch of wikis as layers. Allow a page on a layer to be linked via backlinks with a group of pages on the layer below. Normalize the abstraction of layers into a hierarchy of categories ... say, according to the <a href="LeibnizianDefinitionOfConsciousness.html">LeibnizianDefinitionOfConsciousness</a> ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Key is that each layer is one whole associative wiki in its own right. The pages that link to the relational groups do it simply via backlinks - they represent the categories of the pages in the layer below.

        In a personal wiki, pages can be organized and stored via a system of classification in which sub-directories can become categorized wiki spaces. This is the scheme which I am using for my own upcoming Personal Wiki. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
