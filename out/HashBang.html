        Hash Bang
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some people just read it out. Since the symbol "#" is read as hash among other things. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Found in examples like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        #!/bin/sh <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <code>
        #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        HashBang is usually the first two characters of an executable script in Unix environments.
        If the program after the ! exists and is executable, an exec is performed, and the rest of the script is
        handed to that program.

        <em>Hmmm.  I've heard it called "</em><a href="SheBang.html">SheBang</a>" or just "ShBang" but never <a href="HashBang.html">HashBang</a> ...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably because "bang" seems to be uniquely North American in usage; people who say "hash" would probably just call it an exclamation mark (so we're stuck with the much less exciting "hash exclamation mark").

        The Jargon File's ASCII entry <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/ASCII.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/ASCII.html</a> offers up a few more:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Common: number sign; pound; pound sign; hash; sharp; crunch; hex; [mesh]. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Rare: grid; crosshatch; octothorpe; flash; <square>, pig-pen; tictactoe; scratchmark; thud; thump; splat.
        </li>
      </ul>

        I prefer <em>crunchSmash</em> myself.  :)  --SamuelFalvo

        I'm favoring <em>OctothorpeShriek</em>.  I'd think SplatBang would be '*!'.  That's probably because I had a teacher that had great fun making awful Batman references and writing out '?!*' - hook, bang, splat.
