        See the description of the Fall in <a href="CommunityLifeCycle.html">CommunityLifeCycle</a>, notice how <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> has been added to this Wiki, what are the effects of this change and did it have anything to do with <a href="WikiMindWipe.html">WikiMindWipe</a>

        Hopefully another, smaller fire will again do good. Thanks for what you leave in our memories that's cool Alastair.
