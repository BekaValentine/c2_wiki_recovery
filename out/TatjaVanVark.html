        Every so often I stumble on something or someone that impresses me 
        a great deal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of my long involvement with communications (dating back to 
        TubeElectronics), I have a real affinity for the gadgets of the
        early years of comms.

        In searching for data on various old gear, I arrived a series of
        pages describing the German Enigma machine.  One of the links there
        was to the site of Tatja van Vark, a Dutch lady of some (exemplary!)
        accomplishment -- but with <em>no formal education in electronics or </em>
        <em>mechanics. As she puts it: "I wanted to own a coding machine and </em>
        <em>now I do."</em>

        This is the extreme of "self taught."  Clearly, learning and education
        are not a one-to-one mapping.

        Here are some links:
