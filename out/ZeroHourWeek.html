        Zero Hour Week
      </h1>
      <p>
        After I have completed a piece of work and sold it successfully to two or three companies for internal use, I generally have a one or two years period of <a href="ZeroHourWeek.html">ZeroHourWeek</a>, exactly doing nothing but just answering some calls when they happen. (Never get to a complete hour within a week)
      </p>
      <p>
        Those days seem to be over though.
      </p>

        A <a href="ZeroHourWeek.html">ZeroHourWeek</a> makes a lot of sense <em>especially</em> after a long period in which one cannot find the discipline necessary to employ the <a href="SustainablePace.html">SustainablePace</a> of an <a href="EightHourBurn.html">EightHourBurn</a>, <a href="FortyHourWeek.html">FortyHourWeek</a> or whatever constitutes a reasonable balance.

        This is also what you get when one of the following occurs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Retirement (forced or otherwise)
        </li>
        <li>
           When you are party to a Downsizing
        </li>
        <li>
           When a project is cancelled and persons working on it are not reassigned to potentially successful projects
        </li>
        <li>
           When work is outsourced to those managers feel will follow direction and produce results (possibly Out of Country)
        </li>
        <li>
           When on vacation and a so-called friend does you in.
        </li>
        <li>
           When one has enough financial security as to be able to stop working
        </li>
        <li>
           You are recipient of a financial windfall
        </li>
      </ul>
