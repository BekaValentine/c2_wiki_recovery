        The little tugboat of Test-first Discipline, cardboard fist with middle
        digit extended, duct-taped to the mast, visible from the river banks.
      </p>
      <p>
        On one bank stands the various industry "container-lets": JSPs, servlets,
        orblets, EJBs, Droplets, JHTML, ASP, ActiveX Bean Bridges, session
        expiration call-back listeners, proprietary runtime services, various GUI
        models, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other shore there are the Data Sources, Connections and Persistence
        Concerns--RDBMSs, ODBMSs, XML, ORDBMSs, Behemoth Financials Packages,
        LDAP servers, whatever--the Data Model and Information Sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many fancy, large complicated tugs with flow analysis simulators and
        automated-log-tying are secured to Proprietary Docks at either side of the
        river. Uniformed operators on board, drooling in dishes of pizza-flavored
        cheese snacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your little tug, with its two buttons, COMPILE and TEST, is towing
        thousands of Objects, all linked together in large collections. In radio
        contact, you have your highly agile, small auxiliary aluminum Exploratory
        Test-first Programming craft whizzing around, quite independent of any
        "project" or "release cycle", tweaking the large tow in various places,
        prying apart little jams before they're big jams. The tow is about a mile
        long.
      </p>
      <p>
        The object model is independent of both shores. Discipline keeps the code
        testable, out of container-lets, and persistence concerns shoved far down
        into subclasses or mediated on an as needed basis, by a COTS mapping
        package, Toplink for example.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, to get your money's worth out of a package like Toplink, you
        develop your object model independent of persistence concerns, everything
        testable in the object layer, and separate persistence concerns to deal
        with later--map an attribute here and there, as needed. Everything goes
        much faster because the problem to be solved is clearer, that's where you
        get your money's worth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, doing Persistence Mapping Later buys you the ability to *have*
        attributes at all, not to mention methods, if you can still remember how
        to write them. The notion of developing object model separate from data
        model has been "endorsed" by Giga, but the practicality of it is kind of
        lost with their articles. You'd lump in other information sources, such
        as LDAP, with the data model.

        Fooey, you think, if only I had time to do this, now I'm going to have

        rename my stupid JDBCUserInfoSource class...
      </p>
      <p>
        tests still broke from the last refactoring...put on Levee Breaks and see if
        you can get a Green Bar before the phase shifting kicks in...nope, going
        down, going down down
