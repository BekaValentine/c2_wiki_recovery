        <a href="FreeHand.html">FreeHand</a> is a <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> illustration program very similar (and some people think much better) than Adobe Illustrator.  It was written by a small company in Richardson, Texas called Altsys, and it was initially licensed and sold by Aldus.  Altsys regained the full rights to <a href="FreeHand.html">FreeHand</a> after Adobe bought Aldus.  Shortly thereafter Macromedia bought Altsys, so these days <a href="FreeHand.html">FreeHand</a> is known as Macromedia <a href="FreeHand.html">FreeHand</a>.
