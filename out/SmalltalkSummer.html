        Smalltalk Summer
      </h1>
      <p>
        This was a project that never quite got started. RickLefaivre, the director of <a href="TekLabs.html">TekLabs</a> ComputerResearchLab, stepped out a staff meeting and was surprised to find all of his researchers meeting to discuss all that they could do with a little cooperative development. That is when he suggested that we should do exactly that and dubbed the effort Smalltalk Summer. His staff protested. If their reports spent the summer building tools they weren't about to be held responsible for their previous commitments. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> and <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> didn't let that stop them. They had called the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, it was a good meeting. Meetings are ALWAYS good meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cool things that came out of the project include:
