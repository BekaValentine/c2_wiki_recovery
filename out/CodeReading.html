        An Editorial Review from Amazon says: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You've got a day to add a new feature in a 34,000-line program: where do you start? How can you understand and simplify an inscrutable piece of code? </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Where do you start when disentangling a complicated build process? How do you comprehend code that appears to be doing five things in parallel? 
      </p>
      <p>
        You may read code because you have to, to fix it, inspect it, or improve it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You may read code the way an engineer examines a machine, to discover what makes it tick. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Or you may read code because you are scavenging, looking for material to reuse. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Code-reading requires its own set of skills, and the ability to determine which technique you use when is crucial. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this book, Diomidis Spinellis uses more than 600 real-world examples to show you how to identify good (and bad) code: how to read it, what to look for, and how to use this knowledge to improve your own code.<em> </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        This book could be great for recent college graduates, because in college they drill you all the time that reading other people's code is academic fraud and thus it's verboten.
