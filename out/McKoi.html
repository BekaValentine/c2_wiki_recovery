        Mckoi SQL Database is an SQL (Structured Query Language) Database management system written for the JavaTM platform. Mckoi SQL Database is optimized to run as a client/server database server for multiple clients, however it can also be embedded in an application as a stand-alone database. It is highly multi-threaded and features an extendable object-oriented engine. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Mckoi SQL Database started as an internal project and has since evolved from its inception in 1998. The main goals of the project are a code base that is simple to maintain and extend, ease of use and administration, robustness, multiple concurrent access, and performance.

        <a href="McKoi.html">McKoi</a> uses <a href="SnapshotIsolation.html">SnapshotIsolation</a> which makes it immune to deadlocking and very fast but comes with the disadvantage that its performance degrades badly in scenarios with multiple concurrent writers.
