        Phil Prince Of Insufficient Light
      </h1>
      <p>
        Phil, the "prince of insufficient light" is a character in the <a href="DilBert.html">DilBert</a> cartoon.
        <em>(He's the </em><a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a>' brother too.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A lightweight version of Lucifer, the Prince of Darkness, and responsible for punishing minor sins.  He has the power to darn you to Heck. Watch out for his pitchspoon.
        <em>Often, for only 15 minutes...he </em>temporarily<em> </em>darns<em> you to </em>heck<em>!!</em>
        (compare with Eternal Damnation to Hell.)

        Although strangely enough 'Lucifer' means "bearer of light". And in Dutch, matches are called <em>lucifers.</em>

        <em>This is not inconsistent with the Bible supposedly saying that Lucifer was the second in command until he rebeled. A more theologically grounded person could probably say more.</em>
        However, see <a href="http://www.lds-mormon.com/lucifer.shtml.">http://www.lds-mormon.com/lucifer.shtml.</a> <em>fascinating read</em> Let me add that the LDS church teachings differ quite largely in dogma and in doctrine from the Catholic and Protestant teachings. Failure to note that important fact confuses things.

           Lucifer was probably a name humans gave him.  "Lucifer" is certainly a translation, who knows how accurate?  All the Bible says is that he was an angel and then he got a little uppity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Bible doesn't say that Lucifer was second in command until he rebelled. In fact, the Bible doesn't contain anything close to a fully worked out demonology. Most of the common ideas about this stuff are derived from other sources.

        Lucifer also occurs as the name for a match in the WWI marching song, Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag - see
