        Proximity Database
      </h1>
      <p>
        A database with two tables:  A "record" table and a "link" table, each with a very few attributes.  All intelligence coming out of the database is the product of joins between those two tables.  For more information, and a more accurate description, see <a href="ProximitySoftware.html">ProximitySoftware</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even better: a database with a "relation" table for storing binary relations of various classes, a one-column table of objects, and a set of tables for holding "fields" of various data types.  Each field gets a field class.  Implementing collections in such a monster is a matter of defining more than one instance of a field for a particular object.  So, rather than two tables, you have one table for a particular data type in the underlying database system.  A bignum_fields and long_int_fields table, for example, and a text_blob_fields table.

        Advantages: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           not so hard to coerce these things into <a href="NormalForm.html">NormalForm</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           the data structure is way more flexible, and can be modified and extended very cheaply
        </li>
        <li>
           space savings
        </li>
        <li>
           semantically, relation fields are different from other big_int entries.  Deriving structure becomes a bit easier.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Disadvantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           essentially you're implementing a database in a database.
        </li>
        <li>
           concurrency becomes more of an issue than with table-level locking.
        </li>
        <li>
           you're marshalling objects into a referential system.  
        </li>
        <li>
           it can get silly very quickly.
        </li>
      </ul>
