        Difficult things to pin down. As described in the <a href="RugBook.html">RugBook</a>, "centers" are, according to <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>, the fundamental structures from which all aesthetically pleasing patterns are built.

        Centers are things you notice.  They are things you might give names to.
        They are things we perceive as structures.  So, houses are centers, as
        are doors, doorknobs, and a circle on the end of a doorknob.  Big centers
        are made up of little centers.

        Oh - like objects? -- <a href="OleAndersen.html">OleAndersen</a>

      <p>
        If I am building a simulation of an exploding star in Fortran, none of the centers
        of the simulation are objects, because the system is not object-oriented.  So, I take the
        question to mean "In an object-oriented system, are centers and objects the same thing?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe centers are objects, but I don't think objects are necessarily centers.  
        In general, if I find that something is worth making a name for, I find that
        it is worth defining an object for it.  But there are certainly objects that are not centers.
        In most object-oriented systems, some of the objects are needed
        for implementation purposes but are really not important to think about most of the 
        time. -<a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>

        <em>Curious, I always felt that the interfaces were more interesting - between inside and outside, between land and sea, between this and that; the centres were just homogenous fillings-in and things only distinguished themselves by how they set themselves apart from their surroundings.</em>
