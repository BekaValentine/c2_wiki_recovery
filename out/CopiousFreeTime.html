           [used ironically to indicate the speaker's lack of the quantity in question] A mythical schedule slot for accomplishing tasks held to be unlikely or impossible. Sometimes used to indicate that the speaker is interested in accomplishing the task, but believes that the opportunity will not arise. "I'll implement the automatic layout stuff in my copious free time."

           [Archly] Time reserved for bogus or otherwise idiotic tasks, such as implementation of chrome <em>[see Note 1]</em>, or the stroking of suits.  "I'll get back to him on that feature in my copious free time."

        <dd>1. Don't forget that Netscape describes their Extensible User Interface Language (<a href="MozillaXul.html">MozillaXul</a>) stuff as "chrome" without a hint of cynicism. They put the XUL noise into a Netscape/chrome directory and expect you to use it, all with a straight face. Hmph.</dd>
