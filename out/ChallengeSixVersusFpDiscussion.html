        Challenge Six Versus Fp Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is an attempt to provide a coded example that <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> (FP) proponents can use to show FP simplifying and/or shortening code outside of the systems software domain and beyond mere foobar examples. Although there are lots of different potential metrics to use, this particulate topic focuses primarily on CodeSize.

      <p>
        FP: FP significantly reduces code size
      </p>
      <p>
        Top: I would like to see an example
      </p>
      <p>
        FP: See, it can simplify your Example 6 loops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Top: I could re-write them to simplify the loops without FP.
      </p>
      <p>
        FP: But that does not properly close the database handles/pointers on error.
      </p>
      <p>
        Top {Issue 1}: However, the challenge was to "significantly reduce code-size", based on an FP'er claim. You are moving the goal-posts. "Significantly less code" was never demonstrated for the given example (#6).
      </p>
      <p>
        Top: {Issue 2}: I could reduce or eliminate the need to leave handles open by practicing <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> such that the code-size difference is negligible.
      </p>
      <p>
        FP: But <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> has limitations...
      </p>
      <p>
        Top: (Discussion then spins off to various topics about pros and cons of result sets versus cursors. I agree that result sets have limits in some cases, but they are rare enough I claim to not affect total code size much. The vast majority of loops are not affected by the drawbacks of result sets.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The </em><a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> forces separation of I/O and calculation because it is not good style to put calculation in monads except when you must.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's not really about </em><a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a>, it's about pluggable architecture. It's about "How can you create a function that, logic used deep down in the function calls, can be customized at the site of function call". You can not have this as easily without FP<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to explore a specific need. That was the point of using challenge #6. If you have another fairly complete or complete example that illustrates such, I would be happy to take a look. But, I am skeptical of claims of heavy need for such without seeing for myself. Some of your coding styles seem so different from mine that the frequency may not be an issue if my style is assumed. (see <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a>: coding_thumb_rules, for example.) -- top

        ....
      </p>
      <p>
        FP: FP better isolates variables to specific blocks
      </p>
      <p>
        Top: I tend to agree, but 1) Problems caused by such "loose" variables are fairly rare and 2) it may be a language-specific thing that can be "fixed" without FP.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Top: My conclusion thus far: Demonstrated FP advantages shown so far are quite minor such that adding complexity to a language/design is not really justified, or breaks roughly even at best. I still see no slam-dunk evidence that justifies the FP bragging I have encountered. If you personally like it, I can live with that, but suggestions that it revolutionizes ALL software are off the mark so far.

        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Likely break language compatibility every time we want to apply some programming paradigm (AOP, OOP, TOP, whatever) because implementing such feature as library does not integrates well with the syntax of the system.</em>

        <em>?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, this is sort of off-topic, but it seems you want an infinitely tweakable language. I might like that if I was the only reader and writer, but other people would just reinvent their language to fit their own head and consistency would go out the window. Every shop would have a self-rolled language more or less. If one could demonstrate significant improvements using such an approach, I might be more open to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, I am not for try/catch blocks. <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> reduces the need for that also. Some of those others I might cross out also. Basic list handling can be implemented via string libraries alone, no new syntax, and bigger stuff would often be best in a database.
      </p>
      <code>
        list="1,2,3,4,5,6";<br/>
        while(x = getNextInList(list)) {<br/>
        print(x);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This can be implemented by simply chopping off one item per iteration in the getNextInList function (pop).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I cannot believe you actually show that code. It's, IMHO, ugly... The list cannot contains object of other type (string, file, socket). One will never use that as a replacement for list. Did you think even a bit before showing this example? Or did you just want to put up something?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I generally don't have a need to put sockets into structures in my domain. I rarely open more than one or two at a time. (As stated near the bottom, you FP'ers have a bad habit of opening too many things at the same time. Maybe it is a common need for your particular domain, but not mine.) And, one can usually use an array or map for that instead if they wanted to do that. Maps are a super-set of lists more or less, thus we don't need a proliferation of built-in data structures. Furthermore, if a socket handle is just an ID, such as a socket/handle number, then it still can be put into such a list, especially in a dynamic language. It is often better normalization to reference stuff than to copy it into structures/objects and string-able ID's make such easier. Debugging with RAM addresses is a pain, if even possible for a given language. A relational brain seems to view this kind of stuff differently than you. -- top

        <em>As for infinitely tweakable language, What's the different between allowing one to reinvent the language which fit their own head, or the problem domains, and disallowing it? What's the different between this two library?</em>

        <em>I think the point that allowing one to build a language for their library is moot. Because, after all, when you are using a library, you are really using their new language, the API IS the invented language. The only different is that, in language that does not allow FP. the invented language looks ugly, you see kludge that shows how the new language doesn't get treated as first class language construct. It's like if you have to draw a picture, one system only let you write description of picture, while another just let you draw the picture. What's the different?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not sure what your example is trying to illustrate. There are many ways to clean up reg-ex syntax/API's without using FP. We are wondering away from challenge #6 here anyhow. If you wish to start a topic such as FpMakesRegexBetter, be my guest.
      </p>

        <em>I'm not saying there is no way to clean up Regexp API without using FP. I'm saying that there's NO WAY to clean up Regexp API without reinvent custom language (the regexp part). Just like there is no way to Clean up Database query without having invented SQL language. It shows that there is no benefit of disallowing one to reinvent languages for specific domains. Because, after all, API call is also an invented language; the different is just that it's invented on the language that discourage inventing another sublanguage; That's why it's uglier than another.</em>

        {Damn! My evilness has been exposed. Oh the shame!}

      <p>
        Nor, did they clearly state why their techniques could not shorten #6.

      <p>
        <em>More lies.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They made some vague insult about it having SQL in it, but refused to clarify. All talk and no walk. I am holding you to your claims, guys. No wiggling allowed on my watch. You simply <strong>failed</strong> to deliver less code for #6, and without a good explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You were shown many times, you just didn't understand it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I don't have to "understand it" to know whether it is significantly less code or not.</strong> A quick eyeball scan will tell that. I made a big deal about the claim because such is something that has an easy-to-see metric rather than just another <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> battle. This time you can't pull the old "you would see it was better if you were smart like me" escapist trick.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may later turn into a battle over how to score code size, but you have not presented anything to compare yet. Since you claimed "significant", there should not be much incremental bickering about the code size metrics. I suppose you could also offer fake code to trick me, but the challenge is to produce signif. smaller runnable code, not to fake me out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can I rightly claim that you walked away from the challenge?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, but you can rightly claim ignorance.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [ <em>Indeed, he can. </em><a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> was shown the use of higher order functions to make new control structures many, many times. He was shown how it could shorten loop-oriented code, how to extract regions of code out and make them into <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s that handled common tasks, and how to even use common <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a> tools to make domain sublanguages.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Top's ultimate response was that, in the face of for loops, case statements and the </em><a href="IteratorPattern.html">IteratorPattern</a>, all of these things were rendered pointless. Even when his approach was dutifully extended to show it was several times larger than the counter-examples using <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s, he still claimed they were not practical or didn't offer a net code savings.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't understand this. Please clarify. If you mean the "weather example", I have insufficient info about the requirements to compare. Challenge #6 is better documented and I supplied runnable code. You did not. <strong>Runnability is a fact, not opinion</strong>. Further, I offered to answer ANY question about #6, but the reciprocal for the weather example was not offered. If you want to use the weather example, then please do it right and finish it.

           Good! Apply them to #6 to make "significantly less code" and you are done and win. (Where are these alleged "pretty clear proves" anyhow? I did not see any that did not collapse under scrutiny. I saw <strong>nothing</strong> that was more than about a 5% code-size difference. That does NOT qualify as "significantly less".

      <p>
        Top, you like to point out challenge #6, but whenever we point out challenges, you seem to take delight in claiming that is "not your domain." What I don't understand is why this works for you (in that you can claim TOP is superior, say it is only for certain domains, then act like it's better for all of them) but not for anyone else?

           But before screaming "VICTORY!" note that the actual solution is mathematical and the program just calculates (3^n). It uses no collections. The Haskell version on the other hand does count triangles, and also works for irregular graphs, where the J version has to fail.

        Sure there is, I'm tired of seeing top, saying "No, that part of the problem is not in my application domain." He tried to say HOF has no benefit over his TOP oriented, but when someone showed how HOF is used to achieve simplicity in some problem top can not do, he would just said that it was not in his domain. He is not trying to learn anything. There may be smug lisp weeny, But even those guy knows about what ever programming practice you are talking about, Top is just not so.

        Why does anybody keep giving this crank airtime? Seriously, just go read his pages. Rant, rant, rant. OO is evil. OO proponents are misguided. FP people are ivory tower theorists. No-one recognizes my genius, because there's a <em>conspiracy</em> by OO tool developers to market their stuff. No, really, read this crap. He goes on and on about requirements, but can't write coherent requirements documentation for this or any of at least five other challenges. Most of the pages don't even describe what the challenge is.

        Unfortunately, those who initiated the challenge are the ones responsible for providing one. What you are reading is the response, not the initiator. But, in the case of #6, there is a reference implementation to use as the "requirements".

        I don't understand this library size issue that keeps popping up. Will functional need less libraries? Is it easier to make libraries with functional? Given the same or similar libraries, will the functional program be smaller? If there are too many variables (factors) to compare, then how does one know if a functional version will be significantly smaller? The fault in the alternative may be the design or quantity of the libraries, not the paradigm. It almost sounds like the functional side is implying that if one has good enough libraries, one does not need functional to reduce the code size or code complexity. Good libraries seem to be the <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> factor affecting code size according to this argument and not functional. It is the allegedly great or thorough or domain-specific libraries that made the code example small enough that functional cannot reduce the size by much. It seems the reader is being sold on libraries, not functional.

        The problem with what <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> is asking is that it largely misses the point. He's basically asking us to take one tool from our toolbox and use it to attack a small application without considering other tools. Using <a href="AnonymousFunction.html">AnonymousFunction</a>s and the FunctorPattern in your code is a very significant win in some cases (when you work with collections), but were I to attack Challenge #6, I would use many more patterns. Certainly, <a href="AnonymousFunction.html">AnonymousFunction</a>s iterating across collections would be one of them, but...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You are allowed to use as many FP features as you want.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> is trying to compare Apples and Oranges here, and that's why our examples have fallen on deaf ears. <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> considers <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> in its broadest sense, whereas the one point of FP we argued on (acting upon collections) is but one of the tools of the larger <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it should be easy to beat the line count of the given example (you don't need anything fancy to beat Challenge #6 there, the design is... very conservative) I believe it wouldn't prove anything to <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. Until he learns <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> and groks it, the advantages of such a system will be lost on him.

        <em>As explained in </em><a href="HowCanSomethingBeSuperGreatWithoutProducingExternalEvidence.html">HowCanSomethingBeSuperGreatWithoutProducingExternalEvidence</a>, I reject the idea that something can be significantly better without being able to give specifics. The "if you just knew it as well as I did, you would feel the benefits" is absurd. The fault is your articulation skills in that case, NOT my understanding. Everything objective is demonstratable in smaller examples. I agree that smaller examples sometimes are misleading when applied to larger ones, but at least they can demonstrate patterns to be found in larger stuff. We may later debate about the frequency of those patterns compared to real stuff, but at least the patterns (lower case) themselves are demonstrated so that we can then move to the frequency issues.<em></em>

        There are tons of external evidence to support the merits of <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> paradigm, you just pretend not to see them or refuse to look for them. Don't confuse your ignoramus status with the lack of evidence. See IcfpProgrammingContext for example, let's see if using your <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> you can even attempt to solve any of the examples out there, much less to compete with FP hackers out there. If you complain that those challenges are too elaborate for you to try, I have simpler challenges for you like <a href="EnumeratingRegularLanguages.html">EnumeratingRegularLanguages</a>, or any algorithmic problem. Take the recent one proposed by somebody here, like <a href="SicpIterationExercise.html">SicpIterationExercise</a>.

      <p>
        What was your challenge? If I'm not mistaken it was no coding challenge, it was a request for examples where FP is the best approach, so I pointed you a bunch of them, and I can point to you tons more, so please tone down your handwaving in the meantime.

      <p>
        Given the link you posted, this page should be deleted as it has no value? What's the purpose to compare challenge six against FP? None whatsoever as far as I can tell. FP is not designed to substitute SQL, nor is it intended to solve all problems int he world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can it help the parts that are non-SQL? If not, I would like to know why. That might tell us something about the nature of FP and where it helps and where it does not help. We may all learn something from such an answer. The original "significantly less code" claims did not have caveats for specific domains.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If an environment (be it <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> or <a href="DelPhi.html">DelPhi</a> or <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> or whatever) already offers you precanned components to interact with a SQL database, run reports, etc, then that's the deal. FP was not designed to solve all challenges in the world. It's like discussing that differential geometry is not adequate to solve diophantine equations (in case you wonder the two have nothing in common).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The "precanned" stuff is mostly just library API's. You can assume or make the same API's for your example if you want. If API's are the secret to competing with FP, then why sell FP? The "magic" is in powerful API's, not FP under that logic. I am thus confused about your API complaints. Regarding your diophantine analogy, if FP's benefits are limited to certain domains or techniques, </em>'let's get it out in the open.<strong> I would probably solve most problems I encounter for any domain with TOP techniques. Performance, lack of tools, or management paradigm mandates are the only thing that would stop me.

      </p>
      <p>
        So bottom line is: you try to mix unrelated things in the same bag. You challenge six cannot be used for any discussion whatsoever about FP, and all your comments related to FP on the basis of this challenge are to be discarded. If you are honestly curious about what FP is good for, try to learn first, and handwave less.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I want to know why they are allegedly unrelated.</em>
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Instead FP shines at solving mathematical and algorithmic problems, while producing high quality (low bugs, low maintenance code). FP environments in general don't have precanned libraries and <a href="WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouGet.html">WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouGet</a> IDEs to make them compete with <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, <a href="BorlandDelphi.html">BorlandDelphi</a> and others in slapping together GUI screens and database queries.

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        [Actually, there're several decent libraries available for FP languages, eg. WASH for HTML/CGI, Fudgets for GUI, and <a href="HaskellDb.html">HaskellDb</a> for database access. Unfortunately, most of these are student/hobbyist projects, which means they pay lip service to conveniences like easy installers. I spent 2-3 days trying to get Haskell and WASH installed, and I haven't even tried <a href="HaskellDb.html">HaskellDb</a> because of the long list of dependencies. Preliminary investigations are encouraging though; the equivalent of RptList.asp was half as long (10 lines vs. 19). I expect bigger savings with the main program, as I can utilize <a href="HaskellDb.html">HaskellDb</a>'s composability of queries and Haskell's <a href="PatternMatching.html">PatternMatching</a> features. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>]
      </p>

        <li>
           Regarding the "10 lines vs. 19", I did not use the techniques under <a href="QueryAndLoop.html">QueryAndLoop</a>, which would have shrank it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although it could be done in principle (and some disparate efforts proved that high quality components), no big company invested the necessary money in making FP a success story for this domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So one should not use FP for biz apps???</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So your challenge 6 is completely futile and borderline trolling: nobody pretended FP is the optimal solution for the domain, there's no reason why FP ought to be the optimal solution for that, nor the fact that FP currently isn't the optimal solution for that domain detracts in any way from the value of FP.

      <p>
        Not quite. The thing is, physics is <em>already</em> heavily offshored, because Americans never had a monopoly on smart physicists to begin with. The bulk of physics discoveries have come from other countries, and then their discoverers have moved to America to make more money afterwards. As a result, physics is already a pretty egalitarian playing field, where you need to be smart to do it in the first place, but it doesn't matter whether you're a smart American or smart Indian or smart Chinese or smart European.

        On the size reductions of Top's new code in <a href="ArrayDeletionExample.html">ArrayDeletionExample</a>, specifically Mandy and MandyTwo, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> totally missed the point of what the code was doing. I think part of the reason he isn't seeing how cool <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> are is because he's not thinking in both runtime and compile-time terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you look at his MandyTwo code, what he did was parrot a <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a> example with a pair of named functions, offering none of the flexibility. This suggests to me Top doesn't get how you can dynamically alter behavior with HOFs, trivially. It also suggests to me he thinks of applications in a very web-application-oriented sense. You write something, and it's done. People don't really extend it, and if they do they don't touch old code so much as make entirely new regions. This mimics the development of websites. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your characterization of web-site stuff is naive. Everything changes in the biz world. Further, I have been developing since the mini-computer days. I am not a newbie and have seen changes to software many times.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If he could see how a program uses HOFs to control behavior by managing code like data, placing HOFs at will all over the place, then he might be more interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be used even in software that traditionally centers around tables and doesn't care much for speed. For example, check out this procedure that you might find in a weblog (in a pythonish, rubyish, phpish pseudolanguage):
      </p>
      <code>
        define output_entries( blog_entries, output_type=Outputs::HTML )<br/>
        for each entry in blog_entries do<br/>
        if( output_type == Outputs::RSS )<br/>
        output << RSSEntry( entry )<br/>
        elsif( Output.type == Outputs::HTML )<br/>
        output << HTMLEntry( entry )<br/>
        else<br/>
        output << TextEntry( entry )<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And if someone wanted to add new types, they'd have to extend this further. This is exactly the approach that <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> said he espoused, and you can see on <a href="ArrayDeletionExample.html">ArrayDeletionExample</a>. This is basically a glorified case statement. It's annoying, hard to extend, and prone to breakage. Let's rewrite it with a <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a> in mind.
      </p>
      <code>
        define output_entries( blog_entries, output_func )<br/>
        for each entry in blog_entries do<br/>
        output << output_func( entry )<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now, if we were to add a few HOFs, like the following, we won't see a massive lines-of-code savings right away:
      </p>
      <code>
        output_as_html = { |entry| return HTMLEntry( entry ) } # HOF that returns text of HTMLEntry on its argument<br/>
        output_as_rss  = { |entry| return RSSEntry( entry ) }  # HOF that returns text of RSSEntry on its argument<br/>
        output_as_text = { |entry| return TextEntry( entry ) }  # HOF that returns text of TextEntry on its argument<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Or we might see it used inline, as is popular in Ruby and Lisp:
      </p>
      <code>
        output_entries( blog_entries, { |entry| return HTMLEntry( entry ) } )<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        We can invoke output entries with whatever we want. We've saved a little code, but not too much. Within 5%, as <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> says. But, what happens when something changes? For example, it turns out our users are reporting that every so often, bogus entries are coming up in their blogs. Maybe our master database queries are broken somehow? But we can't easily reproduce this problem on our test server. So what we need to do is put a log on the live system and hope we catch the bug in action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, with the original case approach, this would suck. We'd have to go through each entry in the case statement and add the same code over and over again. Cut'n'paste code at its worst, and clearly it's a pain to handle. But if we had the higher-order-function version, it's simple and painless and reliable!
      </p>
      <code>
        # Assume that the script parsed the URL above, and set "desired_output" as one of <br/>
        # our output_as_* functors.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        output_entries( blog_entries, { |entry| debug << DebugInfo( entry ) ; return desired_output( entry ) }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        See? That's <em>much</em> less code. Using <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> makes your code more flexible. Imagine if only <em>some</em> of the blog sites were breaking. Since you might have thousands of users, you might want to be able to dynamically enable this logging to save on disk space and I/O bandwidth until they report the problem. Again, this would be easy with higher order functions, but much harder with the case-like statement. You'd have to add if-statements into every if statement, massively increasing the size of the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flexible code leads to long term savings. Even though it wasn't immediately obvious, the design paid off when we had to modify our code. This kind of savings often comes when you least expect it. It's why when I wrote my Weather app (I'm the guy who talked about it), I used them. This is not to say they're a <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>. It's undeniable that they don't save much code in the short term, and that they are often more complex (especially in languages that don't support them well, like C++). But even if the code savings is minimal, the ease with which someone familiar with the pattern can extend the program shouldn't be taken lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might argue that "Eval" could mimic this behavior, and you'd be partially right. Certainly, eval does something very similar to what <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> can do. But you're using Eval at the wrong time. Eval is a very slow and powerful tool. Really, it's meant only for use when you have no other option. <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> have strengths ideal for this, and they can encapsulate eval calls at a later date, if you feel you need them. Claiming that you'd forego HOFs here for Eval is like saying you can't be bothered to take the parking break off your car, it's so much more convenient to just drive with it on, who cares if it ruins your gas mileage and break, right? Cars are getting better all the time.

        First of all, why are you assuming that each output "type" is mutually exclusive? (Be very careful using the word "type" around me.) Is it not possible that multiple output "types" may be needed per request? You talk about making stuff be change-friendly, and to be change-friendly we cannot (overly) hard-wire the assumption of mutual-exclusiveness into the design.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a> viewpoint would be to have the output formats (code snippets?) in one table/collection, and the input in another, and then join them as needed. Going from a one-to-many relationship to a many-to-many relationship does not require a change to the original output format table, only the introduction of an intermediate many-to-many table.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, let's stick to a case-statement comparison right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, you claimed, "We'd have to go through each entry in the case statement and add the same code over and over again." I don't see why this would be the case. Let's assume a statement like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        function outputMessage(msgRecord, outputFormats) {<br/>
        result = "";<br/>
        initialization_stuff...;<br/>
        if (listContains(outputFormats,'html')) {<br/>
        result .= do_html_stuff();<br/>
        } else if (listContains(outputFormats,'rss')) {<br/>
        result .= do_rss_stuff();<br/>
        } else if (listContains(outputFormats,'text')) {<br/>
        result .= do_text_stuff();<br/>
        }<br/>
        post_processing_stuff...;<br/>
        return(result);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        We can put the tracing at the beginning (near "initialization_stuff") or at the end (near "post_processing_stuff"). I see no reason to put it under each of the output format blocks unless it is somehow specific to that format, in which case you have the same issue to contend with. Either it is sharable code or specific. Specific goes inside the decision blocks, general goes outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also assumed orthogonality here (an easy change from a case list) by using a potentially multi-value list and also just appended the results to a string. I don't know what would be done in practice because I don't have the full requirements. If they need to be separated into different files or records, that does not change the general strategy here.
      </p>
      <code>
        general_pre	// common to all<br/>
        block A  // stuff specific to A<br/>
        pre_A<br/>
        process_A<br/>
        post_A<br/>
        block B  // stuff specific to B<br/>
        pre_B<br/>
        process_B<br/>
        post_B<br/>
        block C // stuff specific to C<br/>
        etc...<br/>
        end blocks<br/>
        general_post<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If we follow <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a>, then we can intercept the results (or pre-sults) outside of the format-specific blocks.

        Top: If you factor out all the "template filling in" stuff, how many lines are left actually doing real work? It seems to me that this problem may be difficult to reduce because it's essence is trivial once all of the template code is ignored. <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a> usually has a "smallest correct value" in any given language that no amount of cleverness can reduce. If challenge six gets most of its bulk from the HTML and SQL code that is being used essentially as a template, the rest may not be reducible because it doesn't do much. In short, in your attempt to come up with a non-trivial example, maybe you just made a long trivial example.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I do not know what you mean. You may find the example boring, but that is irrelevant. This is not an entertainment contest. What are you calling "template code", and how does that differ from non-template code? I always consider template code as something that you copy-and-paste and then fill it for specific circumstances. This is not that (although it could be used that way if one does not want to extend it directly, but so can anything).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I mean code to fill in the blanks in SQL and HTML statements. To take a trivial example:
      </p>
      <code>
        print "Hello " + name + "."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Replace "Hello " and "." with three page long fairly non-redundant strings, and you will have a six page program that just can't be shortened (ignoring exotic things like data compression).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Maybe that is because SQL and to a lesser extent HTML are doing most of the "work". I don't see that as a bad thing. It is a problem-solving approach: use high-level tools to do the work for you. If it is not something that FP can simplify, then we have learned something and the "signif less code" claimers should put caveats into their claims.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am looking for techniques to simplify my domain, not university homework assignments that find the shortest path to all combinations of pi, etc. I chose that example because it is a bit closer to my domain than most of those offered.

If you have a biz-oriented example you wish to present, that would be great also.</em>
      </p>

        <li>
           I notice that <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a> languages often beat FP languages in university-like contests.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Which <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a> languages are you thinking about, and which contests? I don't know a single university-like contest that's been won with SQL, J, or APL. The normal high performers are Haskell and Ocaml (functional) and C++ and Java (OO). Strangely, Lisp doesn't seem to do all that well, which might be because macros don't make much of a difference until you have a large body of code. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since neither HTML nor SQL are particular functional, that doesn't strike me as much of a concession. I'm not a big FP guy, but I'm happy to take a crack at it. How's this for a caveat: "Functional techniques are of limited use when you are forced to use a language that does not support them, such as HTML or SQL."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Are you suggesting you can create signif shorter code for the same thing if you did not use SQL? Be my guest to try. (I don't think SQL is the ideal relationallanguage, but it is generally compact for what it does.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not exactly. Although I think it may be possible, I suspect that challenge six is just too trivial to matter. Let me try to translate the idea into "structured programming" terms. Imagine that someone is trying to claim that subroutines can reduce code size. Imagine that someone else says "Prove that subroutines can shorten code by showing how it can make the following significantly shorter":
      </p>
      <code>
        for(i = 0; i < 100; i++)<br/>
        printf("Hello, world!\n");<br/>
        for(i = 0; i < 100; i++)<br/>
        printf("Wheeee!\n");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The program just doesn't do enough for subroutines to be of any use in shortening it. Subroutines, recursion, data structures, garbage collection... they just won't help. However, they are all capable of vastly reducing code size in more complicated programs. Does that make sense?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No. I would like to see an example from a "complex" business application. The trick is to not let something get too complex by dividing it into individual tasks. The large-scale communication is via the database, not so much algorithms. More about this in </em><a href="ProceduralMethodologies.html">ProceduralMethodologies</a>. And, I do heavily use subroutines in #6. Anyhow, as far as simplifying the above:<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        repeatPrint("Hello world", 100);<br/>
        repeatPrint("Wheeee!", 99);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But let me get this strait. <strong>You are agreeing that FP won't help much with challenge #6 code-size-wise. Correct?</strong> Any other PF fans disagree? -- top

      <ul>
        <li>
           Not exactly. I am keeping an open mind as to whether or not it can help. I am simply offering a possible explanation for why it may not be able to help, namely that the program just isn't complicated enough for the techniques to be of any value. My subroutine hypothetical was an attempt to draw a parallel. Since I can tell that you understand the value of subroutines, I was trying to explain how it is possible to create a problem so trivial that they won't help with it. It isn't exactly an argument, just an analogy to try and explain the idea. Also, if you include the definition of repeatPrint I doubt that you will get much if any code reduction.

For example, the user puts a string terminator ', and a statement terminator ; in  an input field that you'll use to construct your query, and after that (which will terminate your SELECT ... WHERE) whatever he pleases like DELETE * FROM USERS. So the SQL the app will end up sending to the database will look like:
        </li>

        Like I told you, unnecessary wasted effort. What do you hope to learn in the end? That Haskell is entirely inadequate  to tackle database driven web apps. I could have told you long time ago. How much time do you think <a href="SimonPeytonJones.html">SimonPeytonJones</a> spends on integration with ODBC issues? You just hope that a bunch of developers out there programming a couple of afternoons now and then are going to offer you a software stack comparable with that which is the results of many man years dedicated to the comparable .NET or Java solutions? The only sane solutions to such difficulties is to move over. Life's just too short to be wasted on lost causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is wishful thinking to think you'll get lucky with Haskell. After you'll fix the libraries, you'll discover that WASH will not hold to any kind of stress test, or that you'll have problems adding SSL, and so on, so forth which would make the  idea to use such a stack for any kind of production software completely ludicrous.

        On the contrary, I expect to find that Haskell is quite good at <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>s. I'm looking for at least a factor-of-2 improvement in line count; that'd be about 200 lines max. I was talking to <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a> a couple of days ago and he also didn't see any reason why it wouldn't work.

        <a href="SimonPeytonJones.html">SimonPeytonJones</a> doesn't spend his time writing ODBC drivers, but that doesn't mean other people don't.

I'm quite impressed by WASH and <a href="HaskellDb.html">HaskellDb</a>, for example, even if I'm using Dbconnect instead of <a href="HaskellDb.html">HaskellDb</a> in the end.

        Also, my own language design efforts have recently shifted towards the web/database apps world (as that's where I think existing solutions suck the most), so this is good practice with various database webapp solutions.

        Top... just one question. Did you have a hand in designing Challenge #6 here?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, why? The general concept as a comparison was brought up by John Urberg IIRC.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That explains it. The article raises some objections to OO that I've heard you raise, and I was curious if I was right in reading your hand into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's pretty typical stuff for top. Demand vaguely, then rant and rave when people fail to deliver according to some exacting specification that's super-secret. When presented with answers, he selectively filters out anything he doesn't want to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Damn, you make me sound so evil. What specifically have I "filtered" out?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        He hasn't even managed to write a coherent specification for this "Challenge Six".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>All flames aside, I do agree that Challenge #6 is underspecified as it stands. Every time I consider trying to do it, I have to scroll up and down repeated trying to match requirements, terminology and implied data from screenshots. A clear, concise summary would be better.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have to scroll back and forth to the same areas, then open up two browser sessions. Or, print them out on paper and spread them on the coffee table. I often do that when studying poorly-documented systems. I will try to provide some more details {since added below}.

      <p>
        I don't know why you guys find it boring. <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> frameworks are generally interesting in my opinion. They are not trivial because of all the potential options and variations they can have. It is tough to make a truly generic one that handles all possible business requirements and it still be strait-forward. But it makes for an interesting challenge to search for the best mix of such competing factors. (This example is not meant to cover all possible combinations and features by any stretch. It is pretty much an illustrative experiment.) -- top

        <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a>: more_details
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>More Details</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's take a look at this screen-shot:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/rptscrn1.gif" />
      </p>
      <p>
        It is using report number 2 (selected from the simple RptList.asp report listing). The listing (output) at the top is based on a query created in part using the "Reports" table. If you look at the "selectClause" column in the "Reports" table screen-shot (see original page), you will see an asterisk. This means the SQL Select clause selected every column in the table. In this case the data table has 6 columns. The database table is determined by "fromClause" column in the Reports table.
      </p>
      <p>
        The top part shows the results and the bottom part shows the user's criteria because the criteria is repeated (echoed) to the result page so that the user can modify their already-entered criteria if they want. This is why both are on the same page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll come back to the results later. For now let's focus on the bottom part, the criteria input form. This is generated using the "reportCriteria" <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a>, illustrated in part below:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/dict2.gif" />
      </p>
      <p>
        These criteria fields come from the rows that have "reportRef" equal to 2. See the second column. (The column name is partly truncated to make room, but all the columns are shown in full in the schema on the original page.) You can see that the rows with reportRef = 2 match closely with the above screen-shot. This is a very typical <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a>. "Field-dictionary" would probably be a more fitting name in this case because these do not necessarily correspond one-to-one with actual database columns.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only real oddity in this set is the price range (lowest price to highest price). Our data dictionary does not have a native "range" type, so we used two fields that refer to the same database column (listPrice). When somebody puts a value in a criteria field, by default for numbers it generates an SQL sub-string such as:
      </p>
      <code>
        and X = 999<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This assumes the database column is 'X' and the user entered '999'. It basically just uses the <a href="WhereAndAnd.html">WhereAndAnd</a> technique. The "fmtType" column determines whether it has quotes around it or not. And, for strings the default is a "LIKE" operator.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for ranges we don't want an equal comparison. Thus, the "Comparer" column has ">=" for the first range part, and "<=" for the second. If the user types in "5" and "20" for the range, both "listPrice" rows will generate two strings:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           " and listPrice >= 5"
        </li>
        <li>
           " and listPrice <= 20"
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These are then internally concatenated together as part of the final SQL statement. (A fancier version could perhaps use an SQL "BETWEEN" clause instead.) Here is the snippet of code that performs most of this process:
      </p>
      <code>
        '---Comparer<br/>
        if isblank(rs("comparer")) then<br/>
        useComparer = " = "<br/>
        if fmtType = "T" then<br/>
        useComparer = " LIKE "<br/>
        end if<br/>
        else<br/>
        useComparer = space(1) & rs("comparer") & space(1)<br/>
        end if<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It is basically just constructing "AND" sub-clauses for the final SQL, as described in <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> and <a href="WhereAndAnd.html">WhereAndAnd</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two other data dictionary columns that play a significant role in the range approach is the "keepWithPrior" column and the "sequence" column. If "keepWithPrior" is set to "true", then the input field stays on the same line. This is just a formatting nicety issue. What is "prior" is defined by the values in the "sequence" column.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "in stock" option is format type "Y", which produces a pull-down list of "Yes", "No", and "(either)" as the choices. One can also use the "theList" column to enter a comma-delimited list of options. This particular example does not use that feature. A fancier version perhaps could separate the list description and the list value. (Note that I called the column "theList" instead of "List" to avoid overlapping with reserved words. I don't know if it would be an issue in this language or DB, but I generally avoid column names that risk such overlaps.) -- top

        This is still completely unhelpful. You're explaining "how" and not "what". A good spec states the business requirements, and only the business requirements. It should have no code (unless one of the business requirements is that managers can write code for it), and it should lay out everything that a user can do with the system. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

        {That is not true. Only a little bit talks about code. I am mostly describing the UI and how it relates to the control tables (which I suppose is a kind of UI for app admin people). You don't have to use control tables if you don't want. You can use <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a> if you prefer. I won't complain if it is anything declarative (non-executable) and fairly easy to edit. Personally I would rather use a table editor for entering such info, but if you dig <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a> for whatever reason, go for it. If you want it in requirements format, then try this: "Must provide a way for an experienced operator or administrator to add and edit report configuration information without having to know programming." -- top}

        <em>Top, it </em>'is<em>' true. The document is awfully light on requirements and awfully heavy on how something should be done. We're well aware we don't have to use control tables. What we're confused about is the exact specs of this boring system. Tell us what we need to store, what we need to be able to query upon, the limits of those queries, the specifics of the preview function, and all the details in between. You keep telling us the how like it matters or gives us insight. Like I said before, I had to keep referring to the pictures just to figure out what data would be operated on.

        Ask questions. I added a section below for that with an example. And please stop mentioning that you find it a boring problem.

        I'm interested in this challenge because I think actually programming a real application in Haskell will make me a better programmer. I'm interested in putting the results up because I think some lurker (probably not <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, I've basically given up on him) might find them interesting.

So if you really think that you have better things to learn, and no anonymous lurker speaks up, I'll go do more productive things instead of responding to this page. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

Now, In challenge #6 you raise, NO FP language is going to reduce the query code to be smaller than SQL; Because FP with HOF and SQL solutions WILL BE THE SAME, It comes down to as much the same size. But NO language without HOF, is going to be at the same size with FP or SQL. That's why we said HOF is so useful, after all you don't do just select/insert/update/delete. We don't other operation too!! See after you have query all the data out to series of row, with your procedural language, you have to come back to for loop again. But No, FP'ers don't have to do that. They can still enjoy then same expressiveness as in SQL with whatever the operation they are going to use!! They can pass criteria, filtering to everything, not only SQL engine!!! That's where the code of FP language will start to shrink from Your Procedural parts. But, there are so small things to do in that challenge after the data is extracted, people didn't bother to accept the challenge because it wouldn't be anything left to challenge about (You use HOF feature to reduce code size already, and you are challenging FP to use HOF to reduce the code size again; how is that possible?).

        This may be a definition issue about what <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> really are. Your definition seems to be loose enough that the "eval()" techniques I mention may also be considered HOF. Your conjecture is an interesting approach, but I still would like to see an actual example of it reducing code in a biz app. I selected challenge #6 because it is far more representative than the other examples given (not perfect rep in absolute terms, though). But, then you suggest that something about it makes it not very reducible. Let's call it Factor R. What we need to find out is whether this Factor R is because it is closer to a real biz app, or something else altogether. I have found an example of something that is not very reducible by your techniques it seems, so it makes an interesting exploration tool for FP relevancy, would you agree? It could be that SQL already absorbs the primary benefits. SQL and Eval together seem to cover so much of the territory that FP would otherwise cover, that there is not a lot left over for "direct" FP to help with. -- top

        <em>SQL and eval together *are* FP. Especially when you're storing operations in tables.</em>

        Again, I think that is a stretch of the definition of FP. Somebody else called expressions in tables OOP. I see it as <a href="DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing.html">DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing</a>. My ideal is exposing the run-time engine (<a href="AdvantagesOfExposingRunTimeEngine.html">AdvantagesOfExposingRunTimeEngine</a>) so that it does not matter, each is just a view of the same thing. I suppose what one calls it depends upon their favored <a href="EverythingIsa.html">EverythingIsa</a> view. Eval does not really care what is passed to it, it just evaluates it. It could be a function, expression, etc. Whatever they are called, I find them useful. The real issue is whether going to a more "native" or full-blown FP will make a significant difference.

        Running a quick statistic over my current Java project, out of 1028 classes some 588 classes were  inner classes, thus some form of closures (Java's more verbose corresponding concept to HOF). Of course, this project is peculiar because it is multithreaded and depends on all kinds of events happening between components distributed over the network in unpredictable (non-deterministic) fashion so the use of closures was dictated by a framework needed to keep the concurrency in check. But other Java projects that you can examine (open source) have a healthy doze of closures as well - and you cannot complain that java projects are as peculiar as FP examples coming mostly from university. Thus people do use closures and HOFs, and for you to pretend that you know better that constructed strings can substitute those, well, that is pure unadulterated trolling.

        The main reason why dynamically constructed strings <strong>should not be used</strong> as a replacement for functional values (HOF, closures, inner classes in Java, etc.) is because when you construct a string and eval'ed later the programmer has a much harder time proving (convincing himself to a degree of certainty) the correctness of the execution of constructed string. For example, one would have to account that any values pasted into that string from current variables don't interfere with the syntax of the language, and that's just one of the many crappy details that become a burden when one goes the eval route for all but the simplest of examples. Remember programmers live with a <a href="ProofObligation.html">ProofObligation</a>.

           No, you're trolling to get rid of arguments you cannot respond to. Where do you see types brought in the above? Even in a language with dynamic typing it is much easier to <strong>reason</strong> about a code that you actually <strong>see</strong> and conforms to the syntax and semantics of that language, rather than to reason about the code that you don't see but it will be computed sometime in the future during the runtime phase. That's very basic.

           But you haven't used them much, either, by your own admission. So you're in no position to tell whether they are or they are not a problem when used instead of closures.

        [I agree with <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> that the attack seemed unwarranted. I hadn't heard of prepared statements by that name at all. They're mentioned only very briefly in Date & Darwen's GuideToTheSqlStandard, third edition, as "preparable statements". I'm willing to believe that's a failing on my part, but the vitriol over that detail doesn't seem warranted. Perhaps they go under different names in vendor's implementations. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>, <a href="DeleteWhenCooked.html">DeleteWhenCooked</a>]

        TOP's particular ignorance of this basic mechanism is not the issue. If TOP was just a mere ignoramus he'd be excused and spared the public embarrassment.

        I told him of the problem a few weeks ago and told him it was trivial to fix the code against "SQL injection attack". A simple google for it  would have led him to prepared statements, he instead handwaved about it. Above I told him once more. After he was told he was wrong and that he should have used "prepared statements with bound parameters" any self-respecting contributor would have checked first what that was. There are countless articles on how prepared statements save yourself the embarrassment of SQL injection problems. He instead posted <strong>four</strong> more irrelevant replies without even thinking about it, just hoping that by mere luck he may find something that can stick. <strong>All</strong> his replies above cannot be justified for a contributor who wants to participate <strong>honestly</strong> in a discussion.

        Prepared statements are a well-known mechanism. In ODBC the API name is SQLPrepare, in ADO if I'm not mistaken is Prepare, and tons of examples are everywhere one cares to read about how to interact with SQL databases. Almost all vendor specific client APIs had a prepare call for longer than I can remember. frankly, I cannot even remember when the Prepare call was first introduced in a client API. For the duration of my software engineering career it was always there in one form or another. If you think you have a solid knowledge of things database related but you are not familiar with this concept all I can tell is that you have a serious problem with the selection of books or documentation material for your study, but that's a side issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        How is this particular example relevant? Because prepared statement solve a problem that also happens with eval: the interference between values picked from environment (especially string values) and the language syntax that the evaled string has to conform to. Because of these, to everybody but to <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, it is perfectly clear that thinking about the correctness of the evaluation of a dynamically composed string, is much harder than thinking about the correctness of a closure. He repeated by the way of handwaving that such things are not important and when I pointed out to him that such an interference bytes his ass in the very example he posted in a domain that is supposed to be his area of expertise, he ended up generating this <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> rather than taking the opportunity to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because above everything else, his positions need defended at no matter what cost. Honestly or dishonestly, informed or ignorant, these criteria are totally outside Top's concern.

        <em>For one, we might not want to close it after each </em><a href="QueryAndLoop.html">QueryAndLoop</a> but leave it open for several loops to gain a little efficiency. Second, good web systems allow global default handlers to be defined for database errors that can close the connection, and even better the connection should automatically close after each HTTP event (submit). There is no reason to keep it open, error or not. Third, sometimes we want different handling for zero or multiple results. For example, a custom "sorry, not found" message for zero result rows, and sometimes there should be one and only one result, such as a count query. Yours is not generic enough to handle all that and making it generic enough will just bloat it up with creeping featuritis, especially in a larger app. Finally, a different contractor would come in and have to learn your custom query looper and all its little features, cranking up the learning curve for shop-specific conventions. I agree that it may shorten some loops by about 1.5 LOC (depending on language), but may result in only a few percent total. The claim was "significant reduction". 5% is not even close to what I consider "significant" to mean. -- top<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So this one trick reduce 5% of the code. not enough to claim significant reduction. But who say we can only use one trick per app? Bring in another loop HOF construct, reduce another 5%. Bring in some MAP, INJECT. reduce another 10%. and all that it reduced also increase stability in your code; every part that use "withEachRow" will never leave its connection open. hand typing may forget one. reduce 15% of code size and increase stability of code by 15-30% is not something you can do easily. and that's significant because it BOTH reduce code size and increase stability of application.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the record, I don't see why it would make "withEachRow" bloated just to add <close_on_exit?> flag and <if_empty_rersult_do> function callback, both default to current behavior; it will only add three more lines to above code. And you are being funny here about "sometimes query only return one result". Duh, the above code is utility for use in LOOPING over ROWS of result set; if there is only one row then DON'T USE IT. It's funny you are complaining like "'for loop' is not generic enough because in some case we will only want to execute only one time"; Don't use the for loop there, man. For query that return only one value like <count>, you already know that it will never return more than one value, so someone would be so stupid to not understand that above code is not for such usage. And The above code already always close the connection, error or not.

        In your Non-FP version, you increase complexity of a program by introduce a variable "rs" which is visible for whole method, but is only valid for uses inside the loop. In FP version the uses of "rs" is scoped to inside the block. There can be no mistake of referring to this result set again after it's used. This may be small change, but it's C/C++/Java or whatever languages with external iterator's good practice to scope the iterator to only where it's used. For example, it's good practice to code.
      </p>
      <code>
        for(int i = 0; i < length; i++){<br/>
        ....<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        than
      </p>
      <code>
        int i = 0;<br/>
        for(i = 0; i < length; i++){<br/>
        ....<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        So FP approach reduce only small code size but also reduce code complexity. How is that not significant. As I state FP is not just significant because it can only reduce code size. FP is significant because it both reduce code size and increase code comprehensibility/abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I agree that is a nice feature, but I find it hard to call "significant". Again, you seem to be offering solutions to problems that I generally don't encounter in practice. I won't say I have never encountered problems from "leaky" loop scopes, but that probably would not make my top 10 list. -- top</em>

        <em>It is probably possible to have a dynamic language where the scope is only in the given block. Thus, any variable created in a While loop will only be visible to that loop.

        For the record FP version can also be made to read the whole Result set to cache first.

        I am not against dynamic typing or agile language like ruby, I love it. Yet SQL made by concatenating string together has the same bad thing; You get the dynamic behavior that you can not reason about.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this SQL :
      </p>
      <code>
        Query("SELECT * FROM employee where name = ?", name_param)	#Prepared statement<br/>
        Query("SELECT * FROM employee where name = '" + name_param + "'") #Concatenated String<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In case of Prepared statement the query will work no matter what value are binded to the '?' place. And you can always be sure that it's operation is to do a query on employee based on name.
        In case of concatenated string, it will work ONLY IF the name_param does not contains any ' or comment character for SQL, any statement can even be added by escaping the string and put ";" to separate a statement. You can not be sure what execution path it is for this SQL unless the name_param is know. This is not kind of Dynamicness one will ever want. Or could you give an example of where that is desirable?
      </p>
      <p>
        Clause addable is always possible with prepared statement. <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> is not something that has to created at compile time. You can create them on the fly. For example, this prepared statement can be created at runtime:
      </p>
      <code>
        SELECT * FROM employ WHERE name = ? AND phone = ? address = ? AND ... # add as many "xxx = ?" programmatically.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And you can after that bind each '?' to the value. And there is no chance that the query result will change just because some of the data has '#' (comment character) in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the same objection I have for eval.
        Suppose your eval statement is to do assignment to variable. So you create this:
      </p>
      <code>
        def eval_append(var_name, var_value)	#<var_name> is a string, <var_value> is from DB and never know.<br/>
        eval var_name + " = '" + var_value + "' + 'foo'"	#result in, for example, eval "x = 'bar' + 'foo'"<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now this would work fine for
      </p>
      <code>
        eval_assign("x", "baz")<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But it will not work this string
      </p>
      <code>
        eval_assign("x", "boom' ; 'x")	# assume ";" is statement separation. now we have: eval "x = 'boom' ; 'x' + 'foo'"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I can never think of the reason you will want this. you want <var_name> to always be string you can assign to something no matter what it's value is. (Or do you like a language that "'x = y' works as long as y does not equals 0, 57, and 12357"?)
        You can not really be sure, with eval and string building, that the execution path of the data can be determine based on only the code you wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Code and data are the same thing" is fine for me; to the extent that I can be sure that what I want them to do to be data doesn't suddenly choose to behave itself as code without my decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a different degree of dynamicness one feels comfortable with. For me, I want dynamicness of code that is reasonable by looking at the code. I will never want some undetermined execution path to come just because some weird data enter in to the systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, Eval is hard to play nice with itself. In HOF, one of the best convenient is that a function can take another function as parameter and return function as a result of execution. Can Eval take another a string that is the result of another eval to use in its code, or return a string for another function to use in eval statement? Sure it can but, with the problem that code for eval is just string, you will have to double/triple escape strings depending on where you want it to really behave as string and where you want it to behave as code; which is confusing process to get right at least.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As far as prepared statements, I don't care either way. I am tired of hearing about them. Use them if you want and if it affects the code size count in the end, I will accept an adjustment to compensate.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        PS does not reduce your code size, it is just safer to use than string building. Just like HOF and Eval.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As far as Eval going bad, It has not been a problem for me. I focus on where actual problems occur in practice. If I needed to use Eval a lot per app, it might start to become an issue, but I don't. It works just fine for the few places that extra indirection is needed. And, I have not figured out how to store HOF references in a database. But, I can put function names in a database. (It is not an issue for #6, I would note.) But generally I end up putting expressions in the DB for most Eval uses that I recall, not function names alone.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So now you lost the claim that putting function dispatch in DB is across language; you can't eval TCL code in Python.

      <p>
        <em>I'm not sure what you mean. I do it out of editing convenience and </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. If you put the same in code then you have to carry the primary key in the code also to match up with the table, which contains the attributes. It then becomes a one-to-one relationship, which is something to generally avoid. For example, to add or subtract something from the table requires you to remember to do the same to the code-based list to keep them in-sync.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For example, if you have a menu system where the menu descriptions and nesting are stored in a table(s), then we probably want a way to associate the menu items with behavior.

        It's already stated that we can put the function name in DB and use reflection to get the function to call. Don't you remember?

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Reflection is a different thing than HOF and closures. You keep adding features to solve problems. You need three different features to do what Eval does. Plus, what if we change it from putting function names in the DB to </em>'expressions in the DB<em>'? Now you need four features to do what Eval does:</em>

        <li>
           <em>Closures</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               I don't know if anyone really separate Closure from HOF. Closure happen as soon as you created a lambda (anonymous function). Language that support passing function as first class object but has no closure is supporting half of FP. Just like language that support eval but doesn't have uplevel feature (And that means you need more than one feature to fully use Eval, either).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Reflection (perhaps not an FP feature)</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               The reflection I used is only looking up the name and turn it to function object to be called. HOF means having function as first class object. So I don't see why this feature would not be possible in all FP language. (If all function is object, there is no reason ability to lookup that object is not possible, right?). And for the record I can build my own hash table to store function-name-to-function-object, no need for reflection here. I only use reflection in this case because the language already do this book keeping for me.

               <em>Why not just use a case statement then? Wouldn't a case statement allow more of your preferred compile-time checking than a map array?</em>

            <li>
               You cannot dynamically add case choices. And as I stated, in practice I will use language runtime's function table so I don't keep track of available function myself. And why would I want to use case statement which look like this

          <ul>

               I didn't use Eval at all. Where did I use it?

            <li>
               Ahha, then sure, we must use eval. Because the requirement is "because we want to use eval". I can't argue with the requirement then. But let's consider first why one would ever want that. You need to show me <strong>specific use case</strong> first before we can discuss further.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>I described an example or two somewhere around here, such as the data conversion/validation utility. I'll see if I can find it. A fairly common one is a menu table where menu options call expressions, usually functions. Sometimes the functions may need parameters. I've seen other developers besides me use such.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           And after all, I don't see why needing more than one feature to do work is bad, as long as they all work with each other smoothly. That's why we prefer orthogonality of features. HOF should not need to have ability of reflection because that's reflection's work. Eval can do anything, but half-ass of it.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Eval can some do HOF but you have to make sure that data is never treated as code; and not to mention that you got no help from IDE now. And No compiler syntax checking. Yes I knew dynamic thing, but I never know why you don't want compiler to catch syntax error for you, if it's syntax error, it's always syntax error. It's not the same thing as Dynamic vs Static Type stuff. Even Dynamic type people will surely want to check that their syntax is correct.
            </li>
            <li>
               Eval can do simulate closure, at the cost of jumping through uplevel, upvar stuff. And it cannot capture the binding of variable that goes out of scope either.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Why would we need that? What is an example?</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Eval can do some of reflection, But only getting variables and methods by names; it cannot query available methods, get class of object, etc. And this reflection feature of eval is the same feature it simulate closure. So you still have the same problem.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           So I prefer many small features which work well together. Than one feature fits all you are trying to use. Top, you know how to use Eval, but you misuse it. Not that I'll never use eval in my programming life. But I know to use better, safer, more comprehensible features when possible. I only use eval when absolutely needed and remind myself of it as a smell in my code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I didn't go out of my way at all to make an Eval problem example. It's a common mistake in Eval. You want to passed both data and code to another function; this is possible in both HOF and Eval. But in either approach, you want it to behave as what you want when you want it. If you are intending to use it as data now, it must only be data; if you want to use it as code now, it must behave as code. Eval doesn't give you that. See from above? I intended to use <name_param> as data. But just because that data contains some character, it can't be used!

        <em>Are we talking about security or programmer convenience? Assuming database security is done right, the hacker should not be able to munge function names or expressions stored in tables anymore than they could munge the source code.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Grrr.. I'm neither talking about security or programmer's convenience. Security hole is only one of many results of using eval this way. Using Eval, you cannot be sure that which part of the string will be data and which part will be code. The user of the system may not be hacker. But they just want to type " ' ;" as part of the data! Why can't they do that? And if talking about security. With eval/string concatenated SQL. They don't need special permission to bomb the system. They don't have to munge with the expression in DB; they just type the malicious expression directly in the User interface you provided them!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You seem to be mixing up different issues. The Prepared Statement issue is generally unrelated to Eval. The code that Eval executes does not necessarily have to come from the user. Let's evaluate specific </em><a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a>s of Eval. -- top<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The code that eval execute doesn't have to come from user. But the data WHICH IS PART OF THE CODE that is passed to eval in someway has to come from user. Sure the following code does not come from user:
      </p>
      <code>
        data = ....		  // get data from somewhere<br/>
        code "print '" + data + "';"	// print the data as string (see those two 's?).<br/>
        eval code ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But did you notice that data is actually PART OF THE CODE? If data is, Say, " '; print = 'some more". You will end up with a side effect that only happen because the data contains a single-quote which escape the string literal you intended. But looking at the code above, Can this flawed can be easily found by just looking at the code, I don't think so. Will simple test case discover this? (most people will just pass in normal data, no "'", as test data).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't see how the above is significantly more likely or less testable than any other dynamic-language bug. You keep talking about how risky eval is, but again it has not been a source of big problems in my experience. I don't need it that often, and when I do need it, if one exercises a little care, it does its job. You keep insisting that brand X is going to turn my laundry green, and with more than a decade of use, my laundry hasn't turned green. I can think of only one app where the user created the expressions to be evaled, and it was a local-use app with two power-users, not something all over the company.

      <code>
        eval "print('" + data +"');"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I bet you cannot tell me whether there is syntax error or not until you know what the data is, correct? Syntax error because of data? Good?

        There seems to be a reoccurring pattern to some of our differences in opinion: I practice more <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> and don't mix things that don't have to be mixed. For example, loops are simpler under such separation because preparing the loop and performing the loop become separated issues. I tend to loop on prepared temporary result sets, not direct active behavioral interfaces (such as files or pipes). Similarly, error handling seems simpler because high-risk activities are separated from low-risk activities such that recovering from high-risk activities is then much smaller in scope. It tends to be part of my data-oriented-interface view. Communication between "parts" of algorithm is via data structures (preferably tables in many cases) instead of via behavior and behavioral interfaces. Your examples and demonstrations over-use behavioral techniques in my opinion. You try to do too much at once. You nest processing that does not need to be nested (at least not in my domain). It is not that FP does not help in general; it is that it does not help much when doing things my way. Now, whether my way is "bad" is another topic. But it's similar to some of the reasons my views conflict with OOP also, which tends to be behavioralistic.

        <li>

      <ul>
        <li>
           Do things sequentially unless there is a compelling need to intermix them live
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't open too many files/sockets/connections at the same time unless there is a real need. Buffer output to a database, table, or local file(s) so that bunches of things bound for different destinations can be written out sequentially if need be. This greatly simplifies the code, restart management, and debugging.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use tables for non-trivial structures, not nested structures.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use result sets instead of cursors. The need for cursors should be relatively rare, and put on the database server when they do occur if possible.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now, I will grant there are occasional times where one cannot follow these principles and FP may indeed simplify those particular spots. However, I question whether it is wise to double our tool set just to improve a very small percent of the total code. One should not violate KISS unless there is a compelling need to gum up the works.

        No, I think it is part of the same topic. If I'm understanding it right, it sounds incredibly inefficient for many applications. What do you do when you encounter a performance problem?

        I'll willingly agree with all those points, and work from similar assumptions myself. But the key words are "usually", "can", "generally", and "most". There are exceptions that I find to be infrequent but far from non-existent, such as large batch processes that require a sophistication of processing which the query engine can't handle for me. So what do you do in those cases? Just tell the user that they have to live with the long processing times incurred by all the data copying? Or is this when you resort to cursors? (Note that I'm not trying to enter this debate in any way, I'm just curious.) -- DanM

        Business managers sometimes piss me off also, but your assumption that most business practices are inherently wrong is misguided in my opinion and in this FP case I agree with their general rejection of FP. A good case for it has not been made in the domain. Its features seem better suited for systems software and communications tools. I will agree with this though: if staffing/training/education and language-complexity are not factors being weighed, then I could possibly side with you. I am just trying to put myself in the shoes of those who decide on languages and methodologies from a capitalism perspective. Whether that is the "right" perspective is perhaps another entire philosophical topic in itself. But, hopefully we have identified and narrowed down the areas where we differ. -- top

I have seen cases where boredom led to <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>, and multiple paradigms just gives a dude more dicks.

        In the current work-world, there is not a lot of incentive to write readable code. I know one guy who claims one shouldn't comment code because once he saw his comments confuse the optimizer hint system, and the boss buys that excuse. -- top

        Some indeed do. But it is a matter of quantity. Code where 2 paradigms are abused is better than code where 5 are abused.

        <em>[Ehh... No, if it is a mess, it is a mess, even if it's a single paradigm program. Quantity wise, 10 line of code will be better than 20 lines of code.

And if many choices is bad, then you shouldn't only count paradigm, but count library out there. How many thousands of free libraries are there for Java/C#/Perl? Any programmers can download a library and abuse it in his program. Why should we allow that? Abusing uses of Library is no better than abusing uses of paradigm. Why don't we have a language where one cannot create a library? What's the difference? Disregarding mental masturbation, who force him to use a library where he doesn't need? Who force him to use a paradigm where he doesn't need?]<em></em>

        <em> And it is certain that, in the current work-world, there is not a lot of incentive to know enough to program TOP effectively (Only topmind seem so). I once saw a guy trying to simulate multi-dispatch using Database Table. Does that also mean we should discourage TOP too?</em><em></em>

      <p>
        What is wrong with using tables for multi-dispatch? I am not saying it is always the way to go, but I would like to know specifically why it didn't allegedly work. I've worked in shops where tables where heavily used for such and they were productive and reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Because the language already provide the function?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, you have to build the dispatch matrix from scratch. And, tables are better <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> because an OO version repeats the "cell header" over and over again (method declaration).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Because you are doing things unconventional to your codeveloper?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So the status-quo is a self-fullfilling prophecy? <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> shops often used expressions in tables. It was not "unconventional" to heavy <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> people.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Because your dispatch is based on unsafe eval?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not this anti-scripting debate again. Besides, one can use case statements instead if you really want static "comfort".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Also, there are shops that use multiparadigm and works just like your shop that table works. So what decides that multiparadigm should be discourage while TOP should not?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tables and procedural complement each other well. Thus, you have only 2 paradigms which generally don't fight over territory.

      </code>
      <p>
        And this does what? what is "~a~%"? The SQL does not change, so why run it in a loop?

      <p>
        <em>It's not in a loop silly the first argument is the query and the second is the body of the loop. its lisp format strings</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What use is it over more conventional techniques? Stuff like "~a~%" is not very self-documenting, so I'd knock points off for that.

        How does adding one keyword Lambda, and removing restrictions on function passing have on complexity vs having to add a keyword for every control flow abstraction.

        For what it's worth, I was upset by the on-all-sides-argumentative and fruitless conversation on this page, and decided to do something about it. <a href="http://github.com/ods94065/challenge-six">http://github.com/ods94065/challenge-six</a> is my tilt at the windmill. The solution uses a grab-bag of Lisp tricks, including some FP, to shave off somewhere between 9-30% of source code size depending on how you measure it. Not bad for a simple demo app IMO. -- Owen

        <em>Looks good to me. Just a minor nitpick though. C++ has made some changes recently (i.e. C++11) because they've "seen the light", as it were, on the value of expressions. You can now do the following.</em>
