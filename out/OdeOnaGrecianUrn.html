        Ode Ona Grecian Urn
      </h1>
      <code>
        Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,<br/>
        Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time,<br/>
        Sylvan historian, who canst thus express<br/>
        A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:<br/>
        What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape<br/>
        Of deities or mortals, or of both,<br/>
        In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?<br/>
        What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?<br/>
        What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?<br/>
        What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard <br/>
        Are sweeter, therefore, ye soft pipes, play on,<br/>
        Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,<br/>
        Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:<br/>
        Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave<br/>
        Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;<br/>
        Bold Lover, never, never, canst thou kiss,<br/>
        Though winning near the goal -- yet, do not grieve;<br/>
        She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,<br/>
        For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed<br/>
        Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;<br/>
        And, happy melodist, unwearied,<br/>
        For ever piping song for ever new,<br/>
        More happy love! more happy, happy love!<br/>
        For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,<br/>
        For ever panting, and for ever young;<br/>
        All breathing human passion far above,<br/>
        That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,<br/>
        A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Who are these coming to the sacrifice?<br/>
        To what green altar, O mysterious priest,<br/>
        Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,<br/>
        And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?<br/>
        What little town by river or sea-shore,<br/>
        Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,<br/>
        Is emptied of its folk, this pious morn?<br/>
        And, little town, thy streets for evermore<br/>
        Will silent be; and not a soul, to tell<br/>
        Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        O Attic shape! fair attitude! with brede<br/>
        Of marble men and maidens overwrought,<br/>
        With forest branches and the trodden weed;<br/>
        Thou, silent form! dost tease us out of thought<br/>
        As doth eternity. Cold Pastoral!<br/>
        When old age shall this generation waste,<br/>
        Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe<br/>
        Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,<br/>
        'Beauty is truth, truth beauty, -- that is all<br/>
        Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.'<br/>
