        Rich Text Format

      <p>
        A document description language (or <a href="MarkupLanguage.html">MarkupLanguage</a>), quite similar to SGML or TeX. Used by <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a>, as well as other word processors,
        such as <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a> and <a href="TextEdit.html">TextEdit</a> on <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specification for the format can be found at: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnrtfspec/html/rtfspec.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnrtfspec/html/rtfspec.asp</a>

        Associated extension is .rtf

        Some software projects have a requirement to exchange data with <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a>. I have encountered at least two such projects that employed RTF as an interchange format.  It is reasonably easy to write a portable Unix program to generate RTF.

      <p>
        Some people have observed that RTF loses some formatting when converting from <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a>, particularly for word documents that are precisely formatted or improperly formatted. Perhaps <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> recommends it because of the business argument; RTF is annoying enough to compel some people to abandon their RTF-aware word processor and buy the full <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a> program.

           A side-effect of being a near-monopoly. Many suspect they keep MS-Access crippled for similar reasons: to not cut into MS-SQL-Server sales.

        If you work in a field where MS Word isn't totally dominant some "universal" document type is needed, so the choice is RTF or HTML (<a href="HyperTextMarkupLanguage.html">HyperTextMarkupLanguage</a>). RTF at least has <em>some</em> formatting.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a> adopted RTF for use in <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>.  For instance, the <a href="TextEdit.html">TextEdit</a> application supports RTF.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TextEdit.html">TextEdit</a> also supports an .rtfd file format which is really a file package (a directory containing an RTF text file and one to many EPS and TIFF image files). This allows a document to carry its own images without (a) altering the file format or (b) referring to images stored in another directory or server.
