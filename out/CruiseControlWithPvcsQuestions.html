        Cruise Control With Pvcs Questions
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em> Q: How do I utilize one of your suggested add-in Ant tasks with CC? Do I need to plugin this alternate PVCS checkout task for my normal modificationset.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm using PVCS (pcli) from a WinXP box, connecting with some username required to a network mounted drive y:/pvcs <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Referring to my notice (Michael Parker): 
        In my case, I added /cruisecontrol/src/org/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/optional/pvcs the classes simply to the local source of cc, because I need to make some additions. It would also be possible to make pvcs-contrib.jar and add it to the cruisecontrol/lib directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This classes are used to handle the checkout/getting of the archived files with modifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        To detect the modifications cruisecontrol uses his own net.sourceforge.cruisecontrol.sourcecontrols.PVCS.java which uses the pvcs command line interface (pcli.exe) due to your pvcs-tag in the config.xml.
      </p>
      <p>
        To check for modifications pcli first needs to create a temporary file (files.tmp) of all versioned archives stored in yourConcreteProject.
        After that it uses a temporary command-file called CruiseControlPVCS.pcli to execute the check.
        Here your information is used provided by the PVCS-tag in the config.xml of cruisecontrol.
