           Water/ice under the lunar surface - <a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a> and Herg√© - but now it seems there is in fact very little or no water.

           L-Dopa - There are uncanny parallels between a factual account in <em>Awakenings</em> (1973) by neurologist Oliver Sacks, about mental patients given the drug L-Dopa, and Daniel Keyes' <em>Flowers for Algernon</em> (1959), about a moron made smart...

           The water bed - <a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a> (In <em></em>ExpandedUniverse<em>, Heinlein mentions that a water bed company successfully fought a patent by using one of his stories as prior art.

        </li>
        <li>
           Neutron stars - <a href="LarryNiven.html">LarryNiven</a> described a neutron star in "Neutron Star" - OK, he listened to science, but they were not discovered until later.
        </li>
        <li>
           The Internet - Probably various places, but in an early <a href="DoctorWho.html">DoctorWho</a> episode 'The War Machines' (1966) there was talk of all the computers of the world connecting to each other to form a network.
        </li>

        <li>

        <em>I'll buy the cellular phones, but </em>'my<strong> </strong><a href="PersonalDigitalAssistant.html">PersonalDigitalAssistant</a> won't tell me anything about the presence of humanoid lifeforms behind that rock.<em> It could if the humanoid was </em><a href="BlueTooth.html">BlueTooth</a>-equipped. <strong>My</strong> PDA can tell me the next show time of <em>Rollerball</em> at the mall, which is more important on this planet. <em>Actually, wouldn't those little pad-looking things that Yeoman Rand was always having Kirk sign be closer to a PDA? In </em><a href="StarTrekTheNextGeneration.html">StarTrekTheNextGeneration</a> the Padds were actually the same form factor of a modern PDA--of course that's 'cause they stole that idea from <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a>...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm with <a href="LarryNiven.html">LarryNiven</a>: I'm surprised organ banks (and increased use of capital punishment to supply them) haven't happened.  <em>Driving a car carelessly has built-in capital punishment.</em>

        <a href="NealStephenson.html">NealStephenson</a> in <em></em><a href="SnowCrash.html">SnowCrash</a><em> (I think) described a safety device for riding motorcycles - instead of wearing a helmet, you have an inflatable collar around your neck. In case of a crash, it inflates instantaneously and protects you, rather like an airbag.  A few years ago, I read that a Japanese company came up with a similar device, albeit to protect construction workers falling off buildings. -- </em><a href="BurkhardKloss.html">BurkhardKloss</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually <em></em><a href="SnowCrash.html">SnowCrash</a><em> is rife with good near-term extrapolations like that.  Another that he had were eyeglasses that were monitors -- instead of looking into a monitor tiny RGB solid-state lasers at the edge of the glasses would paint the picture onto your retina.  I just read last week in </em><a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> that there's a company that's now doing that, albeit with RGB LED's instead of diode lasers... -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>

        When <a href="NealStephenson.html">NealStephenson</a> wrote <em></em><a href="SnowCrash.html">SnowCrash</a><em>, Georgia Tech had already been working on a prototype of that technology for some time.</em>

        I've read most of the stuff cited above and a lot more besides. I got turned on to the "classics" at about the age of eleven at my local Jr. High School. My mother used to give me the hardest time for "wasting my mind reading that fantasy." These days -- 35 years later -- I never turn down the opportunity to rub her nose in the fact that I was reading all that "fantasy" about things like microwave ovens, cell phones, PDAs, embedded defibrillators, reusable spacecraft, communications satellites, lasers...I could go on and on. Heh. I guess that's what started me on the road to becoming an embedded systems engineer. I always wanted to build neat stuff like I read about as a kid. -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>
