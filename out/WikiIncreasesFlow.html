        Wiki Increases Flow
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have just noticed a little habit I have formed. Every morning I
        come into my office with a coffee, sit down and browse around Wiki.
        I'm doing it just now, my coffee is finished, and I'm about to
        start work.

      <p>
        The great thing is that wiki has put me into that
        <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a>, which is often difficult to get into on
        Monday morning.
      </p>

        Thanks, wiki!

        Thank you David for this contribution. I find the same sort of thing - I notice a difference on days when there is so much going on that I don't get to look at this wiki. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
