        Practical Wiki Applications

      <p>
        In <a href="RunningYourOwnWikiFaq.html">RunningYourOwnWikiFaq</a>, someone asked,
        "I can't help feeling that the concept of wiki is incredible but I'm struggling to translate it into practical applications. Can you give me some examples of when and how this would come into its own?" They received several answers:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Building FAQs from mailing lists (many contributors, no organized structure).

               Talk.Origins, an Evolution/Creation newsgroup have just started using <a href="http://wiki.cotch.net/">http://wiki.cotch.net/</a> to build up an encyclopedia of responses to common questions and misunderstandings on the group.

           Maintaining a coherent view of a project (small to mid-scale) with minimal overhead among a team of co-workers, so that new members in the project can get started quickly and by themselves.

               This model is being used by more and more <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> projects.  Examples: <a href="http://freedesktop.org,">http://freedesktop.org,</a> <a href="http://psas.pdx.edu,">http://psas.pdx.edu,</a> <a href="http://www.python.org/moin/">http://www.python.org/moin/</a> . Often, the wiki is only writable by those registered with the project, but readable by the general public.

           I run a wiki (<a href="WikiLiver.html">WikiLiver</a>) which I use for teaching of medical students and physicians: I use it during the presentation, students can use it to review instead of lecture notes and I can give students projects to work on to make it a more comprehensive Web which can be used as alternative to a medical textbook.

           Ever wanted more than one person to work on a text (or Word) document at the same time? But that was never possible. A wiki lets you have several people working together on any document - you can convert it to Word later if you want. <em>The book </em><a href="ExtremeProgrammingApplied.html">ExtremeProgrammingApplied</a>: <a href="PlayingToWin.html">PlayingToWin</a> was written this way. In <a href="VlissidesOnBeck.html">VlissidesOnBeck</a>, <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> recounts how the authors used a private wiki to write a 120-page manuscript in three days.<em></em>

           I am a foreign language teacher and am using a wiki to allow students to collaboratively create a bank of information they have found through web research. They investigate various cultural and other topics, and put their findings on the wiki. They then must peer-edit each others' work. The pedagogical point is to allow their work to enlighten others, to collaborate, to be held accountable for their assignments, to make the language and culture more accessible and concrete, to give them a place to communicate in a new language with relatively low stakes in terms of anxiety, and to integrate our classroom topics in a big, fat co-created space. Plus it's fun.
