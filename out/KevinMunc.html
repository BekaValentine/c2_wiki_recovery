        <strong>Some Biographical Background:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Kevin Munc, and I'm a software developer from Columbus, Ohio. I've been a programmer since the bug bit me in 1997. Thanks to Y2K, a guy like me with a Philosophy degree from OSU was able to get a job pretty quickly doing COBOL and JCL. I did a little bit of <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> (v4), then ran for the web in 1999. I've been doing mostly Java and J2EE since then, but all along I've tried to learn as much as I can. As a result I've become pretty good with SQL, XML, XHTML, CSS, and <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. I've done a fair amount of Flash and <a href="ActionScript.html">ActionScript</a>, and dabbled with several other languages. My current interest is in getting good with Ruby and <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a>. My first contributions to this wiki were, in fact, at <a href="IwannaLearnRuby.html">IwannaLearnRuby</a> and <a href="IwannaLearnRubyOnRails.html">IwannaLearnRubyOnRails</a>.

        I've begun blogging a bit this year, at <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/muncman">http://www.jroller.com/page/muncman</a> for mostly Java-related stuff, and at <a href="http://muncman.blogspot.com/">http://muncman.blogspot.com/</a> for mostly Ruby-related stuff (at least that's the plan). My home page, where I've got a (slowly) growing collection of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> experiments, is <a href="http://www.munc.com/.">http://www.munc.com/.</a>
