        What Oracle Cannot Handle
      </h1>
      <p>
        From <a href="DedicatedStructuresVersusRdbms.html">DedicatedStructuresVersusRdbms</a>: "It would be interesting to study that patterns of systems and requirements where Oracle (considered the performance leader) is [allegedly] not good enough." 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That was Top, right? Sigh...this digression should </em>'not<em>' be necessary.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A quick search finds e.g.:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"SAG is claiming Tamino is 10-40 times faster than Oracle 8i."</em>
        <a href="http://listserv.uark.edu/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0002d&L=sag-l&F=&S=&P=6696">http://listserv.uark.edu/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0002d&L=sag-l&F=&S=&P=6696</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"[Lawson non-relational database]</em>
        is much faster than Oracle or the other relational databases"<em></em>
        <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/oracle-l@fatcity.com/msg71361.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/oracle-l@fatcity.com/msg71361.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>These things are </em>'not<em>' interesting. A general purpose relational database can always be beaten, speed-wise, by some special purpose piece of software.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Pay closer attention this time: this has been proven mathematically; it is not a subjective opinion. See the </em><a href="NoFreeLunchTheorem.html">NoFreeLunchTheorem</a>, like I said before.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And actually, it was obvious even before that, that this is </em>'usually<strong> true. The theorem is interesting because it proved that it is </strong>always<em>' true.</em>
