        Real Software
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="RealSoftware.html">RealSoftware</a>, like a <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a>... is a snobbish view that <strong>some software out there is crap and/or fake</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah I'm a snob. I think that for example thin clients are real software.. while web browser html applications aren't real software. Web Browser Based software is just an electronic brochure that was after hacked to be more like a real software application. They are fake applications and they will never be <a href="RealSoftware.html">RealSoftware</a>. Take note, though, that I develop web applications for a living.. and that I've grown to almost consider web applications <a href="RealSoftware.html">RealSoftware</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is a joke.. in that there is no such thing as <a href="RealSoftware.html">RealSoftware</a>.. (as opposed to FakeSoftware?).  However it is a pattern for sure - there are a lot of programmers who think that <em>real programmers use real software</em> and that <em>real programmers develop real software</em>.

        <strong>Examples</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Don't</strong> develop websites or web applications. Real software runs right on the operating system, not in some web browser. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Don't</strong> use Java because a virtual machine runs <em>fake</em> artificial nonsensical programs. Java software is not <em>real</em> software.
        </li>
        <li>
           A program written in Standard Pascal is <strong>not real software</strong> since it was not written in a <em>real</em> programming language
        </li>
        <li>
           a Java Craplet is not <em>real software</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           .NET is not <em>real software</em> because... well because.
        </li>
        <li>
           software that is developed in a scripting language is not really real software
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>truly really really real</em> software is done in assembly code or machine code
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        <strong>if</strong> software === real <strong>then</strong> good;<br/>
        <strong>if</strong> software == real <strong>then</strong> maybe;<br/>
        <strong>if</strong> software = real <strong>then</strong> bad;<br/>
        <strong>if</strong> software <> real <strong>then</strong> bad;<br/>
        <strong>if</strong> software != real <strong>then</strong> bad;<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           real software is developed in a language that doesn't use confusing operators, like above
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <em>Wow, something, or someone, has really got up your nose, haven't they.  Like it or not, some people think that writing HTML pages in a graphical editor is somehow the same as writing safety-critical software to control airplanes in crowded airspaces.  They're wrong.  But it is a question of degree, and there are many, many shades in between.  What gets up my nose is the levels of discipline snobbery and, equally, discipline envy.  Why can't people do what they do, and be content that they do it well, it is what it is, and it's valuable in its own right.</em>
