        While trying to develop new ways of accessing computers remotely, Tim invented the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a> at CERN, where he defined HTTP (<a href="HyperTextTransferProtocol.html">HyperTextTransferProtocol</a>), HTML (<a href="HyperTextMarkupLanguage.html">HyperTextMarkupLanguage</a>), and the URI (<a href="UniformResourceIdentifier.html">UniformResourceIdentifier</a>). He founded, and is now a director of the <a href="WorldWideWebConsortium.html">WorldWideWebConsortium</a>. In January 2004, he received the distinction of Knight Commander of the British Empire (KBE) -- in other words, he was knighted. Hence some would refer to him as "Sir <a href="TimBernersLee.html">TimBernersLee</a>".

        His book <em></em><a href="WeavingTheWeb.html">WeavingTheWeb</a><em> is well worth reading.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="NeXt.html">NeXt</a> cube he used to build the first Web software is on display in the London Science Museum. Decide for yourself if that makes sense or not. <em>Hm, one museum also has the hat of Nikola Tesla.</em> [It would be cooler if the NeXT cube were still on the net.]

        "Sir Tim" has a blog now, <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/blog/4,">http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/blog/4,</a> and in the first entry he says, "Now in 2005, we have blogs and wikis, and the fact that they are so popular makes me feel I wasn't crazy to think people needed a creative space."
