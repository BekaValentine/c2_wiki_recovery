        Design Patterns For Distributed Objects
      </h1>
      <p>
        Refactored mercilessly 20 July 1999.
        Hope to update the paper soon too.

        "Design Patterns for Distributed Objects" is the title of a presentation I
        gave at the Australian Java Users' Group on Monday July 12 1999.
        I wrote a paper which is essentially the same as the talk,
        although the paper has not been published in any more formal sense.

        I'm interested in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           getting feedback on the patterns
        </li>
        <li>
           getting feedback on the writing
        </li>
        <li>
           hearing about related work
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From what I read on other pages (<a href="BeyondWritersWorkshops.html">BeyondWritersWorkshops</a>) there seems to be
        quite an industry in reviewing patterns literature.
        I hope some of the professional reviewers :-) can take some time to look at
        this.
        I am presently working my way through a bunch of papers, such as A PatternLanguageForPatternWriting.
        Thanks!

        The patterns discussed are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hand Off To Remote Worker (to be renamed to <a href="HandOff.html">HandOff</a>)
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To turn this into a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>, I would need to add:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="PublishAndSubscribe.html">PublishAndSubscribe</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           DistributedCallback
        </li>
        <li>
           Write in the form, spirit and style of <strong>A Pattern Language</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           Tags without spaces in them.  For some reason, <a href="http://www.ajug.org.au/ajug-qld/papers/john_farrell.19990712.html#Bag%20of%20Jumping%20Beans">http://www.ajug.org.au/ajug-qld/papers/john_farrell.19990712.html#Bag%20of%20Jumping%20Beans</a> doesn't work for me. (<em>Sorry, the tags are automatically generated for me, and the author of the document formatting system hadn't heard of </em><a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> s.<em>)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>...more suggestions welcome.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It also occurs to me that <a href="DesignPatternsForDistributedObjects.html">DesignPatternsForDistributedObjects</a> effectively
        include elements of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           DistributedProgrammingPatterns
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ConcurrentProgrammingPatterns.html">ConcurrentProgrammingPatterns</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="LargeSoftwareSystemPatterns.html">LargeSoftwareSystemPatterns</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ObjectSystemPatterns.html">ObjectSystemPatterns</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

        I think it shows promise.
        And with a little polishing it could be a useful <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>.
