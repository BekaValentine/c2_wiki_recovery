        <em>There is one area of information technology that is in its infancy: that of dealing with the vast differences in the way people think and the way people understand information. This is not a technical problem that can be solved by clever computer programming. The solutions will depend upon adopting appropriate strategies that take into account the way in which the human brain interprets and processes information.</em>

        <em> Do our minds actually re-wire or restructure the brain to accommodate or better integrate with our tools?
