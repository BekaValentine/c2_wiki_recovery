        Daily Scrum
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a>, this is a daily <a href="InspectAndAdapt.html">InspectAndAdapt</a> opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each work day the <a href="ScrumTeam.html">ScrumTeam</a> gathers in the same place at the same time. The <a href="ScrumMaster.html">ScrumMaster</a> asks each person 3 questions, in turn:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "What have you done since the last Scrum meeting?"
        </li>
        <li>
           "What do you plan to do before the next Scrum meeting?"
        </li>
        <li>
           "What impediments are in your way?"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At the <a href="DailyScrum.html">DailyScrum</a>, only pigs can talk. Chickens can come to the meeting to observe and learn, but they can't talk, make funny faces, whisper, take notes loudly, or in any other way communicate during the meeting. If they do, they have to leave. If they persist, they can be banned from the meeting. This applies to all chickens, including (especially?) executives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="DailyScrum.html">DailyScrum</a> is a chance for the team to organize themselves. The <a href="DailyScrum.html">DailyScrum</a> is NOT a status meeting, but a meeting that will foster the communication between all participants. The <a href="DailyScrum.html">DailyScrum</a> is a tool to create a team spirit in case it is used as a CheckIn method.
