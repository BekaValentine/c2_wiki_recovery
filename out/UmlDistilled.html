        Last ECOOP, <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> announced this book as the tiniest book on methods, in this case the <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a>, ever written. I bet it is the tiniest, but it is much more than a book on UML. It was fun to read the commonsense advice of an experienced practitioner. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A must read for developers, analysts, programmers and managers who face bureaucracy and method-implementors more interested in delivering the documents for their ISO-like target than in practical use.

        I am currently reading it and it is great so far. My company has recently implemented the <a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a> and this book is really making the UML concepts clear.

        <a href="UmlDistilled.html">UmlDistilled</a> is high protein. Along with an intro to the basics of UML, Fowler packs this <em>short</em> book with lots of practical advise on using UML for analysis and design, including some thoughts on when to bend the rules. I highly recommend it, particularly for folks who need to pick up UML in a hurry. -- <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>
