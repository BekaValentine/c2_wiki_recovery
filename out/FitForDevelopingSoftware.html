        From Amazon review: "The Fit open source testing framework brings unprecedented agility to the entire development process. Unlike previous testing tools, Fit fully addresses the business value of software, not just technical quality. Using it, software customers, developers, and testers can clarify what software should do, compare that to what it does do, and systematically address the differences. Working together, they can guide development far more effectively--ensuring that systems accurately reflect business rules, now and in the future."
