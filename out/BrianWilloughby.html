        I purchased my first NeXT, a NeXTdimension, in 1991 while still working for the EvilEmpire.  About six months later I quit, having never owned an IBM PC-clone.  I have worked almost exclusively in <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> since that time, having worked with <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and Java merely for the experience with other O-O-ish language options.
      </p>

        Java is nice.  It solves a few of the problems with <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> - namespaces and abstract classes/methods - but introduces a new set of problems and loses some of the powerful features of <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>.  I find that implementing the same design in Java requires more lines of code than in <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>.  Also, the strong typing of Java forces the developer to use casting, which basically means that you won't know until you execute the code under all possible conditions whether there will be a class exception.  Java suffers in the area of polymorphism and dynamism in this respect.
