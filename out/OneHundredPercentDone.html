        One Hundred Percent Done
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Can a project ever be 100% done?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do we define <a href="OneHundredPercentDone.html">OneHundredPercentDone</a> such that it would be a complete definition? Can a project ever be 100% done?
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, a project being developed with <a href="AgileDevelopment.html">AgileDevelopment</a> is 100% done <em>with respect to current requirements</em> when it meets the <a href="TaskCompleteDefinition.html">TaskCompleteDefinition</a>. If new requirements come on board, that is a new program which either replaces the current project or is completed after the current project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise with tasks. Once a task starts, if its definition changes it becomes a new task; completed after (or instead of, abandoning the current work) the current task.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Questions about definition:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Should this definition include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Alpha & Beta releases
        </li>
        <li>
           Fully tested by QA
        </li>
        <li>
           Fully documented, both in print, and online
        </li>
        <li>
           Supporting website
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s for everything
        </li>
        <li>
           Optimally factored - no refactoring needed unless new features are added
        </li>
        <li>
           Completely secure from worms, backdoors, buffer overflows, broken encryption, and malevolent users
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of these considerations need to be fitted into the <a href="TaskCompleteDefinition.html">TaskCompleteDefinition</a> before a project's status can be determined.

        <strong>Discussion:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the real world, I'd settle for software that was released when 95% done. That's still way ahead of the curve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe a more realistic, usable definition would be, "It's 100% done when there are no more things to be done that are worth the cost of doing them"?
