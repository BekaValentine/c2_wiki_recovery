        Software Is Really Pointless
      </h1>
      <p>
        A lot of software is really pointless: it sucks, it crashes, it frustrates you with its endless mindless refusal to do what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More importantly, for a lot of software there never was, in the first place, a problem which it would solve, nor a need it would fulfill.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The bright side of this, of course, is that if you don't like it you can change it (if it's open source) or just write something better.

        Being a rather "sharp" programmer, I make sure all the software I develop has a "point". -- <a href="EdPoor.html">EdPoor</a>

        <em>I completely agree. I don't know a single person who uses software for anything, ever.</em>

        Used to be from <a href="EntropicLawOfComplexity.html">EntropicLawOfComplexity</a> but now it's lost its context. It wasn't as biting as it sounds. It was more of a depressing realization that most software is uninspiring and that I'm in this game for the theory of computing, not software engineering.

        After attempting response after response, I've finally realized why I can't express my deep dissatisfication with software. <em>Wiki is software.</em> Worse, it's <em>software about software.</em> It's just not the same as talking over beer. But hell, if I was drinking beer right now, I wouldn't care about software or <a href="GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem.html">GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem</a>. <a href="LifesJustTooShort.html">LifesJustTooShort</a>. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

I enjoy software. Pointless my bare bummie, what's the point of anything but to exercise your skills?

      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I still need revenue to do other things I enjoy. Your implied assumption is that I write software because I enjoy building accounting software. I'm in Theory of Computing (vs. say Software Engineering) for a reason. Much to do with GIT, in fact. However, this <em>pointless</em> kvetching aside, you may have noticed that I've taken a deep interest in methodologies. Perhaps this is because, since my motto is "I'm the only one responsible for making my life happen," I feel that I should change the stupid methods that I'm forced to endure. Of course, that won't fix the existing software that I have to deal with, like stupid crashing, mouse-exploding Linux. I aim for the day when I don't have to think, "well, I'll just rewrite that application so it works." (whoops, that <em>is</em> the point of Linux, isn't it?) --ss
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, part of the point of Linux is a reaction to the insane and dysfunctional state of most of the software industry today.

        Isn't software pointless in the same way that life is pointless, i.e. you feel some pain, some joy, some other things and then you die? -- <a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a>

        Life isn't pointless. Life is a struggle to build and grow and become better and happier. Software is a struggle to avoid sucking. There is no goal of goodness, just a goal of not sucking enough that someone will buy your crufty piece of junk. Or, more likely, invest in your newly IPOed vapourshares. Just look at Apple vs. Microsoft vs Amazon. --ss
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think all software is "a struggle to avoid sucking."  Maybe a large part of it is, but there are some projects that are about actually doing something useful for customers.  And a lot of the "suck" is relative.  Some developers aren't happy unless they're using all of the fancy, latest, bleeding-edge tools on a project, where other developers see every project as an opportunity to find better ways of accessing flat-files.  Somewhere in between is the happy medium of using exactly the right tool at exactly the right time, and delivering something useful in a reasonable amount of time.  No suck there, except for the developer who didn't get to use his shiny new "toys." --<a href="EvanCofsky.html">EvanCofsky</a>

        Speaking of <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a>, as you know by now that's my main attempt to make software that isn't pointless. But still, there's some self-congratulatory BS involved with building online communities. As if those are the real social issues of the world and I'm really doing something useful. But it's fun, so that's what matters right now. --ss

        More updates. Well, <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> is growing up and I think it's doing pretty well for itself in the <em>pointful</em> front. I'm also continuing my management training, as well as learning about sociology, psychology, cognetics, ergnomics, philosophy, etc. My new job, which is pretty cool, seems to put me exactly where I wanted to be. It certainly involves mapping technology onto people's lives and needs. Now, I just have to vanquish Java and I'd be happy. --ss

        I think more people would see the point in software if it actually applied to real life:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          if you could program your oven to turn on at certain times with your desktop.. 
        </li>
        <li>
          if you could reprogram your VCR to actually have settings that you want control of, and reprogram the access menu so it's easier to navigate
        </li>
        <li>
          if you could reprogram your breadmaker to come on 5 minutes longer rather than the built in hardware setting, 
        </li>
        <li>
          if you could program your lights outside to come on so you don't have to turn them on (actually you could do that with home automation, but everyone seems to just buy a hardware based timer solution), 
        </li>
        <li>
          if you could program your watch on your wrist to have the timer in front of the chronograph, since you used the timer more.. 
        </li>
        <li>
          if you could program the car to get mileage rather than power, when going on a road trip..(as opposed to buying some hardware based eprom chip, let alone if it's even available on your closed source car model) 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>(</em>HomeAutomation? DeviceAutomation?)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        All these above would apply to your real life objects that you use every day. Too much time is spent on virtual subjects in programming like buzzword technologies, programs that run virtual companies like banks, accounting firms, etc. You don't get to see the real direct affect that the software has on a real life object, so you go insanely virtually crazy.

        Users (the marketplace) have repeatedly indicted that overall they <strong>don't want to pay</strong> more for better software. It takes time and money to make good software, but consumers don't seem to want a price that reflects that.
