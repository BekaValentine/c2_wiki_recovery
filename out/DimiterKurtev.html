      <p>
        <a href="DimiterKurtev.html">DimiterKurtev</a> has been using emacs for over 15 years.  He still doesn't get it.
      </p>
      <p>
        He speaks fluent Smalltalk, C, C++ and Java. He has also been known to code PL/I, amongst others.

        Dimiter is currently having difficulty convincing his colleagues to use a Wiki.  He has hacked <a href="AwkiAwki.html">AwkiAwki</a> quite a bit.  He started off with the BruceHendersons version from <a href="http://81.86.193.194/cgi-bin/awki.cgi/CurrentDevelopment">http://81.86.193.194/cgi-bin/awki.cgi/CurrentDevelopment</a> as of beginning of February 2003.  His changes include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           no need for tabs for creating lists (MSIE6 can't do tabs in forms)
        </li>
        <li>
           # instead of 1 for numbered lists
        </li>
        <li>
           list levels are defined by the number of *s or #s
        </li>
        <li>
           possibility to name external links, syntax is [<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>]url
        </li>
        <li>
           bold text is declared with underscores, i.e. __this is bold__
        </li>
        <li>
           checksum checks of edited text to avoid concurrent editing
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>s are only links when in square brackets [] - very useful if trying to document code which uses a lot of <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           number of rows in the form is configurable
        </li>
        <li>
           edit form uses the whole width of the browser
        </li>
        <li>
           possibility to edit previous versions (i think this is possible in <a href="OliverTonnhofer.html">OliverTonnhofer</a>s code, but not in BruceHendersons version)
        </li>
        <li>
           ability to delete pages by changing the text to "delete" - does not delete the file in RCS (i.e. old revisions remain in the archive and may be resurrected by an admin)
        </li>
        <li>
           changes the RCS checkin user to the logged-in user on windows machines (by using nmblookup) - this info is also displayed on the info page
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        He has also written a simple script to generate a site map for TouchGraph on-the-fly (the output gets cached as well).
