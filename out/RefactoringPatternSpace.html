        Refactoring Pattern Space
      </h1>
      <p>
        A lot of patterns have been written.  Some are well-written, some are
        not.  There are many duplications.  Some are special cases of others, some
        overlap.  Patterns need to be reorganized.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't make sense to try to do it all at once.  Instead, a better idea
        is to take a set of related patterns and try to reorganize them.  Perhaps
        this will lead to <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several attempts to do this in progress at the moment. We would like to know of (and encourage) others.

        This page could be called <a href="RefactoringPatterns.html">RefactoringPatterns</a>, but that name was
        already taken to mean source code refactoring patterns.

        <em>Might a Topic Page work better? This way, the page does not have to be updated each a new page is created. Instead, tHe new page merely needs to reference something like </em>TopicPatternRefactoring<em>, or some such to be included in its listing.</em>
