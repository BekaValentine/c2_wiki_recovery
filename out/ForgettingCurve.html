        <em></em><a href="ForgettingCurve.html">ForgettingCurve</a><em>, a term coined by </em><a href="OliBye.html">OliBye</a> to describe the experience of getting used to <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>, and later <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, and so forgetting about source files. -- <a href="SteveFreeman.html">SteveFreeman</a>

        I'm glad to see I'm not the only one. I can't re-adjust properly to the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> source code / subdirectory game. I thought I was merely going mad; it's nice to see enough other people have experienced it to give it a name. ... the name should probably end with "... syndrome", though, as in "post-... syndrome". -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        The term <a href="ForgettingCurve.html">ForgettingCurve</a> immediately made sense to me, but in a different way: some things are hard to learn (steep learning curve), but once you gain a deeper understanding, easy to remember (e.g. some aspects of <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>); others are just as hard to learn, but more easily forgotten, because they are more arbitrary (<a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a>). -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>
