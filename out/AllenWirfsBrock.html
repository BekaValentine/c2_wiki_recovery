        Allen Wirfs Brock
      </h1>
      <p>
        ... more correctly, Allen Wirfs-Brock. (When Brock married Wirfs (<a href="RebeccaWirfsBrock.html">RebeccaWirfsBrock</a>), they considered adopting the name Brock-Wirfs, but chose an alternative that sounded less like a sausage.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementor of Tektronix <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>.  Left <a href="TektronixInc.html">TektronixInc</a> to found Instantiations, which was bought by Digitalk, which was bought by <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a>.  When he left <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a>, he bought back the name Instantiations, and now builds Java compilers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allen gave <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> his first Smalltalk system to play with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allen reconstituted his company, Instantiations, Inc., parent to Smalltalk Systems, Inc. (which has been given the rights to IBM's <a href="VisualAgeSmalltalk.html">VisualAgeSmalltalk</a> technology, rebranded VaSmalltalk).

        Something to be added about the Java portion of Instantiations bought by Google, open sourced, made part of GWT, etc.
