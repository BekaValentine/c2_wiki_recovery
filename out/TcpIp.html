        Compare with AlternativeProtocols such as <a href="AmoebaFlip.html">AmoebaFlip</a> and PlanNineIp. -- <a href="AluoNowu.html">AluoNowu</a>

        Interestingly (from <a href="ProofOfCorrectness.html">ProofOfCorrectness</a>): "A formal model of TCP/IP discovered bugs in the protocol, even though it has been in use for years!"

           I think <a href="AluoNowu.html">AluoNowu</a> was referring to the last line of the abstract in this paper: <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/nsdi04/tech/full_papers/musuvathi/musuvathi_html/main.html,">http://www.usenix.org/events/nsdi04/tech/full_papers/musuvathi/musuvathi_html/main.html,</a> which reads: <em>We have implemented these techniques in CMC, a C model checker [30] and applied the result to the Linux TCP/IP implementation, finding four errors in the protocol implementation.</em>  What bugs were there would surely by now have been fixed...
