        Wiki Art Critic
      </h1>

        <em>Doesn't there have to be </em><a href="WikiArt.html">WikiArt</a> before anyone can criticize it? Or do we use 'art' like 'text' in lit crit circles?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Um, it seems the </em><a href="WikiArtCritic.html">WikiArtCritic</a> has been created to appreciate brilliant discreations like Ward's contribution on <a href="BornOnTheFourthOfJuly.html">BornOnTheFourthOfJuly</a>.<em></em>

        What does the verb <em>to inconstantiate</em> mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's one of Joyce's </em><a href="PortmanteauWord.html">PortmanteauWord</a>s meaning something similar to "to abstract an enumeration". The word was recently rediscovered in a discarded draft of FinnegansWake. Borges used a similar verb in the Portugese translation of his immortal TlonUqbarOrbisTertius as the butt of a simile on the unbleached bones of Ottoman Turks.<em></em>
