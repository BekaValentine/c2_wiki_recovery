        Fake Industry Canon
      </h1>
      <p>
        (Begin Rant)
      </p>
      <p>
        Some claim there are industry "canons" without any evidence beyond anecdotes or cherry-picked citations. I'm growing tired of these <a href="FakeIndustryCanon.html">FakeIndustryCanon</a>s.  Establish canons with solid evidence and statistically valid samples (random) or don't imply a canon exists (beyond a "soft" anecdotal suggestion). Knock it off! --top
      </p>
      <p>
        (End Rant)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Out of context, this is reasonable.  Taken in its implied context, most of the canon you appear to consider fake seems to either be what introductory </em><a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> and <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> texts explain at length, or what is so foundational in those fields that it's taken as given.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then do a <strong>proper</strong> textual survey to show they universally say (and prove) one factor or concept is more important than another. It's not my job to prepare YOUR evidence for YOUR claims. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No one said any concept is more important than another.  However, some concepts are more recognised or established than others.  Some concepts are recognised by almost everyone in </em><a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> and <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>, and others appear to only be recognised by you.  If you were an authority in <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> or <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> -- like a Djikstra or Knuth, or even a Yourdon -- that might have some weight.  Given that you're not Djikstra, Knuth or Yourdon, your unique-to-you concepts have no weight.  Like the rest of us, if you want your new concepts to gain weight, you have to back them up with strong and compelling evidence.<em>  </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note, by the way, that Djikstra, Knuth, and even Yourdon became authorities in their respective fields by consistently backing up their ideas and concepts with strong and compelling evidence.  You could do the same.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They are topic titles. I don't see a problem. If you wish to classify topics into some kind of "official" versus "non-official", please see <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> topic-disclaimers-01 at <a href="NormalizationRepetitionAndFlexibility.html">NormalizationRepetitionAndFlexibility</a>. (<a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: move that section here?)
      </p>
      <p>
        And the rest is blatant <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> (or popularity per popularity of author).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How do you think they became authorities, so that you could even allege </em><a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>?  Why do we respect the writings of Knuth, but less so for the writings of Top?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Arguments should stand on their own merit and logic. I do my best to explain my reasoning. I don't do design suggestion X more than Y because because Dr. Foo said so, but rather because Dr. Foo explained <strong>WHY</strong> doing X matters more than Y. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do you think your best is good enough?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To you, no. Unfortunately, software engineering (SE) is mostly about <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, and <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> is still an infant science. Software is written for humans <strong>first</strong>, and machines secondly. This state of affairs isn't my doing, I'm just the messenger. The component on the human body that processes software is called "the brain". Therefore, if we want to optimize software for it's intended use/goal/target, then we must understand this component known as "the brain". -t
      </p>
      <p>
        You appear to <em>want</em> SE to be about math and machines, making the <a href="SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple.html">SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple</a> error. You value "solvability" over utility. It's my opinion that this is your key psychological point of error that leads to you optimize for factors that matter only a little to the end result. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        And note that academics tend to focus on easy-to-analyze factors over important-but-difficult-to-measure factors BECAUSE they are difficult to measure. If it's easier to study factor X over factor Y, then of course academics are going to study factor X more than factor Y. But that doesn't mean that factor X is more important. Thus, there is an <strong>inherent bias in academia</strong>. It's not a "fault" of people, but rather just the nature of the <strong>economics of science</strong> in that we milk the low hanging study fruit before the higher fruit. It's rational allocation of resources, but with the <strong>side-effect of measure bias</strong>. It's why we know more about rat biology than human biology; but that doesn't mean we consider rats more important. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the <strong>quantity of mention or study of a given topic is not necessarily proportional to its importance</strong>. A "book count" would thus not be a very good source of importance measure. --top

Sorry, I'm not going to kiss up just to "get along" with the academics. Their ideas don't get to cut in line. And I DO make logical arguments. Sometimes such logic will be based on my own observations of <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>/behavior, but that is acceptable evidence on this wiki.

        <em>There seems to be a fundamental difference with how some of us view "science" and "evidence". Software has an </em>'"evidence problem"<strong>, and I'm not the first to point this out.

      </p>
      <p>
        {Curiously, I find it difficult to discern what your view is on "science" and "evidence".  In some contexts you appear to demand evidence beyond the norm, and in others you find it acceptable to provide no evidence at all.  What it appears is that you want agreement with your opinions, but don't want to work to get it.}
      </p>
      <p>
        First poster speaking: I'm completely fine with what Top said here. Software development isn't math; it's a soft science like anthropology, history, or military tactics. Haskell tries to turn software development into math, but it has to jump through some pretty complicated hoops to get there; and speaking personally, I've found my knowledge of <a href="MrAristotle.html">MrAristotle</a>, NaturalPhilosophy, and RomanCatholic theology infinitely more useful in programming than my knowledge of advanced math (although algebra -- semi-advanced math -- is absolutely indispensible). I think it's better to live with the soft-science situation than to be consumed with <a href="DisciplineEnvy.html">DisciplineEnvy</a>; and I endorse the idea that a given programmer should use the paradigm that he's most comfortable with, which seems to be the main thing Top's saying. I'd add, of course, that self-improvement and engaging with new challenges are important -- but that doesn't mean that everyone has to drop everything and learn Lisp. You can only learn what you already almost know (that's a wiki page, right?) -- evolutionary improvement, like C to C++, C++ to Java and Python, Python to Ruby, C++ to C++11, is probably more useful than attempts to change one's way of thinking all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Software development isn't math, but it isn't a soft science either.  It's a craft, like making furniture.  What Top appears to want from us are studies that prove screws are better than nails, whilst we should take his word for it that typical carpenters are confused by lathes.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Re: "the idea that a given programmer should use the paradigm that he's most comfortable with, which seems to be the main thing Top's saying" -- Not quite. Ideally we'd have productivity studies to decide what technique is more productive in team environments (or at least shared code). But since those are not practical to obtain, team preference is probably the NEXT best approximation/proxy/consolation factor (see </em><a href="ProxyFactor.html">ProxyFactor</a>). <strong>We generally agree on what an "ideal" study would look like, but the hard part is agreeing on how to score the messier alternatives to ideal studies. -t</strong> <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Re: "What Top appears to want from us are studies that prove screws are better than nails" -- What are you referring too? Don't we ALL want studies that demonstrate if one IT tool is better than another? But since we are not likely to get such studies, we need proxy (consolation) studies and analysis instead. Some of this will result in relying on weaker forms of evidence, such as personal anecdotes about coder behavior. -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Re: "whilst we should take his word for it that typical carpenters are confused by lathes." -- No, that is flat wrong. See </em><a href="LetReaderDecideEvidenceAgreement.html">LetReaderDecideEvidenceAgreement</a>. The quality of results is obviously affected by carpenter skill level factor and it's unrealistic to assume infinite or elite skills from average carpenters. You seem to want to set the default skill level assumption at an unrealistic level. Why should we take YOUR word for it that a high skill level should be the default assumption? <strong>You are in the same boat</strong>, Bub. I vote to let the reader decide which profile claim fit's their OWN shop rather than keep bickering over whose profile is "right". YOU cannot let it go.  -t<em></em>

      <p>
        I didn't see any reason to get quite that angry in response to that comment -- but then, I'm not a regular. Letting the reader decide seems reasonable, not least since different tools will cut with or against the grain on different tasks. (Haskell, for example, is not a good language in which to write a <strike>word processor</strike> %thing_which_should_not_be_written_in_Haskell%.)

           [Have you tried writing a word processor in Haskell?  If I had to write a word processor, starting today, I'd write it in Haskell.]

           What would you say should not be written in Haskell?

           [I probably wouldn't write an operating system kernel or device driver in Haskell.  It isn't really designed for low-level systems programming.  However, anything that can be done in a conventional, imperative, application development language like Java or C# can be done in Haskell. <some time passes; some reading is done>  On the other hand, I might change my mind.

           I vividly remember someone attempting to implement Pac-Man in Haskell in 2011; a month and four densely-reasoned webpages later, he had a more or less functional game, but it was very brittle and not very extensible, and he admitted that this could be done in C in a couple of days. Has Haskell become any more suitable for games -- especially games with a bit more heft to them than Pac-Man -- in years since? (I will candidly admit, I hope it hasn't. I neither like nor trust that language, given how fond it is of higher math and opaque terminology, and I'm very alarmed by how much prestige it commands these days. I hope that niches, at least, will persist where other languages can flourish.)

        Bracket-posting respondant, good point on software as craft. Some soft sciences are unprovable or have intractable problems collecting data, or are oriented towards moving targets; others are testable but not reducable to physics (linguistics, for example); but software isn't either, since with software the odd thing is that wildly different methodologies can produce equally good or bad results.
