        <strong>How can we Facilitate Boss Buy-in?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I was managing one team in a non-XP shop. Now I am the 'Program 
        Manager' for the department (24 developers). As the guy in charge 
        of process and schedules, I'm looking to move towards XP.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, my boss (a great guy, by the way) is highly skeptical. He 
        and I have had a few great dialogs so far, and we're both really 
        open-minded and win-win oriented, so I'm feeling ok.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tonight, I mentioned the metaphor of trying to plan your drive home 
        before you start, down to the last swerve. He countered with the 
        example of trying to drive off-road from Denver to LA, without having 
        a map of the entire route, and finding yourself at the rim of the 
        Grand Canyon, wondering how to get your Jeep across. Sharp guy. 
        (My response was asking if there really are any such canyons in 
        software development. He thinks there are. I don't.)
      </p>
      <p>
        --<a href="KevinSmith.html">KevinSmith</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are.  When you encounter them, you drive parallel to the rim until you
        find a way across.  That's what happens when you start roaming through
        uncharted territory.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if you happen to have a very detailed map of the land between here and
        your destination, and you see the canyon on the map, then you can avoid it.
        But what software project has such a map?  Does your boss think that the map
        should be created?  Does that mean hes willing to launch a bunch of recon
        satellites to find the canyons?  Or does he want to send an army of
        surveyors accross the land finding all the possible pitfalls?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are canyons.  That's part of the risk.  On the other hand, it's only a
        drive of a day or two to get past them.  No need to launch a satellite
        system.

        Start small.  Change the process only when it starts to break.  You don't
        want to be using a 50 man process for 5 people.

        Show him the XP vs RUP paper in the 'publications' section of
        <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com.">http://www.objectmentor.com.</a>  This papers shows how XP *is* a very light
        RUP.  Tell him that this paper is precursor to papers that will be appearing
        on the next release of the RUP CD.   
      </p>
      <p>
        As for inexperienced developers.  XP does not allow *anyone* to go wild.  XP
        is far more disciplined than RUP is.  Indeed, it is much easier to go wild
        with RUP (wild writing lots of useless documents) than it is to go wild in
        XP.

      <p>
        Scalability is a problem period.  Any process suitable for a small team is
        not suitable for a large team.  There are no exceptions.  If you start with
        light RUP (which might as well be XP) you will eventually outgrow it.
        Choosing XP as a starting point is not liability with respect to scale.

      </code>
      <p>
        There is one team that I know of that is doing just that.  The jury is still
        out.

      </code>
      <p>
        Newbies need guidance in *any* process.  XP offers the best possible form of
        guidance -- pair programming.  No process can protect you from newbies doing
        stupid things.  Only your experienced engineers can do that.

        Processes don't scale up, but don't forget that process don't scale down either. A process that's good for fifty is not going to work well for five. In my view scalability isn't something you want from a software process. Anything that's scalable is either going to be so loose or require so much configuring (for me, that's RUP's problem) that it ends up not helping.

      <p>
        Compare the following statements:
      </p>
      <p>
        We can't scale XP to 24 programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        and
      </p>
      <p>
        We haven't scaled XP to 24 programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are certainly XP teams out there with 24+ programmers. It may work
        just fine. I would look to SCRUM for ideas of how.

        Many managers have scars of old battles, in which a very quiet set of cubes
        idly pursued a heavy methodology to ruin, misreading its literature to
        elicit <a href="IntegrationHell.html">IntegrationHell</a>, and with no peer review because "we don't have time for that". _This_ was programmers going wild, all the time not talking to each other, and obeying the paperwork of today's attempt at a
        spiral.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers in a steady but verbal, and fully collaborative, enterprise cannot keep secrets, including how smoothly code is incrementally getting better.

      </p>
      <p>
        The issue is not whether it works, but whether a metric of how well it works
        feeds-back successfully & quickly. Management is expected to help in
        authoring and running the <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s. These will tell.
