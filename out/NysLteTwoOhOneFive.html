        It will exist in at least two versions - I am running it using <a href="WindowsSeven.html">WindowsSeven</a> :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           simplified - one information space - this one will be free software, <a href="PublicDomain.html">PublicDomain</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           extensible - last half of 2015 - with hundreds of information spaces and utilizing Artifactories - beta testing edition (limited number of testers)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first test of the free version will be made available, and should be easily installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information on a General Download location (from one of my web sites) will be found shortly after the 31st of January 2015.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you would like to try out the test version to be released, and will give me feed-back on your experience, let me know so I can make a short-list, and prepare a personal package for you to use, in Early January 2015. <a href="mailto:dnoyes@stumail.jccc.edu">mailto:dnoyes@stumail.jccc.edu</a> with Subject line: "Request for Test Version NysLte2015"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After the shortlist is prepared (Dec 27- De 30), I will email you a package which will work on Windows Seven (This is my first attempt at releasing some of my own software for use by others, so it may not work at your location, if not tell me. Initially I will release about one dozen packages. (to enable me to properly communicate with the first dozen verified testers.
