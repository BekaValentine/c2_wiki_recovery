        <em>The sum total of your changes still amounts to a lot of changes.  Therefore, this pattern </em>does not<em> reduce the chances for conflicts.  The </em>'real value<strong> of this pattern, however, is precisely what </strong><a href="JonTirsen.html">JonTirsen</a> wrote above -- it makes it easy to <em>find</em> conflicts.
