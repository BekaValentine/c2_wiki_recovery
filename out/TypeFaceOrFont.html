        Type Face Or Font
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've often heard people say things like, "I think you should use the Garamond font on that paper.".
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an incorrect way to say this.  A font is a specific <a href="TypeFace.html">TypeFace</a>, in a specific size.  So to say "use Garamond" is to tell the person what <a href="TypeFace.html">TypeFace</a> to use, but to say "use 12pt Garamond Bold Italic" is to tell them what font to use. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, there are umpteen different typefaces called "Garamond" by their vendors, so to say "use Garamond" doesn't necessarily define what typeface is intended...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        True.  I was trying to simplify matters a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        {But most people know what you mean when you say "font" even if it's not technically correct. It's a trade-off between successful communication and technical accuracy.}

        And why are the "ends" of capital-I considered serifs? This makes it look like a lower-case "L" in a san-serif type-face. The ends of the "I" are no more serifs than the bar at the top of "T". They are a fundamental shape of the character, not a mere swoosh decoration. Somebody didn't think this through. It causes lots of typo bugs.
