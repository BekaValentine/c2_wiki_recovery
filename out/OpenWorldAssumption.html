        Open World Assumption
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the <a href="OpenWorldAssumption.html">OpenWorldAssumption</a>; any proposition or theorem which cannot be derived from the facts and axioms present in the system is held to be <em>unknown</em>.  Things which are known to be true or false must be stated explicitly, or else inferrable from facts and axioms.  Contrast with the <a href="ClosedWorldAssumption.html">ClosedWorldAssumption</a>, which holds that all which cannot be proven true is false.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="OpenWorldAssumption.html">OpenWorldAssumption</a> more clearly models reality...however it severely complicates things.  The two boolean values (true and false) are inadequate, and we have to use <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a>.  Universal quantifiers are much harder to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ClosedWorldAssumption.html">ClosedWorldAssumption</a> is more commonly used.

        Another way of looking at this is that the otherwise excluded middle must be handled by software one way or another. One way is to make it a value with a meaning such as "unknown". The other obvious alternative is for it to be reflected not in the algorithm's data, but instead in its control paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, perhaps if the value is not known, an exception is thrown, or an if-then-else carefully avoids using the variable that contains the value, etc.
