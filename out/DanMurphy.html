        On a mission to improve software development by simplifying design methodologies and coding techniques.  We have gone too far and must turn back.  I long for the days of BASIC and my TI-99.  I think it is crucial that we make programming more natural and less complex.  There is a belief that with additional complexitiy we can create a more user friendly universe.  This is the same thought process that managers use to justify adding more people to a failing project to try to "Fix It".  It seems so obvious, but it is the anti-solution.
