        Continuous Query Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ContinuousQueryLanguage.html">ContinuousQueryLanguage</a> (CQL) is an SQL based language for maintaining continuous queries over long periods. Such queries are suitable for real-time and reactive programs - those where keeping an up-to-date view and latency are important (such as collaborative editing, traffic or safety or security monitoring, command and control, robotics). The original CQL was developed at Stanford between 2002-2006 as part of a project named 'STREAM'; that implementation is now available under the BSD license. In 2007, <a href="OracleCorporation.html">OracleCorporation</a> introduced 'Oracle <a href="ContinuousQueryLanguage.html">ContinuousQueryLanguage</a>', also abbreviated CQL, as part of its <a href="ComplexEventProcessing.html">ComplexEventProcessing</a> (CEP) framework and application server. This language varies from Stanford's but serves a similar role and purpose.
