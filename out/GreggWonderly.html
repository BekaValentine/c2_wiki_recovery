        <a href="GreggWonderly.html">GreggWonderly</a> went to college at OklahomaStateUniversity. Got a masters in CS with <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a> and <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>s as his emphasis. He currently works for Cyte Technologies Inc., <a href="http://www.cytetech.com,">http://www.cytetech.com,</a> located in Tulsa Oklahoma. Cyte Technologies Inc. builds DataGathering software systems using some core technologies based on Java and XML.

        Gregg used to work at Lucent Technologies Inc., <a href="http://www.lucent.com,">http://www.lucent.com,</a> where he had some associations with <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> through various work projects. While at Lucent, he worked on developing and deploying <a href="PatternsRelatedToFailureRecovery.html">PatternsRelatedToFailureRecovery</a> of complex procedures in fault tolerant systems.

        From 1997 to now (2007), I have been a <a href="JavaOnly.html">JavaOnly</a> programmer. I have seen the light, and  really will never look back (<a href="http://wonderly.org/gregg/java/why.html).">http://wonderly.org/gregg/java/why.html).</a> The <a href="JavaPlatform.html">JavaPlatform</a> provides a very powerful solution space. I know that many <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> programmers are just nuts over Java's lack of many C++ features (see <a href="JavaVsCpp.html">JavaVsCpp</a>) and I can only suggest that these developers are perhaps focused on a <a href="DifferentModeOfSolution.html">DifferentModeOfSolution</a>, that is likely not going to allow them to appreciate Java.

        <a href="EmbeddedJavaSystems.html">EmbeddedJavaSystems</a> are finally becoming a reality with the awesome power of the aJile (<a href="http://www.ajile.com)">http://www.ajile.com)</a> aJ100 microcontroller. This devices executes bytecodes directly, and can do thread context switches in a single instruction time that is less than 1 micro second (around 800 nanoseconds)!
