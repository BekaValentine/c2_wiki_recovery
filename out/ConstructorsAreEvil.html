        Constructors are overloaded anonymous methods. It's impossible to neatly make two constructors that take one string and have that string mean something different to each.
      </p>
      <p>
        I say: banish constructors from <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> and instead declare methods to be <strong>static</strong>, <strong>instance</strong> <em>(the default)</em>, or <strong>new</strong>. They don't even need to return <strong>this</strong> - e.g. a "constructor" that makes a new instance and adds it to a pool.

        Make a factory if you don't like it. Constructors are very simple. Why do you want to make it more complicated? And if you want to make the constructor polymorphic then make a real class. Quit using strings everywhere.

        <em>I want to reinforce that point about the factory.  Most constructors end up needing only a few options for a new() signature, in which case, the constructor is great.

        <strong>Why is it beneficial to separate object allocation and object initialization?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming from the world of <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> where there are no constructors, I found having a method combine memory allocation for an object with initialization of the object a significant benefit. Constructors help (but they are not perfect) avoid having a window where operations on an object cannot be called.  I am not certain I understand the complaint above, and constructors are not perfect, but they are definitely a step in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is beneficial to separate object allocation and object initialization because you don't always want to allocate objects of a particular class in the same way.  In C++, for example, you nearly always have the choice of stack based or heap based allocation.  If you are working with shared memory, you may wish to allocate objects at a specific address using </em>PlacementNew.<em></em>

        Constructors are totally evil (see <a href="NewConsideredHarmful.html">NewConsideredHarmful</a>). I'm an OO guru; that means I'm an expert, not that I like it. You've got to know OO pretty damn well to really know the problems and limitations. You also need to know it in many languages, so you can distinguish language issues from those inherent to the design. (Same is true for any paradigm, I suspect. I imagine that much paradigm zealotry comes from those least experienced. The rest comes from people like you, who knows the value of a paradigm and sad to see it trampled beneath the feet of the ignorant. Unfortunately, you don't know the other paradigms well enough to make a proper argument about their limits.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: "constructors are totally evil" - <em>Well, that's an interesting generalization. I can see we are getting into philosophical issues beyond just GUI's. I'll have to ponder that one. I'm suprised nobody else challenged that one much. But there is something smelly about a bunch of routines with names like "initialize_and_display_foo()" or "update_and_display_foo()". If you see variations of "initialize_and_X" over and over, it implies an abstraction is needed, and constructors seem like the appropriate abstraction. -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are plenty of other abstractions available. Consider load = function(X) { show X; X.init(); }. Now you can use "load(X)" and "load(foo)", and you still aren't <em>implicitly</em> executing side-effects as a mere consequence of display-state (minimized vs. maximized, for example).
      </p>
      <p>
        And the problems with constructors are that: (1) they hurt the GOD RAM illusion of having all objects in memory all the time, (2) which in turn hurts <a href="OrthogonalPersistence.html">OrthogonalPersistence</a> and <a href="TransparentDistribution.html">TransparentDistribution</a>... and automatic redundancy, duplication for locality of stateless objects, and a ton of other features. (3) They tend to execute while the object-configuration - or even the object - is still only half-defined. This hurts composition of objects... their constructors all need to be defined just right for them to compose. (4) There are gravely serious problems with cyclic references (e.g. for mutual interdependence) at construction time that take <a href="SelfDiscipline.html">SelfDiscipline</a> to avoid. (5) They harm optimizations! I.e. if you were writing an <strong>object configuration</strong> language, the use of constructors would make it extremely difficult to remove dead-code based on an object-reachability-graph; you'd also need to analyze for confinement of side-effects, which is much more difficult. (6) They are not abstract. (But see <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a>.) (7) The basic idea behind a constructor is to build the objects/data inside another one, which implies 'ownership' of that data and does not readily scale or compose.

           [<em>I'm not sure I follow your argument here.  I'll start with the first point, that constructors hurt the GOD RAM illusion.  What exactly about constructors is incompatible with </em><a href="GodRam.html">GodRam</a>?<em>]</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           They aren't incompatible with GOD RAM. They are, however, incompatible with the GOD RAM <strong>illusion</strong>. The problem is that real RAM isn't infinite, relocatable, persistent, capability-secure, robust against crash failures, uniformly high performance, and global. GOD RAM is. We use idioms to construct elaborate illusions around our normal RAM to make it look and feel more like GOD RAM. Examples: (a) instead of a Singleton simply being a plain-old-reference to an object in a global address space, we use <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> to provide such a representation in a local address space. (b) we use complex caching schemes to make objects appear closer and more accessible than they really are, (c) persistence patterns and serialization are used for redundancy and 'transfer' of objects. The use of constructors hurts because they 'fire' each time an object is duplicated, moved, regenerated, shared, represented in a local address space, etc.. GOD RAM mandates they would fire at most once, regardless. (Use of constructors still has problems (3)-(7) even in GOD RAM).
        </li>
        <li>
           [<em>When I referred to </em><a href="GodRam.html">GodRam</a>, I was already referring to it's illusion.  Anyway, constructors shouldn't fire when objects are moved, regenerated, shared, represented in a local address space, etc.  None of those acts are construction, so in an ideal language a constructor wouldn't be used (in spite of the current state of some popular languages).  Duplication may or may not be an act of construction depending on whether the duplicate is intended as a cache or snapshot (where the duplicate is still intended to be the original object), or cloning (where the duplicate is intended to be a new object).  If all those spurious constructor calls were removed, would there still be a problem?<em>]</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           If all of those spurious calls were removed (not a trivial task), you'd still have problems (3)-(7). But the GOD RAM issues would be gone and OO would be improved for it.

        When a feature makes you fight the language to get other features, that's a <a href="LanguageSmell.html">LanguageSmell</a>. (on-display events have this same smell... but even worse due to composition and sharing issues.)

      <p>
        <em>But there is a "confusion spike" in that sometimes you can just open the form/window and other times you have to call a subroutine before-hand to refresh stuff. It's usually better mental abstraction (</em><a href="MentalIndexability.html">MentalIndexability</a>) to always just open the form and let it "handle itself". Otherwise, you have to concern yourself with the details of how its opened. Further, it reduces the chance that the form will be opened without remembering to initialize. Without your approach, one has to "just remember" to always open the form via the subroutine. With your approach, the guts are on the outside of the body. Optimization is a secondary concern to helping developers think clearer and avoid forgetfulness-related mistakes. -t<em></em>

        If you wished to abstract the definition of X to the point that 'show X' always executes 'X.on_display()', just like it abstracts other details (like rendering), that would still not involve on-display operations. In particular, 'show X' commands are always explicitly provided in some other input handlers. You would always be able to trace the call of 'X.on_display()' back to an original source user or server. This is different from true on-display <strong>events</strong>, which trace to a third party: the browser.

        <li>
           I do not see how psychology is involved here. There is a technical difference.

I believe you're making an appeal to your ignorance, or even confabulating a justification for it.

        </li>
        <li>
           Yes, taking away choice and control, so that you don't need to make any decisions, may make things easier for you... in general. Though, fundamentally, you're always free to use a procedure that takes away the arguments. No need for control, right? Anyhow, like I said (below), the problem you are describing is fundamental to <a href="ProceduralProgramming.html">ProceduralProgramming</a> - which is based around the idea of saying <em>how</em> to do things in terms of sequential steps and parallel behaviors. There are many non-procedural designs where you don't need to think about the processing necessary for initialization, that completely eschew the issue of on-display events, and that provide many advantages for continuous update, shared access, and robustness to network disruption. You're just unfamiliar with them.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Perhaps, perhaps not, but there's nothing wrong with on-display events, so there's no reason to go paradigm shopping. And it's not "taking away control". It can be done differently if needed.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Sigh. There's nothing wrong with a <a href="TuringTarpit.html">TuringTarpit</a>, so there's no reason to go paradigm shopping. And of course you're taking away control. If I write widget X using on-display events to refresh it, and you want to use it, you don't have any choice but to also use its on-display event. You can't separate the concerns of opening it and refreshing it. The only time you're not taking away control is if you're willing to rewrite a library from scratch. That's the nature of an appeal to a <a href="TuringTarpit.html">TuringTarpit</a>.

        <li>
           <em>That's a "problem" with *any* black-box abstraction. Generally if we want to add a choice (feature) that didn't exist before, we'd use some kind of optional parameter with a default to the old behavior so that we don't break existing calls.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Now that isn't true. There are black-box abstractions that make certain promises... e.g. "this is a black-box abstraction that has no <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s, is referentially transparent, and is guaranteed to terminate". Those guarantees offer programmers a huge amount of control over the nature of composed behaviors even when each behavior is a black-box, and merely offering a choice <strong>is incapable</strong> of offering these sorts of features. Being <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>, <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s, On-display events for GUIs, etc. are among the so-called 'features' that kick controlled composition right in the nuts.

           Black-box abstractions with documented limitations, assumptions, and rules-to-be-followed are common to libraries, frameworks, and protocols even when they are not enforced by the language. And to which non-mainstream paradigms do you refer?

           <em>I'm against those also, but weighed in using a balanced way with all the other avoid-X factors (</em><a href="WaterbedTheory.html">WaterbedTheory</a>). Let me ask you this: suppose the shop manager mandated that we use only SQL-RDBMS, OOP, and procedural("SOP") for all shop projects. Could you objectively "prove" your suggestion is net better than mine (constructors) sticking to SOP? Or, does the improvement require the other paradigms/frameworks you mentioned?<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Whether I could "prove" the suggestion is "net better" depends on how you define "better". If you define "better" as "easier to implement without introducing infrastructure while keeping my hands tied to satisfy language and framework constraints introduced by my shop manager for no technical reason whatsoever", then no, I probably could not prove it better. But if you define "better" as "able to achieve more features among <a href="CrossCuttingConcern.html">CrossCuttingConcern</a>s including such things as performance, safety, security, persistence, distribution, concurrency, consistency, scalability, disruption tolerance, determinism, and termination" then, yes, I believe it will objectively prove "better" to eschew constructor events. (One would need to replace it, though. With my hands tied by your pointless <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> "rules" restricting me to OOP/Procedural/Relational, I would probably replace constructors with a three-phase OOP/Procedural behavior: allocate then link then init().) Also, since it seems you've since confused the point, the mentions of the <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a> and <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a> apply as alternatives to on-display events, not constructor events.

           <em>It is </em>'not<em>' unrealistic for a shop put limits on style. Thus, I object to your derogatory labeling of it. Peers and managers grow uncomfortable if you use styles or tools that deviate too far from the norm of the shop. There are formal standards and informal (unspoken) standards for every shop. I've gotten the "evil eye" for violating them multiple places before. I shape up and stay with the conventions if I want my paycheck. (Sometimes it's good the other way, like the time it stopped the Mad XML Hatter from XML-tizing everything and everyone.)</em> 
        </li>
        <li>
           People, including managers, often do things that deserve severe derision. The basis for your objection seems logically equivalent to saying: "murder and rape are <strong>not</strong> unrealistic, thus I object to derogatory labeling of them." To me, that seems irrational. 
        </li>
        <li>
           There are valid business reasons to use existing tools (because they're "existing" and "proven"), but the fact is that doesn't apply in this case: other approaches are also existing and also proven, and in a sane IT shop one could take other proven technologies to the manager and make a case for adapting them rather than moping about and living with pointless challenges because you're afraid of getting the "evil eye". If the manager can make a good case in return, then so be it, but a blanket mandate "for all shop projects" as you suggested indicates only a lack of competence on his part. Your unwillingness to confront the manager indicates a lack of professional competence on yours.

        <li>
           No... it is pretty darn common in the GUI world to eschew <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s on-display. You certainly won't find scene-graph languages or a <a href="ZoomableUserInterface.html">ZoomableUserInterface</a> like Microsoft Seadragon using them. OpenGL is procedurally specified but functional under-the-hood. When it comes to constructors, a quick overview would reveal some similar things: systems that support object-graphs (e.g <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a> languages, Unix <a href="PipesAndFilters.html">PipesAndFilters</a>) invariably have ways to restrict side-effects from touching other parts of the graph before everything is allocated and linked (basically alloc->link->init pattern) and often drop the 'init' phase since it still hurts optimizations. <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a> and <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a> are extremely common in GUI systems (Nuke, ICE, Max, and many more). Your ignorance of the GUI world and the reasons behind various design decisions is not my fault.

           It is true that constructors aren't the only failing of modern languages. To suggest otherwise would be ridiculous. But, while I do aim to achieve a design without those failings, the case made on this page is <a href="ConstructorsAreEvil.html">ConstructorsAreEvil</a> mixed with a bit of <a href="OnDisplayEventsConsideredHarmful.html">OnDisplayEventsConsideredHarmful</a> (only because the latter topic did not exist when content was moved here by someone). And your other statements are simply untrue: I have not been promoting any particular "pet tools", I have provided a relatively simple alternative to constructors (alloc->link->init) and other alternatives are readily available on this <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>, and "symptom-of-a-bad-paradigm" is unreasonable because <strong>contructors are not an accepted part of ANY paradigm</strong>. Even though <a href="NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs.html">NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs</a>, you won't find "constructors" among any of the popular proposed definitions.

        <li>
           It's nice to know just how low your acceptability standards go. I feel sorry for your clients. Anyhow, merely trading constructors for the simplest alternatives only gives you the <em>potential</em> to become better, without being any worse. It allows you to add various other features currently made challenging by dependency upon constructors and the potential for <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s from them. (Such features include: orthogonal persistence, transparent redundancy and distribution, copying <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>, application configuration languages, safe cyclic object-graphs, dead-code elimination, high-performance object-slab allocations.) You seem to want a dramatic, in-your-face 'evil' that is clear even when you aren't interested in noticing. This is more of a "pouring wine from a led pitcher" evil. It poisons and taints languages and projects in non-obvious ways, diminishing their maximum potential for brilliance.

           I don't really feel like indulging your naive whims, especially if it's because you're unwilling or unable to confront the logic presented. Anyhow, I think I'll leave off this conversation until someone to whom the constructor issues <em>actually matter</em> is interested. It isn't as though constructors will kill kittens, after all. They'll only kill your project in the long-term.

        And if your objection is that people are abstracting and concerning themselves with details of <em>how</em> things occur, then the real problem you're complaining about is the use of <a href="ProceduralProgramming.html">ProceduralProgramming</a>. Consider a more declarative or rules-driven approach, perhaps <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a> or <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a>. Having a display that continuously updates based on changing external data based entirely upon a declarative description of the data-source requires even less concern for 'how' a display is opened and 'how' it maintains itself.

      <p>
        Please note that I didn't exactly read the whole discussion, but I do agree somewhat with the sentiment at the top of the page.  I think that this might be the reason the original poster thought that "new" methods would be a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, the problem with constructors is that they are necessary.  You need to write a ctor to initialize a class.
      </p>
      <code>
        class Obj {<br/>
        public final String foo;<br/>
        public final String bar;<br/>
        public final String baz;<br/>
        private Obj(String foo, String bar, String baz) {<br/>
        this.foo = foo; this.bar = bar; this.baz = baz;<br/>
        }<br/>
        public static Obj withFooAndBar(String foo, String bar) { // In Objective-C, this would be withFoo: andBar:.  I'm trying to emulate that.<br/>
        return new Obj(foo, bar, null);<br/>
        }<br/>
        public static Obj withFooAndBaz(String foo, String baz) {<br/>
        return new Obj(foo, null, bar);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Whereas with the proposed syntax, one could do this, instead:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Obj {<br/>
        public final String foo;<br/>
        public final String bar;<br/>
        public final String baz;<br/>
        public new withFooAndBar(String foo, String bar) {<br/>
        this.foo = foo; this.bar = bar; this.baz = null;<br/>
        }<br/>
        public new withFooAndBaz(String foo, String baz) {<br/>
        this.foo = foo; this.bar = null; this.baz = baz;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Ironically, this syntax creates more typing, which I'm sure the original poster did not intend.  It does, however, make all initializer functions use the same syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some languages which do this sort of thing easily are:
      </p>
      <code>
        //Scala.<br/>
        class Obj private (foo : String, bar : String, baz : String) // Never mind the fact that if bar and baz were mutually exclusive, a guru Scalite would use Either[String, String]<br/>
        object Obj {<br/>
        def withFooAndBar(foo : String, bar : String) = new Obj(foo, bar, null)<br/>
        def withFooAndBaz(foo : String, baz : String) = new Obj(foo, null, baz)<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In <a href="ScalaLanguage.html">ScalaLanguage</a>, you write the constructor as arguments to the class, with a private designation if need be.  The params then become member vals.  Because of some special rules in Scala, <em>all</em> construction of objects <em>must</em> be done through constructors written in this way.  (You can write more constructors, but the last thing all constructors must do is call the original constructor.)
      </p>
      <code>
        # Perl Six.<br/>
        use v6;<br/>
        class Obj {<br/>
        has $.foo, $.bar, $.baz;<br/>
        method new(*@_, *%_) { die "Cannot instantiate Obj through new." }<br/>
        method withFooAndBar($foo, $bar) {<br/>
        bless *, :$foo, :$bar; # Bless works with all classes.  :$foo is short for :foo($foo), which in this case means "initialize member variable foo to $foo.<br/>
        }<br/>
        method withFooAndBaz($foo, $baz) {<br/>
        bless *, :$foo, :$baz;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        As you can see, neither approach actually forces you to write a constructor, although one makes you write its signature--and that one actually saves you time, as you would have written out the member variables anyway, right?
