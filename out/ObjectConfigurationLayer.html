        Object Configuration Layer
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="ObjectConfigurationLayer.html">ObjectConfigurationLayer</a> is a means of declaratively composing multiple objects and linking them together. There are many techniques for this, especially common to <a href="GraphicalProgrammingLanguage.html">GraphicalProgrammingLanguage</a> and <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a>. The <a href="ObjectConfigurationLayer.html">ObjectConfigurationLayer</a> in many popular OO languages is conspicuously absent, often requiring patterns like <a href="SetterInjection.html">SetterInjection</a> and complex frameworks for <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> or <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a> to resolve for larger projects. For smaller projects, one procedurally (and painfully) hooks objects together, possibly following a discipline like <a href="ObserverPattern.html">ObserverPattern</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the absence of an <a href="ObjectConfigurationLayer.html">ObjectConfigurationLayer</a>, OO provides the primitives (objects) but NOT the means of composition. (see <a href="PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition.html">PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition</a> for details). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Development of an <a href="ObjectConfigurationLayer.html">ObjectConfigurationLayer</a> is hindered by use of constructors-with-<a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s (which might try talking to other objects while only half-finished), and hindered by the stack-based messaging semantics (asynchronous messaging is far more amenable to large, possibly cyclic, configurations and <a href="ObserverPattern.html">ObserverPattern</a>s). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The "data ownership" common to OO designs is problematic, as it forces 'classes' to serve triple-duty as configuration, data-manager, and capability. OO languages are much more flexible when they're free to override any 'slot' - i.e. changing the state slots so the object represents a view of another system - without any changes to the programmer interface to access the object. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AlanKayOnMessaging.html">AlanKayOnMessaging</a> suggests a focus on the 'ma' or 'interstitial' areas between objects. I imagine the sort of configuration and plumbing necessary to configure objects would qualify.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, use of objects for "data management" is a serious <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>. Consider <a href="TellDontAsk.html">TellDontAsk</a> or <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> to be rules advising in essence: if correctness of code depends on the structure of another object, that's a bad thing. Data shouldn't be managed as object structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only good reason to manage data as object-structure is the engineering reason: that it's the least evil thing you can do in the language and still accomplish your goals (i.e. it is often needed to do <a href="LockFreeSynchronization.html">LockFreeSynchronization</a>). Just because that's a good reason doesn't mean the need to apply that reason is a good thing, though.
