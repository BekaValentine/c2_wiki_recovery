        Test Case Object
      </h1>
      <p>
        Several patterns where a test case is a class or object,
        or a method of another class or object
        (which is typically bound to create a freestanding object).
      </p>
      <p>
        The test jig may be inherited by the test case object,
        or bound to a test case method.

        PRO: objects are good, allow flexibility
      </p>
      <p>
        CON: imposes requirements on the environment that may be hard to meet for a simple library package being included in other prorams with different test frameworks.
