        Dual Typing Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Typically <a href="AlgolFamily.html">AlgolFamily</a>-style languages are divided into two camps: static or "strict" typing, and "dynamic" typing. But why can't a language have <em>both</em> features? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I believe <a href="ItsTimeToDumpCeeSyntax.html">ItsTimeToDumpCeeSyntax</a>, I'll assume a C-like/<a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>-like style here for examples to make them familiar. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If one does not supply an explicit type, it would act like a dynamic variable (called type "object" or "variant" in some languages):
      </p>
      <code>
        function foo(x, int y) { // x is dynamic, y is static<br/>
        var a;   // dynamic<br/>
        int b;   // static<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If we want to "force" explicitness, then perhaps a keyword can used:
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>strict</strong> function foo(int x, int y, z) { // "z" is invalid<br/>
        int a;<br/>
        int b;<br/>
        var c; // INVALID, flagged by interpreter/compiler<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Module or class level:
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>strict</strong> class myModule {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        function foo(int x, int y, z) {  // "z" is invalid<br/>
        var a;  // INVALID, flagged by interpreter/compiler<br/>
        int b;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And an optional language-wide or folder-wide configuration or marker file could force an entire application to be static if desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Note that I prefer keywords come <em>after</em> the module, function, or variable name, more like Pascal, but here I'm using C convention.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Internally, the structure for a variable/value/object may resemble:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Static flag - "true" if static, "false" if dynamic
        </li>
        <li>
           Type tag (AKA "type indicator")
        </li>
        <li>
           Value (data bytes)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But it depends on the compiler/interpreter design. I doubt it would be as efficient as a "pure" static language in terms of performance, but that's a sacrifice for flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though there are languages that allow one to declare a variable dynamic, one has to explicitly label it as such. I'd prefer that lack of a named type be enough to declare it dynamic. We shouldn't have to declare it as type "object" or "variant" or what not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Types can be converted as needed (if dymamics allowed per scope):
      </p>
      <code>
        var x;<br/>
        x = "123";<br/>
        myFunc(x);  // works<br/>
        x = "abc"<br/>
        myFunc(x);  // type conversion ERROR<br/>
        ...<br/>
        function myFunc(int a) {<br/>
        print(a);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here, the first value of x is coerced (converted) into type "int" inside the function. The second would trigger a run-time type-conversion error, such as "value or content cannot be converted into type 'int'." Note that the "type tag" of "a" would be "int" regardless of the type tag of "x".
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe make classes and objects be the same thing, except for a "single" key word that locks an object from being multi-instantiated, making it behave like a class. Or perhaps a max instantiation count along the lines of 0, 1, or "many". "1" is for singleton-like classes. One may also want to "lock" children from adding and/or overriding methods. Something to ponder and tune.
      </p>
      <p>
        --top
      </p>

        <em>I quite like it.  It's reminiscent of -- and achieves the same goals as -- C#'s 'dynamic' type, but your approach encourages </em><a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a> whilst C# doesn't encourage it.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One could say the default is dynamic, and restrictions are added by architects as needed. It follows a similar philosophy to <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a>, which defaults to dynamic and loosy-goosy, but can be "locked down" like current RDBMS if desired, and incrementally.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="DualTypingLanguage.html">DualTypingLanguage</a> would be better suited for browsers than <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> because the "base" GUI and system-like libraries would lock everything down, mid-level libraries such as shop-specific utils would use an in-between style, and application-level developers could use a more "scripty" angle (where not required by the deeper levels).
