        Algol Family
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most modern programming languages - C, C++, VB, Delphi, Java, Python, and even Perl - use syntax and concepts that originated with the <a href="AlgolLanguage.html">AlgolLanguage</a>. So they're called <a href="AlgolFamily.html">AlgolFamily</a> languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some call them C-like languages since C is so popular.
      </p>
      <p>
        Characteristics include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           functions and subroutines
        </li>
        <li>
           value and reference-based parameters
        </li>
        <li>
           procedural and imperative emphasis
        </li>
        <li>
           code blocks (<a href="StructuredProgramming.html">StructuredProgramming</a>) which include these statements at least:
          <ul>
            <li>
               if/else 
            </li>
            <li>
               while
            </li>
            <li>
               switch or case
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        As illustrated above the dominant opinion is that most common lanaguages derive their syntax from C, and C derives its syntax from Algol, therefore these languages belong in the so-called <a href="AlgolFamily.html">AlgolFamily</a>. First, categorizing languages based on semantics rather than syntax is probably a better practice. Second, the Algol68 syntax on its <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> page reminds me more of ML and its descendants, mainly due to the pattern matching (especially in the '73 revision) and lack of braces. Finally, Algol68 seems like a better language than most the ones listed above too despite its age, so I'd hate to lump it in with them too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The term or reference is often used in a general sense such that looking at specific dialects of Algol are missing the bigger picture of the intended meaning of a general "flavor" of language style. Perhaps a similar topic called "Algol Flavor" should be created to clarify, but so far they are too close to deserve a split at this point, in my opinion. A note pointing out the difference, such as this, is good-enough.</em>

        <em>Note that Algol 68 is a later revision of Algol 60, not without controversy. Algol 68 alone shouldn't be seen as the model for the vast Algol family, which trace their roots back to Algol 60.</em>
