      <p>
        I'm a Ph.D. student at the UniversityOfKent.  I have just given the final draft of my thesis on RemovingGarbageCollectionSynchronization to the wizened and greying entity that is RichardJones.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated with a B.Sc. from the UniversityOfGlasgow in <a href="ComputingScience.html">ComputingScience</a> and decided that I wanted to be a student but get <em>paid</em>.  I'm now paying for my mistake...
      </p>
      <p>
        It's now time to move into the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>, and as such I'm looking for a RealJob, preferably something related to <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> or <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> development.  Failing which I think Borders might be a nice place to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Update</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        I made it through my VivaVoce with no corrections, so I'm now the proud owner of a spanking new Ph.D.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also start in the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> this coming Monday, at <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a>.  Not doing <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>, mind, but working for the WindowsFundamentalsTeam, on various bits and bobs in the deepest depths of <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>.  <a href="WashingtonState.html">WashingtonState</a>, here I come!

        Ha, I should be working on my dissertation proposal instead of working on this, but a friend told me about wikis and now I think I'm hooked!  
      </p>
      <p>
        Too bad I'll <em>never</em> graduate because of wiki :o)
      </p>

        You could spend the first year of a PhD doing nothing but reading papers and wiki'ing and still graduate.  <em>Trust</em> me on this one...
