        Ifdef Comments

      <p>
        <a href="IfdefComments.html">IfdefComments</a> are comments embedded in the argument to an #ifdef directive in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.  Generally, the argument to this sort of #ifdef should never be defined (or else all heck will break loose).  (It is probably possible to identify a block of code with an #ifdef that is <em>always</em> defined; but this use is far less common).
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <code>
        #ifdef REMOVE<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Code inside the #ifdef/#endif has been intentially removed; but programmer wishes to keep it visible for a while.  A good <a href="VersionControlSystem.html">VersionControlSystem</a> makes this use of #ifdef unnecessary; but sometimes this is more convenient than plowing through the Clearcase (or whatever) logs to find what was deleted.
      </p>
      <code>
        #ifdef REMOVE_MM_DD_YYYY (or REMOVE_DD_MM_YYYY if you prefer)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Better version of the above; identifies when the code was ifdef'd out.  When refactoring, such blocks that are old enough can be physcially removed altogether.
      </p>
      <code>
        #ifdef KEEP (or KEEP_date)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Code that is removed; but should remain visible in the source (for whatever reason).
      </p>
      <code>
        #ifdef LATER_MAYBE or #ifdef NEEDED_FOR_foo<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Code that might be needed to implement a future requirement.  Often times signifies a violation of <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> (though violations of YAGNI that are commented out are better than those which are compiled in); may also reflect a partially implemented feature that was deleted from the requirements.
