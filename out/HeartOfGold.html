        Heart Of Gold

        Featured in "Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, the <a href="HeartOfGold.html">HeartOfGold</a> is a spaceship powered by the <a href="InfiniteImprobabilityDrive.html">InfiniteImprobabilityDrive</a>. It was stolen by ZaphodBeeblebrox [who was president of the universe at the time] and is run by Eddie, the shipboard computer.  The onboard beverage machine (the nutri-matic) apparently has a hard time making Tea, which of course is the primary <a href="BrownianMotion.html">BrownianMotion</a> source of the <a href="InfiniteImprobabilityDrive.html">InfiniteImprobabilityDrive</a>.  The ship looks like a white running shoe. The onboard bong-water changer is a pure delight! In the ship's galley there is a large refrigerator full of Michelob Bottles. There is nothing in this refrigerator except beer. In a wall to the port side is where you will find the "normal" refrigerator for all of the food.
