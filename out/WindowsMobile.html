           Gartner analysts repeated their 3 year old criticisms that the company should have its own security framework for this platform, insteading of relying on 3rd party products to achieve level of protection required by enterprises. See <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1826676,00.asp">http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1826676,00.asp</a>

        Persistent (flash) memory support, hard disk support, display support in landscape mode, better power management, builtin support for GPS and camera. Interface is also designed so it can be operated by one hand only. USB2 and Bluetooth devices support (e.g. controversial gum sized virtual keyboard [VKB] from iTech) now included. The <a href="BlueTooth.html">BlueTooth</a> "Human Interface Devices profile" support mean no additional drivers needed when linking to a suitable source.

        In 2005 AMD has launched in US an expensive (compared to unbranded Linux PC) "Personal Internet Communicator" targeting people who would not buy a full fledged PC. The OS it uses is <a href="WindowsMobile.html">WindowsMobile</a> 5 with its included tools such as Pocket<a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a>.

        The unit will need to be hooked up to an external monitor (not TV). It has only 2 spare USB ports and is not intended to be opened up to add hardware.

        Chief problems at the moment appear to be slower performance and price tag. A small number of web sites (e.g. GoogleMaps with its technology that fired up the <a href="AjaxWebApplications.html">AjaxWebApplications</a> genre) are not accessible but on the whole it is relatively problem free.
