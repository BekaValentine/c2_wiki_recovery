        Refactoring With Python
      </h1>
      <p>
        Python has some nice features for refactoring:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           no seagull wings (i.e. { and }) to move around
        </li>
        <li>
           simple inheritance syntax makes it easy to change class structures
        </li>
        <li>
           no header files to maintain
        </li>
        <li>
           everything is first-class object
        </li>
        <li>
           you can play with namespaces (substituting a module/class/.. with a mock module/class/.. is a piece of cake) and change/modify modules/classes/objects in run-time.
        </li>
        <li>
           it has named parameters with default values (easy when need to add parameters but you don't want to break other calls)
        </li>
        <li>
           it has very strong reflection support
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I am truly hooked on </em><a href="PyCharm.html">PyCharm</a> - despite the rest of it is a peesa-crap <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> editor that's slow and fills my swapper file up with billions of pcodes that I will never use. It has ExtractVariableRefactor and <a href="ExtractMethodRefactor.html">ExtractMethodRefactor</a>. I don't _want_ to do any more advanced refactors automatically...<em> --</em><a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        Things to watch out for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As with similar dynamically typed languages, Python has fewer compile-time checks to catch things like typos on <a href="RenameMethod.html">RenameMethod</a>.  Good <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s minimize your risk here.  
        </li>
      </ul>
