        Workshare Technology is the market leader in document comparison and pioneers of real-time document collaboration software.  Clients include blue chip corporates, the US government and most of the world?s largest law firms. The company?s portfolio of products employs web technologies, object databases, n-tier architecture, hard core C++ and elegant well-designed solutions. We pride ourselves on the quality of our work and diversity of skills. Graduate candidates should have at least a 2.1 in a computer related subject, be creative and enjoy working with a team of equally dedicated people. An understanding and experience of component based development and either good front-end capabilities (dialog design (MFC/ATL), COM, DHTML/ASP, etc) or solid back end experience (DCOM, XML (SOAP), Design Patterns, OO Design, etc) are desired.
        We are using XP to manage our team of 30 developers and so are looking for people with XP experience or a willingness to learn and participate.
