        It could be argued that there is a finite set of contributor energy, any action by a contributor uses energy, and there is a non-empty set of people who make both on-topic and off-topic contributions. If you perceive value as on-topic activity, then OffTopicPages cost you the value that would have been added by contributors using their energy to make on-topic, rather than off-topic, contributions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Any particular contributor has a finite amount of energy/time/mood to dedicate to wiki. We are not immortal, you know? The more time I contribute to <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> pages the less time I have for <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll try to resume a case analysis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>case 1</strong> some contributors have very limited time. If their time is wasted wading through <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, they'll have no time for <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>case 2</strong> some contributors are rewarded by the satisfaction of having a good <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> chit-chat and that will stimulate them to also contribute <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>case 3</strong> some contributors have so much time on their hands to contribute to wiki that they contribute <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> as much as they can after which they can't contribute <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> anymore therefore contributing <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> does not subtract from their <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> contribution.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>case 4</strong> some contributors, finding themselves constrained by <a href="HarshEditor.html">HarshEditor</a>ship, feel disenfranchised and leave without contributing their <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>case 5</strong> some <a href="HarshEditor.html">HarshEditor</a>s destroy <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> before it has time to develop.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>case 6</strong> some <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> generates <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>. For example, the debatable <a href="UsaSystemsCatastrophe.html">UsaSystemsCatastrophe</a> gave rise to this page right here, as well as much related.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I for one can vouch that I fit in case 1. I also think that most wiki contributors fit into case 1 (but agin, that's only my opinion. Another fact that I can put on the table that during times of high <a href="SensitiveOffTopic.html">SensitiveOffTopic</a> contention, valuable and active contributors (I could name the names if anybody doubts) decreased their activity on <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> subjects, only to resume it later when <a href="SensitiveOffTopic.html">SensitiveOffTopic</a> subjects died off. That's my primary reason to believe that <a href="SensitiveOffTopic.html">SensitiveOffTopic</a> is best dealt with by having a <a href="GentlemensAgreement.html">GentlemensAgreement</a> to <a href="MoveItElsewhere.html">MoveItElsewhere</a>.  --<a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        ZeroSumWiki is a mischaracterization. We're not saying that the amount of energy wasted on <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> subtracts exactly the same amount of energy from <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages. But it subtracts something substantial. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cases 4-6 suggest just the opposite: people contributing in a free-spirited and welcoming millieu, as wiki was in its first few years, generate <strong>a lot</strong> more <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> content than people getting slapped with <a href="HarshEditor.html">HarshEditor</a>ship every time they try to say anything. It's like <a href="MicroManagement.html">MicroManagement</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> </em>'But still<strong>, cases 4-6 are a wash. For example, your claim that an </strong><a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> subject gave rise to this one is dubious. The seeds were already contributed and you weren't paying attention, that's all.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nor there was any </em>GoldenAge in wiki history for which you seem to suffer such a nostalgia. Maybe the first wiki years were an uncritical glorification of objects (objects a la Smalltalk only, mind you), patterns, and XP, among a community that was as diverse as a village in Wyoming, but certainly having seen the evidence (there are still pages unchanged from that era) I feel many people will have a strong diagreement that the way forward is by moving back.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yep people here can complain of </em><a href="HarshEditor.html">HarshEditor</a>ship when they are called to task to face up to their <a href="BurdenOfProof.html">BurdenOfProof</a> or reminded about <a href="InFavorOfDissertation.html">InFavorOfDissertation</a>, or something about <a href="CriticalSpirit.html">CriticalSpirit</a>. When they slap together a bunch of rants on <a href="SensitiveOffTopic.html">SensitiveOffTopic</a> at a level that would not get them published in the high-school paper, the easy way out is to whine about <a href="HarshEditor.html">HarshEditor</a>ship and not to see the problem where they were. But does Wiki suffer from <a href="HarshEditor.html">HarshEditor</a>ship for real ? Looking for some <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> example I picked <a href="StoredProceduresAreEvil.html">StoredProceduresAreEvil</a> which is a dead and gone page (good riddance), no doubt that the guy who originated it has reason to complain that his view is not reflected. But if we are to take ouselves seriously the fact that pages with conclusion that are simply unsound from a technical point of view, are gone <strong>is progress</strong>. Some folks are more loving of their strongly held prejudices rather than objective evidence, so there can always be the case of somebody complaining of <a href="HarshEditor.html">HarshEditor</a>ship. All views are not created equal. Wiki can survive though rather than succom to irreducible conflict, because people by and large are reasonable and can recognize what is an untenable or undefendable position or where there's room for reasonable people to have differences of opinion.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On </em><a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> pages the two chief complainers to suffer from HarshEditorship are RA and RK. Go figure. Do we have a problem though? I fail to see the evidence that we have. <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Where I do know that we have a problem (testifying to that from my own experience as well as from a few email exchanges with other contributors), is in time and energy dedicated to </em><a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> subjects. And again from direct evidence hosting <a href="SensitiveOffTopic.html">SensitiveOffTopic</a> discussion on this wiki is sure not to help. So we need to pick and choose whether the case 1 above is more important than cases 4-6. My bet is on case 1. I think case 2 and 3 are virtually non-existent (I put them more as a hypothesis). Wait a second, there's one RA that seems to fit in those patterns, but unfortunately for all the time he has on his hands his positive contribution to <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> has gone unnoticed.<em></em>

        It's just like any another economical decision: a question of managing limited resources. The resources are: the attention and the goodwill of readers, the (mental) energy and the goodwill of contributors, gnomes, Ward himself, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Economics is not a <a href="ZeroSumGame.html">ZeroSumGame</a> either. If it were, money could never be created. Nor value. A <a href="NoFunWorkEthic.html">NoFunWorkEthic</a> may hold this to be a good thing ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But again</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that economic is not a <a href="ZeroSumGame.html">ZeroSumGame</a> (which is acknowledge) does not mean that the society can invest resources on anything (lime making another 10000 nuclear warheads for example).
