        Least Recent Changes
      </h1>
      <p>
        With the advent of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, many visitors to the wiki, and many long-time residents, have focused on the most recent edits and ignored, or not been aware of, the wealth of information lying untouched and unseen for years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, some of the forgotten pages would benefit from being linked to by some of the newer material, and <em>vice versa.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea, then, is to list the pages which have gone unchanged for the longest time. The problem remains:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Once found, what do we do?</strong></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The intent is to make this wiki better, so every action should have that in mind. Editing a page simply for the sake of editing it is clearly wrong. Deleting a page simply because it's old is clearly wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judgement must be exercised, actions executed with care. Not every page needs to be touched. Possible actions include, but are not limited to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Page linked to and from
        </li>
        <li>
           Category added
          <ul>
            <li>
               Only sometimes - <a href="PleasePleaseDontCategorizeEveryPageOnWiki.html">PleasePleaseDontCategorizeEveryPageOnWiki</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Page trimmed, edited and tidied
        </li>
        <li>
           Page deleted
        </li>
        <li>
           PAGE LEFT ALONE
          <ul>
            <li>
               Please don't forget this one - it's a very real option.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The original discussion remains below, untouched. Please make edits in the light of the above summary, and enhance the above into <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>.
      </p>

        Thank you.

        It would need to take into account merit somehow - perhaps ratio of total changes against time since last change. On the grounds that something of so much interest back then might have some interest now.

        <em>There's a quotation on the </em><a href="DeadPoetsSociety.html">DeadPoetsSociety</a> page about trying to use formulae to derive a measure of "merit" ...<em></em>

        No, this is perfectly simple and adequate. Things will stay on the <a href="LeastRecentChanges.html">LeastRecentChanges</a> list, or else get deleted as useless, or else get changed and go to <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Merit is irrelevant.

        Unfortunately more often than not, pages have <a href="UseByDate.html">UseByDate</a>. And Pages that have passed their UsedByDate are a <a href="WikiSmell.html">WikiSmell</a>. If <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> do not fix up <a href="WikiSmell.html">WikiSmell</a>s, then it will snowball until the <strong>' Whole</strong><a href="WikiSmell.html">WikiSmell</a>s <strong>.</strong>

      <p>
        We do not have evergrowing number of <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> to check for <a href="WikiSmell.html">WikiSmell</a>s. And therefore we cannot support an infinitely growing wiki. -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a> (Nota<a href="DeleteVulture.html">DeleteVulture</a>)

           And sadly, lack of tolerance and vandalism in this world is growing, that means more time is needed to <a href="FixBrokenWindows.html">FixBrokenWindows</a>, even with a static list of reasonably good pages.

        <strong>Do we have a script that will retrieve last change date for all pages? If not...</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can get 30 people together to examine all pages that exist, we can get a list of pages that have not been touched over 5 years. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Within this list there will be huge opportunities for deleting pages with minimal controversy. And improve <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages with dead information as well.

        <em>I am concerned that people will regard a page as meritless simply because it's been around for a long time. Some of the oldest, longest untouched pages are in fact the most valuable. Certainly some of the most recent pages are effectively contentless.</em>

           I started this section and I share your concern. I do have a bigger concern that some <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages have passed their UsedByDate due to lack of maintenance. It affects the credibility of other pages with good information.
        </li>
        <li>
           Having said that, I recognise there are pages with an air of <a href="TimeLess.html">TimeLess</a>ness to them. These can either be <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>, or <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> pages.
        </li>
        <li>
           If a "perfect" <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> page gets deleted by people who have overlooked its beauty, then I suppose other people who had that appreciation could retrieve from backup (maybe personal ones), and restore them. In that instance it is likened to the "rebirth of phoenix".
          <ul>
            <li>
               What I may be suggesting is for those of us that have "dear to the heart" pages to start backing things up onto a personal wiki.
            </li>
            <li>
               I do find sometimes the history of evolution (of a page) itself tell a story, not sure whether I want to go the extreme of backing up history as well.
