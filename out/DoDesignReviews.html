        Do Design Reviews
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem: </strong>Code reviews center mostly on issues of design, rather than the code itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Code reviews are being done to ensure correctness.
        </li>
        <li>
           The reviewers cannot review for correctness because they do not understand or agree with the design.
        </li>
        <li>
           Modifying the design means throwing away a lot of the work put in by the developer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Resolution:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Perform Design reviews before any code is written.
        </li>
        <li>
           Involve code reviewers to get input/buy in on design
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        The design reviews may not have the same level of formality as <a href="FormalReviewProcess.html">FormalReviewProcess</a>. This encourages <a href="EarlyAndOften.html">EarlyAndOften</a> reviews. <a href="CampFire.html">CampFire</a> may be appropriate for the early stages.

        In order that the review will reflect ProjectSpecific details rather than ReviewerPreferences, it is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> to have an established basis of design with which the reviewer can make comparisons and which can serve as a controllingAuthority. One of the ways this can be done is by Formalization of the Design via designSpecifications:
