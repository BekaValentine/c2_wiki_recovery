        Natural Law
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="NaturalLaw.html">NaturalLaw</a>.  The laws of nature.  Simplicity, elegance, application of creativity and intelligence (all at once or accumulated over time in little steps :) to solve problems efficiently.  Lots and lots of creativity.  Evolution is a good example: the spider is an incredible engineering design feat of such elegance and efficiency.  <a href="NaturalLaw.html">NaturalLaw</a>: not to be confused with God :)
      </p>
      <p>
        Application of <a href="NaturalLaw.html">NaturalLaw</a> is at every level of the Universe.  <a href="QuantumMechanics.html">QuantumMechanics</a>, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Evolution, Communities, Governments, WorldGovernment, SolarSystem, Universe, Universes, the whole damn lot.  <a href="NaturalLaw.html">NaturalLaw</a> expresses the interactions in one level and also the interactions with levels below and above it (think <a href="ChaosTheory.html">ChaosTheory</a> and those pretty-looking fractal diagrams we're all fond of staring at into infinity).
      </p>
      <p>
        Basic concepts that come out of <a href="NaturalLaw.html">NaturalLaw</a>: 1) The Unifying field between electro-magnetic field, gravitational field, weak force and strong force is Intelligence [yeah, i know: weird, huh? :)]. 2) No information can EVER be supressed.  Not fucking ever.  It's going to take some people a long time to realise this, and that is THEIR problem [not mine, and not yours].  3) The power of thought [intelligence] to create is Absolute.  Think about something enough and it WILL happen.  Don't think about it [ever] and it CANNOT happen.

        A couple of points pointed out by Hyrum Smith in <em>Ten Essential Laws of Time and Life Management</em>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A natural law is a law that cannot be repealed
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The better you understand the natural laws relating to your work, the fewer times you bang your head against the wall trying to break them.
        </li>
