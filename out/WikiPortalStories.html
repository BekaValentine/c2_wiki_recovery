      <p>
        These are things that a <a href="WikiPortal.html">WikiPortal</a> might do. Wiki as it stands doesn't really give us a good way to prioritize these, but you can help by rearranging the order as you see it. Please also add new stories as they occur to you.

        <strong>It'll be useless if it doesnt:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Provide wiki participants with a single <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> for all wikis.
        </li>
        <li>
           I am not sure about this. . .I think if we could get a list of wikis and a short description, with a <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> link next to it, that might work
        </li>
        <li>
           Let wikis register and deregister themselves as sources of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>It'll be lame if it doesn't:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Allow searching/<a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> of all sites by category. If a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> belongs to several categories it would show up in all of them. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Provide a <a href="MyWiki.html">MyWiki</a> page to give visibility to changes on selected category(s)/site(s) and to keep track of persistent settings as per above.
        </li>
        <li>
           Permit users to subscribe/filter particular combinations of category/site.
        </li>
        <li>
           Support <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s across multiple Wikis
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>It'll be really cool if it'll also:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Cache old versions of wiki pages and let users go back in time (<a href="WayBackMode.html">WayBackMode</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Support a <a href="WikiInterchangeFormat.html">WikiInterchangeFormat</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Give a read-only <a href="BabelFish.html">BabelFish</a> view of wikis that aren't in the user's language
        </li>
        <li>
           Automatically click "I can't type tabs" on <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> :-)
        </li>
        <li>
           Be able to keep redundant copies of content to minimize data loss/server failure. (nuclear attack proof, like the internet)

        Um, these are "feature lists".  Could you provide a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> that motivates them?  For example, I am wondering how the Category crept into the feature list.

        <em>What more is needed to turn these into </em><a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>? And categories are a wiki fact of life - why is it bad for a <a href="WikiPortal.html">WikiPortal</a> to make use of them?<em></em>

        I agree that I'm not clear what the overall context/vision is here. I'm going to try and put some notes on my page later. (Just put some Apr11'01, will chew on it some more...) --<a href="BillSeitz.html">BillSeitz</a>

        Separately, might lots of the track-multiple-wikis issues be handled via RSS (<a href="http://www.webtools.com/story/TLS20010206S0004)?">http://www.webtools.com/story/TLS20010206S0004)?</a> We could start by piggy-backing off the work that <a href="DaveWiner.html">DaveWiner</a> is doing with <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">http://www.weblogs.com/</a> and <a href="http://my.userland.com/">http://my.userland.com/</a> and <a href="http://my.netscape.com/.">http://my.netscape.com/.</a> --<a href="BillSeitz.html">BillSeitz</a>
