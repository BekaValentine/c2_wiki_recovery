        <em>There's some nice material on this subject on the </em><a href="VisualProgramming.html">VisualProgramming</a> page.<em></em>
      </p>

        <em>Oh, yeah! That stuff is lot more detailed. This is just a kind of summary or precis.</em>

        Look, <a href="VisualProgramming.html">VisualProgramming</a> does not have much to do with an <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a>. Usually an
        <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a> is being used as a drawing tool for the GUI interface elements.
        The programming logic is done separately from that.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a <a href="VisualProgramming.html">VisualProgramming</a> environment the programs a written with a graphical tool and have a graphical representation (Prograph, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, you don't understand. I mean, the page </em><a href="VisualProgramming.html">VisualProgramming</a> has some nice material <strong>on the Next Interface Builder in particular</strong>, and therefore anyone looking at the current page might well be interested in that other page. You should move your argument over to that page, if anywhere.<em></em>

        NeXT programs are almost always written in <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>.
        You start to write your applications by including or writing your own components, which
        can respond to various messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to the UI, the <a href="NextInterfaceBuilder.html">NextInterfaceBuilder</a> lets you plop down visual components
        on a form (ala VB and the rest) and connect them <em>visually</em> with components you've produced or included
        by drawing lines that attach messages from the UI component to receptors(?) on your
        projects components, or messages from your components to the UI components receptors.

        Very cool stuff at the time. Totally wow'ed me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too bad it didn't catch on. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of cleanly separating application from interface was (and still is) a goal to be aspired to.

        <strong>My Authority for producing this page:</strong>
        I had access (it sat on my desk) to a NeXT machine for about two weeks.
        During that time I fiddled with stuff and poked around, and, as usual,
        broke it badly enough to have to reinstall the OS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked at and built some of the example programs.
        NeXT, I wrote some of my own--all toys. --<a href="BobBockholt.html">BobBockholt</a>

        The <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a> was originally written in Lisp and ran on a Mac. Really.
        Developed by a french guy. Jobs saw it and hired him for NeXT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a> is part of the development tools for Mac OS X.

        From Brad Myers "A Brief History of Human Computer Interaction Technology"

      <p>
        "<a href="JeanMarieHullot.html">JeanMarieHullot</a> created "SOS Interface" in Lisp for the Macintosh while working at INRIA (1984, funded by the French government) which was the first modern 'interface builder'. Hullot built this into a commercial product in 1986 and then went to work for NeXT and created the NeXT Interface Builder (1988), which popularized this type of tool."
