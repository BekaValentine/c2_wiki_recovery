        Things You Should Never Do

        <a href="JoelSpolsky.html">JoelSpolsky</a> has a great article called "Things You Should Never Do" at <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a>

        Never throw out running software and start over.  Instead, you should refactor it.  It is always easier to refactor than to rewrite.

           I thought of a number of exceptions, but perhaps they are not truly exceptions, but rather different opinions about what standard software should meet to be called "running". Sometimes the original author thought it ran, but others later didn't think so; "too buggy to fix". This judgement can be ill-supported or well-supported. We need another aphorism to address what to do with software that truly or supposedly isn't really "running".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have long thought this, but did not have the courage of my convictions to state it so boldly.  Once, when people asked me if their millions of lines of C code should be rewritten in C++, I told them "Sure.  It needs to be rewritten.  It would be just as good to refactor the C code and keep it in C, but your management won't let you do that, so you should pick a new language so you can rewrite it."  That is about as far as I've gone.  Now that I have his article to reference, I'll go further.  -<a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>

        <em>What, is this something one should never do?  Not every system is a production system, you know.

        It depends on how much fun you want to have. Unit testing can go a long way in avoid ending up with a <a href="BigBallOfMud.html">BigBallOfMud</a>, which isn't fun.

        Use fgets() or getch() instead.

        Never take the word <em>never</em> literally in these pieces of advice, instead take it in the appropriate spirit. <em>Especially about the poodle.</em> Exceptions to these rules exist, but the existence of exceptions doesn't invalidate the advice. <a href="NeverIsNeverNever.html">NeverIsNeverNever</a>.
