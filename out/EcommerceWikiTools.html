        The significant problem for <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> page exchange: different wikis
        have different page naming schemes.

        You'll need a way of resolving and mapping between different
        <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>. Page names are chosen by people, and refer to 
        the content so it's going to be hard to do this mapping automatically
        and predictably. You probably need something like <a href="LotusNotes.html">LotusNotes</a> to
        do the above in a reasonable fashion... (and that probably means slackening
        the relationship between title, URL, and page identity).

        At the end of it all, every wiki is just data.  Thus for page exchange each wiki should present an API to allow submitting and retrieving pages.  A pure HTTP or DCOM implementation of this would be, I would think, trivial.  -- <a href="StevenBlack.html">StevenBlack</a>

        Thank you for your hints. Perhaps a similar Turnkey Wiki system already exists. Please have a look in <a href="WebWebTwo.html">WebWebTwo</a>, where I wrote a public letter to <a href="JoeMcMahon.html">JoeMcMahon</a>.
        Unfortunately his download link and his workaddress there were unavailable. 
        Although it would be nice, to have the 'pagename problem' for Inter Wiki transfer resolved, I could live without solution of this problem at moment.
        Highest priority at moment for me:
