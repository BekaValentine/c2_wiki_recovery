      </h1>
      <p>
        Steven (aka ferretman) is a (the?) demigod of Artificial Intelligence in Games.
      </p>
      <p>
        He lives at <a href="http://www.gameai.com.">http://www.gameai.com.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I met him on <a href="news:comp.ai.games">news:comp.ai.games</a> when I was still in high school. This eventually let to the great fortune of collaborating with him and others on a book on Game AI for WroxPublishing. While it was never published, it was an extremely rewarding experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steven has taught me a lot more than he may know.
