        Xp In Academia
      </h1>
      <p>
        I think XP should be instructed in academia, from its practical and educational value. Particularly, <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> and <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a> must be learned by any CS students who do coding at all.
        Is it taught in any universities, at least in <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> courses or heavy project lab courses?  -- <a href="JuneKim.html">JuneKim</a>

      <p>
        I would certainly add refactoring to the list.  Students need to be exposed to coding style guidelines.

        <a href="LaurieWilliams.html">LaurieWilliams</a> has taught <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> in some courses, but that's all I know about.

        Thank you. Her papers on <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> were quite interesting. I think her <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> class is comparatively far better than those in Korea, which are mostly speculative and theoretical, usually with old SE tomes.
