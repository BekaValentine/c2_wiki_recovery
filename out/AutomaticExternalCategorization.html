        <em>I like categories, </em><a href="ItWorks.html">ItWorks</a>.<em> - Since the idea exists that a person's information can be most useful, when personally and properly managed, it follows that a template for this management will necessarily be highly personalized.

A comprehensive, individual information management schema and the mechanics for Building and Maintaining Information within it will most efficiently be done <strong>External to the Site Servers</strong>. While General Categorization and a site organization might already exist, how to make each the site additionally and alternatively useful for groups of users can also be done at another UserLocale.

        Using HyperTextTechnology, the combination of ManualCategorization, ExistingCategorization and AutomaticCategorization based on content and context, and the establishment HyperTextualStructures which can be utilized via procedures, processes or programs existing at the UsersDeskTop is not only feasible, but imperative. In my case, tools to do this are being constructed as the accumulation is in progress.

        External (to wiki, to internet) categorization and storage of an individual's information, by an individual, on an individual's own computer, created with a feature allowing it to be shared with others,  is PolarOpposite to that described by "<a href="WoodenLanguage.html">WoodenLanguage</a>". It is bottom up, not top-down. If it must be classified, let it be a part of <a href="WoolenLanguage.html">WoolenLanguage</a>, a WorkingSeries. It is presently in the process of creation and utilization, non.FinishedGoods, using Artifacts, Artifactories, WikiWords, WordLinks, and IdeaSpaces, written in the  English language.

      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> How does that follow? The information may be personal, but I don't see how that implies the management of that person's data will be personalized even a little bit (much less 'highly').

        <strong>A: firstly </strong> It is not implied, it is PersonallyOrganized: (work is involved)

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       Sentences, Paragraphs, Chapters, Books, Sections, Dictionaries, Glossaries, Libraries, Universities

        <strong>A: secondly</strong> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the information processing of the InformationUnits is made to be PersonallySelectable by action, timing, duration, accessability, and security
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>A: thirdly</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the information displayable is made to be customizable, from the simplest of screens to the most sophisticated of presentations
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>RE: First, Secondly, Thirdly...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I still don't see how any of this is <em>implied</em>. InformationUnits could just as easily be AutomaticallyOrganized, GenericallySelectable, have common solutions for security and composition and accessibility, and focus on Automatic Placement (<a href="AutomaticVsManualPlacement.html">AutomaticVsManualPlacement</a>) with little support for customization other than, possibly, stylistic composition (akin to CSS or XSLT transforms). I tend to see these options as highly preferable (in terms of computation properties for composition, common implementations of browsers, common support for subscription and level-of-detail, ability to share data and views of data, etc.) to PersonallyOrganized, PersonallySelectable, and fully customizable display of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: It is not implied! it involves either personal work or the use of applications (either third-party, or personally-developed) to make it so <a href="ItWorks.html">ItWorks</a>!

        The idea of automation and externalization of categories and many, if not all other components and attributes of the StoredInformation, is to allow for its becoming personalized, according to a personally derived organization.
      </p>

        <em>RE: it is further unlikely that a site, a series of sites, or the internet as a whole will contain, organize and store the information in such a personalized form</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I must disagree with this assumption. I believe that it is <em>very</em> likely that sites, series of sites, <em>and</em> the Internet as-a-whole will eventually be tooled to support multi-directional mobile code (both from browser->server and server->browser), which in turn will result in a whole new approach to portals, mashups, and web-applications. The use of mobile code will give rise to 'agents' in the cloud that subscribe to, maintain, and organize data for individual users, and have this data prepared for rapid access even across sessions and disruptions. These 'views' will likely be composable in design, such that one can create new views from older ones, inheriting the filters, compositions, stylizations, and so on. This allows primitive data sources to become automatically organized into many personal and shared views, and also allows views (personal or otherwise) to be shared in a standard manner. (Related: <a href="DocumentDefinitions.html">DocumentDefinitions</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Will be tooled to support</em> suggests methods, structures, and mechanisms a person may use, being highly and strictly structured requiring the user to apply techniques and machinery designed, maintained and controlled by others in a "cloud" environment, which can and will be changing and changeable by others and which may not be counted on to serve in the way the person intends. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Inheriting the filters, compositions, stylizations</em>, suggests that they will fit the filtering, composition and style needs of the individual using them. Personalization and personality are unique, not general. Since such a system is dependent on a design created to store, organize, and contain data to be <em>shared in a standard manner</em> presumes knowledge and context the <strong>server</strong> assumes to be personalized. Assumption when it comes to personal items, does not equal intention. Assumption will be found to provide the user with what has been <em>said</em> and not what is now <em>intended</em>.  (Don't do what I say, Do what I mean)
      </p>
      <p>
        In a personalized system, the user may choose, as I have on occasion, to store personally and potentially interesting items in other forms and formats than those in which it is served. One has but to look at the source of a web page to see why such conversion and interpretation is required. The page is formatted primarily to affect its <em>presentation</em>, not necessarily what it contains a person may find of informative use and desires to store and maintain is a personally designed and structured base. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {I'd like to see that <em>sites and the internet as a whole [...] will be tooled to support multi-directional code</em>. But I fear that is a long way off. So until that point is reached a personalized local store would prove useful.
        But even then will local storage of artifacts (caching), local indexing of sites and artifacts and in general local optimization of access paths for the user bring enormous processing benefits. Call it partial evaluation of the users usage patterns. A site cannot do that efficiently alone.}

        I had a thought about this again today : Why not use AEC as a component of the <a href="WoolenLanguage.html">WoolenLanguage</a> on your desktop to <em>organize, characterize and categorize your own take in a </em>WorkingSeries, on things related by creating shortcuts within personally named and organized folders and subfolders. In this way you can not only categorize, but also sub-categorize pages, not only from wiki, but from most other sites on the internet.
