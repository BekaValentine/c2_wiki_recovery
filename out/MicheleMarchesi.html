        Michele Marchesi
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MicheleMarchesi.html">MicheleMarchesi</a> was exposed to object oriented technology in 1986, when he had the chance to attend the first OOPSLA Conference in Portland, OR.
        In November of the same year he attended a Smalltalk course at SI in Oslo, Norway. In 1989 he wrote a book on Smalltalk/V (in Italian), later translated by Prentice-Hall without his intervention, and published in 1994, when the described dialect (ST/V286) was totally obsolete :-(

        He teaches electric circuits and neural networks at the University of Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy. His (not very updated) Web page is at <a href="http://maxwell.diee.unica.it/persone/marchesi/info.html">http://maxwell.diee.unica.it/persone/marchesi/info.html</a>

        He still practices Smalltalk a lot, he is interested in OOA & OOD and, from its inception, of course in XP.

        Recently, he translated the XP book of <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> into Italian (Kent, your prose is easy to read, but difficult to translate!) and organized <a href="XpTwoThousand.html">XpTwoThousand</a> conference.
