        adj. - Invented by Theodor (Ted) Nelson, prob. a blend of "mingled" and "intertwined". Connected together in a complex way; specifically, composed of one another's components.  (pulled from <a href="SocialText.html">SocialText</a>)

        <em>EVERYTHING IS </em>'DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED<em>'. In an important sense there are no "subjects" at all; there is only all knowledge, since the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this world simply cannot be divided up neatly.</em> -- Theodor Holm Nelson wrote those words 40 years ago in his book, Computer Lib.
