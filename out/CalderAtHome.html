        <strong>Calder at Home : The Joyous Environment of Alexander Calder</strong> by Pedro E. Guerrero, Alexander S. C. Rower [ISBN: 1556706553]
      </p>
      <p>
        A wonderful book, not about Alexander Calder's famous works, but about the environment he spent his later years working in: his home.

      <p>
        The most interesting thing about this book is how it gives you insight into the artist's mind. We are defined by what we surround ourselves with, and Calder's wonderfully cluttered surroundings say more about him (and his wife) than just studying one of his fantastic mobiles.
