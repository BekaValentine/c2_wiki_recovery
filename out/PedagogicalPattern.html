        Pedagogical Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="PedagogicalPattern.html">PedagogicalPattern</a> captures expert knowledge of the practice of teaching and learning.  The intent is to capture the essence of the practice in a compact form that can be easily communicated to those who need the knowledge.  Presenting this information in a coherent and accessible form can mean the difference between every new instructor needing to relearn what is known by senior faculty and easy transference of knowledge of teaching within the community.
