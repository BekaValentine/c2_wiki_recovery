        If this is anything like PsMemo, which is another fine software from the author, then we're in for a real treat. It looks like it supports Japanese, English. There's also a separate build for French. The author also provides some extensions to link to external applications like Mail, MemoURL, Agendus, iambicMail. You can link to Memo, Address, Todo, Mail, even hand-drawn notes like Cliememo, or you can define your own application links. (<a href="CliffordCaoile.html">CliffordCaoile</a>, 2004/09/05)

        What about PalmOS 5+ compatibility? I have only 4.* and can't try myself... (Andrew)
      </p>
      <p>
        Does work perfectly on OS 5+ (at least on my 5.2.1 T|3) (Vincent)

        Well it says on the page that it is for PalmOS 5 and up. It doesn't look like it supports 4 or below. There are lots of Wiki-enabling extensions for 4, though. BTW, the bug-fix version 0.6 just came out this week.(<a href="CliffordCaoile.html">CliffordCaoile</a>, 2004/12/23)
