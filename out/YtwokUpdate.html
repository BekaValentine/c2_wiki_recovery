        Ytwok Update

        Interesting that this thread kind of died...

      <p>
        Well, 60 days to go, how's everyone feeling? Airline bookings seem to be running smoothly into next year, 9/9/99 passed without incident, as far as I can tell.

        I'd really expect any potential ill effects to start showing soon (or, to have shown up already). One factor I find especially comforting is that the stories about extra payment being offered for IT support over Hogmanay week-end have (in London, anyway) suffered severe deflation: from "a year's salary for two days" to, a "couple of hundred quid".

        A straw poll here might be interesting. Of course you can't vote your way out of Y2k, but it should be informative to see people move around on the poll as their expectations change. If the majority move towards optimism over the next 15 months then that will give the lie to folk like <a href="CoryHamasaki.html">CoryHamasaki</a> who publish newsletters saying the geeks are all in despair. If we move instead toward pessimism then that should give us some reassurance that we're not the only paranoids out there. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally we had a scale of 5 but 2 & 3 were too far apart for some of our brave prognosticators, and for completeness's sake something seemed to fit between 4 & 5 too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. No Problemo</strong>: Y2k is hype generated by the media and a few highly-paid consultants. A couple of accounting systems blowing their tops aren't going to hurt anyone. If there is any trouble we'll be back to business as usual within a month.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Recession <= Market Hiccups</strong>: There is a real problem here, but it's not a show-stopper. We're going to see wild swings on the markets, maybe some localized bank runs, and some businesses will have mission-critical failures and go belly up, but we've seen such things in every business cycle. Y2k won't be any worse for the industrialized world than this Asian collapse has been. Full recovery within a year. <a href="PeterDeJager.html">PeterDeJager</a> is here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.5. Severe Recession <= Oil Crisis</strong>: Some of the failures are show-stoppers, but thre are workarounds for most. People just go back to manual systems for a while - pencil and paper, human operators, flat taxes, 1950s solutions. Market crashes, bank runs, oil shortages and bankruptcies occur all over the world, but people have made contingency plans and large enterprises mostly come through okay. Think 1973. Full recovery within 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Depression <= Manufacturing Crisis</strong>: There is a massive global problem here. Embedded systems in almost every manufacturing and distribution network lock up. The utilities experience only local failures, so it's still not the end of the world as we know it, but we're looking at rippling glitches, chronic oil shortage, and big business failures across every sector. 1930's style social dislocation. Recovery takes 5 years. EdYardeni & BruceWebster are here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.5 Chaos <= Domino Effect</strong>: there are twice as many people, the situation is vastly more complicated, technological dependence more widespread, and GIGO flows so much faster than 1929, this won't look like that. A spread of conditions across North America in the 2-4 range, generally better in the warmer cities, but across the world some places (India? Japan?) may go 4.5. Strong chance of war in many spots (Taiwan?). Other places stay pretty much intact and perhaps even prosper with vast external demand for all kinds of services. Recovery time depends on where you live. <a href="EdYourdon.html">EdYourdon</a> is about here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Meltdown <= Utilities Go Out</strong>: The utilities are waaayy behind on this. The lights and water go out in US major cities for periods longer than a week. The biggest cities burn and the freeways become parking lots. Millions die, millions more lose homes and way of life. Recovery will take at least a decade if a nuclear exchange doesn't make it worse. <a href="CoryHamasaki.html">CoryHamasaki</a> & TcMay are about here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.5 The end of the world as we know it <= Dieback</strong>: Not only do the cities burn, but most of the technically skilled population perish. A few survivalist techies are left, but nowhere near enough to maintain 20th century resource-distribution networks. The 6 billion humans on the planet can't live without those networks and suffer a <a href="JayHanson.html">JayHanson</a>-style dieback. Recovery as such doesn't happen, but a substantial new civilization rises among the survivors within a century. PaulMilne, InfoMagic and <a href="GaryNorth.html">GaryNorth</a> live here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. </strong><a href="TheEndOfTheWorld.html">TheEndOfTheWorld</a> <= Darkness Falls<strong>: This is the worst technological screw-up since the Romans decided to use lead plumbing. The utilities, manufacturing networks, telephones, publishing, and everything else that makes living in cities possible go out and don't come back for generations. War, famine, disease and cannibalism are global. Literacy is witchcraft and far-future archaeologists argue we were hit by an asteroid. No one on the net lives here.</strong>

        Vote changed to <strong>2.5</strong> with the revised scale. But with some leanings towards 2 for the less technologically oriented societies, with some local pockets of 1. People with high tech jobs and a wall street leaning may however experience a personal end to their world. I agree however that many Utilities do not seem to be on the ball with this one. A railroad may not be high tech, but as recent chaos in integrating railroad systems has proved, they do have a big impact when they cannot ship the really bulk goods. Remembering that Markets are a SocialPhenomenon, we do have to watch out for our old friends <a href="FearUncertaintyAndDoubt.html">FearUncertaintyAndDoubt</a> causing major market panics. --<a href="PeteMcBreen.html">PeteMcBreen</a>

        <strong>1.5-2</strong>, revised downward with the new definition of 2.5, depending on what the media do.  There will be few real problems: elevators won't fall, planes won't drop out of the sky, most factories won't shut down.  I see no credible reason why there would be an oil crisis, nor a credible reason why we would have to return to pencil and paper.  But media scares could impact the market and cause recessionary behavior.  Y2K is a fear problem, not a real problem.  But fear is real, unfortunately.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        <strong>3</strong>. Like Ron, I think the "real problems" will be fewer than others 
        believe. But the market is 10% perspiration and 90% hallucination, so it will 
        take a hard hit. In addition, I think ineffectual responses to the real 
        failures will exacerbate the overall damage. This is based on my observation of 
        ineffectual efforts at preventive maintenance (such as the reams of paper 
        dedicated to efforts to "fix" report programs that merely put the date at the 
        top of the page.) --<a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>

        <strong>2</strong>, with the caveats others have voiced, if more optimistic.  I don't foresee real technical problems,

        <strong>2.5</strong> I agree that the fear factor is the biggest one.  I honestly believe that the EuroTransition might have a bigger effect on the global economy than Ytwok since no one is planning for it because their entire IS budgets and mindshare are taken up by Ytwok.  All I can say is that I'm happy MY bank (Wachovia) has already started advertising that they're up to Ytwok compliance. --<a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>2-2.5</strong> We will be in a slump, but we will not be able to isolate Ytwok as the cause.  Since markets reflect expectations of future earnings and assessments of risk, the current market meltdown is unfortunately timed.  Ytwok risks may further dampen investments over the next year.  I think we are with the bears until sometime after 2000.  How far after that will depend upon the impact.  -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a> (9/5/98)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>2</strong> A slump, largely due to fear and the various parts of the world where the infrastructure will fail. (E.g. telephones in Asia except Japan (where it is either the year 6000+ or the year 28, depending.)  But banks, utilities, etc will keep working in the US, Japan and Western Europe.  And to be non-PC about it, economically nothing else really matters.  (Middle Eastern banks are not required to ship oil.)  -- <a href="MarkSwanson.html">MarkSwanson</a>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>2.5</strong> The more I think about it, the more I worry. Like Ron, I don't 
        believe that there will be many <strong>huge</strong> failures. In fact, while I 
        won't be flying anywhere (and may take a slight vacation to safer ground), 
        I doubt that there will be much to notice in the first week. But there 
        will be lots of little glitches and, in our interconnected economy, the 
        ripple effect will be enormous. I'd say we're headed for something between
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           and the Great Depression. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        And, of course, Silicon Valley (where I live) will be utterly devastated. 
        Not so much by immediate Y2k effects, but by the resulting recession-- it 
        seems to me that in a recession buying newer software and upgrading equipment 
        are the first things businesses will cut back on.

My cash/charge/chechque guarentee card expires next year, it works fine. There will be problems, there are now, and have been for the last two years or so. I see them build up, peak about this time next year, then fade away again. The economy will wobble, but that happens all the time.

        I don't want to be in India waiting for a train to catch my plane to come back home on Jan 5, 1999.  I expect a number of misprinted bills sent from one company to another.  But all that falls into the inconvenience category, repaired by phone calls and manual rework and "excuse us" all around.  I'll probably buy stocks late '99 because I expect them to go up when people find there is less trauma than anticipated.  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        <strong>2</strong> (2.5 for some parts of the world)
        I believe contingency planning will have a greater impact than some pundits believe and I expect to see some very creative solutions to problems that occur (a joke that I cannot completely recall that involves a farmer showing to deflate the tires of a truck that was stuck underneath a bridge and thus fixing a problem that had the experts stumped seems to come to mind).  The problems that occurred at the beginning of 1999 were much milder than some self-described experts I heard on the radio had predicted just a few months previously.  These people were predicting all sorts of problems for systems that looked ahead one year.  As was reported a few weeks ago by various sources, the problems were rather mild.  The success software systems dealing with the Euro transition is also very good news. --<a href="AlanHecht.html">AlanHecht</a>

        <em>Despite the nice press there have been some Euro glitches. Check out </em><a href="http://www.garynorth.com/y2k/detail_.cfm/3830">http://www.garynorth.com/y2k/detail_.cfm/3830</a> . Still, nothing they're not coping with quite nicely, thanks very much. And you're right, several pundits suggested 1/1/99 and the week after could be shaky, and so far as has been published they were quite mistaken.<em></em>

        I have some stuff to say about the Euro conversion which is straying from <a href="YtwokUpdate.html">YtwokUpdate</a>, so I am moving it over to <a href="EuroConversion.html">EuroConversion</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is also interesting about the Euro and does not seem to be widely reported is the fact that the Euro is a little bit more complicated than just being another currency to deal with (albeit one that represents several nations).
        Conversion to a country's currency that is transitioning to the Euro must be done be means of "triangulation", which means going through the Euro.  For example, in order to convert from US dollars to German marks, the dollars must first be converted to Euros and then to marks.  The same must be done for converting German marks to US dollars. After a few years, all of the European countries will deal exclusively with the Euro.  I don't know how widely known this is outside of the financial and banking industries (I only know it because I work on financial software).  As far as software fixes go, I imagine it is at least as difficult as y2k date conversions & fixes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OTOH, every company that has forecast or admitted to any sort of negative Y2K effect has taken a terrible shellacking in the markets, so it seems fair to think that those that have had 1/1/99 problems wouldn't be too forthcoming about it. None of the worst effects posited here - social, control, or distribution failures, and manufacturing domino glitches - were due for 1/1/99, so that's not necessarily a very good predictor of what's to come. Still it augurs well for the many fiscal-year rollovers due in April; if April wears on well, we can probably breathe easy until GPS EOW rollover day on August 21-23</em>

I would probably have been just 2 a few weeks ago, but I had a pretty bad dream, and a friend who's always been quite optimistic was lately convinced otherwise himself (moving from, I'd guess, about a 1 to about a 2).
