        Card Triage
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm no XPert but here's what I think:
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were a <a href="TriageNurse.html">TriageNurse</a>, I would do it this way:
      </p>
      <p>
        Decide on which pile/category each patient (i.e. card) falls into:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Cases that don't have to be taken care of right away.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Cases that need to be taken care of right now.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Cases that are too far gone and can't be taken care of -- these are the cases that can't be done even with the maximum time allotted.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Then focus on pile number 2, and throw away/modify pile number 3. Plan to do pile 1 later...
      </p>
      <p>
        If there's too many cards on pile number 2, rethink which ones you can put on pile 1 instead. If there's still too many, even after culling the ones to put on pile 1, decide which cards on pile 2 to put on pile 3...
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem solved.

        Or put them in four piles using the technique described in [<a href="FourQuadrants.html">FourQuadrants</a>, from] <a href="SevenHabitsOfHighlyEffectivePeople.html">SevenHabitsOfHighlyEffectivePeople</a>:

        I ask my boss to do card triage for me: I make a card for each thing I've been asked to do, and add cards for things that I want to do but haven't been asked to do.  Then I ask my boss to sort the cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always surprised how wrong I was when I guessed what was important to my boss.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is visceral and direct. My boss never complains about the schedule dates I never meet (I have yet to meet a schedule date on this job). After all, my boss physically put the meet-the-schedule card lower in the stack before handing it back to me. -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>
