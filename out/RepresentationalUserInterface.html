        Representational User Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        A representational user interface is a user interface that represents the data or <a href="RealInformation.html">RealInformation</a> behind it. Representational user interfaces could become popular if our civilization began using <a href="InformationModeling.html">InformationModeling</a> to build InformationLayers. You see, representational user interfaces are presently unpopular because the system behind the user interface is almost always data rather than <a href="RealInformation.html">RealInformation</a>. Customers need information rather than data most of the time. At present, the job of a GUI is to translate the data behind the scenes into real information for the users. This is a hardcoded literal translation and is difficult to change. Using a real information layer would allow representational user interfaces to be automatically manually generated, because the information behind the scenes would be the information that the users needed.

        <a href="NakedObjects.html">NakedObjects</a> and <a href="RepresentationalUserInterface.html">RepresentationalUserInterface</a> s are very similar except that <a href="NakedObjects.html">NakedObjects</a> are used in the <a href="RealData.html">RealData</a> realm whereas <a href="RepresentationalUserInterface.html">RepresentationalUserInterface</a> work in the <a href="RealInformation.html">RealInformation</a> realm. To work in the data realm you must have expert data oriented users. Users in the information realm don't need as much expertise because information is the language of users (as opposed to progrmmers). In addition, information can be used to format the representational interface somewhat. In effect both form and content can be represented by information but only content can be represented by data.

        An <a href="ObjectBrowser.html">ObjectBrowser</a> is one kind of <a href="RepresentationalUserInterface.html">RepresentationalUserInterface</a>. Object definitions are a form of <a href="RealInformation.html">RealInformation</a> for programmers, so they reside int he information realm.
