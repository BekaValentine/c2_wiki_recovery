        This is a very good book that covers a lot of important ideas/techniques in distributed computing for <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> and <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a>. Pity it has a really ugly red cover. <em>It seems that they decided not to go with the ugly red sportscar cover. At least in the hardback US edition. It has a lot of typos but it's on a par with the </em><a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> book when it comes to <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> patterns and J2EE patterns. It's still too early to tell how good the .Net stuff is.<em></em>

        How relevant is this book to people still developing <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> applications in accordance to <a href="DistributedInternetArchitecture.html">DistributedInternetArchitecture</a>? <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a>

        <em>The book is not exclusively or even primarily about distributed computing. See </em><a href="FirstLawOfDistributedObjectDesign.html">FirstLawOfDistributedObjectDesign</a>. -- DagfinnReiersol<em></em>

        OK. However Enterprise applications are either developed on <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> (e.g. <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a>), or one of <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a> (distributed processing) or <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> (distributed processing).
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the pattern material relate to the distributed processing scenario, so my question related to <a href="DistributedInternetArchitecture.html">DistributedInternetArchitecture</a> is still valid. --<a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>

        According to a consultant, I just worked with, does the book cover lots of problems and traps in developing <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a> Applications. And most of these problems are more design & conceptual questions rather than Java Questions. So with a bit of abstraction work, it should be fine for other languages, when it comes to distributes <a href="EnterpriseApplication.html">EnterpriseApplication</a>. --NorganHan
