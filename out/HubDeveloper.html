        I got this from the <a href="XpCritique.html">XpCritique</a> page and could be summed up by:

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>It claims that many of the successful system they studied had a single person who could answer questions about it and who acted as the hub of the developers</em> <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> comments about <a href="FieldStudyOfTheSoftwareDesignProcessForLargeSystems.html">FieldStudyOfTheSoftwareDesignProcessForLargeSystems</a></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        A <a href="HubDeveloper.html">HubDeveloper</a> could also be described as an Architect gone wrong, whereby for me an Architect is similar to an Architect in the building kind. This would imply that the Architect would design the plans for a system - based on their experience and KnowHow. Once complete, pass these to the Developers or <a href="ProjectManager.html">ProjectManager</a> to guide them in the development of the system. HOWEVER, this does not mean that they are never to be seen again, similar to an Architect in the building industry, an Architect is on site when required ... and when not.

        Is there a SignsThataProjectIsGoingBad page? If so, then a <a href="HubDeveloper.html">HubDeveloper</a> should be in there.

        <dd><em></em><a href="HubDeveloper.html">HubDeveloper</a> remains a developer, i.e. programmer, and does not do the design. They tend to kept their ideas to themselves only doing what they are told to do and because they put in extreme long hours, they tends to do everything. When it comes to question about the code/system, then the <a href="HubDeveloper.html">HubDeveloper</a> has the answer, when it comes to design questions then it's the designer who has the answers.<em> -- </em><a href="GerritRiessen.html">GerritRiessen</a></dd>
