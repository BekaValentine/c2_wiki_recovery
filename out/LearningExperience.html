        Learning Experience
      </h1>
      <p>
        A learning experience is a euphemism for a mistake. When a sentient creature or artificial intelligence of limited experience acts without sufficient forethought and the consequence of those actions cause harm to the actor or others, he, she or it can spin the occurrence positively by calling it a learning experience. In truth, however, most human beings do not immediately learn from a learning experience and are usually doomed to repeat the mistake, at least, several more times.
