        Advocatus Diaboli
      </h1>
      <p>
        Devil's Advocate, or taking the opposite side -- often against one's personal belief -- purely for the sake of argument, typically to strengthen the argument of the opposite side.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the team agrees that a SQL DBMS is the appropriate tool to meet requirements.  Someone might say, "Playing Devil's Advocate here, what if I were to say that an <a href="ObjectDatabase.html">ObjectDatabase</a> is a better choice because it will deliver higher performance with less impedance mismatch...?" under the assumption that the team will now hone their arguments in favour of a SQL DBMS.
