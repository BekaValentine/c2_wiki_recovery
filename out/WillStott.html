        Will is moving from London/West Sussex to Zurich in November 2003 so as to support his partner whose job has been transferred there. His work will take him back to the UK for a few months in the new year, but is hopeful of being able to find jobs closer to home thereafter. He hopes to make new friends in Zurich and generally help spread the Agile message.
