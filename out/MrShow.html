        <em>Mr. Show with Bob and David</em> was an offbeat sketch comedy series starring Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, which ran on the HomeBoxOffice cable network.

        The word "offbeat" in the above paragraph doesn't really describe it.  The show has a strange sense of humor, and a lot of people just don't get it.
