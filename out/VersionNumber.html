        Version Number
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most projects have a version number.
        Even smaller units like files or functions may have their own version numbers.
        Which version numbering schemes do exist and what are their pros and cons?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Common Version Number Format</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many projects use a version like <em>major[.minor[.micro[.build]]]</em>, where <em>major</em>, <em>minor</em>, <em>micro</em>, and <em>build</em> are nonnegative integers.
        The <em>micro</em> component is sometimes called the <em>patchlevel</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some projects append a string like "rc", "alpha", "beta", all followed by a small positive integer, to the last component they use to indicate versions that are "almost" finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Meaning of the Version Number Components</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Linux kernel (<a href="http://www.kernel.org/)">http://www.kernel.org/)</a> uses even <em>minor</em> numbers for release versions, and odd <em>minor</em> numbers for development versions.
        The development version <em>major.minor</em> evolves from <em>major.(minor-1)</em> and leads to <em>major.(minor+1)</em> or <em>(major+1).0</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wine project (<a href="http://www.winehq.com/)">http://www.winehq.com/)</a> uses the release date as a single component version number.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Version Numbers for Shared Libraries</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Every shared library should have a version number.
        This number may be different from the version number of the project, in which the library is distributed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The <em>major</em> number should be increased whenever the API changes in an incompatible way.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <em>minor</em> number should be increased whenever the API changes in a compatible way.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <em>micro</em> number should be increased whenever the implementation changes, while the API does not.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Alternative Version Number Format</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        An alternative version number format proposed by David Tanzer (<a href="http://davidtanzer.net/node/75)">http://davidtanzer.net/node/75)</a> is <em>v[major][qualifier][revision]</em> where "major" and "revision" are positive integers and "qualifier" is one of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "ds": Development snapshot
        </li>
        <li>
           "be": Beta
        </li>
        <li>
           "rc": Release Candidate
        </li>
        <li>
           "pr": Production
        </li>
        <li>
           "mr": Maintenance Release
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
