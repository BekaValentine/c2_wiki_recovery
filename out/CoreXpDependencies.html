        Core Xp Dependencies
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps this page might be more correctly named Core XP Relationships, as it appears most of what is shown and discussed are not true dependencies, i.e. A cannot be done without B.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is one of the cases where a picture may be worth if not 1000, then a LOT of words.  A lot of us are visually oriented.  Therefore when we are trying to understand how concepts relate, the best way to do so is with a picture.  So here it is:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="http://members.aol.com/kgb1001001/dependency.jpg" />
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(Here is another diagram on the same subject: </em><a href="ExtremeProgrammingEnablingChart.html">ExtremeProgrammingEnablingChart</a>)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What the boxes represent are the core XP practices as I see 'em.  The arrows are dependencies, meaning "don't try to do this without doing the thing on the other end of the arrow".  For instance, DON'T do refactoring without unit tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Some dependencies not yet labeled on the above graph:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>---> <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a> -- If a project practices code ownership then developers will be sorely tempted to keep code "checked out" for long periods of time while they slog through defect lists or feature requests from other programmers. If your developers tend to keep code "checked out" for long periods of time, then you can't do <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>.  If anyone can make any change, then continuous integration becomes a possibility... (What say you wikizens?)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>This one seems to be a bit of a stretch.  Maybe there isn't a relationship for this one.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="MercilessRefactoring.html">MercilessRefactoring</a> --> <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> - Refactoring leads to version control conflicts without continuous integration.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I'll almost buy this one. But consider the following scenario. What if you're faced by someone who follows a full </em><a href="ClassOwnership.html">ClassOwnership</a> model where each person maintains all their own classes? They can refactor all they want, but as long as the behavior (and interfaces) don't change, they don't screw up anyone else. That wouldn't require <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>. Practically, of course, we know that the interfaces would have to change, but this is the kind of theoretical possibility that people will drone on about...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Except that a <a href="ClassOwnership.html">ClassOwnership</a> model is hardly compatible with <a href="MercilessRefactoring.html">MercilessRefactoring</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why? Please provide some simple reasons here. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many important ReFactorings involve moving things between classes. You can't do that if you don't own the class. <a href="MercilessRefactoring.html">MercilessRefactoring</a> implies <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. You can't do that if you can't do cross-class refactorings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly enough, this also highlights another dependency:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="MercilessRefactoring.html">MercilessRefactoring</a> --> <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="SmallReleases.html">SmallReleases</a> --> <a href="SimpleDesign.html">SimpleDesign</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Please give some reasoning as to why </em><a href="SmallReleases.html">SmallReleases</a> depend on <a href="SimpleDesign.html">SimpleDesign</a>.  For instance, why can't you do a SmallRelease of a complex design?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because you can only do so many things before a small release turns into a large release.
      </p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I haven't included </em><a href="MovePeopleAround.html">MovePeopleAround</a> since it's a cardinal practice of <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>. I might include <a href="StandUpMeeting.html">StandUpMeeting</a>, but I'm not sure that it's really a core practice - I've seen it used and still seen projects fail, but I've seen successful XP projects where people sit down at meetings...<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a> --> <a href="CodingStandard.html">CodingStandard</a>s. Without <a href="CodingStandard.html">CodingStandard</a>s, <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a> is impeded because you will spend too much time puzzling out unfamiliar coding styles and naming conventions.

           <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a> --> <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing and <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s to be in place. If I am allowed to change code I didn't write, how can I be sure it still does what it is supposed to? How can I be sure my changes don't break a third party's code? XP's answer to that is <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing: The tests tell you if the code still does what it's supposed to, and if they succeed but some other code breaks, there is a test missing. Actually, I believe many XP skeptics are not aware of this dependency and argue against Collective Code Ownership while ignoring Unit Tests.   There has been some discussion on other wiki pages that in XP <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s == <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s. <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a> is the officially accepted nomenclature. A correction of a misunderstanding of this can be found at <a href="CanFunctionalTestsReplaceUnitTests.html">CanFunctionalTestsReplaceUnitTests</a>.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="RapidDesign.html">RapidDesign</a> --> <a href="SimpleDesign.html">SimpleDesign</a>. You can't build a complex design in a short time.

           <a href="RapidDesign.html">RapidDesign</a> --> <a href="SmallReleases.html">SmallReleases</a>. You can't do a quick design for a big release. (Or does this make more sense the other way around?)

        It bothers me that <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is off by itself. Maybe nothing depends on it directly, but in my experience, it is the thing that makes teams blossom. It is the turbo-charger. -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

        What about <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a> and <a href="CodingStandard.html">CodingStandard</a>s? What are the dependencies there?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps there should be an arrow to </em><a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a> from <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a>?

      </p>
      <p>
        I would suggest showing <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s as being supported by <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s (I am not sure of what the arrow convention is here). <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s fill in the gaps left by <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s.  -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The arrow convention (as explained above) X->Y (read as X depends on Y) means you can't do X without Y (e.g. doing X without Y is a really bad idea. For instance, you can't do Refactoring without </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s.<em></em>

        Michael's comment gets to the heart of my problem. It seems to me that XP is in fact <em>not</em> all or nothing. There are at least two groups of practices that <strong>might</strong> be more-or-less independent. Now, I'm asking for the following things:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Can anyone explain <em>why</em> any of the rest of the XP practices depend on <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>.  Not that I don't believe that <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is a good thing - in and of its own it's a wonderful thing as <a href="LaurieWilliams.html">LaurieWilliams</a> has shown in her studies. But what else in XP <em>relies</em> on <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> and won't work without it?  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>None depend in the sense of live or die. Many are strongly aided.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How are they strongly aided?  Give me some simple statements that will indicate how pair programming aids the others.  I'm looking for the logical principles that say if you do X then Y will be better BECAUSE...</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        'Just one of dozens of reasons is that Developers will tend to do less and less testing if no one is watching'
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) There's a set of connected practices around <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> that XP shares with the old JAD (Joint Application Design) sessions. XP has its own spin on it, but the idea of very short, customer-focused iterations doesn't seem to rely on any of the other practices - JAD sessions worked well without the other practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>AFAIK, JAD iterations aren't as short as XP's, but there's nothing wrong with JAD. The programming practices of XP just make short iterations better.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Guys, I don't want to cause a religious war here (hard when you talk about XP) but I'm really looking for some hard, solid reasoning as to why you can't separate pieces out and have them still be useful...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You can. Some subsets are quite useful. Some rather obviously don't work. All together work particularly well.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        (<a href="DierkKoenig.html">DierkKoenig</a>) I strongly support Hasko's point. <em>(</em><a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a> -> <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing -- hh)<em> And I would add: Why is </em><a href="TestFirstDesign.html">TestFirstDesign</a> missing in the picture? For me personally it is a core practice with some strong dependencies: 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><a href="TestFirstDesign.html">TestFirstDesign</a> gives the focus for <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> sessions</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>

        <dd><a href="TestFirstDesign.html">TestFirstDesign</a> eases <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing dramatically</dd>
      </dl>

        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><a href="TestFirstDesign.html">TestFirstDesign</a> leads to <a href="SimpleDesign.html">SimpleDesign</a></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are the XP implementation of <a href="TestFirstDesign.html">TestFirstDesign</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (<a href="DierkKoenig.html">DierkKoenig</a>) OK, you're right. <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> includes <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a>. But the name doesn't reveal it. I've seen a lot of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s written afterwards (about 80%, actually). So there seems to be a difference at least in the perception of the programmers. The do not expect it to be so much of a difference.
