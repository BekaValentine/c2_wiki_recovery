        Signatures And Soft Polymorphism
      </h1>
      <p>
        Question regarding your signatures in <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>
      </p>
      <code>
        +(integer, string) returns string<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If a parameter is designated "integer" in your model signature for a dynamic language, does that mean its type tag/indicator must be integer, or that the value/representation is "parsable as" (interpretable as) integer?. Both variations may exist in various dynamic languages. A more thorough model would address and clarify that issue. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The notation used in the signatures is based on the assumption that a value is V=(R,T) where R is the value's representation (a bit string, typically) and T is the value's type (which is always "string" in the case of Category D2 languages).  T is what I presume you mean by "type tag/indicator".  Where values can be encoded within strings, they are treated as type "string".  For example, the signature of a binary operator DateDiff that returns an integer encoded in a string and parses its string operands to identify encoded calendar dates within them would be written as "DateDiff(string, string) returns string".</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           I'll probably have to explicitly illustrate it when my pseudo-code is further along. My explanation appears to have failed at communication here.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Really?  I thought I understood exactly what you meant.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hell, that would be a first :-)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And another possibility is "voting" parameters where plus (for example) will consider the hard (tag) or soft (parsable) type of both parameters before making a decision. I've tried to enumerate all the possible combinations for two parameters and two types, but haven't been able to clean out the equivalence-related duplicates for presentation yet. (<a href="ThirtyFourThirtyFour.html">ThirtyFourThirtyFour</a> has a sampler plate.) -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's conceivable, but I know of no popular imperative programming language that uses the "soft (parsable) type" for operator dispatch.  There would be considerable performance overhead for doing so, because it would require parsing operands on every operator invocation.  Implementing values as V=(R,T) means parsing occurs once (typically during </em><a href="LexicalAnalysis.html">LexicalAnalysis</a>, when values are created from the literals that specify them) and operator dispatch can be done efficiently based on T rather than require the inefficient overhead of parsing R.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Scriptish languages often don't worry much about efficiency. And implementation can use the tag as a shortcut to avoid parsing a good portion of the time, but the result is the same AS IF parsing always occurred (but slower) such that we can simplify the model by saying it "always parses" and avoid conditionals in the model. I'm not going to assume the language was designed with efficiency as it's primary signature processing choice, for that would limit the possibilities that have to be considered. Partly for that reason, I don't like your signature approach. Plus, nobody's done a thorough survey of languages such that "soft polymorphism" cannot be ruled out. Further, such a language could say, "if speed is your goal, then make sure the tags (explicit types) are of the intended type to avoid a parsing step." Some of my earliest exposure to scriptish languages was for minicomputer OS scripting, and those were not designed for math and accounting, but rather gluing the likes of FORTRAN or BASIC programs together and managing or automating system tasks. (Those languages were often still far better than the shit one finds with Windows.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps upper-case can be use to indicate "hard" signatures (tag-only) and lower-case for "soft" signatures. ("Soft" meaning "interpretable as").
      </p>
      <code>
        +(NUMBER, NUMBER) returns NUMBER<br/>
        // matches: 2 + 3<br/>
        // does NOT match "2" + "3"<br/>
        .<br/>
        +(number, number) returns NUMBER<br/>
        // matches: 2 + 3 and "2" + "3"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But I'm still not sure this is thorough and/or clear enough to cover the full gamut. The coding details are dumped onto the kit user without any help [sentence added later]. For one, the priority rules could get long or messy because soft types can overlap. I'm still trying to see if it can be fully regimented per <a href="ThirtyFourThirtyFour.html">ThirtyFourThirtyFour</a> example. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Again, I've not seen a dynamically-typed imperative programming language that uses "soft" signatures for operator dispatch.  I'm sure it could be done, though.  The operator definitions would need some mechanism to identify what "soft" type their parameters expect.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, without a wider survey, it's difficult to say with certainty. Have you explicitly tested many? If you don't have a wide and thorough survey to rely on, I'd suggest it at least be covered in your "model" page as a disclaimer of some sort. I'm not comfortable at this point with the "hard polymorphism" assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am quite familiar with the </em><a href="TypeSystems.html">TypeSystems</a> of popular imperative programming languages and have explicitly and extensively studied them. Among C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Python, Perl, Ruby, VB.NET, VB, VBA, Objective-C and PHP, none perform operator dispatch on "soft" signatures, i.e., parsing string values at run-time to identify other values encoded within them, and then invoking operators based on the types of those values.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Perl does not have tags and so couldn't do hard polymorphism if it wanted to (at least for scalars). Thus, your claim is suspicious. Although, if it has no overloading on the built-in operators, then such is not testable. CF might, I'll have to check one of these days (although it's not a tagged language).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Every Perl scalar value has a type reference, which can be Integer, Double, String, Reference, or something called a "Blessed or magical scalar".  Typical Perl mess, that last one.  Perl does not do "soft" polymorphism as described here.  Whatever </em><a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a> might or might do -- I have no idea; I've not examined it -- it's certainly not in the "popular imperative programming language" category due to obvious lack of popularity.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Can you present a test that demonstrates that Perl scalars have "type references"? And I'm not sure we should limit our models to the top 50 or so languages. Some of the scripting languages I've used before were bundled with obscure or domain-specific tools. -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Why would I need a test?  Perl internals are documented.  I limit the descriptions on </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> to "popular" languages because I haven't done a comprehensive survey of all languages.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Sigh.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Further, even if existing operators usually follow such a pattern, user-defined functions don't have to. When discussing "types" we should probably also consider activities besides the built-in libraries, or at least include a disclaimer saying that such is not being considered in a given model.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>It's self-evident that operators can do whatever they like with their argument values.  No popular imperative programming language parses values as part of its built-in operator dispatch mechanism.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           See above regarding "popular". There is no rule of the universe that prevents such a language/technique such that it shouldn't be summarily dismissed. A disclaimer is warranted in your model in my opinion. And that is one advantage of my model: it can model "soft polymorphism".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>There is no rule of the universe that prevents any of an infinite number of techniques.  Should I provide a "disclaimer" for every one?  The descriptions on </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> certainly can support "soft polymorphism".  As described below, <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> -- which is a Category S language -- supports it.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Something like "as typically found in popular languages" is warranted in my opinion. And I will agree that if you limit a model to a sub-set of languages, it can perhaps be simpler than a model that could potentially target a wider variety of languages. It's a matter of trade-offs.

           <em>You mean the part that says, "Note that the following categories are not intended to be a definitive list", at the top of </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>, isn't good enough?<em></em>

           (Having "+" parse both sides to see if they are number-able, resulting in addition instead of concatenation, even for a "tagged" language is not unrealistic or "wrong". It's not as efficient as tag-centric polymorphism machine-wise, but not "wrong" from a language behavior perspective. Thus, a model/kit that can handle such is a good thing. It's a niche that you don't cover.)

The descriptions certainly admit what <strong>is</strong> done, which is that the "+" operator in certain languages parses its string-typed operands to see if they encode numeric values, and it adjusts its behaviour accordingly.  However, that is not the same as polymorphic operator dispatch; there is only one "+" operator.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It doesn't preclude it, but as-is, your signature model does NOT cover (distinquish?) soft poly. D2 languages have to use soft poly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I know of no D2 language that uses "soft poly" as part of its operator dispatch mechanism.  However, the effect you're calling "soft poly" is covered in the part that says: "Some languages do not distinguish operand types outside of operators and treat all values as strings, so the only signature (for "+") is effectively: </em>'+(string, string) returns string<em>' In such languages, when "+" is invoked it internally attempts to convert its operands to numeric values. If successful, the operator performs addition and returns a string containing only digits. If the conversion to numeric values is unsuccessful, the operator performs string concatenation on the operands and returns the result."  If you want to call that "soft polymorphism" (please don't use "poly", that just sounds like a juvenile attempt to sound like part of some vernacular-using "in"-crowd), that's fine -- but be clear it isn't part of the operator dispatch mechanism, it's merely the behaviour of the single "+" operator definition.</em>

        <em></em><a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> supports specialization-by-constraint, in which each type in an inheritance hierarchy is associated with a boolean constraint expression.  When a value belonging to a particular type hierarchy is instantiated (or "selected", in <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> parlance), the constraint expressions are evaluated to determine the most specific type to which the value belongs.  A programmer can define constraint expressions that are based on parsing values.  Since <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> supports <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> based on the most specific type of values, a programmer can use it to implement "soft" polymorphism as you've described it.  I know of no popular imperative programming language that permits this.  I know of no other language -- popular or otherwise -- that does this internally.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The closest approximation to "soft polymorphism" that is sometimes found "in the field" is the behaviour of certain operators in "string typed" (i.e., category D2 languages described in </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>) languages, in which a few operators vary their behaviour depending on what values are encoded in their (always) string-typed operands.  For example, a '+' operator -- whose operands are always a pair of strings -- may check to see if the operands encode numeric values, and perform addition if (and only if) they do.  Otherwise, it performs string concatenation.  Due to the performance overhead this represents -- the '+' operator has to parse its operands on every invocation -- its use is (appropriately) very limited.  Generally, it's an order of magnitude more computationally efficient to associate type references with value representations once -- at the point where they're parsed in the source code -- rather than have to do it repeatedly by doing it at the point of each operator invocation.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Regarding efficiency</strong>, technically that's not true. An "internal" type indicator/tag can be kept to make processing shortcuts where appropriate. For example, a language parser could determine if a given literal has quotes or not (such as numeric) on load or pre-parsing stage (such as p-code). If it's a numeric (non-quoted), then an internal tag can track that fact and associate that fact with a variable upon assignment from the literal. When an overloaded operation comes along, the tag can be checked, and parsing skipped because it already knows the "value" represented by the variable is from a literal that's known to be numeric. But that's an <strong>implementation detail</strong> and one may have no behavioral way (<a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a>) to tell whether such tag is actually used. I use a programmer <strong>detectable</strong> tag as the category separation criteria, not implementation tags, because language implementation can change or have new vendors building interpreters that mirror existing behavior, but not implementation of the existing specimens. It's like caching in a sense in that it <em>can</em> be invisible to the programmer such that they don't "model" it in their head when reviewing code. An (internal) explicit type indicator/tag can improve efficiency without making its presence known in terms of I/O. As I prefer to describe it, a tag-based language <em>acts like</em> it has tags from a programmer's perspective and a non-tag-based language <em>acts like</em> it has NO tag. If tags are "inside" merely to speed up implementation but don't otherwise change observable behavior (<a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a>), then it's okay to model them as not existing, if prediction is the goal. (Modelling speed is another matter.) -t

      <p>
        <em>It was established early on that </em><a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a> can't detect whether a "tag" is detectable or not.  Remember the trivial C example?

As described, <a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a> makes no mention of detecting tags or anything else -- I thought it was a technique for comparing languages.  Therefore, if it "does not rely on a single example", precisely how many examples -- which I presume will be something in the range of 2..∞ -- are required in order to detect a "type tag", and what is the process for doing so?<em></em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Almost all empirical testing of systems of nature and human construction are approximations since we don't have infinite resources at our disposal. We've been over this already; I don't want to go into that again. In this case, "detecting a tag" would mean the language's behavior "matches" that of a model that uses tags. Similar testing probably could NOT detect caching because caching is intended to <strong>improve performance without changing expected language behavior</strong> (<a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a>). An "internal" tag could do the same thing: improve efficiency by reducing repeated parsing of values/representations WITHOUT changing expected behavior. Thus, I'm making a distinction between "internal" tags and "observable" tags. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>From your description of </em><a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a>, it appears that the only way to use it to detect "a tag" is by comparing one language implementation against an implementation of exactly the same language which is known to use "type tags".

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

           Pretty much, yes. I know of no better alternative. I bet you are itching to claim "read the manual", but again most manuals on dynamic types are pretty crappy in my assessment.

           Once you play with such a model a bit, you don't have to create a new one for each language, you "run" it in your head. That's the general intent. And a crappy manual won't necessarily answer questions even if you re-read it a thousand times. Empirical testing may be the only way to know for sure.

           It's common to learn by playing. Since when is learning a "rigorous" process? And why are you assuming experimenting with the language and experimenting with a model are mutually exclusive? When I experiment with a language, I like to (eventually) develop a model for how it "works" in my head based on the experiments. The pseudo-code kit is just a semi-formalization of that. Otherwise, one is working with mostly feeling and vague notions, which are typically harder to remember and apply. Note that I have documented with sample code various experiments to try, but they are not meant to be complete, for each language is different. One <strong>cannot predict the design of future languages</strong> with anything "rigorous".

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Why even question why one step is more important than another? Why does the ranking matter? They both should be done. Experimenting with the language is generally the first step, and then building a model (in head or code or paper) to mirror the experiments is the next step. If a "user" doesn't want to bother forming/tuning a model, that's fine by me. It's their choice. I'm merely offering them a suggested model that they can use or ignore on their own volition.

           Further, it is possible that caching, for example, may change the <a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a>, but nobody has discovered or noticed the situation (input data and/or source combo) that triggers the difference.

        Please clarify. I don't know what you mean. The programmer could NOT detect an internal-only tag anymore than they could detect caching.

        <em>If you're dispatching on type, that's ad-hoc polymorphism.  See </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism''">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism''</a>

        <em>If they can detect tags, the language may employ conventional polymorphism.  If they can't detect tags, the language may employ conventional polymorphism.  There is no language which parses strings prior to invoking a polymorphic function in order to determine which implementation of a polymorphic function should be invoked.

        Basically it's a rule that says:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           If you already parsed a literal (value/representation) during code parsing
        </li>
        <li>
           You copy that value/representation into a variable during a regular assignment
        </li>
        <li>
           The variable has not been changed since (via a non-tracked event)
        </li>
        <li>
           If you tracked the result of the first parsing (tag)
        </li>
        <li>
           Then you don't have to parse it again. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        But the programmer cannot see this take place nor detect it through non-speed-related experiments (unless there is a bug). Also note that if the programmer cannot see how the dispatching is implemented under the hood, then classifying it as OO polymorphism versus case statements versus something else may be moot. That's essentially an <strong>implementation detail</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Who said anything about OO?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What <em>exactly</em> do you mean by "conventional polymorphism"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>See </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism</a> which is "a kind of polymorphism in which polymorphic functions can be applied to arguments of different types, because a polymorphic function can denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, that's in implementation detail (and OO specific).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's a characteristic of certain programming languages, typically referring to a facility that can be exploited by the programmer.  A '+' operator that supports concatenation and addition may be described as a semantically overloaded operator, but the language does not necessarily support ad hoc polymorphism.  It is common to many OO languages, but not unique to them.  In particular, it is not dependent on "objects" in the usual OO sense, only on types.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are multiple ways to skin the [insert preferred animal]. Note that I consider "soft" polymorphism to involve (at least) parse-based (or equivalent) examination of the "representation" to determine how to process the arguments. Perhaps "polymorphism" is a confusing word choice, but I don't want to dwell on vocab. <strong>The "selection" (dispatching) can potentially be based the explicit type indicator(s) and/or the value/representation, per specific language and/or operator</strong>. For an illustration, contrast lines 4837 and 94838 in <a href="TopsTagModelTwo.html">TopsTagModelTwo</a>. Whether OO polymorphism or case statements or HOF's are used inside the interpreter is a swappable implementation detail. The outsider (programmer) can only observe the patterns. "Tag and value combo X result in results pattern A, combo Y result in pattern B," etc. The explicit dispatching mechanism to do this combo "lookup" is an interpreter/model implementation detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There is no popular dynamically-typed programming language that performs operator dispatch based on parsing values.  Some, however, have semantically overloaded operators.</em>

        Somewhere else, I forgot where, I pointed out that in the field there is a pretty good chance one may end up having to use an embedded or bundled language, often a "scripting" language, that <strong>comes with a specialized product</strong>. For example, an automated telephone answering system (voice menus etc.) may come with its own embedded scripting language to code phone response logic.  I've encountered at least a half-dozen of such embedded/bundled languages over the years. Most of them were <a href="AlgolFamily.html">AlgolFamily</a>-styled languages and/or with domain-specialized key-words and usually didn't try to introduce "fancy" paradigms etc. because they are not marketing to experience programmers only, but rather a wide variety of IT shops with perhaps limited programming experience. They are selling primarily a domain product, not a programming tool, and don't want to hurt their market by using "high brow" techniques unnecessarily. (I didn't analyze the specific type characteristics of such languages in detail.) -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do you know of any language -- popular or obscure, embedded or general-purpose -- other than </em><a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, that supports soft polymorphism?

           I haven't directly tested enough such that I can't say I do, but <strong>we shouldn't assume the narrow case</strong> if we haven't done a thorough survey. By what logic should the narrow case be the base assumption? Unless it's very "costly", it's best to not assume or hard-wire-in the narrow or most-common case. -t

      <ul>

           <em>That's exactly it:  The non-"narrow case" here </em>'is<strong> very costly.  Parsing every operand prior to operator dispatch would be a prohibitively expensive waste of CPU.

Of course, "+" is just an example.  Other operators could be similarly overloaded; the description on <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> is not meant to imply that the mechanism is limited to just the "+" operator.  A language could define other such operators, but the mechanism is the same. <em></em>

           The goal of the model is not machine-related efficiency. As far as a production language doing it, if it's intended primarily as glue or an interface to some product, then the cost of parsing performance may not matter there either. Further, an invisible tag (non-detectable to programmer) can in theory be used to reduce parsing; but there is no need to model such. This was discussed already somewhere in a comparison to caching. A model interpreter wouldn't need to bother with caching-like efficiency shortcuts.

           What you call "needlessly" is a design decision involving trade-offs between <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, machine speed, etc. I have no faith in your trade-off choices because of your uncommon thought processes. Besides, vendors do sometimes make poor decisions. If you are asked to <strong>work with a language as-is</strong>, it's part of your job and you are not in a position to bitch to the vendor about their language design. (Personally, I wouldn't overload "+" for concatenation and math.) Remember we are not designing new languages here, but modeling EXISTING languages. And why introduce something potentially foreign to model users like <a href="PredicateDispatching.html">PredicateDispatching</a> when a plane-jane IF statement can do the job just fine? It appears to be <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> to me.

Thus, always parsing operands would be needless.  Practically, whether operand parsing is needed or not would have to be specified on a per-operator basis, along with some explicit specification of what pattern the parser should expect to find.<em></em>

           I don't see how this adds anything new to the discussion. It appears to talking about how languages "should" be designed, which irrelevant for reasons described above. As for how it may happen in the wild, a vendor may create a scripting language add-on/embedding for their tool that resembles <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> so that they can brag in their brochure that it "closely resembles <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and is thus easy to learn". However, to keep the implementation simple (perhaps at the price of speed), they may choose to skip implementing type indicators (tags), among other things. This would typically require parsing the "values" to determine how to apply operators like "+". Whether such a decision is "wise" or not is probably off topic. (I doubt most programmers would notice the subtle differences in behavior compared to real JS, by the way.)

        <em>There are numerous languages that overload certain operators -- most notably (and typically) "+" for both string concatenation and numeric addition -- but these do not rely on parsing operands prior to operator dispatch as part of the general operator dispatch mechanism.  In every example I've seen where operands have to be parsed to determine whether "+" should be string concatenation or numeric addition, it's done by the "+" operator itself.</em>

        <em>Now, you could argue that the "+" operator itself is a specialist dispatch mechanism that delegates to string concatenation or numeric addition, but that's covered by </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> in the part that states:<em></em>

        <em>"Some languages do not distinguish operand types outside of operators and treat all values as strings, so the only signature (for "+") is effectively: </em>'+(string, string) returns string<em>' In such languages, when "+" is invoked it internally attempts to convert its operands to numeric values. If successful, the operator performs addition and returns a string containing only digits. If the conversion to numeric values is unsuccessful, the operator performs string concatenation on the operands and returns the result."</em>

        Something like <a href="TypeHandlingGrid.html">TypeHandlingGrid</a> may be more flexible and compact for describing combinations of hard and soft polymorphism. Language usage frequency is also discussed.
