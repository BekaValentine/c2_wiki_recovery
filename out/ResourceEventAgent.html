        Resources, Events and Agents (REA) is an economic ontology fathered by Professor William McCarthy (<a href="BillMcCarthy.html">BillMcCarthy</a>) of Michigan State University and developed for the past 20 years by McCarthy and a band of students and colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>
        REA is a distillation of common business interactions into a very few moving parts, most notably:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Economic Resources = for example goods, services, money.
        </li>
        <li>
           Economic Events = production, consumption or transfer of Economic Resources.
        </li>
        <li>
           Economic Agents = people or "parties" who execute Economic Events.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Those three concepts and a few derivatives can describe any business interaction or system.
