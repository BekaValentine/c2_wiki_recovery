        Why Dont Others Get Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm new here, and while I can't say I've had much experience with wiki, I've become an avid follower. I'm a fan, maybe a fanatic. Witness the signs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm a <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           I tell everyone I know about wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           I've set up my own wiki (not public yet - but soon).
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm trying to set a wiki up at work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think I <em>get</em> wiki, or at least, I've seen enough of this and other wikis to see how things flow. I've even stuck my big toe in the water a few times, and actually gotten back wonderful and unexpected responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here's my problem. Others I try to bring to wiki don't seem to get it. I don't think it's my communication skills, because the responses most people have are consistent, regardless of how I present it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wiki is just a mutant newsgroup format.
        </li>
        <li>
           Wiki's formatting is primitive.
        </li>
        <li>
           Wiki's presentation is boring.
        </li>
        <li>
           Wiki's (traditional) lack of security is unworkable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (And indeed, that last response was what turned off some people from wiki at work immediately. A few days ago, I brought up the <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a> for this wiki and was greeted with something like "Can I really edit this page?" Thankfully, someone replaced the original page a while later. But that demonstration soured some folks from wiki.)
      </p>
      <p>
        When I discuss the simplicity of the software, and the low "cost of entry" for people to weave a Web site, they think that's nice, but then wonder why I don't just use a more structured "Web board" discussion database. When I showed the insanely obvious "voting" mechanism used here (people edit a page, incrementing a count when they like something), they look at me like I'm nuts, and say there are plenty of good voting CGI applications out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        So how can I best communicate my excitement for wiki? What have others who have also been bitten by the wiki bug done to infect others with Wikiness? So far, what I'm doing is setting up my own wiki, and populating it with a skeletal framework for a few different things I want to do with a wiki. They are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A frequently asked questions database.
        </li>
        <li>
           Private (slight security) programming discussion forum.
        </li>
        <li>
           Free-form discussion on local issues that might inspire people to write.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My hope is that picking practical (and familiar) applications like this can be used to draw people in, and then I'll start hitting them with non-linear conversations, low-tech voting, and other idioms I've seen form on this and other wikis.

        One idea that may not go down so well with the bottom-up power to the people faction but has worked well for email and should be even more effective with intranet wikis: get the 'boss' at any level of the organization, but preferably the CEO, to say that the only notification of and minutes of meetings in future will be via the wiki.

        I can't agree more with that... we are using a wiki at work for systems documentation, and every week in the staff meeting the director has the wiki on the big screen projector and types the minutes as the meeting goes along. Every time this happens in a meeting, the activity of the wiki is high for the rest of the day. -- <a href="SteveWainstead.html">SteveWainstead</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        If your folks are worried about security, why not add page versioning and keep all the old copies. Every so often, run through and dump out the old stuff or save it to an archive file. For more paranoid types, also keep the id of the machine that did the deed and/or add tracking cookies. Regular backups don't hurt either.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <em>read</em> security is what they want, well, what are you using Web tools for anyway??

        Well, judging by the role of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> to govern <a href="ThingsOnWikisMind.html">ThingsOnWikisMind</a> amongst other things, I'd say, yes, it is a mutant newsgroup. However, it happens to be persistent <em>without history</em>, which makes it different.

It's a bit more than just a newsgroup - it's also a sink for information. <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> vs <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>.

        If there is a security concern, it should be fairly trivial to address. There is no reason why <em>your</em> wiki couldn't have changes made through some versioning software a la <a href="CvWiki.html">CvWiki</a>. At work, we back up servers all the time, and the servers themselves keep revision histories of the files. Almost never do we use these tools to recover data, but they are nice to have. You may never use them once, but if their absence is a barrier to people using a Wiki-like technology ... just add it in. -- <a href="EricHerman.html">EricHerman</a>

        <dd>Wiki <em>appears</em> to be unworkable to many who have seen other online communities dissolve due to spam, flames, or trolls. Sometimes, even a well-behaved group can overwhelm a community - imagine if every hour there was a new page (with a new <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> each time) asking common questions like "Doesn't XP have to do <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>?", or "Couldn't someone erase all of this? <em>(Yes, see </em><a href="WikiErase.html">WikiErase</a>)<em>".

      <p>
        This is one of the essential points. (cf. <a href="WikiEssence.html">WikiEssence</a>, <a href="ElementsOfWikiEssence.html">ElementsOfWikiEssence</a>) In differentiating wiki from newsgroups to someone in my organization, I described it as "permanent and organized". I'm aware that newsgroups can be considered permanent by virtue of <a href="DejaNews.html">DejaNews</a>, but the forward flow in time of information in newsgroups is harder to follow - it's less integrated. But a much more important differentiator in the organization dimension is that wiki is <strong>hypertext</strong> and newsgroups are not, and therefore wiki's organization of information is arguably much closer to our brains' organization of information than are the newsgroups' (reminds me of the <a href="MindMap.html">MindMap</a> book).

        <strong>Wiki is small</strong> (January 11, 2000)
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a> is a relatively small community. Only a few thousand people have ever edited a wiki page. A popular topic listed in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> might be read 200 times in a day. My best guess at C2's wiki traffic (from the top-10 data) is 8,000 to 15,000 wiki pageviews per day. (The <a href="FoxForumWiki.html">FoxForumWiki</a> appears to be almost as active. About five other public wikis are reasonably active, and most are nearly empty.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The small size of the PPR/Wiki community may be intentional. Ward has avoided some high-profile links to the PPR wiki. (See <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a>.) PPR has survived a few <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> links from people replying to XP stories, but has not been tested with a story focused on Wiki.

      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> is awkward<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> is the main user interface for the wiki community. Some people find the roadmaps and guides more useful in finding <em>content</em>, but the <em>community</em> gathers around <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. When I was editing <a href="ChangeSummary.html">ChangeSummary</a>, I estimated about 30 minutes a day were spent just looking for changes. (Later, custom tools cut this time to about 15 minutes.) Here are some of the bigger problems with <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Tiny or trivial edits are a substantial fraction of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.  Earlier today (Jan 11, 2000), this page had two changes. The first one corrected a single misspelling. The second one changed a question into two links to good answers. <em>*These changes are good edits*,</em> and fully in the spirit of wiki. They are also annoying to people hunting for changes.
        </li>
        <li>
           No indication of what changed on a page, or how much activity has occurred on a page. Really hardcore users know about <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>, and some just type "copy=" directly into the address bar. Many people would miss my new comments above (about security), if I didn't point it out here. <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> is popular, but wiki doesn't support threaded discussions as well as many other forums.
        </li>
        <li>
           No organization of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> into categories. Discussions of XP, Java, personal pages, and random topics are not separated. This may be a feature, but it looks like a bug from the outside.
        </li>
        <li>
           Meaningless domain names and frequent blanks for authors.  (<a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>s quickly figure out which home.com address is <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>'s, and what san.rr.com usually means.) Most of these authors are not trying to be anonymous. <em>[I am. -- </em><a href="LamontCranston.html">LamontCranston</a>. Whoops, what a give-away!]<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           The most recent changes still aren't on top. ;-)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not all wikis have these problems/features. The <a href="FoxForumWiki.html">FoxForumWiki</a> divides major topics into namespaces, has a checkbox which allows minor changes to be ignored, and puts the most recent on top. A few wikis have more convenient "diff" features to find what changed on a page. -- <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'd guess that minor changes are part of the lifeblood of wikis. It brings certain old pages back to </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and keeps newer pages active because it causes people to reread the content again, which leads to new reactions and edits. cf <a href="ThingsOnWikisMind.html">ThingsOnWikisMind</a> -- ss<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Special discussion pages such as Village Pump and WatchLists such as at <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> solve the problem of overwhelming amount of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. In a large organisation you would monitor new sections appearing on that general page (i.e. is that topic interesting to me? Yes/No) and individual pages that you are already interested in. The problems you describe are specific to certain Wiki software. @SIG@ ~~~~

        <strong>Metaphors for Wiki</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        May be <a href="ThreeRingBinder.html">ThreeRingBinder</a>s could be a useful metaphor in describing wiki and perhaps why some some resist wiki.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Seems that <a href="ThreeRingBinder.html">ThreeRingBinder</a>s were the hard copy version of an intranet for the enterprise, agency or institution that it served. Good  <img src="http://www.debruyn.com/gifs/smile.gif" /> <a href="ThreeRingBinder.html">ThreeRingBinder</a>s permitted forward evolution more so than the typical intranet does today. That is <a href="ThreeRingBinder.html">ThreeRingBinder</a>s had certain wiki-like qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in lieu of page linking, the binder permitted easy addition of pages to the appropriate section and in the appropriate place within the section. What wiki does is replace the sectional organization and the page sequence with an open, three-dimensional hyperlinking page scheme.	
      </p>
      <p>
        One could ink or pencil in comments and cross-references and, more recently, append sticky notes to the pages in the binder. Unlike the binder that may have been assigned to an individual or a work group, wiki permits these comments to be shared with all. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What made the binders special, beyond writing on a page, was that whole pages could be added. Even better, the binders permitted a bit of the wiki anarchy, in that users could add their own pages (memos from above, below and contemporaries as well as oneself within the organization). Perhaps the control freqs that want their intranet to replicate the one way communication, top/down, of the <a href="ThreeRingBinder.html">ThreeRingBinder</a>s helps us identify some of the resistance to wiki in terms of the negative reaction to <a href="ThreeRingBinder.html">ThreeRingBinder</a>s.

        I think wikis are kinda' like plants.

Having introduced several wikis at work (for managers and developers), I find myself doing some <a href="WikiWatering.html">WikiWatering</a> in the early stages to help it "grow".

        I just started a wiki at work too and have been met with a similar response. I think the fact is that, right NOW wikis are still too new. People aren't versed in its interface like they are to the messageboard interface or the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a> interface. A common thing wiki-users overlook is the need for a better, more intuitive interface. A lot of times, we don't realize that something needs to be changed, but if you watch a new-comer try to navigate the Wiki you'll realize that there REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH HELP to guide the user... They're not used to the non-linear navigation (even though the Web should've trained them by now) enough to navigate... they have no idea where to start! ~ JimmyLo

        I just can't understand why anyone would want to use the wiki system personally. I wouldn't want people to be able to edit my content directly. An open comments section for each page could be fun, but actually allowing a user to edit and add to an original post is a bit insane. *shrug* To each their own. I guess this system requires a bit of trust in people. Unfortunately, all my dealings with the average internet user have left me with little trust in humanity these days.

           The quote from Robert A. Heinlein which says that "An armed society is a polite one" (in "armed" I'm referring to the ability to edit) was helpful in explaining why wiki arguments don't usually turn into an ugly experience, and why vandals don't get their way.

           Showing a wiki site's statistics is helpful in conveying the effectiveness of the wiki dynamics in building a "knowledge community" in comparison to standard forums. For example, in the site I demonstrated 90% of the edits are done by 150 people, and there is a 1 to 4 ratio of editors to viewers. This relatively small community was able to create within a year a very vivid site with more than 1300 pages, and several dozens of changes per day. For people that are used to newsgroups and Web forums, this is usually an astonishing fact.

        I'll also note that sometimes wiki just <em>isn't worthwhile</em>, particularly in many work domains. Wiki is a tool, just like anything else, and while it's fabulous in some cases, there are places where its advantages are dubious at best. I wouldn't want to replace the InternalRevenueService (as an American example) Web site with a wiki. It would be defaced too often. This isn't a weakness in wiki; wiki's just not appropriate in that sort of situation.

        An alternative is to create a Web site that is partially a standard Web site and partially a wiki, and grow the wiki content over time. This allows you to control that content that you want to control, but also encourage wiki pages to build themselves when there's a need to do so.

        Antony (and Ward) - I'm about to start a wiki and would be most grateful for any advice you might give me about <a href="StartingaWiki.html">StartingaWiki</a>, doing <a href="WikiWatering.html">WikiWatering</a>, etc. Thanks in advance. -- <a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>

        It is very hard for wiki to compete against email. Email is used every day. Adding a new source and sink for information is a big marketing campaign.

        Could it be that we don't get the others?  I used to have a pet theory that it was only INTP types that took to this kind of stuff but kids seems to be jumping into it (IM, texting etc.) so maybe we've just been ahead of the game all along :)

        <dd> Rename is a good idea, especially if the links are fixed up too. For a create/delete I would just have a simple form with a data entry box for the page name. On the save take them to the page edit.</dd>

        <a href="BlackHat.html">BlackHat</a>: While it's an interesting suggestion, note that making adding pages easier could lead to the creation of <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s; making renaming and deleting pages easier could lead to a plethora of <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>s. Discussion of the mechanics and consequences of these features belongs on another page, though.

        <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>: In my many attempts to get people interested in wiki, I've found that one reason that others don't get wiki is they can't figure out how to do simple things that are obvious in other systems. If the delete cleans up <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>'s then there wouldn't be any broken links. If you want to make it hard to contribute then just make it read-only and be done with it. The pain of not having people contribute is far worse than the trivial concern of <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s.
