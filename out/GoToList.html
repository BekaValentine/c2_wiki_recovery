        Go To List

      <p>
        I have a lot of things to do today. But <a href="ToDoList.html">ToDoList</a>s go stale quick. Usually just after the first item has been semi-accomplished and you realize there's things that need to be done before you can complete the first item and you actually did the third and fourth items while you were on the way ...
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="GoToList.html">GoToList</a> starts with a list of the mess of things that are troubling you - <a href="TimeManagementIsaBitch.html">TimeManagementIsaBitch</a>. You attach labels to each item connoting the place it has to happen. Then you construct an itinerary for the day, and when you get to each place, you do the things that the list says go with that place. Much easier to maintain than a <a href="ToDoList.html">ToDoList</a> because you're geographically constrained to do it in sequence.
