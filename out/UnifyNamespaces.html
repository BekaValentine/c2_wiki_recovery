        Unify Namespaces
      </h1>
      <p>
        As a programmer... I encounter have to implement/design namespaces under many paradigms and languages (e.g. C#, java, c++, configuration files). Though some of these don't have explicit namespace declarations (e.g. COM <a href="ProgId.html">ProgId</a>'s, Apache property files), they can operate in a hierarchical naming fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think <a href="GoodDesign.html">GoodDesign</a> should logically include unifying these physically separate namespace declarations (e.g. namespaces in C#) and uses (property names in configuration files). I.e. after laying down code in various java, c# and configuration files, one should be able to pull out an overall namespace hierarchy that is consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dilemma is with the root namespaces. In Java, the de facto standard is to use a somewhat institutional category such as "org" or "com". However, in C# the de facto is to use the organizational name disregarding the institutional category.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm somewhat swayed to throw out the Institutional Category as the root simply because it seems to be irrelevant.

        <em>What we need is a </em><a href="UniversalNameSpace.html">UniversalNameSpace</a>. The <a href="UniformResourceLocator.html">UniformResourceLocator</a> was an attempt at that, at least with regard to files and other "resources" on the Web; however, it has been abused in several ways, such as mailto: (which doesn't really identify a resource).<em></em>
