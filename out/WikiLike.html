        Wiki Like
      </h1>
      <p>
        A web-page similar to a Wiki one (see <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>), or sharing with it some basic concepts (all users can edit pages and so on).

        I had a thought about Wiki-Like. I wanted to develop a Web page that browsed like a wiki, i.e. automatically create pages and link by typing <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> or using [[ - ]] type brackets and | pipes, but wasn't editable.

      <p>
        If it's not editable, how does one automatically create pages or add links? Do you mean not editable by others? In that case, investigate <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> with permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or do you mean using a wiki to create static Web pages?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or perhaps you mean using wiki syntax to write Web pages. In that case, it should be easy to write a script to translate <em>foo</em> to <em>foo</em>, [[URL|link text]] to <a href="URL">link text</a>, etc.

        <strong>Things of which </strong><a href="WikiLikeThing.html">WikiLikeThing</a>s are a part: <strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           HyperArtifact
          <ul>
            <li>
               Newly created hyperSpecification which deals, not only with what you type in, but how what you have typed in is handled. Such things as how to display it, manipulate it, store it and retrieve it. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           WikiWords: in their various rawForms are candidatesForInclusion in this special artifact.. 
        </li>
        <li>
           OtherWords: In fact, if the HyperArtifact has a HyperArtifactprocessor designed with the ability to use them as hyperLinks, even Ordinary Words, Objects, States, Events, Actuators, DateTimeWords, AcronymsAndAbbreviations, numbers, AudibleFiles, AlphanumericWords, or even Individual Characters can be included. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In line with "To define is perhaps to value" We can include them in a thing called a HyperRepository): 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           all reachableArtifacts (artifacts we know about and which become accessible at least in part), as well as 
        </li>
        <li>
           all discoverableFutureOrConnectableArtifacts, 
        </li>
      </ul>

        A prominent example of a <a href="WikiLike.html">WikiLike</a> system is <a href="http://piratepad.net,">http://piratepad.net,</a> which is an <a href="EtherPad.html">EtherPad</a> with links, created by surrounding the link text with double brackets.
        Actually it appears to be the first rudimentary EtherPadWiki. To see it in use -> <a href="LikePlusButton.html">LikePlusButton</a>.  -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>
