        Pliant Language

      <p>
        Pliant (<a href="http://pliant.cx/)">http://pliant.cx/)</a> is a programming language or rather a programming language framework.
        It's a <a href="MutableLanguage.html">MutableLanguage</a> with a <a href="GraphReWritingCompiler.html">GraphReWritingCompiler</a>.

        I followed the Pliant link above (<a href="http://pliant.cx)">http://pliant.cx)</a> It really looks like what is required: <a href="TermRewriting.html">TermRewriting</a> on an AST, code-optimization as staged rewriting rules. An AST based on SExps, but after parsing a richer language. Quite how I would have done (or wanted to do) some years ago. But it seems somewhat ad hoc. Also it is not safe (due to its use of memory and casts). I couldn't find references to current research on compilers. There were few details about the low-level <a href="CodeGeneration.html">CodeGeneration</a>, but it didn't look like state-of-the-art technology. But it really is the first project, that I have stumbled over, that succeeds to be a multiple language framework without leaving the core language.
