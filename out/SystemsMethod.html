        Systems Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        From memory (I was taught this 20 years ago now).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Systems Method (and this may not even be the right name!) involves the following steps
      </p>
      <code>
        Determine objectives<br/>
        Identify alternatives<br/>
        Evaluate and select solution<br/>
        Implement solution<br/>
        Monitor and review<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        What I see a lot of is problem definition, based around identifying the symptoms rather than identifying and reviewing the objectives.  Sometimes being clear about the objectives eliminates the problem entirely.
