        Online Persona Syndrome
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you met Elliott Coates in person, would he start a slurred and camp spiel about what a better OO designer he is?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you met James Harris, how soon would he start trying to talk you into ratifying his proof of <a href="FermatsLastTheorem.html">FermatsLastTheorem</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you met our own beloved <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>, would humanity's innate evil soon surface in conversation?

        (BTW if you met <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>, yes you <em>would</em> get a quick lecture about <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>. But he'd stop on cue ;)
