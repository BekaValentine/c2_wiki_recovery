        Neal Martin is dedicated to the Wikipedia project.  Somebody claiming to be Neal Martin has made lewd and licentious comments in Wikipedia pages, often inventing fictitious works and attributing them to prominent authors in a crude attempt at lampoons and mockery.  Neal Martin categorically rejects such gutter attempts at humor.

Neal Martin has no outstanding warrants for his arrest.  Neal Martin does not steal ketchup.
