        Manual Test
      </h1>
      <p>
        When not all tests can be automated, then there are <a href="ManualTest.html">ManualTest</a>s. This is an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> because all tests can be automated and it is usually a waste of time to perform <a href="ManualTest.html">ManualTest</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other reason to perform <a href="ManualTest.html">ManualTest</a>s is that you need to test the software as if you were the customer, for example to reproduce bugs that are assigned to you in the <a href="TaskDatabase.html">TaskDatabase</a> (or <a href="BugDatabase.html">BugDatabase</a>). This is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is usually the case that you build the software every day (<a href="DailyBuild.html">DailyBuild</a>s) or several times a day (<a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>). Every day a successful build should be put on <a href="StagingServer.html">StagingServer</a> for <a href="ManualTest.html">ManualTest</a>s. All bugs found in <a href="StagingServer.html">StagingServer</a> should be either entered into the <a href="TaskDatabase.html">TaskDatabase</a> (or <a href="BugDatabase.html">BugDatabase</a>) or either do the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> practice of <a href="CaptureBugsWithTests.html">CaptureBugsWithTests</a>.

        This may be true in some or even most programming domains, but I am currently developing J2ME games for cell phones and I must disagree most strongly. Testing games is already difficult; how do you write a test for "the graphics appear correct"? Add to that, on the phone you can't see stdout, and don't have nearly enough physical resources available to accommodate a test harness - your barely have what you need for your actual app. Even the emulators will model the severely limited heap size of the phones even if they don't restrict the jar size.

        Of course, you should keep track of the <a href="ManualTest.html">ManualTest</a>s that you perform anyway, so that you can run through the list (playing the game in an emulator) <em>as if</em> the tests were automated.
