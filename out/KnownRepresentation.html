        If there is a physical object or representation of a concept which is known to a user of a proposed/in-design system, then that representation or some graphic of the physical object must be used in the screen/dialog used to describe properties of the object.

        If you're working with a machine setup interface, pictures of the parts of the machine being set up will be most handy, almost indispensable. Digital photos, cad system images, etc. are the fastest way to strike a chord with the user, and may improve an interface dramatically.

        Also, if you are working with values which are typically shown on a time-series graph, then a representative time-series graph is necessary for users to understand what qualities they are entering or editing.

        When reading "If there is a physical object or representation of a concept which is known to a user...", be sure not to overlook the part about "...in the screen/dialog used".
        In other words, represent real world objects -- but avoid an inappropriate RealWorldMetaphor.
