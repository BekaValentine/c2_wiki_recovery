        Scoping Rules
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <em>scoping rules</em> of a <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> dictate how <a href="FreeVariable.html">FreeVariable</a>s - symbol names which are found in the body of a scope (a function, macro, class, whatever) but not defined there - are resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several different strategies exist:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Disallowing them altogether. Very rare; though some languages may disallow free references to all but a pre-defined set of symbols (often called <em>keywords</em> or <em>special forms</em>) which are provided by the language.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Only two scoping levels - global and local. <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and many assemblers use this rule. A <a href="FreeVariable.html">FreeVariable</a> defined in a C function must refer to a "global" symbol (meaning defined either at file or global scope; as opposed to within a function body). This simplifies the implementation of C greatly (and many C programmers don't miss more advanced scope rules at all). <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> sticks to the C tradition in many ways, though the presence of features such as classes and namespaces cause C++ to relax the scoping rules quite a bit. (Still, no C++ function can bind to the local variables of another C++ function). Java, with <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a>es, relaxes the scoping rules further.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>. Used by <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>, <a href="AlgolLanguage.html">AlgolLanguage</a>, <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>, and many others. If a variable isn't found in a given scope, the enclosing scope is searched; repeating until the outermost scope is reached. Two important variants of this are <a href="DeepBinding.html">DeepBinding</a> and <a href="ShallowBinding.html">ShallowBinding</a>. With <a href="DeepBinding.html">DeepBinding</a>, variables are bound to the environment of where the function is defined; with shallow binding variables are bound to the environment of where the function is called. Most languages which support <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a> support <a href="DeepBinding.html">DeepBinding</a> for functions; most macro systems (excluding Scheme's <a href="DefineSyntax.html">DefineSyntax</a>) use shallow binding. It is possible to divide <a href="DeepBinding.html">DeepBinding</a> further into two separate forms (I am not aware of any generally accepted terminology to describe these forms). In one form, a <a href="FreeVariable.html">FreeVariable</a> essentially is an alias for the actual variable in the enclosing scope; if that variable changes than the value of the variable in the function being considered also changes. (If the enclosing scope has exited, possible if <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> functions are mixed in with <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>, then the value the variable had at exit changes). Most languages which support <a href="DeepBinding.html">DeepBinding</a> support this form. In the other form; the <a href="FreeVariable.html">FreeVariable</a> takes the value that it has at the point when the function in question is first defined; and does not change. (In other words, the function using the <a href="FreeVariable.html">FreeVariable</a> makes a copy of the value provided by the enclosing scope). I'm not aware of any languages which do this for FreeVariables; though objects used as closures have this behavior.  Java <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a>es (when defined within a function) sidestep this issue by only allowing references to variables in the enclosing function which are declared to be <em>final</em> - in other words, those whose value does not change. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a> (early dialects of Lisp, <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> special variables, exported environment variables in <a href="UnixOs.html">UnixOs</a>): The caller is checked for a binding for the variable; if one is found, it is used. Otherwise, the caller's caller is checked, and so on. If no definition is found, it is either an error or a default value is used, depending on the semantics of the language.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The following C-like program illustrates the different scoping rules. Apply a different rule, that's that what would print. Of course, this is not legal C in real life, as <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> doesn't allow nested functions.
      </p>
      <code>
        int main (void)<br/>
        {<br/>
        const char *scope = "Lexical, deep, by copy ";<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void print_scope (void)<br/>
        {<br/>
        printf ("%s\n", scope);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        scope = "Lexical, deep, aliasing";<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void (*)(void) helper_func (void) /* Returns ptr to function; pretend its a closure */<br/>
        {<br/>
        const char *scope = "Lexical, shallow scoping";<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void do_print_scope (void)<br/>
        {<br/>
        print_scope();<br/>
        }<br/>
        return do_print_scope;  <br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void do_it (void)<br/>
        {<br/>
        const char *scope = "Dynamic Scoping";<br/>
        helper_func()(); /* Call the function returned by helper_func(); */<br/>
        }<br/>
        do_it();  /* Print what scoping we are using */<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

      <p>
        Another example, in pseudo <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>: (from 'Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools')
      </p>
      <code>
        program scoping;<br/>
        var r : string;<br/>
        procedure show;<br/>
        begin<br/>
        writeln(r);<br/>
        end;<br/>
        procedure scope;<br/>
        var r : string;<br/>
        begin<br/>
        r:='Dynamic';<br/>
        show;<br/>
        end;<br/>
        begin <br/>
        r:='Scope';<br/>
        show;<br/>
        r:='Lexical';<br/>
        scope;<br/>
        end.<br/>
      </code>

      <p>
        Note: C <em>does</em> use <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a> but does not allow function definitions to be nested (<em>Standard C doesn't, but GNU C does</em>). C++ also uses <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>. Namespaces and classes are just lexical scopes, like any other, as are Java <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a>es.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        int func() {<br/>
        int outer_local = 1;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        { // this block introduces a new lexical scope<br/>
        int inner_local = 2;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        printf( "%i %i\n", inner_local, outer_local );<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // inner_local is no longer in scope.<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Will print:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           1
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>The important point about C/C++ is that it doesn't allow </em>FreeVariables in one function to refer to anything defined in another function; this eliminates the need for a <a href="StaticChain.html">StaticChain</a> and/or closures.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>So this perfectly valid ISO 9899:1999 does not use </em><a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        int main() {<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {<br/>
        dosomething(i);<br/>
        }<br/>
        // i is no longer accessible.<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is not a GNU extension, this is valid C99.
        AFAIK the standard does say that blocks group a set of declarations and statements into
        a syntactic unit, and a compound statement is a block.

        Actually, C++ does allow nested functions; you just have to spell the internal function differently. The following is not legal in C++:
      </p>
      <code>
        void outer (int x) <br/>
        {<br/>
        void inner (int y);<br/>
        {<br/>
        cout << y+1;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        inner(x);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The following, however, is.
      </p>
      <code>
        void outer (int x)<br/>
        {<br/>
        class { void operator () (int y) <br/>
        {<br/>
        cout << y+1;<br/>
        } inner;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        inner(x);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In other words, functors are a great way of faking nesting functions. Of course, the functor (still) has no access to the variables defined in outer.
