        Polar Bear
      </h1>
      <p>
        A little <a href="PolarBear.html">PolarBear</a> cub says to his Mommy, "Mommy, am I really a full-blooded polar bear?" 
      </p>
      <p>
        His Mommy says to him, "Well, I'm a polar bear, and your Daddy is a polar bear, and both my parents were polar bears, and all our friends are polar bears, and I met my grandmother once and she was a polar bear. So you probably are a full-blooded polar bear."

        The little <a href="PolarBear.html">PolarBear</a> cub finds his Daddy and asks, "Daddy, am I really a full-blooded polar bear?" 
      </p>
      <p>
        His Daddy says to him, "Well, I'm a polar bear, and your Mommy is a polar bear, and both my parents were polar bears, and all our friends are polar bears, and we've always told stories about polar bears. So you probably are a full-blooded polar bear." 
      </p>
      <p>
        So the little <a href="PolarBear.html">PolarBear</a> cub asks his Daddy, "Daddy, then why is it so F***ING COLD??" 
      </p>
