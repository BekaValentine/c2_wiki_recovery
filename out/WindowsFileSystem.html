        <a href="WindowsFileSystem.html">WindowsFileSystem</a> (WinFS) "was set to be a platform for organizing, searching for and sharing all kinds of data and information. Microsoft described WinFS as a revolutionary storage platform that would include schemas for everything from images and documents, to people, tasks and events."
      </p>
      <p>
        It is said a WinFS-enabled server allows capabilities (e.g. search) to go across an entire network, no longer limited to a single PC.

        Here is something that bugs the crap out of me when I code. Given "C:\temp\readme.txt". We have computer terms for the: folder (or path or dir) "C:\temp", file "readme.txt" and extension "txt". But we don't have a word for the whole thing "C:\temp\readme.txt". If you call it a file, people may think its "readme.txt". So what do you call it? We really need to come up with a new term. Sorry for being slightly offtopic but there's no wiki for FileNamingConventions. <em>How about "filespec"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn't that the full path (or just the path) of the file? "c:\temp" is the path to the folder containing the file, not the path to the file itself. At least that's how I see things...
