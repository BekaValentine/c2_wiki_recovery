           I haven't been active for a few years, but gained a lot of valuable insight during my travels here.

           I enjoy telling the story of this Wiki, as many people seem to assume <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> is the one and only.

           I support <a href="NoNamesPlease.html">NoNamesPlease</a> and might just start a <a href="WikiMindWipe.html">WikiMindWipe</a>. If we eliminate name-ownership it supports focus on creating a <a href="PositiveDialogueCommunity.html">PositiveDialogueCommunity</a>, and in the end I'd rather see the discussion advance than have people arguing over credit for who invented a thought first.
