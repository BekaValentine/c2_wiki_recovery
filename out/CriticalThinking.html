        Critical thinking clarifies goals, examines assumptions, discerns hidden values, evaluates evidence, accomplishes actions, and assesses conclusions

        I think <a href="CriticalThinking.html">CriticalThinking</a> is different from <a href="CriticalSpirit.html">CriticalSpirit</a> as it exist, on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> around <a href="OctoberZeroFive.html">OctoberZeroFive</a>. To me <a href="CriticalThinking.html">CriticalThinking</a> requires a few key conditions, and having a <a href="CriticalSpirit.html">CriticalSpirit</a> could be one of these ingredients.

        But what people call "critical thinking" differs widely. For example, I often use economic models to select one choice over another. But I often get flak for this for reasons that so far escape me, but appear to be a form of <a href="ArgumentByElegance.html">ArgumentByElegance</a> to me. My point is that an economic argument is not "critical thinking" to the other party. People start from a different base.
