        Face To Face Regularly
      </h1>
      <p>

        It's frequently useful to have selected team members (<em>not</em> just managers) fly to each other's site to meet <a href="FaceToFaceRegularly.html">FaceToFaceRegularly</a>.  This has the following advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Team members can get to know their colleauges better; rather than just being a voice on the phone or a face on the videoconference.  Neither can replace true FaceTime.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Team members can learn about the environmental and work conditions at the other site.  Many "satellite" offices aren't as well equipped as the main office.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you practice this pattern, a few recommendations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Travel should be bi-directional; not just the satellite offices visiting the home office (if such an arrangement exists).  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Visiting workers should be provided with (workplace) accomodations similar to what other workers (of equal rank or station) at that site enjoy.  If the locals get a cubicle with their own phone line and desk, so should the visitors.  If, OTOH, all developers work at a common bench loaded with computers, so should the visitors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Respect the wishes of employees who prefer not to travel, especially to foreign countries.  Some folks are better dealing with <a href="CultureShock.html">CultureShock</a> than others.
        </li>
      </ul>
