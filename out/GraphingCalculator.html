        A piece of mathematical software, originally for the <a href="PowerMac.html">PowerMac</a>, now developed by a company called Pacific Tech (<a href="http://www.pacifict.com).">http://www.pacifict.com).</a> It has a somewhat unusual history of how it was created - see <a href="http://www.pacifict.com/Story/">http://www.pacifict.com/Story/</a> for details, or go to <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/</a> and search the archives for "Should I Stay Or Should I Go". Basically, the developer kept working on it at Apple, after having been fired by Apple, but that summary doesn't do it justice. There ought to be lessons in it.
