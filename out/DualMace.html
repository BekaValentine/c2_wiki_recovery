        Dual Mace
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="GregMansfield.html">GregMansfield</a> wrote Mace for the CDC6000 series computers. It cleaned up a lot of junk in Scope, CDC's official OS.

        <a href="PurdueComputingCenter.html">PurdueComputingCenter</a> latched on to Mace and pretty much made it their own.  VicAbell knew Mace through and through. He tweaked the scheduler regularly, always upping the monthly job count as a result.  <a href="DualMace.html">DualMace</a> was his masterpiece. It scheduled jobs among three processors, two in a 6500 and one more fast one in a 6600.

        The CDC also had ten <a href="PeripheralProcessors.html">PeripheralProcessors</a> (PPs) which did all the system work, including I/O.  <a href="JimBesemer.html">JimBesemer</a> tells the story of learning to program the CDC.  Reading the assembler manual he had found one I/O instruction, PAGE, which would start output on a new page.  He thought surely this would be handy should he ever find a way to produce output in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course how to do I/O wasn't written down anywhere. The skill was passed on father to son. <a href="DaveDodson.html">DaveDodson</a> taught me how to do I/O by waking up a PP and passing it a <a href="CircularBuffer.html">CircularBuffer</a>. CDC programs buffered output within the user's address space.  This was particularly un-handy when a program crashed.  You got all of your output except that in the buffer.  This is the exact opposite of a <a href="LogicAnalyzer.html">LogicAnalyzer</a> which gives you only what's in the buffer.
