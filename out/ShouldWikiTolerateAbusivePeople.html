        Should Wiki Tolerate Abusive People
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some believe heavily in <a href="CriticizeBluntly.html">CriticizeBluntly</a> and constantly insult people personally, not just their ideas. Should the wiki community tolerate such activity? Occasional flair-ups are expected, but relentless personal insults just create a "hostile working environment" and serve no useful purpose. <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> can apply to insults also.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Let's narrow this to personal insults since the potential scope of "bad behavior" is very wide.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Such as people who use phrases like "eff off", and "he got my goat", and "you're just a lowly academic", and... Yeah, should wiki tolerate such Top (bottom) minded people?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Just for comparison: This wiki tolerated <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a> quite a long time and he was the prototype of abusive people. So I guess Top is well in the tolerated range. Actually I consider him not really abusive though agree that he gets that if the debate gets heated, but then both sides have their share in it I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The irony is that I think Top created this page,  as if he is complaining that </em>'other people<em>' are the problem. It's not other people, it's everyone, or it is Top himself too. He creates the page, as if he is the angel. In fact he is a hypocrite. We all are a bit hypocritical, but we have to watch ourselves in the mirror closely...</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this wiki must tolerate abusive people to a larger degree than society at large because it focusses on topics that require (or usually come with) a deep technical insight which is usually found in people that spend lots of time on these issues. And this often causes self-confidence (otherwise they would have left a long time ago, they piles success on success by this strategy). And self-confidence correlates with arrogance and hypocrisy.
