        Facet Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Intent:</strong> <em>Restrict</em> an interface to obtain a smaller interface that provides less authority. Usually the smaller interface has only a subset of the methods, or allows only a subset of parameter values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facets are used as a security pattern in <a href="CapabilityOrientedProgramming.html">CapabilityOrientedProgramming</a>, in order to
        satisfy the <a href="PrincipleOfLeastAuthority.html">PrincipleOfLeastAuthority</a>. For example, if some client of an object only needs to
        be able to read information from it, that client should be provided with a <em>read-only facet</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facets should be implemented in such a way that if methods are added to the original interface, they are <em>not</em> added by default to the facet. The methods to be included in a facet should have to be explicitly indicated (although this could be by metadata or a naming convention).
      </p>
      <p>
        If it is known in advance which facets of an object will be needed, the object can cache them
        as an optimization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like other <a href="SecurityPattern.html">SecurityPattern</a>s, <a href="FacetPattern.html">FacetPattern</a> can be used to improve robustness or safety, even when security <em>per se</em> is not an issue. It may also be useful in some cases to provide a deterministic or purely functional subset of an interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        A facet differs from an adapter (<a href="AdapterPattern.html">AdapterPattern</a>) in that the facet interface is always a subset of the original interface, and the purpose is to restrict authority rather than to translate between incompatible interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FacetPattern.html">FacetPattern</a> is one of several patterns that use "wrapper objects" or the "handle/body idiom". See <a href="HandleBodyPattern.html">HandleBodyPattern</a>.

        There is a <a href="CompactForm.html">CompactForm</a> definition of the Facet pattern at <a href="http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2002/final/plop2002_ecrahen0_0.pdf.">http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2002/final/plop2002_ecrahen0_0.pdf.</a>

        <em>That is not </em><a href="FacetPattern.html">FacetPattern</a> as described here. It appears to be <a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a>.<em></em>
