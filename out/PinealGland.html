        Pineal Gland
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>A small organ in the human brain of unknown function, though many modern theories connect it to melatonin levels and mood</em>

        Many mystical schools hold that the function of the pineal gland is not <em>biological</em> but <em>spiritual</em>; it is often referred to as the 'Third Eye'. It is sometimes said to be the seat of the soul.

      <p>
        Among Discordians, the Pineal Gland is seen as the source of (or at least a metaphor for) inspiration, insight, epiphany, and creative problem-solving, as well as the means by which one communes with Eris. The phrase 'consult your pineal gland' is a common way of recommending that one meditate upon (in the sense of 'consider carefully') the meaning of something, often added after a reference to a source of information on the topic; it implies that sudden insight, perhaps of a psychic or even Divine nature, would be an alternative to study.

        This use is generally <a href="HaHaOnlySerious.html">HaHaOnlySerious</a> in tone. See <a href="DirkGentlyNavigationMethod.html">DirkGentlyNavigationMethod</a> for an example of this idiom.

        If prodded enough, a frog can allegedly grow a third eye here.
