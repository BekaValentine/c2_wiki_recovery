        Velocity Vs Load Factor
      </h1>
      <p>
        A deprecated part of <a href="XpPlanningTerminology.html">XpPlanningTerminology</a>, <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> is replaced by <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a>.  By <a href="MeasuringProjectVelocity.html">MeasuringProjectVelocity</a> and applying some <a href="LoadFactorArithmetic.html">LoadFactorArithmetic</a>, the <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> converts the estimated <a href="IdealProgrammingTime.html">IdealProgrammingTime</a> into an estimate of actual time expected to be spent on a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>.

        <dd><a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> is the inverse of velocity. If I estimate in ideal weeks (which I do before I have comparables), then my load factor is the ratio between those estimates and how long it actually takes me. For me this is between 2 and 5, depending on what else is going on. If my load factor is 3 and I have 3 week iterations, then my velocity is 1.</dd>

        <dd>The confusion comes because we recently started using velocity exclusively, ignoring load factor. For example, I just got back from iteration planning with a client who got 30 days worth of tasks done in iteration 1 (out of 39 committed) then 35 done in iteration 2 (out of 36). They committed to 36 days worth of tasks for iteration 3.</dd>

        <dd>Velocity is Effort/Time.  It is the true amount of effort you get done per unit time.  Usually the denominator is the duration of an iteration. In that case Velocity becomes the amount of work you can get done in an iteration.  Some folks use "Day" or "Week" in the denominator.  </dd>

        Iterations are scheduled in calendar weeks not ideal weeks.

        <em>An estimate for a </em><a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> card should be 1-3 weeks? Calendar weeks or ideal weeks?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Stories need to be mapped to <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s. Ideal time estimates are
        placed on <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s.

        In their planning process, <a href="DoIt.html">DoIt</a> uses <a href="IdealTime.html">IdealTime</a> estimates for each ImpliedRequirement.  This raises another interesting question: how does ImpliedRequirement relate to <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> from a granularity perspective?  <a href="IdealTime.html">IdealTime</a> is sometimes called UninterruptedDaysToCompletion. Then we need a factor to turn the <a href="IdealTime.html">IdealTime</a> into CalendarTime. The factor was originally called a DistractionFactor, but that had too much negative connotation -- not to mention it is not a very accurate description. The formula basically is:
      </p>
      <p>
        CalendarTime = <a href="IdealTime.html">IdealTime</a> / DistractionFactor  -- the only other complexity is converting from <a href="IdealTime.html">IdealTime</a> to CalendarTime, adjusting for weekends and holidays
      </p>
      <p>
        Our experience tells us that a DistractionFactor of about 50%. In other words, we double <a href="IdealTime.html">IdealTime</a> to get <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had lately taken to calling this measure <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a>; but it sounds like this means something different to the posters on this page?
      </p>
      <p>
        The main reason the statistic is important is because we can estimate better in <a href="IdealTime.html">IdealTime</a>, but we need a way to convert to CalendarTime.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I guess I missed the point about Ideal Time. How should I calculate <a href="IdealTime.html">IdealTime</a>? In estimating, I usually try to take an actual time from a similar task and use that. Blindly multiplying an estimate by some correction factor just seems to be a highly unreliable way to estimate to me. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
