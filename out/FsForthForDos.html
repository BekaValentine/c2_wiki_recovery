        Fs Forth For Dos
      </h1>
      <p>
        - FS/Forth for DOS - 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the following basic attributes which describes FS/Forth for DOS:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Global Runtime Environment 
          <ul>
            <li>
               64KB shared data and code dictionary space 
            </li>
            <li>
               Code and data grow upwards in memory; stacks and block buffers grow downwards 
            </li>
            <li>
               16-bit native code generation with subroutine threading and inline assembly sequences. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Linked list dictionary structure (will optimize this later as necessary) 
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>FORTH</strong> wordlist contains words accessible to both interpreter and compiler 
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>COMPILER</strong> wordlist contains words that implement the compiler. Defining new words in this wordlist extends compiler. Think LISP macros. Replacement for <strong>IMMEDIATE</strong> words in other Forth environments. Cleaner, more readable, better organized code. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Applications can have application-specific words; these words are not accessible to the interactive Forth interpreter or to the compiler. An application must search these wordlists as it sees fit. <strong>FINDWORD</strong> will accomplish this. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Text mode; 80x25 or 80x50, whichever state DOS left the screen in last. 
            </li>
            <li>
               An application has full control over the screen when it has display focus. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Applications usually call a word to render the screen's title bar. Doing this is considered good form. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Usually, the application with display focus will also have input (keyboard and mouse) focus as well. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Multiple applications can be loaded and running concurrently; only one has display focus at any given time 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Storage/Persistence 
          <ul>
            <li>
               A flat block space ranging from 0 to 65535 offers up to 64MB of persistent storage. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Ranges of blocks maps to individual files in the filesystem for maximum flexibility 
            </li>
            <li>
               Each file can be up to 1000 blocks long. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Files longer than 1000 blocks will appear to only be 1000 blocks long in FS/Forth. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Up to 64 files can be opened at a time. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Multitasking 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Number of concurrently running tasks limited only by available dictionary space. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Cooperative multitasking: <strong>PAUSE</strong> forces a reschedule. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Explicit task control: <strong>SLEEP</strong> puts a task to sleep, while <strong>WAKE</strong> unconditionally wakes it up again. 
            </li>
            <li>
               When tasks are created, they start out in the <strong>SLEEP</strong> state. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Wake-up predicates are used to conditionally wake a task without depending on another calling <strong>WAKE</strong> for you. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>HLT</strong> instruction called if no tasks are eligible for running. Saves power; reduces heat generation. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>EVENT</strong> is used to flag a need to call wake-up predicates; it notifies other tasks that a potentially interesting event has occurred. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
