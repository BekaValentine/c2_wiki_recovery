        In an attempt to make this my "central" personal Wiki page, I am transferring some content from other Wiki pages around the world to here where appropriate and pointing to those pages in other cases.

        <strong>What</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I write at <a href="http://www.jbrains.ca">http://www.jbrains.ca</a> and <a href="http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com">http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           I brought XP Day to North America co-organising five conferences from 2005 to 2007.
        </li>
        <li>
           I wrote a book called "JUnit Recipes" (ISBN 1932394230).
        </li>
        <li>
           I worked on a project with Toyota Canada Inc., which began as an XP project coached by <a href="MikeBowler.html">MikeBowler</a>. The corporate environment was not well-suited to XP, even though the project's planning and technical needs made XP an obvious choice. I estimate that we worked as an XP project for almost three months before we started slowly abandoning the XP practices, one by one. While I worked with Toyota, we stopped pair programming, stand-up meetings and collaborative design. Just after I left the project, automated unit testing was stopped. Although the overall experience was not positive, I learned a great deal about XP.
        </li>
        <li>
           In response to complaints about the scarcity of tutorials on <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a>, I wrote one in 2001, which I didn't understand at the time acted as a precursor to JUnit Recipes.
        </li>
        <li>
           I spent six months doing "XP for One" at IBM's Toronto Lab. I was the only member of my team and my manager helped with the planning. My technical customers were other developers working on my product, <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> Commerce. I described my experience in another presentation located on my web site.
        </li>
        <li>
           I contributed regularly the <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> mailing list from 2000 until approximately 2007.
        </li>
        <li>
           As a response to witnessing repeated abuses of the <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>, I wrote an article in 2001 offering alternatives to Singleton. <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/co-single.html">http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/co-single.html</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Why</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I value XP because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I want a sane work/life balance.
        </li>
        <li>
           I want to do quality work with quality people.
        </li>
        <li>
           I want to give the customer what they need.
        </li>
      </ul>
