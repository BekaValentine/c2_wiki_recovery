        Sorry for the slow response.  My home IP has not had the edit code word for about a week and I have been off work.  In general I do not like to edit at work so I will keep my response brief.

        I have a Ph.D in Mathematics.  I have worked as a C++ programmer and project manager for C++ programmers.  Currently I work as an economist ( <a href="DomainKnowledge.html">DomainKnowledge</a> expert ).

        I am a <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a> and express an impulse to improve and contribute by acting as a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>.  I hope my edits are not noise to people.

        July 28th - Once again my Comcast cable IP address seems to be in a range which does not receive the <a href="EditCodeWord.html">EditCodeWord</a>. I briefly had the edit rights in June and early July.  I can of course edit at work but I don't like to do anything but simple <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> edits at work because I assume my internet communication is logged.  - <a href="ScottChastain.html">ScottChastain</a>
