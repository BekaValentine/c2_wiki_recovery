        Specific And General Problem Solving
      </h1>

        <em>(Polya, I think, argues that it is sometimes easier to solve a more general problem than it is to solve a specific one -- BT)</em>

        A good example of solving a general problem for me is <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>. It would have simplified a host of solutions I wrote in the last five years. However, I couldn't have imagined <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> until I wrote all those less-good-solutions. I just can't do it. Maybe someone else is smart enough, but I'm not.

        XP says to solve the most general problem you can imagine (<a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>). But don't halt progress just because you imagine there might be a general solution out there that you haven't discovered yet. Trust that when insight comes, your <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>'s and <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> and <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> are up to the task of retrofitting the more general solution.

        I watched my kids interact with Italian-speaking kids of the same age.  Mine would just speak English; the Italian kids would speak Italian.  After three days, my kids spoke a few words of Italian, and the Italian kids spoke a few words of English.  If this continued for a few months, obviously everybody would've been able to speak both languages.  But this all happened without charts or graphs or grammar rules.

        This is analogous to the process I follow- get the behavior you want (as specified by <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>'s), then discover the "right" structure for the logic you have.
      </p>

        I am experimenting with this right now. I am writing a stock trading simulation, <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> with my 14-year-old daughter. Having just worked on a big unit-linked life insurance system, I "know exactly" how to design it. However, I am forcing myself to just take it a unit test at a time. The result is a surprise- simpler than I thought and different objects than I thought. And this is for a system I KNOW how to design. Imagine if I was developing something for the first time.

        All that said (or rather, rambled), there is a place for solving a more general problem than you have. If I am completely stuck making piecemeal progress, then I ask the question "What object would I need in order to make this code simple?" But this is a last resort for me- first I take a walk, switch partners, read science fiction, or go home for the day.
