        Fun exercise. Try to write this class with no branches. You can add as many classes as you like:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Silly { int function (int n) { return n < 5 ? n : 0; } };<br/>

        No branches, polymorphism, library functions, tables, etc. No conditional branches in generated code either.

        OK, I just found this Exercise, but you don't rule out language-specific
        answers, so in C++ I could replace:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Silly { int function (int n) { return n < 5 ? n : 0; } }; <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        with
      </p>
      <code>
        class Silly { int function (int n) { return n * (n < 5); } };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The "trick" is that in C and C++, booleans are integers. In my misspent youth I used to use this sort of trick a lot in BASIC, but many BASICs use -1 as TRUE, so a little more math is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If FALSE == 0 and TRUE == -1 (all bits set), as in </em><a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>, then the trick becomes more efficient:<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        : FUNCTION   DUP 5 < AND ;     \ n & ( n < 5 )<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>or ported back to C:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        class Silly { int function(int n) { return n & -(n < 5); } };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>This idiom was published in </em><a href="ThinkingForth.html">ThinkingForth</a>, and is probably well known to <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> programmers.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In APL it's such common practice that it doesn't even justify being called a trick. For more type-fascist languages like Java, you'd need to convert the boolean to an int in some other way, say: 
      </p>
      <code>
        import java.util.*;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Silly { <br/>
        static Vector v = new Vector(); <br/>
        static {<br/>
        v.addElement(new Boolean(false));<br/>
        v.addElement(new Boolean(true));<br/>
        }<br/>
        int function (int n) { <br/>
        return n * v.indexOf(new Boolean(n < 5)) ; <br/>
        } <br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>

        We could do the same in Smalltalk by writing asNumber methods in True
        and False that return 1 and 0 respectively, and then giving the Silly
        class the method

        Reading the requirements as "Rewrite <em>this</em> class with no branches,"
        is it not unreasonable to take advantage of a branch in an existing,
        standard class?

        Not wishing to get on my high horse here, but has anyone else applied any XP-style unit tests to this problem?  I can't say with surety, as I don't know all the details of all the languages in use, but I can't believe that
        some of the "solutions" above actually have the same semantics as the original.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ron's, (just for example, nothing personal) originally had an <a href="OffByOne.html">OffByOne</a> error (it returned 5 rather than 0 for an input of 5) and many of the solutions seem to return 0 or even crash for negatives. I know it's only a "Fun Exercise", but I wouldn't dream of publishing any code without unit testing it. Especially as the original page was all about safe techniques for refactoring. Please prove me wrong.

        This page was made, what? A year ago? Anyway, I think that Frank's is the most elegant so far. Dave and Ron are cheating terribly by using high level language features. That only means that they will get the job done rather than game around like us. Poor guys :) And Frank is right. The original code allows negatives. Does this mean that source code is a poor <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>? Or, that people who do puzzles are apt to see things mathematically and assume a domain that is convenient?

        Most of the solutions above seem to involve branches in non-obvious places, either in built-in language features or in base library implementations. I would really look at the assembler code that is actually executed. I think, the only valid solution would be one that took advantage of the fact that booleans are ints on some low level. Then, a comparison and a multiplication suffice. Otherwise, there <em>will</em> be a branch somewhere. So <a href="FrankCarver.html">FrankCarver</a>'s first solution is valid and his second isn't. (There will be branches in the implementation of indexof.) Even polymorphic implementations in an OO language will use branches for message dispatch. -- <a href="HaskoHeinecke.html">HaskoHeinecke</a>

        I agree with the previous statement whole heartedly.
        Even the statement
      </p>
      <code>
        int A =  n<5; <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Does on many machine architectures with some compilers result in assembly instructions that are branches. For example it is only on later Intel Chips that the 'set' function is added to the instruction set. Before that time compilers (usually (On all compilers I saw)) generated branches to create the boolean = 1 out of flags set by cmp instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question remains what the most portable solution?
      </p>
      <p>
        I offer the following C version while it does not quite fullfill the specification of the class requirement it was hard to test the private member function :).
      </p>
      <code>
        #define SIGN_SHFT(n) (sizeof(n)*CHAR_BIT-1)<br/>
        #define BRANCHLESS_LE_COMPARE(n1,n2) ((n1 | n1-n2) >> SIGN_SHFT(int n) & 1)<br/>
        int function(int n) {  return BRANCHLESS_LE_COMPARE(n,5) * n; }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that in the best tradition of obscure C code hacks there are no comments and at least two macros.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I can tell this is portable to ALL two's complement based machines.

        Does the second one of these work?
        The L to Str stores a binary littele endian version of the long
        It will surely store  0 2 0 0 for (long)512
        The Str to L test for NULL termination!!!
        So the reverse conversion gives back 0

        I really like this solution as it is really OO and solves the problem using Classes, not by using a library function or some broken math or implicit casting of boolean to int.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately it's not so easy to translate this to Java, because Boolean is final and you can't add methods to existing classes like in Smalltalk.

        This works, using an InstanceInitialisationBlock to make it more interesting:
      </p>
      <code>
        static interface My {<br/>
        public int n_if_TRUE_0_if_FALSE(int n);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        final static Map<Boolean, My> bools = new <a href="HashMap.html">HashMap</a><Boolean, My>() {<br/>
        {<br/>
        put(Boolean.TRUE, <br/>
        new My() { public int n_if_TRUE_0_if_FALSE(int n) { return n; }; });<br/>
        put(Boolean.FALSE, <br/>
        new My() { public int n_if_TRUE_0_if_FALSE(int n) { return 0; }; });<br/>
        }<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        int eval(boolean b, int n) {<br/>
        return bools.get(b).n_if_TRUE_0_if_FALSE(n);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void test() {<br/>
        for(int i=-10; i<=10; i++ ) {<br/>
        System.out.println("i: " + i + " eval: " + eval(i<5,i));<br/>
        }<br/>

        Of course, under appropriate circumstances, you can push this computation to compile-time, and avoid branches by forcing compile-time constants into the run-time executable:
      </p>
      <code>
        namespace silly { namespace detail {<br/>
        template <int, bool> struct domain         { enum { range = 0 }; }; // OUT-OF-RANGE<br/>
        template <int N>     struct domain<N,true> { enum { range = N }; }; // IN-RANGE<br/>
        } }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        namespace silly {<br/>
        template <int N> struct function {<br/>
        enum { value = detail::helper< N, (N < 5) >::value };<br/>
        };<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and unit test...
      </p>
      <code>
        // Compile/link-time conditional checking.<br/>
        template <bool> struct static_assert;          // UNIMPLEMENTED for FALSE case.<br/>
        template <>     struct static_assert<true> {}; // IMPLEMENTED for TRUE case.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        int main() {<br/>
        static_assert< silly::function<-3>::value == -3 >();<br/>
        static_assert< silly::function<4>::value == 4	>();<br/>
        static_assert< silly::function<5>::value == 5	>(); // FAILS when uncommented<br/>
        static_assert< silly::function<5>::value == 0	>(); // SUCCEEDS<br/>

        Here's my version. The operating principle is the truncation-rounding of integer division in C. How I worked out the polynomials is an exercise for the reader. ;) Of course, this won't work for large (in absolute value) n because of integer overflow. You can fix that with some bit-masking hackery (to limit the values) but then you may as well just take the quoted approach.

        <em>What language is that, and in what sense is this not branching?</em> It's <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>, and it's not branching because nothing (except for the details of current implementations) says that this function couldn't be compiled into something like <a href="FrankCarver.html">FrankCarver</a>'s code, and there are no branches in the high-level code.

        The behavior near the INT_MIN boundary gets a little weird, but this handles most cases (nothing like old vanilla C to bend the brain):
      </p>
      <code>
        int function(int n)<br/>
        {<br/>
        return n * ( ((n - 5) < 0) & 1 );<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The "& 1" helps just in case the compiler doesn't guarantee (true == 1), though it does assume an odd return. I suppose I could divide:
      </p>
      <code>
        return n * ( ((n - 5) < 0) / ((n - 5) < 0) );<br/>
      </code>

        <em>Seems to me it has a divide by zero feel to it</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely the main obstacle is the possibility that 5 - n (or n - 5) causes overflow when evaluated, which would trip up several of the above "tested" solutions.
