        If you are interested in who is writing and <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>ing most, you can process all the ChangesInWeek pages as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        for i in `wget -q -O - "<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=ChangesInWeek">http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=ChangesInWeek</a>"`<br/>
        do<br/>
        sleep 1;wget -q -O - "<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?$i">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?$i</a>"<br/>
        done |<br/>
        awk '/\. \. \./{ split($0, a, ". . . . . . ."); print a[2]; }' | <br/>
        sort | uniq -c | sort -nr<br/>
      </code>

        This will show the most active <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> on top (but may take some time). -- .gz

        It fetches just 53 pages, that's not that much (though I agree, that these are not the smallest ones). What would you propose? Should I insert a sleep between the fetches? -- .gz

        <em>Certainly it needs a sleep between the fetches. You also need to process the first fetch to turn it into a list of pages. Currently, this version, as stated, returns HTML with links. It also doesn't take into account the "only the last editor is mentioned" problem. I use the RSS feed for this.</em>

        It was a quick hack and worked (it really did). Processing the first page isn't necessary as the non-links just generate 404er and are filtered out later. "Last editor mentioned problem" isn't really a problem, because it averages out (in a way). What's much worse is that ips and user names are not matched. It's enough to get an impression. -- .gz
