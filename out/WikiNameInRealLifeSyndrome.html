        I may be the only person to suffer with this, but from time to time I have found my self writing key technical terms as <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> in documents. This came to a head when I found that I had <em>hand written</em> DentalAppointment in my diary.

        But isn't it heartening to note that more and more businesses use TradeMarks written in the same way... before we know it all CompoundWords in the <a href="OxfordEnglishDictionary.html">OxfordEnglishDictionary</a> will be written as <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>. -- <a href="GarethCronin.html">GarethCronin</a>

        I actually find it useful that <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> become engraved... when it gets tough, thinking things like '<a href="RefactorLowHangingFruit.html">RefactorLowHangingFruit</a>' are a godsend... -- <a href="ShaunSmith.html">ShaunSmith</a>

        If this keeps up, English will be an <a href="AgglutinativeLanguage.html">AgglutinativeLanguage</a> like Turkish and Hungarian. <a href="DoublePlusUnGood.html">DoublePlusUnGood</a>!

        <em>It would have helped my reading of Orwell's </em><a href="NineteenEightyFour.html">NineteenEightyFour</a> if he <em>had</em> used the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> "<a href="NewSpeak.html">NewSpeak</a>" instead of "Newspeak". I mistakenly parsed the latter as "news speak", and spent most of the book wondering how the language was supposedly geared toward news. Using a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> would have made the mistake impossible. A rare case, true, but I would have appreciated it.<em></em>

        Another approach: <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> are CombinationsOfWords which constitute a singular entity or concept. as in <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a> is a separate and distinct individual, <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> is a call for an explanation or an answer to a question, again singular. A DentalAppointment is singular (a commitment of a block of time - both of the patient and the dentist). It is in fact closer to the way the mind conceives of things. When we see a tree that produces apples, the thought is AppleTree.

        It is a UsefulDevice when used for WikiPageTitles and for <a href="HyperLink.html">HyperLink</a>s, so it should not seem strange that the usefulness of <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> should not carry into usage in <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a>. Perhaps InTheFuture the usage of words like <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> will become so widespread that dictionaries will carry the meaning of words used singly and also those used as a conglomerate. In a sense, though this <a href="WikiIsNotaDictionary.html">WikiIsNotaDictionary</a>, a page in this wiki can become a definition of the meaning and usage of a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>.

        I use <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> for more and more things in <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a>, thinking prophylactically, there might one day be a page for that issue in my or another's Wiki, so better too many than too few <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>. - As I am a German native speaker I am used to building CompoundWords and use UpperCase for every nominative, so I liked the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> convention right away. - My philosophy: The <a href="GermanLanguage.html">GermanLanguage</a> should adopt from <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> the UpperCase inside a word and the <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a> should adopt the CompoundWords, as part of the process of an emerging WorldLanguage. I imagine, in the future, everybody writing many issues as <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>, making them a standard. Yep! There is RealLifeInWikiNames!

        Generative grammar as practiced by linguists like <a href="JimMcCawley.html">JimMcCawley</a> treats individual words (lexical items) as having the same "internal" structure as syntactic constituents such as noun phrases (<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>) or verb phrases (<a href="RefactorLowHangingFruit.html">RefactorLowHangingFruit</a>). -- <a href="TomRossen.html">TomRossen</a>

        I just wrote a few e-mails in which I wanted to include table information. I immediately -- and without conscious realization of it -- wrote TWiki tables. In other words, I put
