        <strong>Q:</strong> If cgi/ doesn't work and cgi-bin/ does, isn't that a problem on the server side?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes. The server needs to read/write cookies for the whole c2.com domain (and any subdomains).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Is the <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie system secure?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> No. Using a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> is entirely optional and is not meant as a form of login. There is no validation. It is easy for anyone to enter another's name, but it's rude.  <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> rudely spoofs <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>s on a regular basis, and the consequence is the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>/<a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>. The <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie is thus no longer safe to use until a real authentication system is put into place.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Why would I want to be identified?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Several reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           To make connections both to ideas and to people.
        </li>
        <li>
           To show responsibility for changes.
        </li>
        <li>
           To claim ownership of particular text so others don't change one's words without permission (discounting spelling and grammar corrections, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
           Courtesy, egotism, provocation -- many other reasons both valid and invalid. Just ask around.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Q:</strong> <a href="WhyDoesMyUserNameDisappear.html">WhyDoesMyUserNameDisappear</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> There are several possible reasons, some of which have to do with the way your browser handles cookies. (<a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a> users see the <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> page.) If you are using a cookie cleaner or session-only cookie manager your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> will disappear every time you exit your browser. Also, your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> will disappear once the cookie has expired.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> My cookie expires December 31, 2004. Then what?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> All old <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookies expired December 31, 2004. c2.com does not make use of expired cookies, your own browser probably deletes them, and your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> disappears. Fresh cookies were instituted in early 2005. Have c2.com set a fresh cookie for your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> How can I tell if I have a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> before I save an edit and check <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Go to <a href="http:wikiOptions">http:wikiOptions</a> to set the <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie for paths under <a href="http://c2.com/cgi.">http://c2.com/cgi.</a> Most browsers let you view cookies; on Safari it is in Preferences > Security > Show Cookies.
