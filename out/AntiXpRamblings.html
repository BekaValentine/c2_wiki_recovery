        From: Krasicki
      </p>
      <p>
        As a matter of introduction, my experience with methodologies began in
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           in the integration of <a href="CaseTool.html">CaseTool</a>s and has continued for the past dozen years as occasional
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        methodologist, systems architect, and developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that time, I have worked as a project-to-project software contractor
        and have seen these methodologies and techniques bastardized in hundreds
        of sometimes reprehensible, amusing, or creative ways. The following
        comments are based on summary readings of Extreme Programming
        literature, voluminous forum postings on the subject, and
        an article called The New Methodology (see:
        <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html),">http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html),</a>
        <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> describes many of the assumptions and philosophical
        perimeters of what are becoming known as <a href="LightweightMethodologies.html">LightweightMethodologies</a>
        (LWM).
      </p>
      <p>
        I commend Mr. Bernard on his initial attempt to apply legitimate
        standards of expectation, measure, and semantics to the conversations
        about the merits of these LWMs. In the many years that I've been
        associated with IEEE and ACM, I've found their discussions of these
        topics to be intellectually lively, creative, and accurate. I would like
        to add some additional observations that I hope may stimulate a broader
        discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most obvious characteristics of the literature discussing
        LWMs is that many of the authors suffer from mutual-admiration-society
        syndrome. There is an annoying dependency on circular logic and
        self-insulating reference (Joe thinks Bill's ideas are great,
        Bill thinks my ideas are great, I think Joe's ideas are great, and so
        on). In many cases, examples of methodology deployment deceivingly point
        interested parties in the direction of companies who profit from the
        publication or training of professionals in the very thing that they are
        being cited for. This is always a dubious practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advent of lightweight methodologies is not surprising. A dozen years
        ago, CASE tools were intended to elevate the masses of programmers into
        a new hybrid information age worker sometimes referred to as a knowledge
        engineer. Knowledge engineers, armed with code-generating CASE tools
        would soon out-perform and render mere programmers obsolete. IBM's
        Visual Age tools are today's revised implementation of that ideal.
        Today, just as I did a dozen years ago, I wonder how many programmers
        can think in the necessary abstractions of design AND code. Contemporary
        IT vendor-speak often takes this for granted as if all programming
        activity, by definition, IS design.
      </p>
      <p>
        There never seems to be any doubt that software design is a by-product
        of coding activity. Some of us think software and product design is much
        more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        A LWM such as Extreme programming's solution to this problem is that if
        you cannot grow another head on each programmer, simply make all design
        and coding activity a shared experience.
        In this scenario, one person codes while the other observes, coaches, or
        simply provides the second opinion or designer role. Coders and Software
        designers are interchangeable entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, ALL design and coding is done just-in-time.
        Lightweight methodologies like extreme programming are highly
        existential in that the only design decisions that matter are those that
        exist at the moment and, intentionally or not, are reactionary
        in nature to some recently triggered event (design consideration, bug,
        itch). The customer and programming team are tightly coupled and achieve
        design objectives in waves of relatively immediate gratification. There
        is no unnecessary baggage like a requirements specification or even a
        design specification to slow down these locomotives of productivity. Oh,
        and BTW, if you are a programmer that prefers developing code privately,
        through research, good practice, solitude - that's okay - you just can't
        do it in most extreme programming environments. That is unless the rules
        change and programmers make all the rules - whenever.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is obvious and ominous is that programming for couples is a new
        idea and one that will introduces some very interesting psychological
        and corporate policy challenges. LWM proponents are still buzy
        formalizing the details of managing sick days, vacation time,
        tight schedules and the like. Needless to say, where there's a will
        there's a book, a whitepaper, at the very least a certification exam -
        whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what about the methodologies? These can be best described as a hybrid
        set of well-known programming practices infused with a "fast" start-up
        attitude and decorated with a refreshing social agenda (no more than 40
        hour weeks, programmers(lightweight designers/programmers) make most
        important decisions, tightly coupled business relationships, and more).
        LWM will appeal to young developers who will feel empowered by the power
        politics vocabulary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Methodologies largely consist of sets of techniques that attempt to
        accomplish a clearly defined Software Engineering objective. What is
        slightly different about is that the lightweight methodology
        proponents seem to add an even finer granularity to this mix by
        concentrating so intensely on a programmer-centric vocabulary.
        Discetionary programmer best-practices have been introduced as
        components of the methodology sometimes given equal or greater status
        than an established technique. So instead of a notation for testing, one
        might simply write a test or test vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overwhelming emphasis on testing and building software component
        (objects or otherwise) introduces opportunities to refine, fine-tune,
        and formalize this set of practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect that this emphasis is the realization that successful software
        companies cannot be burdened by heavyweight methodologies. The clear
        lessons of history show that fast development is more critical to
        capturing market-share than slower, higher quality product. Generally,
        lightweight methodologies are merely acknowledging and catering to this
        phenomenon. The lessons come straight from contemporary development
        practices described in corporations such as Microsoft, Netscape, and
        Apple to name a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lightweight methodologies may also more accurately be called post-modern
        methodologies because the whole of the methodolgy is not much more than
        a pastiche of practice that fits an immediate need. Lost is an orderly,
        temporal Software engineering procession of processes that eventually
        produce a final product. Proponents of lightweight methodologies,
        unwittingly, propose the idea that there is no "end-product" there is
        just an ever-evolving prototypical system that the customer can choose
        to accept or reject at any time. Proponents sell this concept
        as an embrace and resignation to continuous change. It also has the
        potential to horrifyingly redefine the excesses of feature creep,
        product creep, and engineering creep. Some LWM feature bill of rights
        manifestos for developers, customers, and significant others.
      </p>
      <p>
        LWM literature expresses a youth bias. LWM are clearly being marketed to
        a youth engineering segment and are burdened by workplace practice
        requirements that may render the methodologies unworkable. Employees
        participating in extreme programming are required to conform to a
        majority rule that invades privacy and invites "Lord of the Flies"
        potentials. The literature is laced with petty tyrannies that are taken
        for granted, the least of which is the "our way or the highway" subtext
        of extreme programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, like it or not, the profitability of selling sexy, fuzzy,
        vapor-stuff is not to be underestimated. These LWMs may well become the
        pet rocks of your software engineering library. They are reactionary
        responses to the bloated, impossible to manage, and pretentious
        heavyweight methodologies. Companies that cannot afford the cost
        overhead of heavyweight methodology software development will surely try
        LWM out and, inevitably - in some round-about way, software will get
        developed under the auspices of LWM.

        Metrics or not, a bastard child awaits at the doorstep crying for
        attention and consumption.

        I have known of <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> for quite some time. His published articles
        were always of interest to me. Kent wrote on topics ranging from
        agent-based programming, to class-responsibility-collaboration cards,
        to diagramming techniques for object-oriented software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In person, Kent comes across as someone who is genuinely interested in
        people as human beings. It is no accident that his approach to software
        development techniques contains generous helpings of the human element.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I may have serious issues with his latest ideas regarding
        software technology, I sincerely respect Kent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I was approached by both Kent and the IEEE. They are in the
        process of creating a web page dedicated to discussing and exploring
        eXtreme Programming (XP). I was asked to contribute a short article
        addressing the cons (the downsides) of XP -- at least as I saw them. I
        declined the invitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both Kent and the IEEE were persistent. I reiterated my belief that
        some of the more vocal XP advocates seem to be on a different playing
        field than most of the rest of software engineering technology. This
        "paradigm gulf" (as Kent has described it) makes it difficult to have
        meaningful discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent then asked me to put down some of my concerns in writing. He asked
        me to address my issues in the form of "when I see A, B, and C, I will
        feel comfortable discussing XP again." I did this, and sent him my
        ideas via private e-mail. Kent then asked me to post my concerns to
        some public forum so that they could form the basis for a discussion.
        That is what this article is all about.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, at Kent Beck's request, and in no special order, when I see the
        following, I will be comfortable discussing XP again:
      </p>
      <code>
        -> A well-defined, and well-documented set of metrics: A "metric" is<br/>
        a defined measurement of something. The term is used to mean both<br/>
        an actual measuring technique, and the results of applying that<br/>
        technique. In software, we measure processes, products, and<br/>
        people.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        If you claim that A is bigger/faster/better/cheaper than B, that<br/>
        implies that you have a way of measuring the same thing in both<br/>
        A and B, and that the results can be compared in a meaningful<br/>
        manner. Some metrics are very quantitative (requiring "hard<br/>
        numbers"), while others are very qualitative (e.g., true or<br/>
        false and good or bad).<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Metrics themselves have metrics. For example, we talk about<br/>
        "statistically significant," "representative sample," "objective<br/>
        versus subjective," "systematic," "repeatable," and "in context."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        To be meaningful, metrics discussions must:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        - Use a documented definition of the metric<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        - Describe what was being measured<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        - Describe the precise way in which something was measured<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        - Describe the context in which the measurement took place,<br/>
        giving special attention to factors that could have a<br/>
        major influence on the measurement.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Realizing that there is often more than one definition for a<br/>
        particular term or concept, there should be a bibliography of<br/>
        acceptable references for each metric.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        XP discussions are full of words like "quality," "faster," and<br/>
        "value." However, in the XP world, metrics are seldom defined, and<br/>
        almost never measured. Questions like "did you measure A?" are<br/>
        met with responses such as "why would you want to measure that,"<br/>
        or "measuring that will result in unnecessary and wasteful<br/>
        infrastructure."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        No metrics, no credibility.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        -> Recognition of human psychology: Human beings are all different.<br/>
        Just because two humans have the same raw level of intelligence<br/>
        does not mean that they will be equally capable (or, equally<br/>
        inclined, for that matter) to assume a given task. We are all not<br/>
        Renaissance people.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Further, psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, and others<br/>
        who study the human condition, have been reporting for centuries<br/>
        on certain tendencies regarding they way people think. For<br/>
        example, most people are reactive thinkers, and relatively few are<br/>
        proactive thinkers. Many people are very comfortable with "lots of<br/>
        trees," while relatively few actually notice "the forest."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        In reading some of the discussions on XP, I get the distinct<br/>
        impression that if you bring up some aspect of the human condition<br/>
        that does not put XP in the best light, that aspect is denied.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        -> A resurgence of intellectual curiosity: Some people are aware not<br/>
        only of how much they know, but also how much they do not know.<br/>
        The seemingly infinite amount of continually-updated technical<br/>
        knowledge proves daunting to many people. This problem is further<br/>
        exacerbated by the realization that, even if one was handed the<br/>
        information on a silver platter, there is still no guarantee that<br/>
        one will understand it, or even begin to perceive all the<br/>
        ramifications.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Some within the XP community feel that if they are not aware of<br/>
        something, then:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        - it must be theoretical, academic, and definitely not<br/>
        practical, or<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        - it must be the fault of the vendors or authors for not<br/>
        bringing it to their attention.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Some XPers demand to be spoon-fed, i.e., rather than checking out<br/>
        some or all of the references themselves, they ask for a quick<br/>
        synopsis of the contents. Others simply deny the existence or<br/>
        value of the technology. Still others claim to know about<br/>
        something, but in later conversations, often reveal that they<br/>
        do not.<br/>

      <code>
        -> A recognition of existing and past software engineering<br/>
        technology: Over the past 50 years, software practitioners have<br/>
        moved from small machines and small problems, to very large<br/>
        (in power) machines and very large problems. Along the way, they<br/>
        dramatically increased their understanding, their strategies, and<br/>
        their tools, e.g.:<br/>

      <code>

        technologies (late 1960s, early 1970s), to object-oriented<br/>
        technologies (1970s, 1980s, and 1990s), to Web-based<br/>
        strategies (1990s), and onward.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        - We saw the evolution of many new subdisciplines, including<br/>
        analysis, design, testing, debugging, quality assurance,<br/>
        configuration management, domain analysis, and software<br/>
        project management<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        - We created software tools to help automate the processes of<br/>
        creating, measuring, maintaining, and otherwise managing<br/>
        software.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        To hear some XP advocates talk about it, one might get the<br/>
        impression that nothing much of consequence happened before XP.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        -> A major decrease in zealotry: Some XP "acolytes" seem to feel that<br/>

      <p>
        I take a more middle-road view. In nearly everything in life, the 'pure' route isn't the best. I find this to be the best approach for most project (contrast this to XP):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Gather rough requirements (documented from a meeting)
        </li>
        <li>
           Make a draft design involving the developers
        </li>
        <li>
           Create a prototype
        </li>
        <li>
           Solicit feedback from the customer
        </li>
        <li>
           Begin XP methodology
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are often massive changes from 3 to 4. This approach allows you to discard the inevitable large swaths of design/code without wasting the efforts of inapplicable unit tests (TDD), pairing, debugging, UI redesign based on feedback, etc. Crank something out with a SUPER-lightweight methodology, get feedback, then use any other methodology.
