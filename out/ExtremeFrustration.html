        Extreme Frustration
      </h1>
      <p>
        The frustration caused by trying to work on an <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> project, when it goes wrong on a social level.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Because we can deal with technical problems within the system, right?  So the social problems are outside the system.</em>

        I think <a href="EdYourdon.html">EdYourdon</a>s <a href="DeathMarch.html">DeathMarch</a> is one of the best books I've ever read on this subject. -- rad

      <ul>
        <li>
           Joining a project so full of bugs you can't even compile and run the code you're supposed to work on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>No, </em>joining<em> the project was ExtremeStupidity.  You should have applied the principles in </em><a href="QualifyingEmployers.html">QualifyingEmployers</a>.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Getting off of a project that you didn't much care for to work on something fun, only to be repeatedly dragged back for <a href="FireFighting.html">FireFighting</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Getting some badly needed personnel assigned to your project, only to have them repeatedly dragged back to fight fires.
        </li>
        <li>
           Being forced into maintaining 200 000 lines of undocumented, "comment free" results of <a href="CowboyCoding.html">CowboyCoding</a>. Especially when you joined to work on something else.
        </li>
        <li>
           Joining a project that is desperately needed and thoroughly funded but nothing can be produced because no one will stop analyzing and tell you what they need.
        </li>
        <li>
           Getting blamed by users for crappy software when you are the single person in an IT department innocent of all blame because you have been advocating refactoring the damn mess for a year.
        </li>
        <li>
           Having all technical decisions made by the least technical person, then being force fed their incompetence, then getting blamed for the resulting poor quality.
        </li>
        <li>
           You <a href="FixBrokenWindows.html">FixBrokenWindows</a>, but two more break every time you do.  Nobody else on the team will help you fix them; they're too busy "making progress" on getting the project <a href="OutTheDoor.html">OutTheDoor</a>.  Bonus points for getting into trouble for wasting time, because they don't understand what you've fixed.
        </li>
        <li>
           You <a href="ActInsteadOfComplain.html">ActInsteadOfComplain</a> to <a href="ChangeYourOrganization.html">ChangeYourOrganization</a>, go over the head of the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a>, and discover <a href="PointyHairedBossTransitiveClosure.html">PointyHairedBossTransitiveClosure</a>. <em>(</em><a href="YouJustCantWin.html">YouJustCantWin</a>)<em></em>

        <li>
           <a href="ReleaseEasyReleaseOften.html">ReleaseEasyReleaseOften</a> doesn't happen.  You have the final release coming up fast, and there is no one person on the team who can put all the code and data together to make it.
