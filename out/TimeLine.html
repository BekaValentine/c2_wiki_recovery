        A <a href="TimeLine.html">TimeLine</a> editor that I have in mind is one that allows all time, past present and future, to be represented visually on a (horizontal) <a href="TimeLine.html">TimeLine</a> that can be panned, zoomed, filtered, customized and edited with in many different ways. I've often done this manually with sketches of time at different scales and with different types of annotations.

        There used to be a project scheduler program named "<a href="TimeLine.html">TimeLine</a>" (circa 1990), which performed functions similar to MS Project, although in a vastly superior way.
