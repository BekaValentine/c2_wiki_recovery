        <em>Welcome, Mike. It looks like you've already explored </em><a href="WelcomeVisitors.html">WelcomeVisitors</a> and some of the pages it links to. You already know how to delete a page and set your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie. For loads of interesting topics, I suggest you start with the <a href="RoadMaps.html">RoadMaps</a> page. -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a> (fellow Queens resident)<em></em>
