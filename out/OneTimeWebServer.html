        Anyone want to provide a C version?

        <em>Very nice. I'm not sure how much use it is, but it's very nice.</em>

        Sounds like a hacker/security pattern.  <em>Perhaps.  Could be used to provide very specific, personal, and confidential information to a single browser.</em>
      </p>

        <em>Do you mean "cracker"?</em>  I don't think so, although I suppose there is a use in such a realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not cracker - because this would be setup server-side, right? So some sysadmin might want a disappearing backdoor for something - just in case - maybe it lets you issue one command-line command, and then disappears until you can set up the vanishing web server locally. . . Hacker in that context means "someone who needs/makes a quick hack to get something to work" - not someone who breaks into others' systems.

        <strong>What is the term for this kind of technique? It's not quite a pattern, maybe a trick, not really a feature. . .What are neat little pattern/feature/tricks like this called?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Seems to fall into the same category as <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> and MockObjects where you more or less hack an object to temporarily stand in for something greater, which just now simply is not (yet) there.
