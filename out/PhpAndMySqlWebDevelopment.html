        ISBN: 0672317842Authors Luke Welling and Laura Thomson's technique aims to get readers going on their own projects as soon as possible. They present easily digestible sections on specific technical processes--"Accessing array contents" and "Using encryption with PHP" are two examples. Each section centers on a sample program that strips the task at hand down to its essentials, enabling the reader to fit the process into his or her own solutions as required. Tables that list options and other nuggets of reference material appear as well, but the many examples and the authors' commentary on them take center stage.

        For reference material on <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a>, have a look at PaulDuBoiss MySQL. On the PHP side, WebApplicationDevelopmentWithPhp 4.0 is excellent.
