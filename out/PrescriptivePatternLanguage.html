        Prescriptive Pattern Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A ``Prescriptive Pattern Language<em> is a partially (at least) ordered collection of patterns, which direct the reader how to solve a specific kind of problem. (Compare with </em><a href="PatternsHandbookLanguage.html">PatternsHandbookLanguage</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        I have two hypotheses:
      </p>
      <p>
        One:
        The patterns in a Prescriptive Pattern Language are qualitatively different than other patterns (e.g., standalone patterns,
        or patterns in a <a href="PatternsHandbookLanguage.html">PatternsHandbookLanguage</a>). The patterns are less general, there is less motivation, explicit context is less important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two:
        A framework is best described by a Prescriptive Pattern Language. A programmer writing programs to a framework always does the same kinds of things. (That's what makes frameworks so easy to use once they're learned). A Prescriptive Pattern Language captures those "kinds of things" as steps in the development, each one a pattern, ordered to minimize the global  understanding needed to carry out each step.
