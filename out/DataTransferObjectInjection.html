        Data Transfer Object Injection
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DataTransferObjectInjection.html">DataTransferObjectInjection</a> is a programming error which results in security holes. It is to <a href="RemoteObjectService.html">RemoteObjectService</a> based applications which use object graphs what <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a> is to applications which use databases. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DataTransferObjectInjection.html">DataTransferObjectInjection</a> can happen when there is a <a href="RemoteObjectService.html">RemoteObjectService</a> that allows a client system to send an object graph that is automatically converted by an <a href="ObjectRelationalMapper.html">ObjectRelationalMapper</a> into SQL statements. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of sending a valid object graph, the attacker can send a different object graph representing alterations to the database that go well beyond his security level. For example, a <a href="RemoteObjectService.html">RemoteObjectService</a> may receive an object graph that represent changes in the objects that represent new users, or new permissions granted to existing users of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prevent this problem it should be possible to specify, at the <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> level, which entities can be saved by the current user.  Many object-relational mappers and XmlRelationalMappers automatically write the changes represented by the object graph to the database, without caring if the current application user has the privileges required to persist those objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can not rely on RDBMS security, because most <a href="RemoteObjectService.html">RemoteObjectService</a>s use the same user for all calls.  Unfortunately, connecting with a different user for each remote object service would be bad for connection pooling performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder if this is a common problem and/or if it generally goes unnoticed.
