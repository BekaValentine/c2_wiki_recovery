        Non Deterministic Turing Machine
      </h1>
      <p>
        A variation on the <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> that picks all possible alternatives at each decision point. Used as the basis for ComplexityTheory.  Is not more powerful than a deterministic <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>--i.e. all problems which are decideable on a DTM are also decideable on a NDTM--but NDTMs can solve many problems faster.  The classical example of this is the class of problems known as NP--this means "nondeterministic polynomial"; such problems can be solved in polynomial time on an NDTM, but it is not known whether or not they can be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> (see <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a>).
