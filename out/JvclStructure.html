        Jvcl Structure
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a possible structure for <a href="JediVcl.html">JediVcl</a> 3.0, and was proposed by Peter Thornqvist:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Just to get you all started thinking about this and come up with your own
        suggestions, here's some of mine:
      </p>
      <p>
        Packages (one each for D5-D7,BCB5-BCB6):
      </p>
      <p>
        JvCore - RT package with utility units and core classes (JvFunctions,
        JvComponent et al)
      </p>
      <p>
        JvStdCtrls - enhancements to standard components (labels, edits, listboxes,
        menus), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvWin32 - enhancements to common controls (listview, treeview), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvNet - internet related, RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvDB - DB related, non-visual (JvMemoryData), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvDbCtrls - DB related, visual (JvDBDatePicker), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvBDE - BDE related (JvQuery), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvDialogs - dialogs (standard and win special), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvSystem - system related (JvAppDDECmd, JvTimerList, JvCreateProcess), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvControls - visual controls not fitting for JvStdCtrls or JvWin32(JvFontComboBox, JvColorComboBox), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvComponents - non-visual controls not fitting in the other packages(JvMRUList, JvScreenSaver), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvCustomCtrls - original custom controls, not extending an existing control(JvLinkLabel, JvInspector, JvTimeLine, JvLookout), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvMMedia - multimedia components (JvStarField, JvId3v1), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvUtils - stuff seldom used (JvPatchFile, JvEasterEgg), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvCrypt - encryption and compression (JvVignere, JvCabFile), RT + DT
      </p>
      <p>
        JvBeginner - components that are simple wrappers for API calls and/or with little actual code (JvSelectDirectory, JvDirectories, JvSystemColors), RT +
        DT
      </p>
      <p>
        A suggestion from me (with Roberts comments) about what components to merge and what to keep can be found here:
        <a href="http://cvs.jvcl.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jvcl/jvcl/restructure_proposal.txt">http://cvs.jvcl.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jvcl/jvcl/restructure_proposal.txt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I propose that the different edits (integeredit, yearedit etc) should be merged into one (preferably the standard JvEdit with additional
        properties for setting the accepted format), the different labels should be merged into one (preferably the standard JvLabel) except for JvLinkLabel
        which is too special to be merged (I love that component!), the different grids should be merged into one, the different buttons should be merged into
        a selected few (JvBitBtn, JvSpeedButton). We could probably also remove some of the listboxes, buttons, dialogs and grids.
