        Might Be Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a place to list rough ideas that might be patterns in the hopes that knowledgeable visitors will help out with the following tasks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Refactor descriptions into simpler form.
        </li>
        <li>
           Identify duplication of already existing, named patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
           Identify useful new patterns that should be recognized.
        </li>
        <li>
           Distinguish non-patterns that might be better listed in another category.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Say you have something like this Access VBA code.
      </p>
      <code>
        Public Sub SetFooTo123()<br/>
        Dim ctl As Access.Control<br/>
        For Each ctl in Me.Controls<br/>
        If ctl.ControlType = acTextbox Then<br/>
        If ctl.Name Like "*Foo" Then<br/>
        ctl.Value = 123<br/>
        End If<br/>
        End If<br/>
        Next<br/>
        End Sub<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is the <a href="ArrowAntiPattern.html">ArrowAntiPattern</a>.  We could get rid of the arrow using <a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a>, but this leads to tightly-coupled, special-purpose procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        My idea is that, instead, we flatten the arrow by creating a series of procedure calls, each of which produces a byproduct that is passed to the next, as below.  Refactoring is done from the outside in, like peeling an onion.  There is, for now, a bit more code here than when we started, but it's mostly more general-purpose code and much less tightly coupled.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is now possible to test each component atomically, rather than testing all at once, or testing C, then B -> C, then A -> B -> C.  Also, it is now trivial to change the order of operations.  Note that this is starting to resemble what one might do in a Functional programming language, but without the lazy evaluation.  Note that VBA has on Continue statement for loops, so we can't flatten the mini-arrows that way.  Of course, if we then implement some sort of Functors, we could get rid of the duplicated ForEach loops, and if we extract a class for filtering and manipulating Controls collections, we could probably get rid of all the objControls passing, but those are other refactorings.
