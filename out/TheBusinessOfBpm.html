        The Business Of Bpm
      </h1>
      <p>
        What is the Business of <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a> (BPM)? Once that is answered and endorsed, then the people involved can go about implementing strategies in making things happen, related to its mandate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently the local BPM community have been asked:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Q: <em>(Your) views and expectations of what the BPM Community is there for?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           A from one response: <em> (Hopefully) the BPM Community can become a trusted and credible advisory to sponsors of (firm XXX) BPM initiatives, and that the BPM processes will be relied upon as a stable process glue, to help realize (firm XXX) investments in planning, program and project initiatives.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Those of us in the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> who have contact with <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a> communities, do you have anything to share regarding "the Business" of BPM?
