           I prefer to program, rather than to think.

        <li>
           I think any problem can be solved with one more line of code.

        <em>Therefore:</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           I write programs that are <a href="TheMostComplexWhichCanBeMadeToWork.html">TheMostComplexWhichCanBeMadeToWork</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           If the program doesn't work, I add more code to it until it does.

        <em>This reminds me of Harrison, the man who invented the first accurate clock (for use at sea) in the book Longitude. He was one for running over his mistakes with more and more parts so that his 'mistakes' were no longer 'mistakes'.</em> -- <a href="MatthewTheobalds.html">MatthewTheobalds</a>

        As explained in more details at <a href="JohnHarrison.html">JohnHarrison</a>, the above is a gross misrepresentation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           He was trying to accomplish something that had never been done.
        </li>
        <li>
           He effectively made successive prototypes to solve the new problems thrown up by his most recent prototype.
        </li>
        <li>
           When he understood all the issues well enough, he produced a working solution.
          <ul>
            <li>
               I think that mentioning <a href="JohnHarrison.html">JohnHarrison</a> on this page in this way is nothing short of iniquitous. I'll leave it to others below to explain more clearly just how wrong the above characterisation is.

        Working on his own - and against very powerful opposition and the received scientific wisdom - <a href="JohnHarrison.html">JohnHarrison</a> managed to solve the greatest technological challenge of his time. When his solution was rejected, he solved it again. And again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I would want to solve the greatest technological challenge of my time at least once before I started criticizing Harrison's methods - which, from my reading of <em>Longitude</em>, were considerably less complex than those advocated by his rivals - but then I long ago gave up being a cynic. -- <a href="TomKreitzberg.html">TomKreitzberg</a>

        <em>Don't get me wrong. I wasn't criticizing his methods, I was merely commenting on their similarity with this page.

        Compare to <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>. In this method, you think up the most hare-brained scheme that could possibly solve the current problem. For instance, if you need some user configurable script files, you don't go to an existing language like <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> or <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>. You develop your own language, then write a compiler for it, taking over a year of development time.

        The title would suggest someone doing something because they believe that complexity, a priori, improves code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The way <a href="TheResidentCynic.html">TheResidentCynic</a> puts it reminds me of <a href="MakeTheSmallestChangeThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">MakeTheSmallestChangeThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> -- keep piling kludges on it until the problem seems to go away. Or maybe it's "don't refactor, ever" -- just keep plowing blindly on, and if you have a design flaw, add something else that compensates for it. In my experience, both of these most commonly arise from time pressure -- you don't revisit the design because you don't feel you have time to. (One might ask, "do you have time <em>not</em> to?")

        You might also want to <a href="DoTheMostComplexThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheMostComplexThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> if you mistake complexity for quality. That might come from a failure to apply <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, adding unnecessary "flexibility" to a program. <a href="PrematureOptimization.html">PrematureOptimization</a> might be a related practice.

        Of course, <a href="TheResidentCynic.html">TheResidentCynic</a> didn't make any arguments for this actually working better, he just said he <strong>prefers</strong> it, and prefers not refactoring, and prefers not thinking, and prefers not debugging.
      </p>
      <p>
        He did make the unsubstantiated claim that adding code can fix any bug, but note he didn't say he preferred working code.
      </p>
      <p>
        So apparently he's just saying he prefers enormous kludgy buggy programs that get worse over time. Perhaps he's an insane conceptual artist.
