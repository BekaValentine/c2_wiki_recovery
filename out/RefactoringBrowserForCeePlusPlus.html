        So is anyone actually using any of these refactoring tools for C++?  My hunch is that most people who are into the idea of automated refactorings are probably using a different <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>.

        <em>I use Ref++ on a daily basis.  The two features that I use most often are finding all uses of a specific function or variable, and renaming all instances of a functions or variable.  Since Ref++ parses the C++ code, it can tell the difference between different variables with the same name, which makes it better than the find-in-files feature of IDEs.  I have occasionally tried some of the other features of Ref++, but found that they don't always work the way I would like.</em> -- <a href="ChrisHines.html">ChrisHines</a>

      <p>
        <em>I installed Ref++ for </em><a href="VisualStudioDotNet.html">VisualStudioDotNet</a>, but after asking me for the serial number it's as if it doesn't exist.  There is no menu or toolbar.  I was really hoping to use it...<em> -- Nikolay</em>

        I use xrefactory for C/Java (the only free version), and find it immensely useful
