      <p>
        I'm a christian man, very well married, struggling to understand himself and how to make the best of the life he was given. I program for a living, and lazy as I am, I always try to make my life easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        I need to work on my diplomacy skills, and on understanding other people's motivations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some day I will have my own company, and it will be good.
