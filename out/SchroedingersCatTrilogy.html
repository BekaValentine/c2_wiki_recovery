        By <a href="RobertAntonWilson.html">RobertAntonWilson</a>.  The same story told in five different possible universes.  Explores <a href="QuantumMechanics.html">QuantumMechanics</a> and mysticism.  Great beginning that blew my mind in high school:

        <em>The majority of Terrans were six-legged. They had territorial squabbles and politics and wars and a caste system. They also had sufficient intelligence to survive on that barren boondocks planet for several billions of years.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We are not concerned here with the majority of Terrans. We are concerned with a tiny minority - the domesticated primates who built cities and wrote symphonies and invented things like tic-tac-toe and integral calculus. At the time of our story, these primates regarded themselves as </em>the<em> Terrans. The Six-legged majority and other life-forms on that planet hardly entered into their thinking at all, most of the time.</em>

        The 1979 edition has references to Richard Nixon.  The 1988 edition replaced them with references to Ronald Reagan.

        Contains many of the same characters and themes as <a href="TheIlluminatusTrilogy.html">TheIlluminatusTrilogy</a>.

        I actually thought Schroedinger's Cat was much much better than <a href="TheIlluminatusTrilogy.html">TheIlluminatusTrilogy</a>. Regularly made me stop and look up and be amazed by the tricks the author had just played on me. Clever clever. Sort of 4 books in one, with a chapter from each book, so you could just read one chapter in four, but if you read it all in order it still makes sense. Anyone remember transformers ? :-)
