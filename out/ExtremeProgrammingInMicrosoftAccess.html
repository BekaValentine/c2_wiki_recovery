        Extreme Programming In Microsoft Access
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a> is an all-in-one system for building databases, but:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It can't do everything
        </li>
        <li>
           It uses objects, but doesn't have all the object "stuff" (Inheritance and what have you)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        How can you apply <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> practices (or even object based development) to Access?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There is </em><a href="VbaUnit.html">VbaUnit</a>, which was developed for a <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a> project.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>VBA is very close to VB, so you can do lots of stuff in </em><a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a>, just as you can in VB. You can create classes, but you'll have to get familiar with VB's retarded not-quite-<a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> style, especially its <a href="DelegationInheritance.html">DelegationInheritance</a> scheme (see also <a href="InheritanceInVbClassic.html">InheritanceInVbClassic</a>). Regardless, it is possible to do XP in Access, just not as easy as say Java or Smalltalk.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried, and that was the only project I ever abandoned for <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access has thousands of "conveniences" that help wizard-driven development.
      </p>
      <p>
        They interfere, mercilessly, with all phases of test case creation - with the <a href="AssembleActivateAssert.html">AssembleActivateAssert</a> cycles in test cases. There was no way to tell the helpful nag windows "yes I KNOW that record is partially formed - I'm just going to test something with it then throw it away!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Switch to <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> with an Access driver for the back end.
      </p>

        There is a <a href="UnitTesting.html">UnitTesting</a> tool for Access called AccUnit (<a href="http://accunit.access-codelib.net).">http://accunit.access-codelib.net).</a> I use it intensive and it works out pretty nice. Version 1.0 to be released soon.

        If there are more than two developers working on an MS-Access program, then MS-Access is probably the wrong tool. You'll drive yourself crazy trying to give it an "Enterprise Flavor". MS-Access is like the Millennium Falcon: it's out-dated, cheap, it mostly works, you have to bang it a lot with a wrench to keep it going, and if you sneeze wrong you'll have to restart it with the wrench again.

      <p>
        Nimble, maybe.
