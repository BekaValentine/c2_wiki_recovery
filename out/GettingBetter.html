        The more time goes by the more I realize how true this quote is.  It is very, very costly to make code that is beautiful when viewed statically. It is equally costly to fail to make code a little bit simpler every time you touch it.

        It's getting better all the time<br/>
        I used to get mad at my school<br/>
        Now I can't complain<br/>
        The teachers who taught me weren't cool<br/>
        Now I can't complain<br/>
        You're holding me down, ah, turning me round, ah<br/>
        Filling me up with your rules, ooh ooh<br/>

        I've got to admit it's getting better, better<br/>
        A little better all the time, it can't get no worse<br/>
        I have to admit it's getting better, better<br/>
        It's getting better since you've been mine<br/>

        Me used to be angry young man<br/>
        Me hiding me head in the sand<br/>
        You gave me the word<br/>
        I finally heard<br/>
        I'm doing the best that I can<br/>

        I used to be cruel to my woman<br/>
        I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved<br/>
        Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene<br/>
        And I'm doing the best that I can<br/>
