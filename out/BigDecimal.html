        Big Decimal

        <a href="BigDecimal.html">BigDecimal</a> is a class in java.math package. It is also supported in java.sql.ResultSet class with a getBigDecimal method.
      </p>

        Do you have any experiences with this?

        Special Decimal classes avoid the problems of base-2 representation of base-10 fractions.  You see these kind of binary problems when your old calculator told you something like 10/2 = 4.9999999999.

      <p>
        See similar Decimal class in <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>. In Perl there are two classes, MaTH::BigRat for fractions, and MaTH::BigFloat for floating point, and MaTH::<a href="BigInt.html">BigInt</a> for arbitrary precision integers.

        <a href="BigDecimal.html">BigDecimal</a> and <a href="BigInteger.html">BigInteger</a> are used for precise arithmetical work, including cryptographical work. However, <a href="BigDecimal.html">BigDecimal</a> is used more for financial work. The rounding methods support banker's rounding (round toward even). The primitive float and double classes aren't really suitable.

        We use <a href="BigDecimal.html">BigDecimal</a> for financial work, however, like many other <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> core classes, i.e., GregorianCalendar, it is clumsy and needs to be contained within a simpler interface.

        IBM Fellow <a href="MikeCowlishaw.html">MikeCowlishaw</a> designed a <a href="BigDecimal.html">BigDecimal</a> class which was, I am told, a significant improvement over the Java class that preceded it (I never used the old one).  It is now available as of Java 5.0.  A 2004 presentation describing it is at <a href="http://www.softwaresummit.com/2004/speakers/CowlishawBigDecimal.pdf.">http://www.softwaresummit.com/2004/speakers/CowlishawBigDecimal.pdf.</a>
        The specification is at <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=13.">http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=13.</a>

        We used an early version of it for a Brokerage application, and the function was excellent, but obviously you have to sacrifice some performance if you stay in pure Java - an add method (say) is a fairly complex piece of Java code. In the presentation, Mike talks about IBM's plans to support this function in hardware based on the agreed IEEE 754r standard. --<a href="PaulMorrison.html">PaulMorrison</a>
