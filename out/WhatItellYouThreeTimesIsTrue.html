        <em>"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,</em><br/>
        <em>As he landed his crew with care;</em><br/>
        <em>Supporting each man on the top of the tide</em><br/>
        <em>By a finger entwined in his hair.</em><br/>
        <em>"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:</em><br/>
        <em>That alone should encourage the crew.</em><br/>
        <em>Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:</em><br/>
        <em>What I tell you three times is true."</em><br/>

        Carroll may have intended this line as comic contrast to the long-established Law of Witnesses, namely that an important fact must be established by two or three independent witnesses, not by one witness three times.
