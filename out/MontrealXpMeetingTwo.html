        Although very few people showed up we still managed to talk about a smattering of XP topics. We discussed the Conservative Approach and the Liberal Approach to installing XP. We also talked about which XP practices are easiest to install. <a href="IainLowe.html">IainLowe</a> had questions about building a culture in an XP team and how to motivate developers to accept responsibilities while Zhong Dan Lan asked about development environments and Hungarian Notation. JeanMarcHeneman brought up the issue of <a href="DistractedDevelopers.html">DistractedDevelopers</a> and how to bring them back to the fold.
