        <a href="OpenJdk.html">OpenJdk</a> is an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> project based on source code released by <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a>.  Sun released most of the source code of its Java Platform Standard Edition, version 6 (though some was restricted by third parties.)  As of 2009, the Java community uses the OpenJdk project to develop code that will satisfy the compatibility tests for version 7 of the Java Development Kit specs.  It has also developed an open source version of JDK 6, available for Linux and OpenSolaris.

        OpenJdk contains source code for the <a href="HotSpotVm.html">HotSpotVm</a>, a <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> compiler, and a suite of class libraries.
