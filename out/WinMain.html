        Win Main
      </h1>
      <p>
        Win32's answer to the main() function in all <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> programs.  (Actually, <a href="WinMain.html">WinMain</a>() is called from the entry point of a Win32 program, or from a function called from the entry point, which may end up being main().)  The "canonical" form of <a href="WinMain.html">WinMain</a>() is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Create the application's main window
        </li>
        <li>
           Display it
        </li>
        <li>
           Enter a loop which waits for UI events, then dispatches them, typically to the main window's WndProc()
        </li>
        <li>
           Exits the loop when a special UI message is received (WM_QUIT)
        </li>
        <li>
           Performs cleanup and exits
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All the monstrous muck that is MFC, WTL, etc. (and formerly other stuff like DDE, which led to OLE, COM, etc.) rests on this simple little ditty.
