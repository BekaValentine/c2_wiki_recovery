        Giants Walked The Earth

        Giants have never walked the earth. People have always been the same size. -- <a href="GregSolomon.html">GregSolomon</a>

        What would a pygmy call a typical NBA basketball player on first sight? Perhaps there were never any thirty-foot-tall giants, but surely there were unusually large people in the past. Not to mention the effects diet can have on height - referencing the average height of the Japanese since industrialization.

        I was talking in an abstract sense.  My claim is that CulturalHeight is relative and situational.  To state that you regard another person as inherently "better" or "worse" than yourself is either telling a joke or making a complete fool of yourself. -- <a href="GregSolomon.html">GregSolomon</a>
