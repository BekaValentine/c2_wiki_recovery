      <ol>
        <li>
           Building small pieces of information that can be strung together as needed. Tentatively called "nuggets".
        </li>
        <li>
           Delivering <strong>the exact same</strong> training locally and remotely (intranet/web server) via browsers.

        <li>
           Trying to use in as much <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> as I can :-)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I also have worked on a cool multi-user drilling rig using Java, VRML and 4 small Akia computers that can be taken anywhere in the world.
