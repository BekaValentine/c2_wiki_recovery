        <em>What is the etymology of "</em><a href="MondeGreen.html">MondeGreen</a>"?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Writer Sylvia Wright listened to a Scottish ballad called <em>The Bonny Earl of Murray</em> which she thought included this line: "They hae slay the Earl of Murray, and Lady Mondegreen." Later she learned that instead of "Lady Mondegreen" it was "laid him on the green."
      </p>
      <p>
        She then began to collect similar mishearings and in 1954 published an article about them, and coined the word "Mondegreen."
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirty years after her death, a columnist in San Francisco discovered the term, and released it into the wild.

        Usually with song lyrics, but can be anytime someone hears something other than the intended words.
      </p>

        Example:
        'Scuse me while I kiss the sky. -- <em> 'Scuse me while I kiss this guy.</em> Jimi Hendrix - Purple Haze. (Note: Apparently Jimi played on this <a href="MondeGreen.html">MondeGreen</a> and worked it into his live performances.)

        there's a bad moon on the rise -- there's an out-house on the right
      </p>
      <p>
        gladly the cross I'd bear -- "Gladly", the Cross-eyed Bear
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        And what about: "Some people call me Maurice, 'cause I speak of the <em>pompatus</em> of love"
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's exactly what Steve Miller said.  Not misheard.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, but it is a <a href="MondeGreen.html">MondeGreen</a>, by Steve Miller himself. <em>The Joker</em> is in reference to his own song <em>Enter Maurice</em> which inaccurately reuses a couple lines from <em>The Letter</em> written by Vernon Green. <em>The Letter</em> has the line "... and discuss the puppetutes of love." Puppetutes was coined by Vernon to mean a secret paper-doll fantasy figure. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, pompatus (or pompitous) is a <a href="MondeGreen.html">MondeGreen</a> for the made up word puppetutes.
