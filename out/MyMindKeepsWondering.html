        This is a variant of <a href="MyMindKeepsWandering.html">MyMindKeepsWandering</a>, which is mind activity which has sporadic and semi-directed activity. The difference is that Wondering is about a more directed, concentrated effort to solve problems or answer questions.

        The effort is not limited to singular issues, and may involve complicated, inter-related matters, each of which may branch into areas which cause additional "wondering".
