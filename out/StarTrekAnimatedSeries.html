        Yes, there were actually a couple of seasons of a <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> animated series in the Seventies. It was actually reasonably good.

        <dd>Reasonably good?  Watch them again, it was terrible!  But a fun view regardless.  Terrible animation, even more ridiculous stories than <a href="StarTrekOriginalSeries.html">StarTrekOriginalSeries</a>...</dd>

        One of the episodes, "The Slaver Weapon," is adapted from the story "The Soft Weapon" by <a href="LarryNiven.html">LarryNiven</a>.

        For what it's worth (i.e. for Trekkies who care about such things), the animated series is not considered "canon"--i.e. it never happened.  (Or, it never <em>will</em> happen).  It's just fiction, unlike that episode of TNG where the Enterprise crew are turned into children--that <em>is</em> canon, and thus an integral part of the Star Trek universe.
