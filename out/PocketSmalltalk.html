      <p>
        <a href="PocketSmalltalk.html">PocketSmalltalk</a>, <a href="http://www.pocketsmalltalk.com,">http://www.pocketsmalltalk.com,</a> is an implementation of the popular <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> for the <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a> / <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a>. It consists of a development environment which runs on Windows 95/NT, along with a cross-compiler which can generate "executable" .PRC files from Smalltalk source code.

        Pocket Smalltalk makes it easy to develop applications for the <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a>. You have the full power of the Smalltalk programming language along with a complete class library. Best of all, Pocket Smalltalk creates small, standalone executables. No runtime libraries are required.

        It works, it's cool, it's a good reason to buy a <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a>.

        It's currently <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> only, but the source is available if you want to port it. :)

        Will this work on a PocketPC as well?

        <em>For your </em>PocketPC you can get a free license for <a href="JayLanguage.html">JayLanguage</a> from www.jsoftware.com. It was originally for CE 2.1, but seems to work well on my Jornada 545.<em> -- </em><a href="JimRussell.html">JimRussell</a>  (but isn't Smalltalk --PeteF)

        <em>Despite reading Wiki for some time, I never really got into Smalltalk until I tried </em><a href="PocketSmalltalk.html">PocketSmalltalk</a>. I tried <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> and couldn't get the commands listed in the tutorial to work, and I hated how ugly it was. I also tried <a href="GnuSmalltalk.html">GnuSmalltalk</a>, but it didn't seem very well supported. I'll have to try it again soon now.<em></em>

        I have an allergy to using non-free programming environments when there aren't any good free ones. What I mean is, I accept Visual C++ because I can use gcc if I find something deplorable about a future version of VCPP or something like that. On the other hand, if I like a non-commercial smalltalk environment, then I will have to pay a lot of money to buy it if I want to do anything commercial. I don't have hundreds of dollars to spend on programming environments for doing small-scale contract work occasionally. I am taking a new stab at <a href="GnuSmalltalk.html">GnuSmalltalk</a>. It isn't so bad, but it isn't an environment like most of smalltalks, and it doesn't seem to have GTK or <a href="WxWidgets.html">WxWidgets</a> support. Lacking those two toolkits is what gets me. Haven't yet looked at what it takes to link in external C code though. If it's like <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, it won't be too bad.
