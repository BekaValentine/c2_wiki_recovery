        Myths About Xp

      <p>
        Shayne.  Thank you for this post, I really appreciate it.  Reading it
        gave me a good apprehension for what you dislike about XP, and also
        gave me a way to talk with you about it.  I think you have some
        misconceptions about XP, but I also think I can understand where those
        misconceptions came from.  With more communication like this, we may
        be able to come to a closer understanding, and appreciation of each
        other's views.

        XP allows you to spend at least half of your programming time in your
        specialty, if that is what you desire.  Developers sign up for the
        tasks that they want to be responsible for.  If they want to focus on
        a specialty, then they will sign up for tasks in that specialty.  
      </p>
      <p>
        XP also puts pressure on developers to spend about half their
        programming time pairing on other peoples tasks, so that they can get
        some familiarity with the other parts of the system.  This promotes
        communication and understanding amongst the team; and spreads
        knowledge.  It also makes the projects less vulnerable to the loss of
        a particular specialist.

      </code>
      <p>
        Why do you think this is counter to XP?  XP does not want ivory tower
        architects who produce documents and throw them over the wall to the
        developers.  But XP has no problem with team members who are
        architecturally strong.  A well formed team may indeed appoint someone
        to act as an architect to be responsible for the guiding vision of the
        system.  XP teams do not require this role; but I have certainly seen
        XP teams where the role has been created out of need.

      </code>
      <p>
        The rule in XP is that you cannot produce production code unless you
        are working with a pair partner.  XP does not say that you must spend
        all your time bound to a pair partner.  You can work alone any time
        you like.  You can experiment vith various program structures, and
        write prototype code alone if you like.  You can take as much time as
        you can afford to work along and be creative.  You simply cannot type
        in production code alone.

      </code>
      <p>
        It is hard to conceive of something that would be architecturally
        important but not important to the customer.  XP does not eschew
        architecture.  Instead, XP creates architecture in the presence of
        rapid feedback while working on the features that have the most impact
        on the customer.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems an appropriate strategy for building an architecture.
        Rather than using brain power alone (not that brain power isn't
        important) we focus the architectural effort on those parts of the
        system that the customer feels are most valuable, and we create that
        architecture one small step at a time, verifying that it works at each
        small step.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first the vision of the architecture is indistinct, because we do
        not have much data.  But as iteration after iteration goes by, the
        data becomes clearer and clearer, and the appropriate architecture for
        the system becomes distinct.
      </p>

        <strong>Architecture Must Be Installed First</strong>

        >critical step is complete.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        How do you know when that critical step is complete; and how do you
        know the result is accurate?  What elements do you consider if not
        those that are important to the customer, and why?

        <strong>Forced Documentation Helps Developing</strong>

        >it.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        XP does not recommend the elimination of documentation.  Nor does it
        recommend its creation.  The expectation is that developers will
        produce the documentation they, or their customers, need; when that
        need comes to the fore. -- <a href="UncleBob.html">UncleBob</a>

        I always wondered what it would be like to live thru one of the scientific revolutions that I'd heard about from history books. Times like when the Catholic Church would burn you alive for saying that planets went around the sun instead of the earth, or like when early engineers were learning to build airplanes and their detractors would say inane things like "If G*d meant men to fly He would have given us wings."

        I dunno... seems to me XP must be doing <em>really</em> well, if we now have guys
        spreading disinformation at conferences.  The other day, I was in Dymocks bookshop,
        and there was at least 4 (was it 5) XP books on the shelves.  I felt odd about
        that, having learned all about it on Wiki 3 years ago.  XP has grown up, I think.

        Are the points listed above really idiotic?  I think we should encourage
        such criticism of XP and certainly we should not imagine that the battle in
        favour of a certain methodology is won.
      </p>
      <p>
        You only have to browse these Wiki pages to find development situations
        where XP has very limited usefulness (<a href="LargeScale.html">LargeScale</a>, frameworks etc.)
        or where an XP customer is hard to find (<a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, COTS).  These
        and other problems offer points of attack and possibilities for
        improvement and/or flexibility in XP.

      <p>
        I've enjoyed trying out XP over the past couple
        of years and I feel that there is no part of XP without value.
        However, if we start believing that XP is right for all development
        situations and completely without fault we will find ourselves replacing 
        one bad methodology with yet another.

        The best way to seek out the limitations of XP is to compare it
        with alternative approaches.  This is made all the easier if there
        are people like Doug arguing <em>passionately</em> in favour of these approaches.

        To quote Kent Beck: "XP is a starting line. It asks the question, 'How little can we do and still build great software?'"  To do less is to threaten the ability to build good software. To do more could threaten the ability to work quickly and with little overhead.  The question "how little can we do" is valid, but saying the above myths <em>are</em>' what XP is promoting is just lying.
