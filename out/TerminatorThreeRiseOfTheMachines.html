        <li>
           The movie, which is fundamentally about a sophisticated computer system taking over the world and destroying humanity, is produced by C2 Pictures; we can only hope that this isn't Ward's way of trying to tell us something.

           Early on, there are references to an unstoppable virus taking over computers all over the world; seeing this movie is thus a little spooky if you've been following the news about the Blaster/Lovsan worm.

           [<em>SPOILER WARNING!</em>] [Bad pun warning!] At the end of the film, Skynet, the computer system which destroys humanity, is revealed to be not the classic huge underground <a href="MainFrame.html">MainFrame</a>, but  rather, in a very Zeitgeisty way, a <a href="DistributedSystem.html">DistributedSystem</a> which has invaded internet-connected machines all over the world via the aforementioned worm. In fact, you might say it was P2P's <a href="KillerApp.html">KillerApp</a>.
