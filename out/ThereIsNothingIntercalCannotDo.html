        There Is Nothing Intercal Cannot Do
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>, after all... and use of <a href="InterCal.html">InterCal</a> for your next project has advantage of increasing demand for programmers, hence boosting the economy.  If we all used <a href="InterCal.html">InterCal</a> rather than those wimpy OO languages with GuiBuilders and <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> and HigherOrderWhatevers, we could find work for every programmer in the US, Europe, India, China, and Japan...and still not finish any productive software on time.  <strong>Then</strong>, automation would grind to a halt, and numerous other workers who were replaced with computers would find work again.
