        Lucid Fried Eggs is a PHP/MySQL application found on <a href="http://www.memes.net">http://www.memes.net</a> .
      </p>
      <p>
        It was developed in response to a CoSource ( <a href="http://www.cosource.com">http://www.cosource.com</a> ) request for an open source version of The Brain ( <a href="http://www.thebrain.com">http://www.thebrain.com</a> ).

        It's basically a collaborative collection of notes organized in a semi-hierarchical fashion. Each note can connect to any other note as a parent, child or jump link. Any note may have more than one parent, which makes this somewhat different from a traditional hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a little different from Wiki in that the navigation of notes is very structured. Links and relationships are identified to give the reader a better understanding of the entire structure.
