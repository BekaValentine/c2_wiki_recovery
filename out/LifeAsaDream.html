        In this page we are exploring another useful aspects from <a href="LifePatterns.html">LifePatterns</a>.  The <em>Dream</em> refers to a <em>vision</em> that energizes a person, a group, or a nation.

        In the Christian and Jewish religions, within <a href="TheBible.html">TheBible</a> it was said 
        "Where there is no vision, the people perish". -- Proverbs 29:18 (KJV)

        <strong>walking on the moon was once a dream</strong>

        "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth". -President John F. Kennedy (1961)

        "For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.
        ...
        We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."

        We have different capabilities, even the most foolhardy amongst us can benefits from <em>The Impossible Dream</em> of Don Quixote. There is a deeper meaning to the task of taking up windmills.

        In shamanic traditions, lucid dreaming and control of your dreams is a prelude to greater control of the "dream" which we interpret as "reality".

        The author of <a href="TheHeartOfSuccess.html">TheHeartOfSuccess</a> was said to have remarked:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The problem with most business people is that they have stopped dreaming. It was their dreams that inspired them but now their businesses are established. Their friends may admire them, and their bank managers may send them diaries at Christmas, but they have stopped dreaming. They are now administrators.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

        Some philosophies embrace the notion that all you know of a world around you, waking or sleeping, is that which you perceive.  You cannot deductively prove that an objective reality exists, and you cannot deductively prove that dreams aren't perceptions of real worlds.
