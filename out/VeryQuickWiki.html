      <p>
        Very Quick Wiki is originally by <a href="GarethCronin.html">GarethCronin</a> and has been taken over by MartijnVanDerKleijn since September 2005. It can be downloaded from: <a href="http://www.vqwiki.org/downloads.php">http://www.vqwiki.org/downloads.php</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/veryquickwiki.">http://sourceforge.net/projects/veryquickwiki.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The project has its own domain since around december 2005: <a href="http://www.vqwiki.org">http://www.vqwiki.org</a> This domain also hosts its own VQWiki instance running the latest version. (released on May 1st, 2006: v.2.7.8)
      </p>
      <p>
        It consists of a few JSPs and a few class files. It subscribes to almost all of the <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a> to conform to the <a href="WikiPrinciples.html">WikiPrinciples</a>, and includes a <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> system and a search engine - it resides in a single WAR file. Drop it into the <a href="ApacheTomcat.html">ApacheTomcat</a> webapps directory or deploy in some other J2EE container instantly - no configuration necessary.

      <p>
        Version 2.2 released on 24th October 2002 features email subscription/notification for topic changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          reports for all topics, orphaned topics, to-do topics
        </li>
        <li>
          an admin console where topics can be locked (e.g. if you want to lock your <a href="StartingPoints.html">StartingPoints</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          a full built-in diff function that <em>doesn't</em> depend on having the Unix diff tool (or a port of it) on your system

          username cookies
        </li>

          binary file uploads/attachments
        </li>
        <li>
          optional HTML support (not recommended for public Wiki, but useful on Intranets)
        </li>
        <li>
          Words in "<a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>" become links to topics as named by the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>. VQWiki also allows wiki-naming by surrounding a word in back-ticks. (No spaces allowed in back-ticked <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>s.)
        </li>
        <li>
          VQWiki features changeable parsers. This means you can write your own parser. It currently supports parsers based on JFlex but a new system supporting more parsers is in the works.
        </li>
      </ul>

        It took me a while to find my way through the source code for this wiki. I will excerpt a few key files here to show you what it looks like. It starts with a jsp file. This is an html file that has escapes into java code. The java code in this jsp creates a file handler and asks it to readLinked() at the point where it wants the processed page text to appear within the html.
      </p>

        <html><br/>

      <p>

        <%@page import="vqwiki.*"%>
        <%
        String topic = request.getQueryString();
        if( topic == null )
      </p>
      <code>
        topic = "StartingPoints";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        FileHandler handler = new FileHandler();
        handler.setFileName( topic + ".txt" );
        %>
        </head>
        <body>
        <h1><%= topic %></h1>
        <%=handler.readLinked()%>
        <hr>
        <a href="edit.jsp?topic=<%=topic%>">Edit This</a>
        </body>
      </p>
      <code>
        </html><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here is the implementation of readLinked() where the raw text file is opened. The opened input file is passed on to another program called Yylex where the token by token translation to html takes place. 
      </p>
      <code>
        public synchronized String readLinked( String fileName ) throws IOException{<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        String contents = "";
        fileName = fileBase + System.getProperty( "file.separator" ) + fileName;
        file = new File( fileName );
        if( file.exists() ){
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader( new FileReader( file ) );
        Yylex lexer = new Yylex( in );
        while( true ){
        String line = lexer.yylex();
        if( line == null ) break;
        contents += line;
        }
        }
        else
        return null;
      </p>
      <code>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here is the source for Yylex. This isn't java. It is a special language for describing tokens using regular expressions. After a few declarations, it is basically one big switch statement that answers what to do with various character sequences found in the input.

        I have taken some liberties with this code. Mostly I've deleted boilerplate that is required to hook the pieces together. I've also mixed a few versions as I sought to find the essence. If you are studying this and finding inconsistencies, it is time to read the real source. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        It took me about 2 mins to set this up and start playing - great little program! It then took about half an hour to find out where it was putting the text files (turns out to be in the users default dir under Win2K). Would be nicer if they were somewhere under WEB-INF for the application. I wonder if minimal database support could be added......

        I set up a wiki in my group using <a href="VeryQuickWiki.html">VeryQuickWiki</a>. But I had to make some modifications on the JSPs and yylex to make it fit in Chinese. That edition can only run on containers that support servlet 2.3. I wonder whether these modifications can help others. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Those modifications will be added to the main release in the near future; in the mean time, I'll put them up on the web site. Which 2.3-only features are being used?</em>

        I seem to have a problem with edit locks in 2.4 on a filesystem-based 'vanilla' install. Any tips or tricks to be allowed to edit my pages again?
        Solution: rename the filename.lock to filename (overwrite).

           thinkbase provide a solution (it use UTF-8 entirely)

        <em>There is another GBK version, which use GBK for character encoding.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since VQWiki release 2.7.8 it has full support for UTF-8. This should mean full support for languages like Chinese or Japanese.
