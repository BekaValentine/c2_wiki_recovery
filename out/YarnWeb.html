        Yarn Web
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's a large circle of people. Equally spaced around the circle are people holding multi-coloured balls of yarn. Each ball of yarn has a loop at the end. The loop goes over a finger of the non-dominant hand. The balls are thrown across the circle, the catcher adds a turn of yarn around their finger and throws it on. Repeat until all the balls of yarn are used up.

        The group has built a beautiful yarn web that they then place on the floor as a symbol of their interactions and connectedness.
