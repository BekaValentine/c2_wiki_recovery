        Early Binding
      </h1>
      <p>
        In early binding, the compiler must know the object that is being referred to at compile time.  Also known as static linking or static binding. It typically results in faster code than an equivalent ahead-of-time compiler using late binding, because references can be translated into more direct, immediate actions and more easily optimized by the compiler. <a href="DynamicCompilation.html">DynamicCompilation</a> can late-bind code without a performance penalty, but at the one-time cost of compilation at runtime.
