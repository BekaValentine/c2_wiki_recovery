        Every great scientific truth goes through three stages: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           First, people say it conflicts with the Bible. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Next they say it had been discovered before. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Lastly, they say they always believed it.

        Be willing to make decisions. That's the most important quality in a good leader. Don't fall victim to what I call the Ready-Aim-Aim-Aim Syndrome. You must be willing to fire. -- T. Boone Pickens

      <p>
        If the opposite of a great truth is another great truth, then Mr Pickens has perpetrated a great truth, to which the opposing great truth is the usual sequentiae of "Ready, Fire, Aim."  The fulsome overpraising of the "bias for action" in management textbooks has led to numerous real-world examples.

        OK. They're not short but they are beautiful (that's not the quote):

        Quote #1:
      </p>
      <p>
        All ideas come from sensation or reflection. Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas:- How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from EXPERIENCE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quote #2:
      </p>
      <p>
        The senses at first let in particular ideas, and furnish the yet empty cabinet, and the mind by degrees growing familiar with some of them, they are lodged in the memory, and names got to them. Afterwards, the mind proceeding further, abstracts them, and by degrees learns the use of general names.

        "The best thing for being sad," replied Merlin, beginning to puff and blow, "is to learn something. That's the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then - to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a lot of things there are to learn." -- T.H. White, "The Once and Future King"
