        Over the past decade I've observed an increasing trend of technical leadership getting less technical -- MBAs, even Accountants who's never been in the trenches seem to be taking over -- mainly due to the stereotype that geeks are incapable of speaking layman's language, don't care about the important business issues of the day, and are inept socially and day-to-day.

        Is this in sync with other people's exp.? And is there such a thing as <a href="GeekCeiling.html">GeekCeiling</a>? Thanks for sharing. - JoeX.

        <em>The smartest geeks do tend to be socially lacking in my observation. Those techies who move into management tended to survive by hard work or political meneuvoring and less on tech smarts.</em>
