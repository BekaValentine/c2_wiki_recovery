        Wiki experienced <a href="CantOpenWikiDbForUpdate.html">CantOpenWikiDbForUpdate</a> plague at one time.

        <strong>This was once (August 2001 to March 2002) a problem. </strong>

        Please see <a href="WikiWikiSystemNotice.html">WikiWikiSystemNotice</a> (and cautiously rejoice).

        Let's do a quick counting vote to confirm:
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have noticed that this is no longer a problem (since March 1, 2002)":
      </p>
      <code>
        [10] Agree<br/>
        [0] Somewhat agree (still happens but not as much as before)<br/>
        [0] Disagree<br/>
        [0] Don't Know<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If the information really is logged, as per the message, why is a vote needed?

        The logs show zero errors of this nature since the conversion a week ago. I would be interested to know if there were some other effect I hadn't anticipated. Other errors that continue to be logged are ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Can't sustain current request rate (thousands, from a few sites)
        </li>
        <li>
           Page changed by ... your changes not saved (dozens)
        </li>
        <li>
           Empty text field (few)
        </li>
        <li>
           No change to text (dozens)
        </li>
      </ul>

        See <a href="WikiLockSolutions.html">WikiLockSolutions</a> for speculation on this problem.

        <em>I have been watching this problem from the server side and suffering with it as would any wiki author. I don't believe readers of </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> create the load that locks out update. Much more likely are the many sites that spider wiki with five to ten requests per second for extended periods of time. (I could be wrong. <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> does do many probes to see if its many page references are valid. But, then, <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> actually does more work because it retrieves the last changed date for each page.) -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Even thought <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> usually has far more links than <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>?
