        Memory Asa Programming Concept

        From the Preface:
      </p>
      <p>
        "The motivation for this book came from years of observing computer science students at universities as well as professional programmers working in software development. I had come to the conclusion that there seemed to be a gap in their understanding of programming. They usually understood the syntax of the programming language they were using and had a reasonable grasp of such topics as algorithms and data. However, a program is not executed in a vacuum; it is executed in computer memory. This simple fact exerts a powerful influence on the actual behavior of the program -- or, expressed more precisely, a subtle yet powerful influence on the semantics of the particular programming language. I had observed that many students and programmers did not fully understand how memory affected the behavior of the C and C++ programs they were designing. This book is an attempt to fill this gap and provide students and programmers alike with a text that is focused on this topic."

        Back before embarking on the "enormous challenge" (as the Sun PR machine ludicrously describes it) of creating a "programming language better than Java", <a href="GuySteele.html">GuySteele</a> co-authored papers in the <a href="LambdaTheUltimate.html">LambdaTheUltimate</a> series concerning a processor design that executed a cut down <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> directly on the metal. see <a href="http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html">http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html</a> <em>"Design of LISP-based Processors, or SCHEME: A Dielectric LISP, or Finite Memories Considered Harmful, or LAMBDA: The Ultimate Opcode"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This design captured several interesting ideas to do with memory as a programming concept.
