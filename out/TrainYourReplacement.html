        Train Your Replacement

      <p>
        <strong>Problem: </strong>
        How to leverage <a href="ComingUpToSpeed.html">ComingUpToSpeed</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong>
        You're in a new situation, and are "coming up to speed."
        There's not a lot written down yet.
        Others will follow the same or similar paths as the
        project staffs up or evolves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces: </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You want to be up to speed and productive, and want to avoid anything that slows this process down.
        </li>
        <li>
           The organization needs productive people.
        </li>
        <li>
           The project needs to get more "stuff" written down.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution: </strong>
        Adopt the mindset that you're responsible for training
        your (possibly fictional) replacement.  (If it feels
        safer, suppose a new team member instead.)
        Arrange to gather and record information that will
        help your replacement come up to speed.
        This mindset will drive you to seek a deeper understanding
        of issues.  (And pushing issues on behalf of a third party
        may feel somehow safer.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context: </strong>
        You'll achieve a greater understanding of the
        problem at hand than you otherwise would have,
        and you've cleared the path for those who'll follow.
        If you're promoted and actually end up with a replacement, it's probably a win-win.
        At worst, you'll have refined your skills at problem
        definition and refinement,
        and will have helped the project
        get things written down.
