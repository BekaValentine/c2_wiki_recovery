      <p>
        Jeff Sandys is a design engineer at a large aerospace company in Seattle.  I lead a design automation group that uses Lisp based ICAD.  We also use Python for glueware between large applications and cgi scripts.

        I enjoyed the talk that <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> gave to the Seattle Extreme Programming Group, in January. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am implementing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> practices in my group and because we still need to deliver P+ documentation, I have set up a Wiki to do Extreme Programming documentation.  <strong>Has anyone else done this?</strong>
