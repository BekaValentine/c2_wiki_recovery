        Tic Tac Toe

        Solved. A draw with optimal play from both players.

        In The<a href="PsychologyOfEverydayThings.html">PsychologyOfEverydayThings</a>, he describes a game in which alternating players select numbers from 1 to 9, and the winner is the first to get three numbers that add up to 15. It certainly takes a lot of thought to play effectively. Unless, of course, you use this handy little visual aid:

        Equally useless, I started writing a learning tic-tac-toe game with my kids. We never got it to play optimally, but with some very simple rules and a lot of trial games it did learn something. One interesting aspect of the project was that I wrote a cgi script to browse memory dumps from the program. These are board configurations with counts towards wins. The browser lets you compare the amount of learning that is represented by various dumps. Have a look. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Any learning algorithm that does not take account of symmetries in the domain will learn vastly slower than otherwise, since it must learn each symmetry group item separately rather than generalizing one solution to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, adding the ability to learn symmetries makes any such project a much larger conceptual challenge. Yet simply hardwiring the appropriate symmetries is cheating, isn't it? Which of course brings up <a href="DanielHillis.html">DanielHillis</a>' MIT AI Lab koan:

        In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him<br/>
        as he sat hacking at the PDP-6.<br/>
        "What are you doing?", asked Minsky.<br/>
        "I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe",<br/>
        Sussman replied.<br/>
        "Why is the net wired randomly?", asked Minsky.<br/>
        "I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play",<br/>
        Sussman said.<br/>
        Minsky then shut his eyes.<br/>
        "Why do you close your eyes?", Sussman asked his teacher.<br/>
        "So that the room will be empty."<br/>
        At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.<br/>

        The 3-dimensional (4x4x4) version (called Qubic) is more fun. See <a href="http://www.wylliedraughts.com/Qubic.htm">http://www.wylliedraughts.com/Qubic.htm</a> for some details and a program.
