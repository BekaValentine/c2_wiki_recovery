        Should the <a href="PrinciplesForGoodGuys.html">PrinciplesForGoodGuys</a> place the good guys at risk?

        <em>When they aren't able to continue to follow these principles, they stop being good guys.</em>

        Gene Autryï¿½s Saturday matinee saddle pals wanted to be just like their hero. Gene responded with the Cowboy Code, sometimes known as the Cowboy Commandments. They are as relevant today as they were then.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Cowboy must never shoot first, hit a smaller man, or take unfair advantage.
        </li>
        <li>
           He must never go back on his word, or a trust confided in him.

           He must always tell the truth.
