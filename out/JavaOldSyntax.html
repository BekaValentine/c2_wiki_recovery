        Java Old Syntax
      </h1>
      <p>
        Java syntax is modelled after <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, which is intended to promote programmer portability. Since <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> was set in 1972, improved syntaxes have been presented.
      </p>
      <code>
        Better syntax       -> greater clarity, fewer lines of code.<br/>
        Fewer lines of code -> less writing, lower initial cost.<br/>
        Greater clarity     -> lower maintenance cost.<br/>
        Lower cost          -> more value.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Look how well Python and C# (<a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a>) have done. Java could do better. As a matter of fact, I think this is a key value that people are ignoring. It is much more important than this castings/cloneable stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Huh? </em><a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> also borrows its syntax from C.<em></em>

           I'm an old C guy. Frankly, I'm a lot happier in just about any language than Java. I think its syntax has improved since 1.5 ... but it's still a verbose and overblown piece of hacked on munge-bait. "Fewer lines of code" is particularly ridicuolous. Go learn <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> and <a href="WpFe.html">WpFe</a> and let java die its long overdue death. Even <a href="CeePlusPlusIsBetterThanJava.html">CeePlusPlusIsBetterThanJava</a>. So there.
