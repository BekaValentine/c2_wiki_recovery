        Writing Is Rewriting
      </h1>
      <p>
        Among writers, this common saying represents the idea that <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> is the greater part of writing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first draft of a text is rarely very clean. We often mash many ideas together in confusing lumps. <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> helps us to untangle these ideas; and to clearly see the points we are trying to make. <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> makes editing easier. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WritingIsRewriting.html">WritingIsRewriting</a> is in no way meant to equate the two terms. However, among many programmers, the two terms are indeed considered equal. For example, when programmers say that they are "<a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a>" a program, they usually mean they are <a href="WritingCodeFromScratch.html">WritingCodeFromScratch</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overloading of the word <em>rewrite</em> has left programmers without a word to represent the traditional meaning of <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a>. Recently, the term <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> emerged. <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> is used throughout Wiki synonymously with <a href="ReWriting.html">ReWriting</a> in the traditional sense. See <a href="RefactorByMerging.html">RefactorByMerging</a>, <a href="HumbleRefactorer.html">HumbleRefactorer</a>, <a href="CanYouRefactoraLiveThread.html">CanYouRefactoraLiveThread</a>, <a href="DeleteDontRefactor.html">DeleteDontRefactor</a>, and so on.

        In <em></em><a href="RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode.html">RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode</a><em>, </em><a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> had this to say on the origins of the term:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>I've not succeeded in pinning down the real birth of the term <em>refactoring</em>. Good programmers certainly have spent at least some time cleaning up their code. They do this because they have learned that clean code is easier to change than complex and messy code, and good programmers know that they rarely write clean code the first time around.</dd>
