        Wiki Rewrites History Applause
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is only one page that I started on Wiki that every time I come back to it gives me guaranteed, massive pleasure, often causing loud guffaws.

        <a href="ThankYou.html">ThankYou</a>, Wiki, for what you have done with <a href="WikiRewritesHistory.html">WikiRewritesHistory</a>. Anonymous all. Indeed, anonymity at its coolest. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        (For the record, the anonymous comment at the start of the last section, mentioning <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>, was <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>'s. This was within an hour or two of my creating the page and putting up the first half dozen possibilities, within a fortnight of first experiencing Wiki in January 1999. Does that matter? Given <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a> and all that I mean. Ah well, a delete of this page by Ward himself would be one answer.)

        On the Fermat: Let's hope that note and the system containing it lasts longer than the copy of Diophantus's Arithmetica he wrote <a href="FermatsLastTheorem.html">FermatsLastTheorem</a> in.

        The addition of The Holy Quran is simply inspired.

        Whoever 'improved' that had a sense of humor failure. We all know it wasn't 'what he really said' but it was much funnier this way.
