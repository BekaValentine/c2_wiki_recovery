        Smug Python Weenie
      </h1>
      <p>
        With descriptions of <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a> and <a href="SmugErlangWeenie.html">SmugErlangWeenie</a>, surely there's a place for the <a href="SmugPythonWeenie.html">SmugPythonWeenie</a>. These folks generally have it in for <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, but sometimes target other scripting languages. Perl has a philosophy called <a href="TimTowTdi.html">TimTowTdi</a>: <a href="ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt.html">ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt</a>. Python has TNTRWTDI: That's Not The Right Way To Do It. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em><smug>But that's because most of the possible ways to do it are Not The Right Way because they are:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>less readable;</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>orders of magnitude slower;</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>prone to error; and/or</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>more difficult to maintain.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>There is generally a broad degree of consensus among Pythonistas about what the Right Thing to do is.</smug></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="SmugPythonWeenie.html">SmugPythonWeenie</a> will insist that when you run into something that irritates you about the language (block ends are hard to see) the failing is actually yours instead (your blocks are too long).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's actually a going point, and I've used the same argument in favor of } over "end if" etc in overly wordy languages like </em><a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>.  If you can't tell which block is ending or can't find the closing brace, your blocks are too long.  It's a valid criticism in any context.  <a href="SmallIsBeautiful.html">SmallIsBeautiful</a>.<em></em>

        Now, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> may have its share of weenies, but 'taint nothing compared to those of <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> or <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>.  (And <a href="ErlangLanguage.html">ErlangLanguage</a>!  Why does <em>it</em> have a weenies page?  You can count <em>those</em> weenies on a single hand, it seems!)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Speaking as a former </em>SmugAmigaWeenie, I can tell you that you don't have to have huge numbers to be overly smug. As a matter of fact, the smaller the minority, the more the group tends to take on the tone of an underdog unfairly treated by the world. (It's been discussed a lot.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (I'd say that programmers tend to be a lot less religious about Python than users of other languages.  It's a language for getting things done, not a shining jewel of a language that focuses on elegant but controversial features.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Where, in the Python community, does one find a <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> or <a href="ErikNaggum.html">ErikNaggum</a> -- someone who can constantly find new and elegant ways to tell you you're an idiot for not using Python?  And unlike <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a>, <a href="GuidoVanRossum.html">GuidoVanRossum</a> is about as down-home, humble, and self-deprecating as you can get.  I guess <a href="EricRaymond.html">EricRaymond</a> can be annoyingly smug at times, but usually, he's talking about something other than Python when he starts popping off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python programmers are just too <em>nice</em> to have a SmugWeenies page written about 'em!
