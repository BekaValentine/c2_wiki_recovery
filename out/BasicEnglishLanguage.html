        Basic English Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Basic English was published in 1930 by <a href="CharlesKayOgden.html">CharlesKayOgden</a> and claimed to be English reduced to a vocabulary of 850 words, yet still suitable for uses in commerce, science, and the arts.

      <p>
        <em>C. K. Ogden worked about the meaning of words and tried to reduce the necessary vocabulary to express meaning to a minimum. E.g., he managed to work with only 16 verbs (he called them operators). In </em><a href="ThelopLanguage.html">ThelopLanguage</a>, I follow similar lines of thought. -- <a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a><em></em>
