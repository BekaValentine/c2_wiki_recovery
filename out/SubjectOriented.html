        Subject Oriented
      </h1>
      <p>
        We all know what <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> means. But what does <a href="SubjectOriented.html">SubjectOriented</a> mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well there have been lots of people trying to make it mean something pretty much since <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> was invented. But nothing has stuck. <a href="DoshMosh.html">DoshMosh</a> uses the term in a RestFul way. Basically it regards web pages, tweets, posts and user opinions of all sorts as representations of a subject. And it allows people to contrast and compare those subjects. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is pretty different to what we do with methods on objects. Subjects don't have methods - they have contexts. Which are a little bit like aspects - except arranged in a <a href="SemiLattice.html">SemiLattice</a>. So it is conceivable that a system could be <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> and <a href="SubjectOriented.html">SubjectOriented</a> at the same time ...
