        <em>[Tim BL] coined the name, and also implemented HTTP (</em><a href="HyperTextTransferProtocol.html">HyperTextTransferProtocol</a>), HTML (<a href="HyperTextMarkupLanguage.html">HyperTextMarkupLanguage</a>), URIs (<a href="UniformResourceIdentifier.html">UniformResourceIdentifier</a>), and the first HTTP servers and clients. The story is told in <a href="WeavingTheWeb.html">WeavingTheWeb</a>. You have him (and Ward :-) to thank for the fact that you could even read or edit this page. -- <a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a><em></em>

        Is this a generally accepted fact that Tim not only proposed the formal idea of WWW but also _originated_ it himself? Hadn't there been any work or idea which could be called WWW in some sense, before him? What is the common _academic_ opinion concerning this? -- <a href="JuneKim.html">JuneKim</a>

        There was tons of work done. In 1987, two years before TBL did anything, the first <em>hypertext conference</em> (with the name 'hypertext' in the conference title) was held, and 29 papers were published. Hypertext had been an idea for two decades by that point. <a href="TedNelson.html">TedNelson</a> had convened TheXanaduGroup to work on a much, much more sophisticated version of a global hypertext system in <strong>1979</strong>. <a href="DougEngelbart.html">DougEngelbart</a> demonstrated the hyperlink in <a href="TheMotherOfAllDemos.html">TheMotherOfAllDemos</a> in <strong>1968</strong>. What Tim Berners Lee was was a johnny come lately who wrote a hacked up piece of crap that didn't fulfill a fraction of what the original specs for such a system were, but he released it anyways. And that's why it became popular, because he released it.

        <em>Yes, released it as opposed to presenting papers about it at "hypertext conferences" for 20 years. See </em><a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a>.<em></em>
