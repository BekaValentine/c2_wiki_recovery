        How prevalent is this style in the contemporary (2003) ANSI C++ world? I got out of C++ just as the STL was getting going, but then I came back into the Symbian C++ world, which is non ANSI and has its own ideas about templates, collections (even strings). If I were to head back into the ANSI world, would I <em>need</em> to know STL?

        <em>This is in my opinion worth reading as it carefully defines some of the concepts which other references assume are self-evident. The early examples show how the concepts work.

        To make the examples 100% Pure ANSI C++, change:
      </p>
      <code>
        #include <iostream.h><br/>
        #include <vector.h><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        into:
      </p>
      <code>
        #include <iostream><br/>
        #include <vector><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and put after the includes section the line:
      </p>
      <code>
        using namespace std;<br/>
      </code>

        Don't use "using namespace std". Scope everything with "std::".
        This way you don't pollute your global namespace. It's in a namespace for a reason! :)
      </p>

        <em>It's far better to pollute your program with std:: all over the place...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a middle ground to that, importing only the bits you need. But the advice to "using namespace std" was only given to make the old examples on this page compile I believe. The point is rather moot now.
      </p>

        <em>Practically, can anyone construct a valid argument against using namespace std; in source code files? The only place I can see it being a </em><a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a> is in headers, where it has the effect of trailing the std:: namespace (in other words, the interface to the StandardCppLibrary) along with the interface of your class or classes.<em> -- </em><a href="JonKale.html">JonKale</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the solution is:
      </p>
      <code>
        #include <vector><br/>
        #include <string><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and then just put the minimal "using":
      </p>
      <code>
        {<br/>
        using std::vector;<br/>
        using std::string;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        //your code here<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        First, the using keyword is used only for the used class (dependencies appear more explicitly), and then it does not pollute the global space because the using are between the { } (these could be the brackets of a particular method or namespace). -- Pierre-YvesMartin

        <em>Um, yeah, this is good so you can declare your own classes classes vector and string. And that's a good idea because ... hey, wait a minute, that's a lousy idea!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Apart from the un-</em><a href="SelfDocumentingCode.html">SelfDocumentingCode</a>ness of sticking std:: everywhere, your using declarations are just waiting to catch up some poor maintenance programmer who cuts and pastes badly. Maintenance programmers shouldn't have to wade through template error messages just so one day you can declare your own <vector> ...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You wouldn't define your own vector or string, but you may e.g. define your own unordered_map (which use hashing), and then in the next version of C++, where this may be added, you will experience a name clash.

        This did happen for me in JAVA, although it was when using AWT's List class. In a later version they introduced a List class as part of their award winning container framework (actual quote!), and suddenly my code no longer would compile.

        To solve many of the above arguments, I typedef most of my STL containers.  A typedef is a whole lot easier to work
        with than having to write std::vector<std::string>::iterator every time you want an iterator.  I like
        something like StringList::iterator much better.

        I always do it to avoid a particularly nasty link-stage problem. All the symbols that are in the C standard library are present in the root namespace but not declared there. Accidentally defining a C symbol (hint: global variables aren't mangled) in the root namespace can result in all calls to the name in the std namespace as going to the wrong place.
