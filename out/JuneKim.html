        <em>In which case, June, we'd love to have you take a look at </em><a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a>, without wishing to poach you from Wiki. See the end of FreeThinker and <a href="OpennessOfGod.html">OpennessOfGod</a> here to see the two mentions of Whitehead and process thinking that I know of on Wiki (cos I wrote them). Slightly related also is the stuff on <a href="RogerPenrose.html">RogerPenrose</a> and his collaborator <a href="StuartHameroff.html">StuartHameroff</a>, both of whom look to Whitehead to some degree, especially the latter. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a><em></em>

        Thank you for your directions. I'm on them. It seems to me that [those] places are rather religious (or unreligious in a religious way) than philosophical, and I'm not really knowledgeable of the heavenly side - I'm too down-to-earth to be religious, but just enough to remain philosophical. As far as the Whitehead is concerned, I'm more interested in the cosmology, wherein God is just a part of it. My favourites of Whitehead are <em>Process and Reality</em>, <em>The Adventure of Ideas</em>, and <em>The Function of Reason</em>, though I couldn't understand them fully.

        He wrote an article about <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> in Micro-Software Magazine, one of the bestselling computer magazines in Korea. The article introduces Wiki concept and its implication in the internet age. It goes further toward its usage as a knowledge management tool and is compared with Nonaka Ikujiro's organizational knowledge evolution model.

        I'm with a school group at the University of Michigan's School of Information that has taken "Wikis" as our topic for a project in Computer Supported Cooperative Work. I'd very much like to read your article - or, hear other pointers you might have from the experience of writing it. Thanks - <a href="TomAllison.html">TomAllison</a>

        I got your email Tom. Thank you for your interest. Unfortunately, I'm leaving home tomorrow morning for Japan to attend Conference on Creating, Connecting and Collaborating through Computing. When I come back on Feb 2, I'll drop you a line. -- <a href="JuneKim.html">JuneKim</a>
