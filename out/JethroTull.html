        Jethro Tull

        <a href="JethroTull.html">JethroTull</a> almost singlehandedly invented the AgriculturalRevolution in eighteenth century England, thus providing the infrastructure to support the <a href="IndustrialRevolution.html">IndustrialRevolution</a>.

        His best known inventions are the seed-drill and the horse-drawn hoe.

        Also a Prog/Folk outfit.

        Or a "heavy metal" group, if the Grammy committee of 1988 (1987?) is to be believed.

        Damned group.  Won't stay in its bloody pigeonhole.

           I remember that some kid with the bad luck to be wearing a Tull t-shirt in the wrong place at the wrong time, got beaten up by a bunch of Metallica fans after Tull won the Heavy Metal Grammy; a prize many expected would be won by Metallica.  Metallica probably deserved the award; their <em>...And Justice For All</em> was far better work than Tull's <em>Crest of a Knave</em>.  But as usual, the Grammy folks have no clue whatsoever.

        Damn!  I was admiring that, too.  I must be living in the past.

        According to the band, they settled on the name Jethro Tull for no reason other that that's the name (out of many) that they were performing under, when they started to get popular.  Before that, they'd change names whenever they found themselves unable to get gigs; reinvented as a "new" band, they thus got to play all the local clubs all over again before the managers thereof figured out what was up.
