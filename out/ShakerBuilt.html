        HGTV had a show (Sunday, 2002/01/27) about the Shakers. They're famous as masters of "the simplest thing that might possibly work," but have a reputation as technophobes. Not so.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Shakers invented, among other things, the circular saw, the washing machine, and the "flat" broom (the kind we have today). Not only that, they manufactured and sold them commercially.
      </p>

        Not only *that*, but the simple things they built are beautiful as well as functional, and have lasted (often in design, sometimes physically) for a century or more.

        Sounds like folks we (software developers) could learn something from.  --<a href="PaulChisholm.html">PaulChisholm</a>
