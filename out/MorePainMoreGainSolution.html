        More Pain More Gain Solution
      </h1>

        A commonly encountered arrangement of opposing forces is one where cost is proportional to benefit.  In other words, cost rises as benefit rises.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to solve this type of problem is to define a desired minimum benefit, and strive to <em>achieve but only achieve</em> this minimum benefit.  We can call this a <a href="MorePainMoreGainSolution.html">MorePainMoreGainSolution</a>.

        Is there a name for when 100% is significantly better than anything less? This is being claimed for XP as a whole, and there are other examples. Eg if something works 99.5% of the time, you still need the overhead of checking it, and the cost of checking for rare events may be as high as for common ones. If it works 100%, you can eliminate the checks. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        GO/NOGO?  Btw, eXtremists <em>believe</em> that there is a popping effect with "all" the practices in place, that gives an extra kick to productivity.  It's not particularly magic (if it's true), it's just a curve that arcs upward, like any power of N > 1.  I'm not sure what the checking notion is: I'm not aware of anything in the material universe that CANNOT fail.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Think guaranteed algorithm vs a heuristic.

        I've had this go both ways. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes a guaranteed algorithm fails, usually because the primitives it uses break. For example, someone changes a database column type to be case-insensitive, or the algorithm uses floating point and doesn't take enough care about accumulated errors.  In both of these cases, treating the algorithm as heuristic would have resulted in better run-time behavior.  If you expect that some code will never fail, your failure behavior may be unexpectedly bad!

        I was also in a design discussion where it was proposed that we "not let power fail". The idea was to make the power delivery system sufficient redundant (through e.g. fine-granularity UPS near or embedded in each component) that catastrophic power loss was deemed "impossible". The software design would have become much simpler, but wow! what an assumption to make. --<a href="GarthDickie.html">GarthDickie</a>
