        I live in Rochester, New York.  When I'm not goofing-off, I work as a Software Engineer.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I just realized something stupid.  Here's a list of the companies I have worked for, in reverse chronological order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Lab X Technologies  (current employer, <a href="http://www.labxtechnologies.com)">http://www.labxtechnologies.com)</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Performance Technologies (<a href="http://www.pt.com)">http://www.pt.com)</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Applied Research and Technology (<a href="http://www.artroch.com)">http://www.artroch.com)</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Rochester Software Technologies (<a href="http://www.rstsoftware.com)">http://www.rstsoftware.com)</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Yes, I apparently can only work for companies that have "technology" in their name.  The end result of this is that most of my family doesn't really know what I do for a living.  I need to work for a company that has a nice, unambiguous name-- like <em>Bob's Auto Parts</em> or maybe <em>Sam's Deli</em>-- then they would know I had a real job.

        One day, I want to start restaurant.  It's going to be some small, quiet, hole-in-the-wall someplace where people can get the best Greek/Korean/Mexican "fusion cuisine" in the city.  It will get rave reviews and have scores of famous people visiting from all around the world.  But after a few years of struggling to survive, paying the mob protection money, and having our head chef leaving for a television career as the replacement for Emeril Lagasse, we'll close.  We'll shut the doors, and move out to Arizona where my partner and I will sip iced tea all day and make mad passionate love all night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that's the plan, but for now, I just write software.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em>WhatDoesOneDay mean.<em> How does one know it when it is? Will the restaurant have technology in its name, like possibly calling it Techno Fusion Food Shack? Maybe when </em>OneDayFinallyArrives you can save a lot of money and time by going straight to the "shut the doors" part and arrive in Arizona in front, ahead, and before the crowd. <em></em>ButForNowDreamsWillDo<em> -- :) </em>
