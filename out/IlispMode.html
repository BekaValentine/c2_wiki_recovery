        Ilisp Mode
      </h1>
      <p>
        ILISP is ``a comprehensive (X)Emacs interface for an inferior Common Lisp, or other Lisp based languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        ``Currently ILISP can handle the connection with the following Common Lisp and Scheme implementations: CMUCL, CLisp by B. Haible and M. Stoll, Harlequin <a href="LispWorks.html">LispWorks</a>, Franz Allegro CL, many KCL derivatives (including GCL), and
        various Scheme implementations. <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find out more at <a href="http://ilisp.cons.org/">http://ilisp.cons.org/</a> or download it from

      </p>
      <p>
        For a long time <a href="IlispMode.html">IlispMode</a> had the dubious honour of being "just good enough"; although very easily confused and with viciously opaque failure modes, it was sufficiently good that nobody was motivated to write anything better.  Happily in late 2003 a new project - the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs, or SLIME (<a href="SlimeMode.html">SlimeMode</a>) was created, which as of May 2004 though still pre-1.0 is about ready for real work and already more useful for many people than ILISP.
