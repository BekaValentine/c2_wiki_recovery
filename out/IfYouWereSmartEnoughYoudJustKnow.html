        If You Were Smart Enough Youd Just Know
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a common informal fallacy that I encounter on this wiki in various debates. It appears to be an excuse to not have to provide explicit evidence and explicit logic. Variations include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you read all the books I did, you'd just know that X is better or right.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you where as smart as me, you'd just know that X is better or right.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you used tool X long enough, you'd just know that X is better or right.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you knew X well enough, you'd just know what an X is and isn't (definition).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's a variation of <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>. "Just know" implies one will <em>feel</em> the truth in their bones. It almost reminds me of a religious missionary who insists you read their scripture set and then pray, and then (insert your favorite deity) will put the feeling into your body and you'll just <strong>feel the truth</strong> throughout your body like a kind of electricity. Logic and evidence need not apply.

        <em>I appreciate that you perceive it that way, but you're probably misinterpreting one of our great frustrations with you: your inclination to criticise, with obviously little understanding, fields that some of us have spent decades studying in great depth.  It has nothing to do with you being as "smart as me", and everything to do with what could be the decades I have spent reading books about 'X', using 'X', and gaining an in-depth education in the subject area to which 'X' belongs.  It's rather insulting for you to wander in, with obviously only a glancing familiarity of 'X', and act like you know better or that we should be obligated to defend 'X'.</em>

        If your field of study fails to provide you with the tools/knowledge/skills to <strong>present</strong> clear, direct, and objective evidence related to it, then your field is <strong>doing something wrong</strong>. The fault is not me, it's the lack of science in your field (or your memory's inability to remember the science-side). Go kick your school, NOT me.

        It's quite possible many universities have inadvertently ended up relying too heavily on <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> over the years in software fields out of habit and tradition, perhaps because of insufficient criticism. You may have picked up and absorbed this bad habit, and have grown science-blind over time. The field of psychology has even admitted it made a similar mistake (heavily due to difficulty in conducting repeatable science), and is now trying to remedy that. Thus, it does and can happen to fields. -t

        <em>It's possible, but you haven't yet demonstrated evidence of it.  More likely, you simply don't know enough about the subject to either criticise it intelligently or fully understand the responses to your critique.  The job of subject education is not to create a sound-bite defences of it when pointlessly challenged by the deliberately naïve.  Your perception of </em><a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> is also an apparent product of that deliberate naïvety.<em></em>

        We are usually talking about tools. One does <em>not</em> have to know how cars work to know if car A is "better than" car B. You can't just say "Car B is better because it uses the Groppenheimer spark plug valve (G-valve)" <strong>alone</strong>. Instead you'd need to explain what <strong>practical</strong> benefit(s) a G-valve provides to users (car drivers), such as better acceleration. The <strong>user (driver) can then verify that claim</strong>. Many of your claims <strong>do not tie</strong> your Magic Trait to something practical. You are missing a step. It's usually <a href="ArgumentByElegance.html">ArgumentByElegance</a>, but intellectual "elegance" does not necessary tie to practical benefits. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If the car driver cannot detect any benefits, you are doing the equivalent of chewing out the driver, saying, "You just don't understand Groppenheimer valves! If you did, you'd JUST KNOW the car is better! Your driving tests are only for plebeian dummies!" -t

        <em>Your analogy is not quite apt.  A better analogy -- if we're sticking with cars and tools -- is a torque angle gauge.  It's a tool for ensuring that fasteners -- engine head bolts and the like -- are properly tightened.  Mechanical engineers and mechanics use them without much controversy; their application is well-understood, and their users happily apply them as they see fit, occasionally discussing their use on a forum for mechanical engineers and mechanics.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Now you come along -- perhaps with some basic mechanical knowledge, but you're neither a mechanical engineer nor a full-time mechanic -- and claim that torque angle gauges aren't necessary: they're a specialist tool only used "out of habit and tradition, or perhaps because of insufficient criticism."  We shouldn't use them; anyone can tighten fasteners just fine with an ordinary torque wrench.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We calmly point out that a torque angle gauge is more accurate because it isn't affected by friction, and being more accurate when tightening bolts means less chance of an assembly warping, being damaged, or coming loose.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You reply that in the many years you've been repairing clocks, you've never warped or damaged an assembly, or had anything come loose.  We point out that we're talking about much more than clocks; under specialist vehicle applications -- for example -- like racing or other extreme conditions, the risk of warping, damage, or inadvertent disassembly is increased.  You say extreme conditions are rare; everyone has at least one clock, and no one needs a torque angle gauge to fix a clock.  We point out that there are more extreme conditions than you think -- like driving in stop-and-go traffic or winter cold snaps -- that can affect car engines.  You point out that you're talking about clocks, not car engines, and whilst maybe there are rare circumstances where a car engine needs to be repaired, you're not talking about car engines and we haven't proven that torque angle gauges are needed to fix clocks.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We point out that clock repair might seem important to you, but it's actually one mechanical repair niche among many.  Almost everyone drives a car that will need it repaired at some point, and that repair could well benefit from a torque angle gauge.  You ask us to prove it or retort with "so you say," or assert that there are no real practical benefits to torque angle gauges -- it's just </em><a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> if we reference recognised sources or <a href="ArgumentByElegance.html">ArgumentByElegance</a> if we say it's better to be more accurate than less accurate.  Anyway, you say, real-world bolts don't need to accuracy of a torque angle gauge and the typical mechanic doesn't know how to read them.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We point out that you obviously lack knowledge of mechanical engineering or mechanics and engine repair.  You claim that most car repair is done by non-mechanics in their garages, so we need to target our tools at them and we should be able to "present clear, direct, and objective evidence" -- that can be understood by non-mechanics -- in favour of torque angle gauges.</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The discussion goes rapidly downhill from there.  Eventually, it winds up being reconstituted as a stylised example in some meta-discussion page.</em>

        Part of this argument sounds like a case of <a href="TheRightToolForTheJob.html">TheRightToolForTheJob</a>. I don't claim my favorite tools or techniques are the best for every niche and domain usage.

        And it may be the case that certain tools are "good enough" in certain situations and easier to learn than some fancier thingy. If one says tool X is better for situation Y, they are obligated to make a case for that. "Trust me, I'm an expert" is not science. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>In terms of programming tools, there are vanishingly few scientific studies that demonstrate one tool is better than another.  We don't even agree on what "better" might mean; e.g., if it makes programming easier for the original programmer but harder for the maintenance programmer, is that "better" or "worse"?  You could build a research career just trying to definitively answer that one question.  Of course, you probably won't get funded for that research -- most funding agencies and companies don't care enough, relative to other priorities, to consider it worth bothering.  So, most claims for tool 'x' are essentially a verbose way of saying, "I like 'x'", which is only a problem when I say "I like 'x' [because of my preferences, or reasons that matter to me]" and you respond with "Don't use 'x' [because of your preferences, or reasons that matter to you]".  When that happens, there's a fight.  Unfortunately, it's an un-resolvable fight, because the empirical bases (i.e., research) for resolution simply don't exist, and we'll probably never agree on the appropriate weight of the theoretical (e.g., simplicity, elegance, parsimony, safety, etc.) bases.</em>

        Now, back to your "torque angle gauge" analogy:
      </p>
      <p>
        If you say tool X makes bolts less likely to fall off in the long term, then you should provide evidence for that. If you merely talk about the elegance of the physics behind a torque angle gauge, then you are not doing real science and one shouldn't just take your word for it. At least get simulations of vibrations that suggests it works better; an approximation of "actual testing", if you can't do actual field testing. "Bolts that were fastened with a torque angle gauge were 40% less likely to fall off than those fastened without them" is the kind of result we really want and one that customers and hobbyists alike can relate to. If you don't have such data, then <a href="IfYouWereSmartEnoughYoudJustKnow.html">IfYouWereSmartEnoughYoudJustKnow</a> is a <strong>poor substitute and nobody should be lambasted for not accepting such at face value</strong>. Many of my detractors <em>insist</em> their alleged expert opinion is sufficient, not merely present it as a professional recommendation or anecdote.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, I don't think any of your detractors have ever done that.  Most have presented precisely the items of evidence that convinced them to use tool X in the first place -- and you categorically deprecate them.  It appears that you only discuss tool X here once you've made up your mind about it, and once you've made your mind up about it, nothing will shift your view.</em>

           Sorry, they have not done so. You are mistaken. They are anti-empirical, insisting <a href="ArgumentByElegance.html">ArgumentByElegance</a> or similar is plenty strong and sufficient. But if you view the debates different, then we'll just have to <a href="AgreeToDisagree.html">AgreeToDisagree</a>. The <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a> and thin-table debate comes to mind. I suppose some of the arguments are based on objective metrics such as parsimony (code size) and machine speed on a given platform, but <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> should be heavily considered also, if not more so. Software is mostly for inter-human communication, not human-to-machine communication. Sometimes we view the purpose of software and its relationship to <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> very differently. I believe my viewpoints on these to be based on rational assumptions which I do my best to describe and illustrate, but realize some disagree heavily. But it bothers me that they are so insistent they are right with no solid logic to back such alleged certainty. If you don't have solid evidence about what the goals of software "should" be, don't be so insistent you are correct.

           <em>No one here is anti-empirical.  Most of us simply realise that there is virtually </em>'no<em>' empirical research to cite.

           I feel you exaggerate the strength of such evidence in the absence of empirical research. My detractors <em>insist</em> this kind of secondary evidence is strong.

           If those hurt grokkability, they can be rendered moot features. For example, if heavy parsimony results in code a maintenance developer cannot read, then nothing gets done and the organization is <strong>outright stuck</strong>. Repetitious code, on the other hand, rarely gets an org outright stuck: it's just slow and labor intensive to change. I've talked to managers of many organizations, and non-grokkability generates far more horror stories than repetition. See <a href="StaffingEconomicsVersusTheoreticalElegance.html">StaffingEconomicsVersusTheoreticalElegance</a> for more on this. -t

           Grokkability is generally significantly more important than the others. And there are indeed many factors involved such that one has to weigh myriad trade-offs. Often one has to use professional judgment and professional judgement will differ. But some <em>insist</em> their judgement is superior, not respecting others' because they allegedly know more. Thus, they claim <a href="IfYouWereSmartEnoughYoudJustKnow.html">IfYouWereSmartEnoughYoudJustKnow</a>. I have no problem with "professional judgement" that differs from mine, but I do have a problem with those who <em>insist</em> their professional judgement carries far more weight than others for wiki readers. It strongly appears their human ego is clouding their judgment about the strength of their anecdotal evidence. -t

           <em>Grokkability is subjective.  You, your manager, and your colleagues are the only people who matter in deciding whether a feature is sufficiently grokkable or not.  If it's not sufficiently grokkable, feel free to suggest ways to improve its grokkability.  If you can't think of any and choose not to use that feature, that's fine.  To the author of a feature, your personal ability to grok it or not is neither relevant nor of any concern, especially if others grok it.</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Grokkability is potentially empirically testable, but we don't have such tests yet. And we can ignore it because it's hard to test, but then we are potentially committing the <a href="SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple.html">SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple</a> sin. Most of those other aspects listed above don't have clear, objective tests either, so far. If we stuck with currently-measurable objective measurements, we'd be favoring the machine, and possibly using machine code. Are you truly suggesting that grokkability be ignored because it's difficult to measure?

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>No, I'm not suggesting it be ignored, and I would encourage you, your manager, and your colleagues to give it all appropriate attention.  However, in discussions here about (say) higher level abstractions -- which may allegedly be less grokkable than (say) procedural programming a la </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> in 1987 -- I don't think it warrants much consideration.  It's up to you, as a feature user, to decide whether a feature is grokkable or not.  It's not up to me, as a feature author or proponent, to be concerned about whether you may or may not grok the feature.  At best, given a feature <X> and two implementations of it <A> and <B>, I'm only concerned which of <A> and <B> is easier to grok.  I'm certainly not going to withdraw support for <X> -- or pepper my descriptions of it with caveats about how you or your shop should be extra careful -- because someone, somewhere, might not grok it.

           I'm not understanding your point. Perhaps a code example might help. When you say, "feature user", do you mean like an API user, or an end user? Managers and owners typically have wanted me to code in a fashion that makes it relatively easy to get <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a>; and catering to a certain mid-level of abstraction seems to best fit that desire. In my experience talking with them, this desire for <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a> is often based on their past <strong>actual experience</strong> with maintenance staffing (aka "being burned") and NOT some random personal paranoia.

There are other feature users, managers and owners who are happy to gain the advantage -- whatever it might be -- that my feature provides.  I certainly care whether or not my feature is as grokkable as it can be for those who chose to use it, but I don't care if there are users, managers and owners who have no intention of using it no matter what I do to make it grokkable.</em>

        And the question about whether a hobbyist mechanic or a non-car mechanic should get the fanciest tightening tools possible is a question of weighing trade-offs: how much does it cost, how much is the training, how long does it take to learn it well enough, how much are the benefits compared to total costs, etc. Weighing these kinds of trade-offs is not an easy job and I do no trash other people for having different opinions and estimations on how to weigh such trade-offs, but I do complain about those who use <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> in a heavy-handed way, such as <a href="IfYouWereSmartEnoughYoudJustKnow.html">IfYouWereSmartEnoughYoudJustKnow</a> intended as more than just personal anecdotes.

Liking 'x' serves as a form of personal empirical evidence, lending credence to our use of 'x'.  Many debates seem to ensue when you take a glance at 'x' and don't like it.  If there's no empirical evidence in favour of 'x', it appears our liking it and having theoretical evidence to support it is irrelevant, and you justify telling us we shouldn't use 'x' because it will be (you claim, anecdotally) more difficult for "the typical programmer."</em>

        I rank middle-of-the-road in terms of anal-retentive-versus-wild-cowboy design spectrum in terms of the personalities I encounter in the field. In general, I do believe that the heavily educated have a tendency toward <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a>.

For example, those in IT tend to have lower-than-average people skills, and I believe most would agree with that association.

        I believe you are mistaken. I stopped insisting TOP was objectively better a good long time ago (when I realized everybody's <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> is very different and that my own <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> couldn't be used as a wide reference.)

Therefore, it does appear that you've swapped one cause for another.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To make sure we are clear, I did <em>not</em> claim TOP was the <em>only</em> alternative to OOP. It's one of many (depending on specifics).

        <em>For a long time, it appeared that you felt TOP was </em>the<em> preferable alternative to everything.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Preferable? I don't think so. I often defend it as a viable/potential alternative to many design issues and still do. I do NOT insist it's objectively better, only that it deserves a fair consideration. If somebody finds clear and objective flaws (without counterpart/tradeoff flaws on the other side), then it may indeed deserve to be ignored. But, I have not seen that outside of machine performance issues for "small" hardware.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm not sure I'm interpreting the rest of the sentence correctly. Please elaborate on "drawn parallels", and explain its relationship with TOP. (Why are both mentioned in the same sentence?) I did mention there are similarities to my debates with OO-heavy-proponents and the HOF debates in terms of the kind of evidence and accusations that got tossed around. But what this has to do with TOP, I don't know. (OO-heavy-proponents suggested that if one simply use it long enough, it will eventually click and one will then "just know" that OO-everywhere is better.)

      <p>
        <em>I'm noting the similarity between your former anti-OOP (aka pro-TOP) stance and your current anti-HOF stance.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, I don't see a connection. And as already explained, I never pitted it as OOP-versus-TOP directly such that it was NOT OOP-versus-TOP. TOP is one of multiple alternatives to OOP (although specific domains may limit the choices).

        Got here from another case completely outside of the debates at c2. Had to deal with vendor SequelMed that could not understand the consequence of the fact that in a message, ack protocol that "sent ack" != "received ack", and failed to implement elimination of duplicate messages, nor make message processing idempotent. Customer complained about duplicate charges. Obviously, customer cannot be expected to understand this, but the vendor ought
        to have. The engineer already had all the facts, but could not do the induction. The phrase "no ack for ack" was telling. -- <a href="JoshuaHudson.html">JoshuaHudson</a>

        <em>Perhaps you just didn't explain it well enough, such as an analogy of people passing notes through slots in huts and how somebody ends up with duplicate coconuts. I've had issues that at first seemed too confusing to the customer, but I later found out how to explain it better.

That's a tricky problem, but this topic is not really about time management and as a working assumption I shall assume the "customer" has sufficient time to receive explanations and ask questions.</em>

        <em>And even if they don't understand something, empirical numeric metrics can still be used, such as testing that "protocol X results in 10x fewer duplicates than protocol Y". It's clear the frequency of duplicates, something quantifiable, mattered to this customer. Thus, </em>'claims about which technique results in fewer duplicates can be empirically tested<em>'. In practice, every part may not be able to be subject to testing, but that's more of a resource constraint issue and this topic is not about making decisions in a rush or on the cheap. (Trust sometimes has to be a shortcut to empirical testing in practice.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately we got here because OV didn't understand idempotence and implemented broken X' instead or there would have been no observed duplicates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In theory, even if the OV remained ignorant, tests or scenarios could have been devised to demonstrate that his/her version of messaging coordination was inferior to the "correct" way, resulting in an integer count of duplicates to compare both techniques side-by-side.

      </p>
      <p>
        You underestimate the magnitude of OV's error. They claimed we should have built our side to send them each message once, but sending it again if they did not process it.

        <em>I guess I wasn't clear. I meant the nature of the argument between you and the "problem person". He or she may be doing the equivalent of a copy-machine technician arguing with a rocket scientist at NASA about which rocket engine type is better. They would be arguing the engineering side of things, not the "results" side of things. A rocket "customer" cares about accuracy, safety, cost, speed, setup time, etc. of the vehicle (rocket). Each of these can be empirically numerically measured in various ways. Arguing beyond such "consumer metrics" appears to be the problem in your case. If he or she insists that protocol B produces fewer duplicates than protocol A, then he/she is obligated to empirically demonstrate that with tests or scenarios.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The nature was that he was claiming to the customer that we should have implemented our side of the protocol in such a way that we could prove was mathematically impossible and that we were responsible for the duplicates because of that. While we could have built a receiver that would have shown no duplicates, that would not placate the customer.

        {Many years ago, my software company helped sponsor the local soccer club and donated software development time.  My business partner developed an application to manage scheduling of matches on the various soccer fields.  To keep things fair, the club wanted every team to play an equal number of games on every field.  Unfortunately, there were an odd number of teams and an even number of fields, so some teams would inevitably wind up playing more or less games on field 'x' than another team.  This, according to the club president, was unacceptable.  Commissioning another field or closing one was also unacceptable, as was removing or adding a team.  So, my business partner requested time to do a presentation to explain the problem to the president and his board.}

      <p>
        {My partner's request was granted, and he did a brilliant presentation with illustrations, props, and clever explanations that proved -- beyond a shadow of a doubt, and in ways that a child could understand -- that an odd number of teams and an even number of fields would <strong>always</strong> result in some teams playing more games on field 'x' than others.  To do otherwise was mathematically impossible.  The board thanked my partner and excused him from the room to deliberate on what should be done.}
      </p>
      <p>
        {After a half hour or so, they called him back in.  Their solution was simple:  The same number of teams would be retained.  The same number of fields would be used.  However, the soccer club could now proudly guarantee that <em>every</em> team would play the <em>same</em> number of games on every field.  How did they do it?  They made it a <strong>policy</strong> that every team play the same number of games on every field. Problem solved!}

        Some people just like being dicks for the pleasure of being dicks. If the soccer dude claims it is mathematically possible, then he/she is obligated to provide a mathematical proof, even if it requires hiring a mathematician. This problem appears to be something that can be proven mathematically either way and doesn't depend on fuzzy <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> claims, etc.

        However, if it was a corporation and I was a consultant, I'd consider pulling the plug, saying something like, "I guess I am not smart enough to solve this problem to your satisfaction, and perhaps it's time for you to try another contractor. If the new contractor solves the problem, I'll buy both of you a lunch. Nice working with you." Sometimes owners just want to force people out they don't <strong>personally</strong> like and rotate in contractors or employees until they find one they do like. The technical side of things is secondary and is used as a facade for social goals.

        Go the the town hall and bet Mr. Soccer real money (5 grand?) if they can prove such combinations are mathematically possible. If it comes to real money and embarrassment and P/R of losing, the logical side of their brain may tell the bullshitting side to shut up for a while. Often it's just the case that there's no real penalty for being cocky or stupid.

        {I met some of them.  They truly believed it.  Never underestimate the power of limited schooling and feeble intellect to sustain a belief that mathematics is subject to human whim.  To the uneducated, it's a product of human invention, as subject to re-engineering as any gadget.}

        Bet them money, have them sign it, and get rich. And arrogance and education are orthogonal. There have been a good many highly educated people who's ego or stubbornness made them stubbornly stick to faulty or evidence-poor positions. Human nature makes <a href="HumansSuck.html">HumansSuck</a>, not education. But, it's still usually better to work with well-educated ego-infected nuts than poorly educated ego-infected nuts. But it's usually easier to discredit the stupid ones because the smart ones know enough to make tougher-to-crack bullshit because they can sprinkle it with actual partial truths or close-enough buzzwords.
