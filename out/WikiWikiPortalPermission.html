        Wiki Wiki Portal Permission
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am contemplating building a kind of search-engine/portal hybrid that helps people find <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> (c2) content. It may include Google Ads or the like. I don't plan on intentionally tilting finds toward my favorite topics, but I may spend more effort on making sure topics I like are classified properly because I relate to them more. But it would also take suggestions on other people's search difficulties in order to improve the results. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What I am asking is: do I need special permission from Ward etc.? Legally, I don't think such is required, but I would rather get any such issues out of the way up-front.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a lot of good, thought-provoking stuff on <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>, but it is hard for newbies to navigate.

        In IpAddressReleaseRequest, it appears from an anecdote that copying or spidering lots of pages trips an edit-lockout. It's probably an anti-vandal defense mechanism. Thus, this idea is out the window for now unless I find a "throw-away" IP port.
