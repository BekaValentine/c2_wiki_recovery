        Organized Chaos Wikis Heart
      </h1>
      <p>
        A plea...
      </p>
      <p>
        The heart of Wiki is "Chaos". It is the life giving blood of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ward set out to create a collaboration tool, but ended up with a live community like no other. Not understanding this community, many <a href="WikiUser.html">WikiUser</a>s have tried repeatedly to eliminate this chaos to the detriment of Wiki. Now, they have nearly reached their goal, but can't understand why Wiki is nearly dead (or as good as dead).
      </p>
      <p>
        A living, thriving, chaotic community is not something that software programmers and engineers are good with, as they are all about putting things into nice little organized and predictable boxes. So, those that watch over <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> should not be either, instead it needs to be people who understand a living and thriving society, and the chaos and needs of wild and living things (put the cute little birdie in the cage and it dies).
      </p>
      <p>
        Eliminate people's ability to laugh, play around, and joke, and you kill the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eliminate the charismatic/controversial individuals, and you kill the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rule over the community with the iron-fist of a dictator, and you kill it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I have tried to get everyone to listen to for many, many years, is that hard-playing people do lots of hard innovate work. I have tried and tried, to no avail, to keep what has happened to Wiki from happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, admit it or not, the biggest killer of Wiki is the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>. Newcomers come and try to do small test edits to Wiki, and end up in a battle with that retarded script. Of course, they immediately get frustrated and leave. Wiki is dying to the point of being dead. All of this script stuff needs to stop, and Wiki needs to be given a chance to live again, before it is to late and no-one cares or remembers about Wiki.

      <p>
        Wiki needs <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki needs controversial/colorful users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki needs non-serious amongst the serious.
