        Does Agile Lead To Anarchy
      </h1>
      <p>
        Does the adoption of <a href="AgileSoftwareDevelopment.html">AgileSoftwareDevelopment</a> lead to anarchy.  Is this a bad thing?  If so, then what are the rules or practices that would prevent this?
      </p>

        <em>Anarchy can be used as medicine against dogmatism and sluggish thinking.  I suspect it is a medicine you can overdose on.  I think that </em><a href="AgileMethods.html">AgileMethods</a> strike a good balance.  They don't dismiss procedure and method, neither do they let any particular method dominate: "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools".<em></em>

        "bad thing" => No. Anarchy (ie. LibertarianSocialism, ParticipatoryDemocracy etc.) is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>. Especially OpenSourceAnarchy, which seems to work pretty well: <a href="http://ming.tv/flemming2.php/__show_article/_a000010-001239.htm">http://ming.tv/flemming2.php/__show_article/_a000010-001239.htm</a>

        <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a> holds as a tenet that there is an <a href="EdgeOfChaos.html">EdgeOfChaos</a> at which it is possible to have a complex but still adaptive project. Agile methods supposedly allow you to operate in this region, or to 'push' the edge of chaos (presumably this puts you at a competitive advantage versus other companies that couldn't push it as far). Compare this with the aviation expression <a href="PushingTheEnvelope.html">PushingTheEnvelope</a>.

        For me the essence of <a href="AgileMethods.html">AgileMethods</a> is feedback to improve the process, together with a determination to make sure each constraint can always be justified. There's a big difference between adaptability and anarchy. Anarchy in software development, to me, is <a href="CowboyCoding.html">CowboyCoding</a>, and is something I'd always fight against.

        Agile devlopment leads to anarchy if you think that anarchy is the only alternative to monarchy (or dictatorship).
