        Replacing a page with its machine translation is vandalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see non-English text, it must fit these guidelines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the author added new text, and didn't replace with translation
        </li>
        <li>
           the author knew the target language
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Does anyone know the motivation for babelfishing pages? It doesn't seem to make sense except in a vandalism way, in which case, why go through the trouble of babelfishing when you can just trash it?
