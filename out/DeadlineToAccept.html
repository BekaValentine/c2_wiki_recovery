        When making an offer or a counter-offer (whether you are the buyer or seller, the hiring manager or the prospective hire), especially if in writing, <em>always</em> include a deadline which the offer must be accepted by, else it is withdrawn.  (The deadline might not be a specific date/time, but an event such as accepting another job elsewhere).  Some reasonable deadline (days or weeks) is good sense; open-ended offers are never a good idea (especially if binding).  However, a <a href="DeadlineToAccept.html">DeadlineToAccept</a> may have additional advantages:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Prevents the other party from searching for a better offer.  If you offer someone a job, but give them 24 hours to accept; chances are that they won't be able to continue shopping for a better offer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Might force a hasty decision; especially if the deadline is "take it or leave it now".  Of course, an intelligent party will reject any such deadline and walk, but some parties will accept a lowball offer on such terms.
