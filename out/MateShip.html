        Mate Ship
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Mate" is a Strine <em>(see </em><a href="LetStalkStrine.html">LetStalkStrine</a>)<em> word, loosely synonymous with but with utterly different baggage than the American "sir" or "man". </em><a href="MateShip.html">MateShip</a> is a trust relationship. Mates are not necessarily friends, but they expect one another to act with tolerance, compassion, and good humor. "We're mates" means we've mutually taken the piss (<a href="PissTake.html">PissTake</a>) until we agree we're on a peered social footing.
      </p>

        <em>I heard that "raggae" is actually patois for "regular" (clearer if you can pronounce the french "regulier"). "Mahn" is distinct from "man". As for "sir", well, what do I know ... I worked for my rank. [google Joseph Conrad on male bonding]</em>
