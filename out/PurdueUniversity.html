      <p>
        Purdue is one of the largest public universities in Indiana.  The university was founded in 1869 as a result of the MorrillAct signed by <a href="AbrahamLincoln.html">AbrahamLincoln</a> in 1862.  The first classes were held in 1874 in University Hall, in West Lafayette, Indiana.

        Purdue, as all land grant institutions, was founded as a school specializing in Agriculture and Engineering (as well as other "mechanical arts").  Today, however, Purdue has schools specializing in Science, Pharmacy, Liberal Arts, Business, Technology, and several other disciplines.

        The university is named after JohnPurdue - the man who donated money, and much of the original land that would become the campus.  A memorial to JohnPurdue is located in front of the oldest building on campus, University Hall.

        Purdue students, alumni, and athletic teams are nicknamed the BoilerMakers.  The origins of this nickname date back to the early 1900s, when <a href="WabashCollege.html">WabashCollege</a> was Purdue's main rival.  After soundly beating the Wabash football team, the writers of a Crawfordsville, Indiana, (where <a href="WabashCollege.html">WabashCollege</a> is located) newspaper used the term as a derogatory description of the the Purdue football team.

        Purdue is a charter member of the BigTen Conference.  Purdue has the winningest basketball program of all time in the BigTen.  The BoilerMakers have won 21 BigTen Championships - more than any other school (including IndianaUniversity, who has 19).  Purdue also has a winning record against every other BigTen school (including IndianaUniversity - 105 wins, 75 losses as of 2/02/01).  Behind 3 time All-American, JohnWooden, the Boilers won the National Championship in 1932.
