        I am struggling with the following definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An expert whose knowledge/wisdom concerning a certain problem set is not shared with other team members.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A person in whom rests a detailed and actionable collection of information that
          <ul>
            <li>
               no other team member possesses
            </li>
            <li>
               other team members may know a little of this, but cannot sufficiently act on what they know
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This person is also well described, as a team of one, by the <a href="TruckFactor.html">TruckFactor</a>
