        Software Handbook
      </h1>
      <p>
        Software Handbooks, similar to the handbooks of common
        techniques used in other engineering disciplines, exist
        for software in several forms, ranging from very formal
        (e.g. Collected Algorithms of the ACM, IEEE Transactions
        on Software Engineering) collections of formal models, to
        the practitioner's guides (e.g. book and training course
        examples, well-documented widely-distributed source code)
        to the very informal (e.g. USENET technical group archives).
      </p>
      <p>
        Many attempts have been made to standardize handbooks for the
        software engineer, which would describe software artifacts at
        several levels of abstraction from Patterns (analysis level) to
        Architectures (design level) to libraries (code level).  The
        standards used in the software industry may be at any of these
        levels of abstraction, i.e. a software handbook may reasonably
        describe the ISO 7-layer network model and the MVC model from
        Smalltalk (Patterns), the more detailed APIs given to these
        models in, say, TCP/IP or Smalltalk (designs), and the code
        that implements these, in, say, the GNU Repository (code).
        Little useful work can be done in software until a developer
        has absorbed a problem, understood its known solutions, and
        found some set of resources that help him/her construct a 
        new one.  Unlike bridges or cars, the exact same piece of
        software, built a second time, is worth exactly nothing.
        Software handbooks must concentrate on helping developers to
        understand what is novel about their problem and solution, 
        and to focus their development effort on what is really new.
