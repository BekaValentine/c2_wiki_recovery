        Status Quo
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>noun</strong>, usually used as <em>the status quo.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The existing state of affairs, especially regarding social or political issues: <em>they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Origin:</strong> Latin, literally 'the state in which'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Means "the way things are now".
        Typical usage is in a call "to preserve the status quo" -- IE: to keep things the way they are; don't change things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historic origin is to describe restoring "the way things were before the war".

      <p>
        <em>Arguing to preserve the status quo is usually done in the context of opposing a large, often radical change. The social movement is an example of the status quo being challenged. The term frequently refers to the status of a large issue, such as the current culture or social climate of an entire society or nation.</em>

        <strong>Original question:</strong> What the hell does this mean anyway? I've heard it used so many ways that don't relate at all to what I thought it meant...
      </p>
      <p>
        What I thought it meant: Not rocking the boat; same-old same-old; established standard (for better or worse).

        There is also a rock band with that name, see <a href="http://www.statusquo.co.uk/">http://www.statusquo.co.uk/</a> (who have been grinding out the "same-old same-old" for a long time...)
