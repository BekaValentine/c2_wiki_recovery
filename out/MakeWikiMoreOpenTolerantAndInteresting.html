        Make Wiki More Open Tolerant And Interesting
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some people here believe wiki is improved by <a href="CompellingIrritant.html">CompellingIrritant</a>s. In 8 years of <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>ship, I have never found that to be the case. Others are determined to be <a href="HarshEditor.html">HarshEditor</a>s. I have never seen such editing improve wiki. And still others are determined to be <a href="TopicPolice.html">TopicPolice</a>. I have never found any need to have the topicality of this place protected by such a person. What I have seen is a lot of destructive edits justified by appeals to these shibboleths. And I'd sure like to see such people wise up and help make the place kinder, happier, and more interesting. --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
