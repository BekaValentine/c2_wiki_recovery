        Why Did Wiki Take Labor Day Weekend Off
      </h1>
      <p>
        Especially with gas hovering around $3.00/gallon in the US (I know, it's <strong>still</strong> cheaper than in the rest of the world), one would have thought that Wiki would have stayed in town this labor day, and gotten some housework done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, it apparently grabbed a towel and a bathing suit, jumped in the car, and sped off to the beach.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
        At least it got back to the office on time on Tuesday.  :)

        <em>I could be wrong, but </em>'my<em>' theory is that that's silly. :-)</em>

        Hey, it's more interesting than "the server went down..."
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Although it's true the server went down.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>No it didn't.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Yes, it did.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>No it didn't.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Yes, it did!
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Didn't.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Oh look, this isn't an argument.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Yes it is.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           No it isn't. It's just contradiction. An argument isn't just contradiction.  An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>No it isn't.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Look, you just contradicted me.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>I did not.  By the way, are you here for a 1-hour session, or the 10-week course?</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Just the one session.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Are you sure?</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Yes.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>No you're not.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Oh, this is futile! I've had enough of this.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>No you haven't.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm not prepared to pursue my line of inquiry any longer as I think this is getting too silly!
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Oh, right.  You want the Complaining course, which is three doors down.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Quite agree, quite agree, too silly, far too silly. Come on, you, you've got to go do another page now!
      </p>

        Anybody want to try putting the above in <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>? :-)

        I don't care <em>if</em> Wiki Did Take Labor Day Weekend Off, I want to know <em>why</em>!!!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Because it was tired? Hey, even servers need a holiday!
        </li>
        <li>
           Because it was hit by a hurricane?
        </li>
        <li>
           Because Ward took a holiday?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>c2.com still responded to pings.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Must have been the result of a hangover then.  Responding to ICMP but ignoring HTTP requests is a server's way of saying "Oh, my head!  Go away and leave me alone!  And turn out the damn light, willya?"
        </li>
      </ul>
