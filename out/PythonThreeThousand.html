        Python Three Thousand
      </h1>
      <p>
        A "mythical" version of the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> that would break Python's backward compatibility. Some claim it happened with PythonV3, but in truth, the Zen of Python3000 has not been achieved. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is for collecting and discussing the reasons why.  
      </p>
      <p>
        To be included for Python3000:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All methods which are guaranteed to return <em>unique</em> items should return a <strong>set</strong> (not a list) to communicate that. <em>(</em><a href="GuidoVanRossum.html">GuidoVanRossum</a> has acknowledged this one.)<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               the <strong>dir()</strong> built-in.
            </li>
            <li>
               locals(), globals()
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Use <strong>is</strong> for type checking rather than isinstance().  "if n is int and n>2: [...]"
          <ul>
            <li>
              Add to PEP8: the python style guide. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Fix the relationship between <strong>bytes</strong>, <strong>str</strong>, and unicode.  (See thread in python-ideas re: bytestring type).  It's all forked up in Python3.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use <strong>&</strong> to indicate <strong>self</strong>-reference in class methods.  Dissipates the old argument for needing to type it.  See NameConceptualUnits.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use operator <strong>^</strong> rather than a function for super calls.
        </li>
        <li>
           Rename the built-in <strong>len()</strong> to <strong>size()</strong> to generalize to containers that aren't necessarily linear (as the name would imply).  A Tree for example.
        </li>
        <li>
           Bring back compares of unsimilar objects.  Double-quoted strings should be highest priority, and sets the lowest.  This is based on how the <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> must relate to the underlying hardware.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make the File object more abstract.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Create a <strong>File.pos</strong> attribute so you can rid of the confusing seek, tell and such.  Such an attribute allows easy <em>relative</em> indexing as well as <em>absolute</em> indexing.
            </li>
            <li>
               This removes the need for two separate and less obvious method names to 1) read the current file position and 2) move to a new file position.
            </li>
            <li>
               Providing a much more straightforward and obvious syntax for relative file movements:  file.position += 5
            </li>
            <li>
               Less dependency on low-level, C history.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>File.open()</strong>, <strong>File.close</strong>(), <strong>File.closed</strong> could all be combined into a single File.open boolean property that can be read from to query the state of the file and written to (re-)open or close a file.  (There is actually no File.open() operation:  Python seems to require that you re-create the file object to re-open a file.)
            </li>
            <li>
               use <strong>del myfile</strong> to delete file object which will call <strong>__del__()</strong> method automatically. to do any cleanup.  Get's rid of <strong>finally</strong> because objects are already cleared after last reference is removed. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Specify an [unenforced] naming convention which asks for <strong>property</strong> and attribute names to be <em>nouns</em> so as to communicate that no visible changes are being made to the object. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Establish a convention to use attribute/properties instead of functions when there is 1) no need to pass any parameters and 2) the object will not be significantly transformed in some non-obvious way if/when the property is written to.  All such attributes/properties should have an adjective or noun name.
        </li>
        <li>
           Add to PEP 8: 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Use <em>verbs</em> for functions, <em>nouns</em> for attr's.
            </li>
            <li>
               Specifying a naming convention for iterators, so there's no confusion vs. an actual Object. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           With the new enumerate() builtin, could get rid of Dict.[iter]items().  
          <ul>
            <li>
               "items" was always an ambiguous name for dict (key, value) pairs anyway.  enumerate() generalizes the concept to all collections (although since dict already had iteritems(), I don't think enumerate() handles the dict case).  
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Dict</strong>s should inherit from <strong>Set</strong>s. A dict is a <em>set</em> of <strong>name:object</strong> associations.
          <ul>
            <li>
               dicts get a lot of additional and powerful functionality for little to no maintenance or performance or memory costs.
            </li>
            <li>
               no longer need separate method dict.update().
            </li>
            <li>
               coupled with the dir() builtin, now you can do quick class inspections when using other's code through set operators for a more populated <a href="DataEcosystem.html">DataEcosystem</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           An empty Set literal should be <strong>{}</strong> as any <a href="SetTheory.html">SetTheory</a>st can tell you. The empty Dict literal then is <strong>{:}</strong>. This becomes an even more obvious wart with dict inheriting from sets.
        </li>
        <li>
           DefaultDict should take an optional <strong>collision function</strong> to be called when keys are the same.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Many home-spun data types can be reduced to a single, flexible type. An edge-weighted graph becomes trivial.
            </li>
            <li>
               As Python evolves a <a href="UnifiedDataModel.html">UnifiedDataModel</a>, this will replace the current Dict.
            </li>
            <li>
               This resolves a long-standing debate about what to do with key collisions on dict.update() -- let the user decide.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Use the C construct of switch...case, rather than series of if/then/elseifs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Remove the range() built-in and use the ellipsis ("...") to give a less ambiguous, more conventional looping and ranging construct.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="DocTest.html">DocTest</a><strong> should be integrated into the interpreter environment and a </strong>test()<strong> built-in added to complement help(), encouraging </strong><a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               As people get used to TDD and <a href="AgileDevelopment.html">AgileDevelopment</a>, it will become a no-brainer to check random python files in a directory: just "python someoldwork.py" and see if it's in working order.
            </li>
            <li>
               Python will read the starting directory's __new__.py (name?) file to set the execution context for all code run in the interpreter. Since TestingIsDocumentation, this file could be called README.
            </li>
            <li>
               Doctests improved to support lexical scoping context, so that setup code can be placed in Class doctests and used within inner methods, for example. (Variables at module-scope can be used in class doctests.)  This would remove a lot of pollution out of help(), removing one gripe of resistance to using <a href="DocTest.html">DocTest</a>:  pollutions of <a href="DocStrings.html">DocStrings</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               No need for a Python startup file anymore, just put your python code in a textfile, put the file in your home directory and that's your __builtin__ module's docstring.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           All the built-ins should be organized in their own <a href="NameSpace.html">NameSpace</a> and placed in a tree. Devs can create their own <a href="NameSpace.html">NameSpace</a>s and export them to the interpreter environment.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Exceptions shouldn't be intermingled with functions for example and math functions can be logically separated from non-math functions.
            </li>
            <li>
               Need to think through how to do this right and interact with the abstraction model in coordination with the <a href="FileSystem.html">FileSystem</a> and Python's environment properly.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Consider integrating VPython in the standard library (import __future__).
          <ul>
            <li>
               VPython has Wx windowing system integrated with it, a cross-platform, flexible GUI library.
            </li>
            <li>
               Many young programmers are drawn into a language by graphics -- you can't beat 3d.
            </li>
            <li>
               The scientific community comes for free. ;-)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Return the type/class distinction so that the <a href="ObjectModel.html">ObjectModel</a> isn't so abstract.
          <ul>
            <li>
               The <a href="GodObject.html">GodObject</a> "Object" was the wrong direction. We're not close enough to God to make everything derive from Object properly.  See <a href="ClosuresConsideredHarmful.html">ClosuresConsideredHarmful</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Let's get back to the roots and build up objects from the bottom, not the top.
            </li>
            <li>
               Automatic conversion from int to longs seemed good enough. See <a href="ObjectOrientedRefactored.html">ObjectOrientedRefactored</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The Super() business needs re-vamped for this more concrete <a href="ObjectArchitecture.html">ObjectArchitecture</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Use a caret "^" operator, which is clear syntax for super calls.
            </li>
            <li>
               Composed classes should have mandatory super calls, for example.
            </li>
            <li>
               One now follows the logical order of combining smaller types + methods to make bigger objects. Notice how this former OOP trajectory of <a href="EverythingIsAnObject.html">EverythingIsAnObject</a> has confused us?

        <li>
           <strong>dir()</strong> could probably be integrated with <strong>help()</strong> so as to reduce pollution of namespace.  (Perhaps help(Object, verbose=True))
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Implement the guidelines under </strong><a href="ObjectOrientedRefactored.html">ObjectOrientedRefactored</a><strong>. Specifically:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               A universal query-state operator: <strong>?myObject</strong> (which also functions as a <strong>print</strong> function).
            </li>
            <li>
               A universal <a href="MessagePassing.html">MessagePassing</a> syntax: <strong>data >> myObject</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   "data" can be an atomic element or a stream of such, represented by a tuple.
                </li>
                <li>
                   "data" in a tuple is processed (strictly) <em>serially</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Data that cannot be processed by the Object will be spit out with a DataError Exception (akin to a parameter type error). The state of that object could be suspended at that point (waiting for the operator), or valid data elements can continue, in order.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Makes a consistent interface for collection objects:  Node >> myGraph, element >> myList, myStack >> (outputs next element of stack)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               This will make a language-supported specification for interfacing with <strong>all</strong> objects.  No more learning object interfaces.  The name should be self-documenting and the methodology will encourage good DocStrings.
            </li>

           Implement the new keywords of the Vigil programming language for code contracts. (see <a href="http://GitHub.com/munificent)">http://GitHub.com/munificent)</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Don't delete bad code, though, put it in a Purgatory object (the only good use of global). 
            </li>
            <li>
               Get rid of <strong>finally</strong> keyword to make space for two new keywords:  <strong>implore</strong> and <strong>swear</strong> for <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Solve the conceptual separation between str() and repr(), <strong>one of them is redundant</strong> or <strong>too ambiguous</strong>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Str should perhaps be dropped to be replaced by the state-query operator.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   The state of immutable objects {string, tuple} is its contents <em>sans</em> its container characters (?"This string" --> This string)
                </li>
                <li>
                   The state of mutable collections {set, dict, list, ...} retain their grouping characters since their ownership can't be verified.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Repr should give an output that can be used to rebuild the object; i.e. full type information. -- In fact, the object shouldn't mess with this, so get rid of it as a special method.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           ?Consider reinstating __cmp__ as a general comparison method. Remove the excess syntax of __le__, __gt__, __eq__, (but check if there's an optimization for __eq__ that make this desirable)
        </li>
        <li>
           Rewrite the standard library using the new <a href="MessagePassing.html">MessagePassing</a> syntax from <a href="ObjectOrientedRefactored.html">ObjectOrientedRefactored</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Data members in a Class definition could be declared, just like methods and allow an optional DocString that describes what it's for. <a href="SelfDocumentingCode.html">SelfDocumentingCode</a> rocks.
          <ul>
            <li>
               No more undocumented data members in help() class inspections!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Consider capitalization of keywords, to distinguish them visually from variable names 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Would allow reuse of keywords for variable names:  ex. SORT as a keyword vs. sort as a variable name)
