      <p>
        We're doing a cross-country and cross-company project. Since I'm new in the wiki world, I wonder if it could be used as a tool for general project documentation.

        <em>Most certainly. There are plenty of other Wikizens already doing exactly that. Take a look at some of the </em><a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a> pages to see how to go about doing this. There's also source code from many sources for creating your own in-house wiki that you can administer for team documentation.<em></em>

        I guess it is a very interesting idea!
