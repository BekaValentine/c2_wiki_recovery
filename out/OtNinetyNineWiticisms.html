        Ot Ninety Nine Witicisms
      </h1>
      <p>
        At <a href="OtNinetyNine.html">OtNinetyNine</a>, large white boards were joined
        together in a corridor 
        for public writing, posting of questions, messages, responses, pictures, posters. (A sort of "hardware wiki" clone.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a communally written limerick that appeared on "the wall":
      </p>
      <code>
        "There was a young man from Trieste<br/>
        Who said "in OO why test?"<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
        When hacking out Java<br/>
        It's such a palaver<br/>
        Delivery?, Surely you jest!<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
        We know that we should<br/>
        But develop so good,<br/>
        Our users will do all the rest<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
        Objectively speaking<br/>
        Other tasks are competing<br/>
        So leaving it out's for the best<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
        A class or two here<br/>
        A class or two there<br/>
        ... it's integrate if we're blessed<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Maybe someone else with the results of the OT competition could post them?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Just tidied this up a bit...my favourite was from a few years ago, when contestants were asked (among other things) to rejig song lyrics. Some memorable submissions included
      </p>
      <code>
        I can't get no<br/>
        Good abstraction<br/>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        When I find my code in times of trouble<br/>
        Bjarne Stroustrup comes to me<br/>
        Speaking words of wisdom,<br/>
        OOP<br/>
        (a full three verses of this one...)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And many, many more...
