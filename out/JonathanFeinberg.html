        Hello. I'm Jonathan Feinberg.

        I recently moved from New York City to the Boston area with my wife and son (<a href="http://MrFeinberg.com/gabe/)">http://MrFeinberg.com/gabe/)</a> in order to join IBM Research, in Cambridge. I'm in the <strong>Collaborative User Experience</strong> group, where we're trying to influence the design of software to support collaboration.

        I was at netomat, inc. for over a year before coming to the Hub. It's too hard to describe, so go see <a href="http://netomat.net/">http://netomat.net/</a> for the scoop.

        I have recently begun a collaboration with a certain <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, who has kindly offered to add a small language to my physics toy (<a href="http://MrFeinberg.com/physics/).">http://MrFeinberg.com/physics/).</a> He has shown me some extremely cuspy parsing code so far. The project is hosted at <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>, name of "mf-physics".

        I have worked closely with Martin Wattenberg, who created the MapOfTheMarket while he was the research director at Smartmoney.com. He and I met when we both answered an ad placed by Marek Walczak, who was looking for programmers to help him realize his crazy art project involving real-time synchronized text, VRML, and sound performance over the internet. You can read about that and other things "like" it, at Marek and Martin's site, <a href="http://mw2mw.com/">http://mw2mw.com/</a> .

        I have also worked with Golan Levin on his "Secret Lives of Numbers", the "Alphabet Synthesis Machine", and the "Telesymphony", in which the audience's cell phones are the instruments.
