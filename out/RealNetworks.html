        Used to be ProgressiveNetworks. Creators of RealAudio and RealVideo.
        Look like they're determined to be the <a href="NextBigThing.html">NextBigThing</a> or at least a 
        BandwidthHog.

        <em>Well, they aren't good enough to be the </em><a href="NextBigThing.html">NextBigThing</a>.  They may be a bandwidth hog though.  The big problem is that aren't as good as either <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a> or Microsoft's solution.  The only reason to use <a href="RealNetworks.html">RealNetworks</a> products is for linux and <a href="BeOs.html">BeOs</a> compatibility.<em></em>

        Interesting. All the tests that I've seen show that they perform better than 
        Microsofts <a href="WindowsMediaPlayer.html">WindowsMediaPlayer</a> and <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a> Streaming. The big problem has been in the authoring and experience presented by the content providers.  I've seen plenty of sites that offer <a href="WindowsMediaPlayer.html">WindowsMediaPlayer</a> clips at 300K and RealVideo at 128K. Generally people see the quality of the 128 and decide that RealVideo at 
        <em>broadband</em> is bad. RealVideo8 at 300k is much better than WMP at 300k.

        <a href="RealPlayer.html">RealPlayer</a> <em>is</em> <a href="WindowsMediaPlayer.html">WindowsMediaPlayer</a>. The "authors" of Real worked for Microsoft and stole the code and algorithms to create <a href="RealPlayer.html">RealPlayer</a>. Real will always be inferior to WMP because Microsoft a) retains the minds behind the technology, b) will crush Real like a bad ex-girlfriend. <a href="RealNetworks.html">RealNetworks</a>/ProgressiveNetworks is, incidentally, based in Redmond but "across the river" from Microsoft. Gee, I wonder why.
      </p>

        <em>bzzt. try again. Although Rob Glaser is a former Microsoft VP, Most of the engineers are </em>'not<strong> from Microsoft. Seattle is </strong>across the river<em>' as you put it, but is nothing like Redmond.</em>

        Real, much like Netscape, must die. I hate them considerably. They <em>explicitly</em> told me to reverse engineer their file formats instead of just giving me the specs. Sure, I did it, but it cost me a month of my life (part time). Microsoft just emailed me the "proprietary" specification for ASF v. 1.0. Like it matters to them. It's no wonder why there was less than a dozen Real "partners" at the time and <em>thousands</em> of WMP/ASF partners.

        <em>Sounds like whatever your project was conflicted with the license agreement. Otherwise, you could have downloaded the SDK like everyone else.</em>

        Real also is so badly written that they can only open <em>one</em> Real channel per machine. However, the only accurate, version-independent way of determining the play length of an media clip is to "play" the clip for 0 seconds and terminate immediately. You see, they return the run length in a callback. Well, that's just great unless you're simultaneously using the Real channel to play audio during production. So, if you need to just find the durations of files so you can schedule them, you have to shutdown the production broadcast. Don't worry, Real will do this for you automatically. How kind of them to help you shoot yourself in the foot.

        <em>I think you are mistaken. I can run multiple streams through a smil presentation, and I know of more than a dozen content providers that do. What exactly are you trying to do anyway?</em>

        <dd>I'm not talking about RealServer (which crashes for broadcast.com once an hour) but about the actual player. We were using the <a href="RealPlayer.html">RealPlayer</a> to dump audio out onto broadcast television in order to unify the television and web presense of companies. </dd>

        When asked to fix this stupid limitation, the panel of PhDs at the Real conference that ran <a href="RealPlayer.html">RealPlayer</a>'s research department just shrugged. Couldn't figure it out. Like it's a hard problem.

        Real must die. And they will because Microsoft's ASF v. 2.0 (which is deeply related to MPEG-4) is the new industry standard. Real is going to support it, they have to. And if they suck, screw them. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>/Coward <em></em>

        <em>Odd.. MPEG-4 hasn't been finalized yet, and Microsoft has been labeling their formats with MS-MPEG4. Sounds a lot like pushiing their own brand of HTML which we know has been oh soooooo good for the internet. </em>

        <dd>Well MPEG-4 when I last saw it was based on ASF, but now (as I said below) it appears to be based on <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a>. I give up. It appears I got my wish anyway, though. <a href="RealPlayer.html">RealPlayer</a> seems to be trailing <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a> and <a href="WindowsMediaPlayer.html">WindowsMediaPlayer</a>.</dd>

        Personally I dislike <a href="RealPlayer.html">RealPlayer</a> because of the way it installs itself and generally messes everything up. Particularly <strong>forcing</strong> you into making it accept various file formats as its own, rather than letting other apps handle them. They appear to have fixed this in version 8 however which is nice. I also don't like the way it installs stuff <em>everywhere</em> on your machine. Much of which is only used once, and thus a waste of space. More power to <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a> I say! Although I do find interesting the recent agreement between the two companies, Real Servers can now Stream <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a> content.... -- <a href="MatthewTheobalds.html">MatthewTheobalds</a>

        I retract my statements about MPEG-4 and ASFv2. It will be based on <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a> instead.
