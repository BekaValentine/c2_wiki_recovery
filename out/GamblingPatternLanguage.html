        Gambling Pattern Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ever been in a casino or at a horse race? Got stocks and bonds? Lost money? Me too. But I stumbled over an old book on the famous 20th century gambler, NickTheGreek, and it's got me thinking there may be smarter ways to risk your dough:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="PlayRational.html">PlayRational</a>; watch out for <a href="GamblingAddiction.html">GamblingAddiction</a>
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="KnowYourGame.html">KnowYourGame</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      <p>
        Some more sound advice:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Offer the odds. If you're the bookie, and you're smart, you don't lose.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>This ain't gambling. It's business.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Play with <em>other peoples</em> money, for a percentage. This technique used successfully by stockbrokers for years.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>This ain't gambling. It's touting.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Fix the race/stack the deck/bribe the pugilist. Be careful to avoid the law. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>This ain't gambling; it's theft.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Give up smoking, gamble what you save. You might not get rich, but you'll live poor longer, and you <em>will</em> end up a little richer than you were when you smoked.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>This ain't gambling; it's a public service announcement.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't race horses, dogs or pigeons. They can all go faster than you and some of them bite.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>This ain't gambling. It's veterinary science.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Only gamble what you can afford to lose. Because you will. One day.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Already covered in the patterns above.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           If you can't spot the sucker at the table, it's you
        </li>
      </ul>
