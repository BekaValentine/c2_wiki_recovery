        Benefits Of Header Comments
      </h1>
      <p>
        Given that many development organizations have been using file, class and function/procedure/subroutine/method comments since such things existed, it seems likely that there must be some rational reason why they thought it was worthwhile to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cost/benefit trade-offs may have changed since then, or be different in your development environment:
        Knowing the benefits and costs, and alternatives that provide the desired information, can help one make more sensible business decisions about what to do, and what to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        [To a large extent, this is likely to be a <a href="StrawMan.html">StrawMan</a> Argument, as most of this community (quite sensibly) favors elimination of unnecessary maintenance work, as waste. But let's at least make an honest attempt at listing potential benefits, however small, of this practice, so that they can be compared to the actual costs.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>NOTE: This page is </em>'nothing but<strong> </strong><a href="StrawMan.html">StrawMan</a> arguments. No attempt has been made to promote actual reasons why certain tracking information may be valuable if contained as straight prose text in the comment header of a file. Perhaps some kind Wikizen will correct that deficiency in this page.<em></em>

               Ability to expand and contract comment headers and method bodies helps.

            <li>
               Having a visual "outline" of classes and methods, with two-way navigation between the code and the outline helps.

        <strong>Actual usage:</strong> The design has been done to show how services are implemented in the architecture. All of the interfaces between services and objects have been identified (as best as can be done) and the code is ready for implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implementation <em>in code</em> is described in the headers and source files where the code resides. Each object is described in its context, its storage is identified, and both public and private methods are described in brief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each non-trivial method is described in its own doc block prior to the method itself. Anything out of the ordinary is explained in detail, but the doc block is mostly for describing the algorithm followed in the method.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Alternatives:</strong> Whatever you want to find that works better. Don't whine about this until you come up with something, though.
