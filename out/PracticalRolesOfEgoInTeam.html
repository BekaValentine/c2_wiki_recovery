        (jmh) What can I do to get rid of my ego? ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        (<a href="RobertCecilMartin.html">RobertCecilMartin</a>) *Value* your ego.  There's nothing wrong with being proud of your work.  It is that pride that makes your work worth doing, and keeps you motivated.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, *shift* your pride to how well you can work with others and help
        them to produce good work.  A lone star will never do much.  A group of
        effective team players can shake the world.

        (jmh) What can I do to help people to understand there is a thing called ego and it is not good in our team? ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        (<a href="RobertCecilMartin.html">RobertCecilMartin</a>) Don't try to tell them that their ego is bad; it is not.  Rather challenge them to improve their team skills.  Help them to become proud of how well
        they play as a team.

        (<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>) Prefrontal lobotomy or major Prozac. Neither recommended.

        (<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>) Ego is good if used in support of the team. Consider killing a few of them as examples to the others.

        Challenge ego if it can be <em>good team player's ego</em>.
