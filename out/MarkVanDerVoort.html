        I am working with De Nederlandsche Bank and as part of a pilot project we are considering an XP-adaptation of the RUP process. So far we've gotten consensus on <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>, <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> and <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a>. There was a <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> since we are actually rebuilding an existing application, but due to uncertainty both on how to actually create a <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> and on how to deal with the new EJB platform it is now fading ;->. 
        We are now trying <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>s, and I hope to be able to play the first <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> within the next two weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to say <a href="ThankYou.html">ThankYou</a> to the XP community for sharing their thoughts, optimism and courage. I'd like to thank <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> for his book on use cases, since this sells good to a community that wants to do RUP.
      </p>

        My main interest is framework and application building while getting rid of all incomprehensible rules. I am an optimist by nature and the XP style of tackling problems very much appeals to me.

        I am more than willing to contribute to a Dutch XP group. Anyone can reach me on one of the following addresses:

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        apart from that I will report progress on our project on this page and on the mailinglist.
