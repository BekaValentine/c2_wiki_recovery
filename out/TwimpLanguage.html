      <ul>
        <li>
           All commands are converted to uppercase before being executed
        </li>
        <li>
           Forced constants (c) are always in Roman
        </li>
        <li>
           Command (x) you can put another command
        </li>
        <li>
           Stacks (s) are stacks that can have only 3 kinds of values inside: program-line-references, stack-haf-references, and duck-sos.
        </li>
        <li>
           You never need to use the shift key to write a program.
        </li>
        <li>
           Execute-counter is increased by 1 every line of program (even if it does nothing) 
        </li>
        <li>
           ABREV c x = Runs before the programs runs. It does for all .. 1 to c will change .. in x to that number and insert those commands in that order in the program
        </li>
        <li>
           RET s = Go to the program-line referenced by the top of the stack (does not remove items from the stack)
        </li>
        <li>
           PUSHL s = Push this line onto the stack
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
           COPY s n = Pop top element of the stack and push it n times. POP s 1 does the same things as COPY s 0.
        </li>
        <li>
           STOP = Stop the program
        </li>
        <li>
           ON s = Turn on the line of top element of stack
        </li>
        <li>
           OF s = Turn off the line of top element of stack. Lines is of is - at the beginning stop from execute (except ABREV and STEP)
        </li>
        <li>
           SWAP s = Swap this line with line indicated by top of stack
        </li>

           NEW s = Make a new stack, blank
        </li>
        <li>
           MAKE s = Push this line onto stack if stack is empty
        </li>
        <li>
           FORGET = Reset execute-counter to zero
        </li>
        <li>
           DIVIDE n = Set divider to number (default 10)
        </li>
        <li>
           STEP c = Increase execute-counter by number
        </li>

           \ z = Any text. Put on stderr

        </li>
        <li>
           PULL s = Pop 2 haf-references off the stack, and move the top element of the reference stack onto this stack
        </li>
        <li>
           LINE z = Push this text made of any characters onto the waiting line
        </li>

           DRINK n = Makes the program drunk
        </li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Expressions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           n = Any number (positive or negative)
        </li>
        <li>
           [] = Take 1 nibble (4 bits) from input
        </li>
        <li>
           [n-n] = Subtract
        </li>
        <li>
           [n=n] = Binary numbers AND
        </li>
        <li>
           [\] = Take first character off of waiting line and insert into equation
        </li>
        <li>
           [n] = Look at top element of stack. If is empty stack or pointer to line is on, or to haf-reference it will be 1, if is line is of, it will be 2, if the top of the stack is duck-sos, the whole equation will be replaced with zero.
        </li>
        <li>
           [=] = The execute-counter divided by the divider rounded down
        </li>
        <li>
           [======] = How many equal signs you put after the first, will multiply by 2^number. Example: [==] change into [[=]--[=]] and [=====] change into [[====]--[====]] which will do again, again until stop
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I also want to add a KNOT command to tie knots in the stack and in the program. Can you tell me how exactly would that work, please?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(Please type more in here)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I want you to make a new manual, something like the INTERCAL manual. I am no good at making manuals. Look at source-code and make manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've tried to correct spelling on this page, probably with less than 100% success. For example, what are "duck-sos" and "haf-reference"?</em> (You will have to look at the source-code to figure that out. The document I wrote is not very clear.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But it still isn't a full manual yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I added more commands and more stuff, you download it and look, and write a manual like INTERCAL manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please, I need more suggestions! (<a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        I added more commands now, now you need to make some useful programs using this!
