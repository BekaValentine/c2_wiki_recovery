        Initial Blue Hat

      <p>
        At the beginning of a <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> discussion, it is important to identify the topic to be discussed and to decide which hats are going to be used in what order. Because this is <a href="BlueHat.html">BlueHat</a> thinking, most meetings start with an <a href="InitialBlueHat.html">InitialBlueHat</a> under which these matters are decided.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're doing <a href="SixThinkingHatsOnaWikiPage.html">SixThinkingHatsOnaWikiPage</a>, you'll probably omit the <a href="InitialBlueHat.html">InitialBlueHat</a> from the page, because whatever you decided on will be obvious from the structure of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Only the order of discussion as set up by the </em><a href="InitialBlueHat.html">InitialBlueHat</a> will be apparent. The page, if it represents a real discussion, will be in stages or incremental. While it is going on, <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> will be its order and structure. Only  in the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a> when the page is viewed as being finished, having been refactored to <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>, will the structure be viewed as orderly and complete. While the page is in process, the structure will not be structured and orderly. -- <a href="YellowHat.html">YellowHat</a><em> </em>
