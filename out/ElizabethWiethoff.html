        <strong>To be moved eventually to </strong>RubyCallStack:<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Eliz  Have a look at <a href="RubyCoerce.html">RubyCoerce</a> about the right association problem. If I can help solve a problem just ask. See further comments on <a href="RubyCoerce.html">RubyCoerce</a>. Surely this community exists to share what we know. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Eliz, which version of <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> are you using? I am having some trouble duplicating one or two of your results. If I can sort that out I think I should be able to explain some more of what is happening when using <a href="RubyCoerce.html">RubyCoerce</a>. -- John
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a dinosaur. I'm running Ruby 1.6.7. I assume you're running something newer. It's disturbing to think that a different version produces different results. -- Eliz
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment it looks as though 1.6.7 and 1.8.2 behave the same. The version 1.8.4 which I have on Fedora 4 seems to be different. The difference is what is on the call stack when the expression is <strong>1-x</strong>, where <strong>x</strong> is the user type. For this case with 1.8.4, where the first operand is a number (Ruby <strong>Fixnum</strong>), the call is as if from the main program, so that the operator does not appear in the call stack string, so cannot be detected. For  <strong>a-x</strong>, where <strong>a</strong> is some other Ruby class which has operators defined for <strong>+</strong> and <strong>-</strong>, then the operator does appear in the call stack string. I have downloaded the source code of 1.8.4 to look in the change log. -- John
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe get around the version problem by checking the call stack in coerce, instead of in subtract. However, I don't like the thought of coerce needing to know that subtraction is special; I prefer to have subtraction know that subtraction is special. -- Eliz
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that in that case the call to <em>coerce</em> does not contain information on the stack as to what has made the call, which has come from operator <em>-</em> as defined for <strong>Fixnum</strong>. The call stack string does not contain this information any more. This is the change from version 1.8.2 to 1.8.4. I have looked in the changelog and not found any obvious cause. -- John
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe it's time to file a bug report, or at least a weirdness report, to alert the Ruby community of the new behavior. -- Eliz
      </p>
      <p>
        It looks so. The code which does the numeric work is in <strong>numeric.c</strong> and the code which prints out the message is in a function <em>backtrace</em> in <strong>eval.c</strong>. Neither of those parts of the code seem to have changed. The information about the calling function is contained in a variable <em>ruby_frame->orig_func</em> which is set in only one place, in <em>rb_call0</em>, also in <strong>eval.c</strong>. It is set to zero in several places, and in that case the print is skipped. It looks as though some change elsewhere is cleaning up the value. There are several references in the ChangeLog to <strong>eval.c</strong> in 1.8.4. I have been comparing the source codes of versions 1.8.0 and 1.8.4.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am now playing with a copy of 1.8.4 by modifying and recompiling the source. I have established that the routine <em>rb_num_coerce_bin</em> in <strong>numeric.c</strong> knows the name of the calling routine before and <em>after</em> the call to the <em>coerce</em> defined for <strong>Rectangle</strong>. The knowledge must be lost in the complex calling sequence in <strong>eval.c</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Found it</strong> From the ChangeLog: 
      </p>
      <code>
        Wed Jun  8 08:33:10 2005  Nobuyoshi Nakada  <nobu@ruby-lang.org><br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           eval.c (backtrace): skip successive frames sharing same node.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This puts an extra line into the code:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (frame->prev->node == n) continue;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If this is commented out then the previous behaviour is restored. This code is in versions <strong>1.8.3</strong> and <strong>1.8.4</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had a look around the various web sites and not found an obvious location for reporting problems. -- John
      </p>
      <p>
        Great detective work! I wonder why this "feature" was added to Ruby 1.8.3. I guess I'll look around for where to report this. Maybe I'll ask the guys at the local Ruby user group. In the meantime I'm scratching my head wondering how to accomplish the exercise without peeking at the call stack (which struck me as quite a hack). I think Python and C++ beat Ruby when it comes to that exercise. -- Eliz
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks. I had thought of Emailing to the contributor of the patch. My guess is there is some <em>other</em> reason that it was put in. If you send me an Email to J.P.Fletcher@aston.ac.uk I will send you a copy. I have some tidier code for some of your things. I had not come across this before, because for me + and - both make sense and also I working with a SWIG interface where I control all the operators, comparable to your situation with Python. -- John
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> will be patched with the solution with the next release. A one line patch has been added. In the meantime, do not use 1.8.3 or 1.8.4 for this without rebuilding it yourself. -- John
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks. Now I'm marveling at the international <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> community! -- Eliz
      </p>
      <p>
        I like your solution to the problem (on the <a href="RubyCoerce.html">RubyCoerce</a> page). I had been trying from the other end by overloading the operator - of FixNum. Yours is very neat. -- John
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for the compliment. Defining the subtraction operator for Numeric was the first thing I tried, and it didn't work. That's when I decided to carp on <a href="WhyWeHateRuby.html">WhyWeHateRuby</a> about my inability to define right-associated operators, and that's when you came along and introduced me to <a href="RubyCoerce.html">RubyCoerce</a>. I came up with the BogusRectangle idea last night talking to my beau. All he knows about programming is what he did years ago in <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a> on his Commodore 64, so I have to make sure to use the word "subroutine" a lot when I try to explain my newfangled programming ideas to him. ;-) I wrote up the code today and, on a lark, showed it to him. He said, "I'm really thrilled about your Ruby program. It's very elegant. Elegance is important to me as a mathematician." I rule! I discovered a problem with that solution, though, as I explain on the <a href="RubyCoerce.html">RubyCoerce</a> page. After reading my <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> book awhile (get my mind off things) and gazing at the online <a href="PickAxeBook.html">PickAxeBook</a>, I came up with something that I think is more elegant and more Ruby-ish. Take another look at <a href="RubyCoerce.html">RubyCoerce</a>. -- Eliz
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you. I like your new version as well. It is indeed elegant. I have learned things I didn't know about <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>. Also, we have, between us and Nobuyoshi Nakada, tracked down and fixed a bug in the core code of Ruby. I can confirm that both your new methods work fine with Ruby <strong>1.8.4</strong> without the patch. -- John
      </p>
      <p>
        Hooray! Thanks for all your help. Have you also tried some operator chaining tests?
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           + Rectangle.new(3, 4) - 1
        </li>
        <li>
           + Rectangle.new(3, 4) - Rectangle.new(1, 1)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These should work, not raise an exception.
      </p>
      <p>
        These both work with your latest version. I am having problems (spurious failure) with the earlier version. The reason is that the result of the operation
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           + Rectangle.new(3, 4)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        has the class BogusRectangle. It looks like a good reason for preferring the second one where the object under consideration does not change class. -- John
      </p>
      <p>
        Yep. Those "spurious failures" are why I ended up unhappy with the BogusRectangle version. -- Eliz
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had to revisit my own implementations for <a href="RubyCoerce.html">RubyCoerce</a>. One case was failing in some code I had not looked at for a while. The code is an interface for <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> classes to be accessed from Ruby. The problem turned out to be in the setting up of the vector to pass back to Ruby. If you are interested look at <a href="PromotionTraits.html">PromotionTraits</a> for a discussion of the problem. It has taken all evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had another problem which turned out to be an incompatibility between the Ruby development interface and one of the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a>. They both had a macro called ALLOC! To solve that I had to edit my local copy of ruby.h!! -- John
