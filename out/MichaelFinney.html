        Off and on, I have looked at the <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s. Often, I felt the urge to change something on a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>. However, I held back and examined the rules, proper things to do when acting as an author, and the <a href="GoodStyle.html">GoodStyle</a> tips for editing.

        Years ago, I was turned on to the <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s again when I was led to <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> (would be called JUnit if it could be), and <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> from the <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/integrateoften.html">http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/integrateoften.html</a> page.

        Hi, my name is ghassan, I'm an MSc student in chemistry.
        This is very good idea.

        By the way, I added the prefix <em></em>'<a href="mailto:'''''">mailto:'''''</a> in front of your email so that people can just click on it to email you if they wish. I hope that was a good thing. I learned the trick from <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>. -- <a href="MichaelFinney.html">MichaelFinney</a>

        Hi Mike - Just saw your post - Wasn't sure from your comments if you had taken our <a href="WikiInTheWorkplaceSurvey.html">WikiInTheWorkplaceSurvey</a>? You offered some comments about TWiki - We've only been looking at Wiki as a subject for a month or so - so the whole picture is just coming into focus. It does look like TWiki is especially popular in the workplace. Thanks for your comments and feel free to spread the word on our survey - we're really hoping to gather a lot of info in a short time for our course and our own curiosity about the subject. Cheers, <a href="TomAllison.html">TomAllison</a>

        Yes. I hope you could get that information. -- <a href="MichaelFinney.html">MichaelFinney</a>

        Hi Mike - David here. I arrived from <a href="GridComputing.html">GridComputing</a>. I am getting stirred up by SOA architectures and <a href="GridComputing.html">GridComputing</a> implementations. Is VirtualOrganization a term coined by Globus? Also in late 2005 <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> is seeing its <a href="GridComputing.html">GridComputing</a> efforts maturing, see "Transforming Grids into Business Tools" at <a href="http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=38366.">http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=38366.</a> Would you like to update that page to include updates for the <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> arena (e.g. EnterpriseGridAlliance)? I have gathered some raw material in the <a href="ExtremeOrchestration.html">ExtremeOrchestration</a> page -- dl <a href="DeleteWhenCooked.html">DeleteWhenCooked</a>

        Hi David. Welcome! I am glad to see your post.  The market has not really taken advantage of the technology solutions out there it seems when it comes to <a href="GridComputing.html">GridComputing</a>.  Everyone is busy doing their own thing.  So much to do, so little time. I can relate.
