        I'm_a software developer working on different projects. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A hobby of mine is to join the different worlds of computers (PC, Unix, mainframe) together. So I set up a private project, the
      </p>
      <p>
        Platform Independent Network Programming Interface (PINPI).
      </p>
      <p>
        PINPI is a programming interface based on an all-purpose platform independent networking protocol for use to realize client/server (or similar) applications. 
      </p>
      <p>
        PINPI supports user authorization, accounting, compression and encryption. 
        Problems which comes with different platform architectures (byte swapping, different character codings) are solved transparently.
        If the underlying OS or runtime supports multi-threading, the PINPI server handles client requests in parallel threads.
      </p>
      <p>
        TCP/IP is used as underlying transport protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is based on a data format which I published as a RFC (see: <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3072.txt),">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3072.txt),</a> called 
        "Structured Data Exchange Format" (SDXF).
      </p>
      <p>
        SDXF is somehow similar to XML, but it is a lot simpler. It is not a text based format like XML, it is a binary format (some people tries to establish a binary XML - binXML - to realize a similar approach).  
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information, have a look at my project home page <a href="http://www.pinpi.com/.">http://www.pinpi.com/.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        While writing the drafts for SDXF and SDXP (A propose for a General Network Protocol which I use for PINPI) I made a program which prepares a text into the official RFC style.
