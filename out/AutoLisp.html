        Auto Lisp
      </h1>
      <p>
        AutoLISP is a dialect of the <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>. It is the extension language of <a href="AutoCad.html">AutoCad</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Its usefulness is in its abilities in aiding AutoCAD operators in their use of AutoCAD in the preparation of vector graphic representations some call "Blue Prints". AutoCAD has gone through transitions which have steadily improved through refinements and additions of internal accessories such a AutoLISP. 
      </p>
      <p>
        AutoLISP is the scripting language for AutoCAD by Autodesk, a very crippled dynamic <a href="SingleNamespaceLisp.html">SingleNamespaceLisp</a>, based on very early xlisp sources (v1.0), posted by David Betz on <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> (alt.sources), and without proper copyright laws that time used by Autodesk as their free scripting language. There's an old <a href="ByteMagazine.html">ByteMagazine</a> article about that.
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep the language simple, some typical features such as macros, vectors, structs, destructive operations and objects were left out. Memory was low then in the late 80ies. Since then the language itself was not improved at all, to keep things simple and to keep backwards portability. From time to time some library functions were added, such as DCL support (a cross-platform Dialog Control Language). More language features or library functions never made it, besides some utility functions introduced with a compatible third party product Vital Lisp. Autodesk bought it then to replace the old xlisp engine. Now marketed as "VisualLisp", though it's not as "Visual" as the other suites.
      </p>
      <p>
        The language has several milestones since 1987:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           autolisp, based on xlisp 1.0 with ent-, ss-, and get- function plus wcmatch, 
        </li>
        <li>
           extlisp, vmon (virtual memory on), use extended dos memory pages (R10), 
        </li>
        <li>
           acomp <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> compiler for European developers, also xlisp based (R10-R12), 
        </li>
        <li>
           Vital Lisp, external compiler and development system (R12-R14) ("vill"), 
        </li>
        <li>
           Reactors and Automation support (vill 3.2), 
        </li>
        <li>
           VisualLisp, based on vill 3.2. Replaced old AutoLISP in R15 aka AutoCAD 2000. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It is similar to the <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a>, but has even fewer features. A typical <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a> example.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Dynamic scope instead of lexical scope as in <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> and the <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
          Immutable <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a>s, no destructive replacements. Though <a href="HenryBaker.html">HenryBaker</a> seems to classify that as advantage. He classifies it as the only <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> with <strong>only</strong> functional strings and functional cons cells, though not pure because there's SETQ. <a href="http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ObjectIdentity.html">http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ObjectIdentity.html</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Only one global <a href="UniversalNameSpace.html">UniversalNameSpace</a>, though the latest compiler can optionally separate <a href="NameSpace.html">NameSpace</a>s (aka packages) per document (aka DWG)
        </li>
        <li>
          No data structures at all (no vectors, structures, classes, hash tables, ...) 
        </li>
        <li>
          No macros, no optional arguments
        </li>
        <li>
          Very limited control-structure facilities: only if and cond for conditionals, only while, repeat and for each for iteration. 
        </li>
        <li>
          It has mapcar and apply, but not reduce .
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The pro-side is that it has COM support and a built-in IDE with debugger, stepper, project manager.

        I don't know exactly if you can do <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> in AutoLISP because the description is unclear to me. But I guess so. From my point of view it's even the most extreme development environment. Its IDE is <em>better</em> than emacs and tightly integrated into the language and the system. Single <a href="NameSpace.html">NameSpace</a>
        and fully functional vars and <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> like unstrictness makes development much easier than with any scheme or <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> system. Not to speak for other languages. <a href="ReadEvalPrint.html">ReadEvalPrint</a> is unbeatable. Smalltalk maybe comes close, but haven't tried that yet. Just one thing: The internal AutoLISP IDE lacks a builtin cross-referencer.

        A surprising feature:  <a href="AutoLisp.html">AutoLisp</a> insists that fractions be written with a leading zero (e.g., 0.6, not .6).
        If you leave out the leading zero, it may refuse to load the script, due to a "misplaced dot on input" error.

        It is easy for the user to cancel a function, but hard to cancel a function gracefully.  
      </p>
      <p>
        To prepare for being cancelled, a function can set the *error* behavior, to ensure that a proper error message appears, and/or set the system back to the state prior to running the function.

        For *error* handling one can start with template code and add more case-specific functionality from there. The following *error* handling simply records <a href="AutoCad.html">AutoCad</a> system variables as they are initially set within an <a href="AutoLisp.html">AutoLisp</a> command; upon *error* all modified system variables are then reset to their previous values. Also, the UNDO command is often needed to better define transactions in order to achieve proper rollback behaviors.

        And if namespace management is needed/wanted (it's a little tricky in <a href="SingleNamespaceLisp.html">SingleNamespaceLisp</a>) one could structure their <a href="AutoLisp.html">AutoLisp</a> code similar to the following. This pattern takes advantange of <a href="AutoLisp.html">AutoLisp</a>s <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a> to import requested functions from a namespace, which are then bound to symbols of another defun (most suitably a C: prefixed command). The symbols bound to functions by the import should also be protected (declared local) by listing the symbol names after the formal function params.
