        <a href="HaikuMe.html">HaikuMe</a> is at least as relevant to wiki as <a href="DeleteMe.html">DeleteMe</a>. It suggests you want to put your point succinctly, but aren't much good with <a href="HaiKu.html">HaiKu</a> and would appreciate help. <a href="HaikuMe.html">HaikuMe</a> could be clearer on this, I admit. Consider that a challenge.

        <em>Why add noise?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They're not noise. They're requests. <a href="HaikuMe.html">HaikuMe</a> occurred when I read your contribution to <a href="PoemWiki.html">PoemWiki</a>. Since your contribution wasn't a poem, but wasn't drivel either, I wanted to make it into signal. So I tried to do that. Now I'll admit the result isn't great Haiku ... but one thing that's been entertaining me on the poetry pages is that <strong>the poems are getting better over time</strong>. As someone used to noodling poetry alone, I'm very curious about whether this will keep working like that.

        Well, for what it's worth, I like it. How about a spring motife?:

      <code>
        Grass Growing greener<br/>
        Reaching, striving to the sun<br/>
        Gas up the Lawn Boy<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Or a morning one?:
      </p>
      <code>
        Slow roasted coffee<br/>
        Waiting for discovery<br/>
        Accept no substitution<br/>
