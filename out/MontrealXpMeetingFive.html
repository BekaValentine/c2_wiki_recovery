        November first, 2001.

        Presentation: <a href="MontrealXpToolsPresentation.html">MontrealXpToolsPresentation</a> by <a href="StephaneLussier.html">StephaneLussier</a> and JeanMarcHeneman
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           We cover the subject in 40 minutes (the goal was 20 minutes of lecture and then, open discussion).
        </li>
        <li>
           Possible improvement: one suggested to present during 20 minutes, then break and discuss, then resume presentation for the last part.
        </li>

           IMHO, it would have been difficult to make the presentation shorter since it had a lot of stuff ot talk about. But 40 min. about a topic that everyone is interested in (as it was the case yesterday, <strong>kudos</strong>) seems much shorter than 10 min about a topic nobody cares about, no ? I think that the "break and resume" scheme would not be successful since it is generally much easier to get everyone's attention in the first place than getting it back once people started talking about various topics (which I think is good)... My 2 c(Cnd cents). <em>Seb</em>
