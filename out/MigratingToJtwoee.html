        Migrating To Jtwoee
      </h1>
      <p>
        After reading LOTS of postings here and studying newsgroups and other resources on the net, I (<a href="JanNilsson.html">JanNilsson</a>) decided to start this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Background:
      </p>
      <p>
        J2EE (<a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a>) has been around for a short time but long enough for people to start using it.
        The production environment for J2EE is 1.1 today (Aug 2001) but the 2.0 final draft has been available for a while and BEA has a 6.1 port available. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           2004 update: I think the current version is 1.4. Is JavaWebServices a new set of packaging?
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="WebService.html">WebService</a>s is basically a mechanism to support SOAP. RMI is very Java-specific, but CORBA and SOAP allow J2EE components to talk with non-Java entities.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Any news (2004) regarding v2.0?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The thing is that my hard-earned experience is based on 1.1 and 2.0 differs quite a bit regarding <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the people seem to work on "huge banking applications" or something like that but what they are doing is "webifying" a proprietary system to be used by not-so-demanding customers over the Internet.  The "real" business logic still resides on some IBM mainframe or so.
      </p>
      <p>
        There must be more people around the world that think that a complete J2EE technical strategy for their enterprise is the right thing. That ALSO includes the clients. Rich GUI clients working against the J2EE-based server, not <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> and client-server but Swing -> <a href="SessionBean.html">SessionBean</a>s -> <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s -> <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to discuss the consequences of migrating from the old environment to J2EE including the use, or not, of <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s; mapping the database to <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s, or not mapping and using <a href="SessionBean.html">SessionBean</a>s; the number of layers in the application; the different patterns that can be used; pitfalls and successes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sincerely hope someone will join me!!!

        There is this 2004? book <a href="CoreJtwoeePatterns.html">CoreJtwoeePatterns</a>. Anyone seen and have comments on it?

        The original contributor would have starved by now (3 years since its creation), if he relied on the contributions from other people on this subject. I am hoping there are more Java developers this time around (2004). -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>
