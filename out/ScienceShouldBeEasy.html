        Science Should Be Easy
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>...but it isn't.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a>s, routinely employed by pseudoscientists in order to "debunk" some scientific theory in the presence of laymen. It can be an especially effective technique if the audience is skeptical about intellectual endeavors (which makes this effective in political and business circles, where the decision-makers are often <em>not</em> scientists).
      </p>
      <p>
        The essential assertion of this fallacy is this: Scientific truths should be readily explainable to functionally literate laypersons of average intelligence, who have no training in the discipline (or related fields that the discipline in question depends on). If not, the scientist is probably making it all up, using big long words, complex equations, and other forms of gobbledegook to cover up his fraud. (And scientists have much reason to do so - in order to keep their research grants coming in.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Were this fallacy to stand, none of the following could exist:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Algebra, and any form of mathematics more complicated than algebra. Even simple arithmetic cannot be taught to an innumerate person of average intelligence in a short timespan. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Much of modern medicine.
        </li>
        <li>
           Any post-Newtonian physics.
        </li>
        <li>
           Virtually all of chemistry.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In some of the cases, it is often possible to impart superficial knowledge of a scientific subject to a layperson; but in-depth understanding of any modern science requires in-depth study.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't know why you exclude Newtonian physics.  The very fact that we could have nothing more complicated than algebra has to exclude Newtonian physics, because of the latter's reliance on calculus.  (And even algebra is far more complex than most people might imagine--indeed, Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem runs hundreds of pages, relies on decades of work of previous previous mathematicians is pure algebra--algebra that may have even sucked other forms of mathematics into itself, to arrive at the result.)  --Alpheus</em>

        Algebra can and has been taught to 2nd graders. The basic ideas are stuff that 4 year olds are often familiar with, i.e. when you say "Two plus two equals what?", it's the same thing as when grownups say "2 + 2 = x". The discipline of algebra is just realizing that the "what" doesn't have to come at the end, and figuring out how to reverse your steps so the "what" ends up by itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I disagree. They can learn specific simple facts you teach them about anything, but very few will be able to find out new things for themselves. Algebra is far more than just "reversing steps". For example, you can explain in detail why 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2, but only a gifted youngster will be able to find (not prove, just find) the corresponding formula for 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2 using algebra. In fact, most won't even guess that the answer needs just one extra factor. How do you teach young children </em>'how<strong> to guess effectively, </strong>how<em>' to spot patterns?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I fully believe that most 7 year olds are brighter than "an innumerate person of average intelligence", but I'd argue this is because adults make everything far more complicated than it needs to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SetTheory.html">SetTheory</a> is often also taught to elementary school children, and I'd guess they could handle formal axiomatic set theory (as opposed to the union/intersection/membership pablum they're given) if their teachers could. But then again, set theory is not more complicated than algebra.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for physics, basic electromagnetism (Coulomb/Biot-Savart force laws, principle of superposition, even most applications of Gauss's law in integral form) is no more difficult than Newtonian mechanics. I found it significantly easier. Once you get to div/grad/curl, it gets a bit harder, and when you get to tensors you've lost just about all laypeople, but that's still a lot of physics beyond Newton. And LagrangianMechanics isn't in principle much more difficult than Newtonian; the proof of Lagrange's equations is about 3 lines long, falling out of the definitions of force, acceleration, and momentum. The equations sometimes get much hairier to solve, but usually these are cases where you can barely set up the problem in Newtonian physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I won't comment about medicine or chemistry since I have no in-depth knowledge of those subjects. I was balancing chemical equations and playing with molecular models when I was 6-7, but I realize there's a lot more to chemistry than that. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You'll note I said "average intelligence". While I suspect other 6-7 year olds might be able to handle stoichiometric equations given appropriate study, most cannot. Indeed, many adults have difficulty with the subject. Those of us who are smarter than the proverbial average bear often make the mistake of assuming that high intelligence is the norm - and the reason that your average six-year-old can't solve differential equations is 'cause the school system is failing him. (Although I'll certainly agree that in many cases, primary and secondary schoolteachers are ill-equipped to provide adequate instruction to advanced students...)</em>

        <em>With regards to specific fields of endeavor, and their teachability, I'm not intending to make any firm claims as to when they can be taught to people and how long. The point I'm trying to make is that there is a persistent meme that states that everything should be simplistic, else it is rubbish. Which itself is rubbish.</em>

        But... it's understandable rubbish! To me, at least. Which in itself means that it must be true! (Shall we have a betting pool on how many <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a>s are in this statement?) -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

        "If you can't explain to a 5 year-old what you're doing, you don't know what you're doing." (Robert D. Ballard, Discoverer of HMS Titanic, Speaking at a conference at the National Geographic Society in Washington, Nov. 4, 2003)
      </p>
      <p>
        If a scientist doesn't get across what he wants us to see/think from the presentation of his work, he has failed. The IQ of your audience is already something you should have considered when you put your work into the public domain. The discussion about how stupid people are seems be intellectual snobbery. Albert Einstein once said "It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.", the only real problem being we don't all have the time.

        P.S. Chemistry is easy; have you every tried understanding the rules of golf? <em>So we're all clear on the rules, then? No Jews and no blacks.</em> -- Agnus Griffin (FamilyGuy)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think you have it around backwards, Kenneth. It is true that you don't really understand something unless you can 'explain' it at a very basic level. To use your example, you should be able to give a 5 year old the flavour of it. However, this is a statement about *your* understanding of the science, *not* about the complexity of what you are doing. The explanation you give the 5 year old will necessarily be simplified, and probably flawed in subtle ways. It is the appropriate level for the audience, in other words. However, this is not the appropriate level for the work to actually be done in, nor for important policy or funding decisions to be made at. The average joe can understand a lot about what is going on (this is about ignorance, not 'stupidity'), but only if they are willing to put some effort in. Expecting deep understanding of complicated ideas to come from sound bytes and brief outlines is simply inane. As noted on this page, there is a common and fallacious argument made about science and complexity, these days especially from administration circles, which is simply not good enough. Coming from a group of people who are essentially anti-science, this is not surprising...</em>

        Without wishing to be too contrary, there is understanding and then there is understanding. I can explain to my daughter what a microprocessor does, and she can "get" what it's doing, in much the same way that I understand what she's doing when she draws portraits. The explanations provide access, not necessarily skill. I can make the micro jump through hoops; she can draw a convincing dragon. My dragons are not convincing. Mine are ... hopeless. She, on the other hand, doesn't grasp enough of the nuances of flipping bits to carve a program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Science should be able to provide access to knowledge, at whatever tier of understanding you can master. I have no illusions about bottling nuclear fusion, but I "get" what it's about. Some other guy gets it better, so I'll let him craft the first NuclearKleinBottle. I know enough metallurgy to know that certain metals are good or bad for certain things. I would not presume to engage in the formulation process without <em>more</em> understanding and practice than I have.

        I think that the problem of <a href="ScienceShouldBeEasy.html">ScienceShouldBeEasy</a> is that it has two sides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           ScienceIsNotEasy, i.e. there are complexities involved that require training and practice, <em>but</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           ScienceIsaSecretArt, i.e. many books are definitely <em>not</em> written to be read by students, but only by peers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The latter can easily lead to subcommunities in scientific circles, that <em>do</em> fetch funding and are self-referential and excluding students.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But these are separate issues. A scientist's job is to do science. A teacher's job is to teach. These jobs may be done by the same person, but not necessarily. And of course some texts are written only for peers (and most journals). Anything else would be inane. If you want to teach people, there is an entirely separable process of constructing a 'bridging' curriculum to get people to the point where they can read the working literature. In most cases, this is called graduate school. The idea that colleges and universities are somehow holding students back intentionally is simply laughable. If you can demonstrate a way that we can teach undergraduates how to do science faster (with similar resources, I suppose), I guarantee the world will beat a path to your door.</em>

      <p>
        And what I get out of Jonathan's remarks is that <em>if</em> science is appropriately presented, children and laypersons <em>can</em> learn it <em>much</em> faster than is usual in school or college.

        Software design and physical science (Newtonian and quantum physics, chemistry) are two different animals. As described under <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a>, software can transcend physical limitations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Complete and utter BS. Software can't, for example, solve the </em><a href="EntscheidungsProblem.html">EntscheidungsProblem</a>, nor Hilbert's Tenth, nor do numerous other things.<em></em>

           That is not a physical limit. That is a logical limit. Having God-like power is not the same as having God-like wisdom.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We now have the ability to make a world in software that has almost any rules we want as long as we solve the problem at hand (right output). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>At which point generating the "right output" efficiently becomes a paramount concern. While this introduces economics into the equation (at which point the discipline starts to wear the cloak of "engineering", it does not justify reducing the construction of software to a black art, full of hocus-pocus and mysticism.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is not mysticism, for one must create rules and a system that follows those rules without crashing. In other words, "internally consistent". Mysticism does not necessarily require internal consistency. More about this in <a href="SoftwareGivesUsGodLikePowers.html">SoftwareGivesUsGodLikePowers</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the "science" of software may not have to be hard, unlike physical science. We are stuck with the laws of physics, but we can bend software laws in many ways.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Well, maybe software design is theology.

Both, of course, are intimately related to feature size; smaller transistors can be packed more densely, and can also run faster due to lower parasitics and such. Over the past several years, #1 seems to have hit a wall. #2 hasn't yet - and Intel and others have been taking advantage of #2 to continue to achieve processor speedups, and there's still probably ample more room to make even faster CPUs by throwing more gates at the problem.

        <li>
           <em>That misunderstands. Let's try again. If it is bendable (regardless of whether supernatural forces are at work), then it isn't a scientific "law" - i.e. by definition of the word, not as an argument about the concepts. Very few things in science are labeled "law", as a result; most things are theories, which make predictions that are highly context dependent rather than absolute and universal. (As an interesting theological side point, that means that if indeed the/a god can bend physics arbitrarily, then there are no laws of physics after all - but this is theology, not science, because that leads directly to debates about whether one should say that physics can be bent by god if god </em>'never<em>' actually does so, etc.)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           The laws of physics are whatever God/Mother-nature wants them to be. Computer simulations are worlds unto themselves. As a practical matter, the internal rules have to be consistent, or at least fairly well-understood for us as humans to deal with them. I don't know if the actual God/Mother-nature has that same limit or desire. <a href="AreWeSimulations.html">AreWeSimulations</a>.

        Thus, maybe software does not have to be hard, at least not in the same way particle physics might be. <a href="StringTheory.html">StringTheory</a> makes a crappy assembler language for us to work with as humans. But, we can play God with software and change the rules as long as the output is correct.

        A lot of the discussion on this page concerns the <em>level</em> of understanding of a topic. An audience of average intelligence, with no previous training in a given topic, often can be taught a superficial understanding of a topic (to not much breadth or depth; often employing extended metaphor which is technically imprecise or incorrect), in a reasonably short amount of time. For example; consider the topic of plaque buildup in arteries, leading to heart attacks or strokes, etc. Most laypersons have a simple understanding of how this works; analogies to plumbing and stopped pipes have been successful. Laypersons also know that a substance known simply "cholesterol" is implicated in this; laypersons who are on a diet or exercise regimen may even know about HDL ("good") cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, and triglycerides.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, becoming a (competent) doctor generally requires more in-depth knowledge of the underlying biochemistry and biomechanics; stuff that generally requires advanced training in general chemistry and anatomy to understand sufficiently. Whereas the "stopped pipes" analogy can be described in a four-page brochure over a half-hour training session; in-depth knowledge of the topic requires much longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> topic: I can explain the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> to an interested layperson; simply by pointing out that in some cases <em>analyzing</em> a program takes just as long as <em>running</em> it; which may take forever. Pop-culture references, even if largely specious (such as <a href="NormanTheAndroid.html">NormanTheAndroid</a>), may help. This is a frequently useful exercise in response to questions such as "why don't programmers write programs to get rid of the bugs in their code?". However, my lecture on the topic does not convey to the listener an in-depth knowledge on RecursiveFunctionTheory, the <a href="ChomskyHierarchy.html">ChomskyHierarchy</a>, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The essential point of the page is that some people often advance the claim that sophisticated science is in fact fraudulent; a giant house of smoke and mirrors which enables doctors (and others) to collect large fees and purchase country-club memberships, all at the expense of an unwitting population that has long been fleeced by this scheme. I don't all object to the notion that scientific knowledge should be brought to the masses wherever possible (and whenever said masses are interested); and there are many examples of circumstances where productive and useful work can be accomplished by individuals with little formal training (administration of first aid in medicine; many programming tasks, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
        What I generally object to is the allegation of a <a href="GrandConspiracy.html">GrandConspiracy</a> of scientists and others - the notion that "if an egghead tells you something is difficult, <em>he's lying</em>". Many things that scientists do <strong>are</strong> hard, or at least require lots of study in order to understand at the level sufficient for scientific exploration. Granted, not all tasks in scientific disciplines require that level of understanding (many don't), but there are some that do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I guess I see a slightly different aspect. I see a lot of pseudo-science that gets wrapped up in unusual terminology and complex logic. My hypothesis is that "Science is logical. Human minds have developed to process patterns, which is the basis for logic. From this, I believe that the better scientific description will be the more logical and most easily processed by the human brain. Hence, science should be easy or at least easily understood with the proper explanation."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your hypothesis has some weak points, not the least of which is the fact that the vast majority of humans are very bad at logic. There is also a lot of empirical evidence that some of the best science only became generally accepted (by scientists, let alone laypeople) after a generation had 'grown up with it' (e.g., quantum physics, evolutionary theory). This is not because it is particularly complex, but that big ideas that require rethinking a lot of your assumptions (i.e. a 'paradigm shift', in the proper sense of the word), can be difficult to accept. A third issue is that often when an idea is first presented, it is overly complicated. If it is an important idea, many people will play with it - and iteratively improve it. This is particularly notable in mathematics, for example (have a look at Newton's original notes about calculus some time!).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not certain I follow the logic of this argument. I do not see the leap where the "acceptance of an idea" is deemed equivalent to the "understanding of an idea."</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no equivalence. However, we are on difficult ground here, especially if we are talking about what science ought to do. But assuming there is always understanding, the length of time sometimes seems needed. In other words, there seems sometimes to be a need for difficult to accept (and understand) ideas to be around for a *long* time. But it is good science. As far as I can see, this is quite different from your idea of 'easily understood'. If your statement "or at least easily understood with the right explanation" can be read to include as explanation, for example, 4-6 years of postgraduate study, then you will not find much argument, I think. As far as "most logical and most easily processed by the human brain" goes, your argument is in difficulty, as our understanding of cognitive and neuro science does not suggest logic is not where you look for 'easily processed'.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As for the final point, it appears to reinforce rather than contradict the idea the science should be easy. The supposition presented was that an idea is initially overly complicated, but later is improved. I would conclude from this statement that simplification of the idea is improvement of the idea. To me, this progression implies a belief that science should be easy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple is not the same thing as easy. And both of these things can assume a lot about the target audience. Note also, this progression sometimes takes centuries (in the case of maths, at least). And for all that time the ideas were in a (more) difficult to explain and understand form. So while you can certainly argue an aesthetic case (and many scientists would argue this strenuously) that, for example, given two theories and all else being equal, the simpler one is better. It is certainly not a logical consequence of this idea that one ought to reject complicated ideas. As far as I can see, the only defensible content of your statements is pretty much an inarticulate statement of Occams razor, but I may just be missing something.

        <li>
           School messes with our minds and teaches us to think in unnatural ways, so we then loose the ability to understand and teach from a natural scientific prospective that would have been easy.
          <ul>

                   I was referring to structured formal schooling. There have been many extremely intelligent scientist that never went to a formal school of any kind. One individual that comes to mind (I forget her name) was one of the Rothschilds. A very brilliant scientist and inventor. Self-studied and taught herself from her parents' home library. Formal schooling teaches us to be dumb in certain ways from an early age. Later on when we need to be brilliant, it's kind of too late.

                   <em>In what way does formal schooling teach us to be dumb? I went to public school in the US; I certainly didn't learn to be "dumb". Obviously, some schools are better than others, but...</em>'

                <li>
                   Hmmm. How do you explain the fact that most of the 'extremely intelligent scientists' (whatever we take that to mean) did come up through the usual formal schooling system? There are many flaws in our school system, but your statement seems a bit strong and verging towards conspiracy theory weirdness ... unless I am misreading you.

                   <em>One thing the public school system doesn't likely do well is push advanced students hard; it's generally geared towards imparting basic literacy in the vast majority of the populace, rather than cultivating Einsteins or Gerschwins. Cultivating expertise has long been considered the domain of universities, not primary and secondary schools. Many bright individuals, after 12 years of public school boredom, have come to the conclusion that the public schools have failed because </em>'they<em>' weren't as well-served as they would like. Of course, many allege that the public schools even fail at the mission of imparting basic literacy; and that high school graduates are routinely produced that cannot read or write satisfactorily; that's another topic of debate.</em>

Don't get me wrong, I am very thankful for my education, but it does have a down side too, that's all. It is kind of like this Wiki. Where you have a group of the regular-guard that forces new-comers to either think and act the same way or leave. What is lost is unprecedented innovation and evolution on new levels. Often, in schools, business community, science laboratories, etc., when someone does come up with something extremely brilliant, no one else seems to understand it and the person gets ridiculed until they either drop the thing or leave.

        Part of the problem, I think, stems from the notion of "easy"; it seems to mean different things to different people.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           One definition of "easy" is <strong>simple to understand/explain</strong> (at least at a basic level). This has quite a bit of dependency on the abilities of the teacher, not just on the properties of the discipline in question. There are those who can make a topic which is often considered "complicated" (say, quantum mechanics) and provide plausible explanations that laypersons can understand. This doesn't qualify the layperson as a quantum physicist, however.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Another definition of "easy" relates to the amount of inherent complexity in the domain, accounting for (and subtracting out) the "noise" often introduced by educational processes. An in-depth understanding of modern medicine has a large degree of inherent complexity; as the human body is an extremely complex system which even <em>scientists</em> (and physicians) have only a limited understanding of. (Which might be part of the problem.)

        <strong>Explainer Not Trying Hard Enough?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        (Based on material from <a href="ObjectiveEvidenceAgainstGotosDiscussion.html">ObjectiveEvidenceAgainstGotosDiscussion</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Good doctors can explain just about anything if both parties are patient enough (pun). Sure, chemistry is sometimes hard to explain, but there are often common counter-parts to compare the general process to. For example, proteins tend to cling onto other proteins when there is kind of a key-to-door match between them. If the key or lock is damaged or changed, then the two may not fit so well. The wrong medication is like the wrong key: it won't fit the target proteins properly and thus not lock-on to the right "door" to do its work. People in academia too long often lose or never gain the ability to communicate to non-academics and get frustrated easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a newbie office worker asked me what the difference is between "filtering" and "sorting". At first I was talking techie gobbledy-gook, but then switched to a laundry analogy. Sorting is like grouping the entire wash results while filtering is selecting only some of the clothes, such as only washing the dark colors. It clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I have difficulty communicating to non-techies, I will tend to <strong>blame myself</strong> and think about better ways to describe it rather than call the user "dumb". If I try hard enough, usually I can find a way to communicate what I need to. (Although I do fail sometimes.) In explaining the difference between "fat-client" and "fat-server" apps, I've resorted to using elves. In client-centric apps, most of the elves are in your own garage and receive raw toy materials from the north pole. In server-centric apps, most of the elves and raw material stay at the north pole and they build-to-deliver what you ask for over the phone. One does not have to worry about elves with different skill-sets or tools at each different location (version variation) if they are all at the north pole. However, it requires supporting a big north pole operation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That elves analogy is actually pretty good.  It lends itself to a host of similar ideas for explaining computer ideas that are not far off the acutuality.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        --top
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course being 'patient enough' sometimes means 'educating the other party up to one's own level', especially when they assume they know something and can't be convinced they are wrong with their current level of knowledge.  Elves and clothes are all nice, but to someone who thought different, your entire 'elves' analogy would be no better than some 'claim from on high by an arrogant SOB; fat-client apps mean apps that make the client fat, dammit, and that's what I'm going to teach to your children!'.  There are people we might generally term as <a href="HostileStudent.html">HostileStudent</a>s.  They are such often because they are <a href="AgendaPushing.html">AgendaPushing</a> - and often that for such ridiculous reasons as being unwilling to back down on something they said before (some people are more invested in their having-been right than in their becoming right).  <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>'s examples are nice and all, but they are obviously provided in situations where the audience isn't assuming something.  That Top brought this up in '<a href="ObjectiveEvidenceAgainstGotosDiscussion.html">ObjectiveEvidenceAgainstGotosDiscussion</a>' as though to blame the other party for not explaining well enough... bothers me; I don't believe Top at all qualifies as an unassuming audience.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And some people, whom we might generally term as 'Practical', demand that their audience already possess the necessary degree of education prior to engaging in professional discussion or willfully entering a situation where they may be required to do so.  A doctor is allowed to assume that other (alleged) doctors and nurses are qualified and will understand what they are talking about without them babying it down in terms of 'elves' or 'dirty clothes' - that is, unless the topic is highly specialized even within the profession.  A nurse or doctor that wasn't capable of keeping up with such discussion shouldn't even be allowed to remain in the profession!  The same goes for people discussing on a profession-specific forum such as <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>: we can expect, nay, demand a certain level of education and expertise when we discuss goto patterns or argue the benefits of double dispatch.  And while we cannot expect that many know the depths of <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> or <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> or <a href="GraphTheory.html">GraphTheory</a>, we can certainly demand expertise of those who choose to actively engage in discussion on the merits or properties of any of these or alternatives to them (unless they are just asking general questions).  There is such a thing as negligent ignorance.  People who wish to make make claims or engage in arguments have something of a duty to perform well, to make no unreasonable assumptions, to either have sufficient evidence or to be extremely forthcoming in the degree to which their statement is speculative... unless they are happy with being considered pretenders, trolls, and sophists.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, of course, the equation changes if someone really is just asking questions, seeking education.  Experts don't have any inherent <em>duty</em> to educate those seeking it, but they should, if they are honest, attempt to do it well if they try at all.  But, unless the listener is somehow <strong>paying</strong> the explainer to dumb it down to 'elves' and 'dirty clothes', I expect that "<strong>Explainer Not Trying Hard Enough</strong>" isn't a justifiable claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I personally believe its a </em>'good exercise<em>' to try to explain the benefits of something to somebody who may not be well-versed in the same professional lingo and idioms that we are. Again, I've found that if I really want to communicate with somebody not from a technical background, and both sides are willing to try, then eventually I can. It is usually possible. If the other side walks away and doesn't want to talk about it, then obviously its over. But if they stay, even if they are irritable or jumpy, it's usually possible to come to a mutual understanding even if there's a lot of shouting involved. I am not saying it is easy or that it is "expected" for one to be that patient, I am only saying its possible.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, I believe you: so long as you're talking about "somebody not from a technical background" - i.e. someone who is both ignorant and who assumes you know better than they do - you can "come to a mutual understanding" because you're free to "teach" your audience.  But, if nothing else, your experiences on <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> and such pages as <a href="TypesAreSideFlags.html">TypesAreSideFlags</a> and <a href="ObjectiveEvidenceAgainstGotosDiscussion.html">ObjectiveEvidenceAgainstGotosDiscussion</a> should have taught you that even you cannot come to "mutual understanding" with people that (for better or worse) think they know better than you do.  Instead, you are accused of arrogance, fallacy, and negligent ignorance... to which you respond by making your own accusations.  You, too, are a person who thinks he knows better (albeit you think it while thumbing your nose at academia and the vast store of knowledge it has accumulated).  As such, patience or no, people can't "teach" you anything, be it what types really are in <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> or anything else.  The only "mutual understanding" reached by each party is that the other is full of himself, and the only thing you'll get a <strong>good exercise</strong> in is your frustration.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Type" definitions are not a good test because thats about definitions, not superiority of a technology. And it may be that both sides grow weary in the "goto" topic such that they don't want to discuss it anymore. That doesn't mean mutual understanding is not possible, but merely that it takes longer than both sides want to invest and/or the name-calling exceeds someone's toleration threshold for that week. It's too early to call that one in my opinion. --top

        <em>Another thing, almost every tool is somehow tied to the real world. Rockets are very complex, but they need to be reliable, safe, accurate, cheap, etc. to various degrees for the users. When "selling" tools like rockets to customers, they want metrics that are closely tied to reliable, safe, accurate, cheap, etc. If you try to sell them on the idea that trionic compensator dynamical engines are "better" for their needs, you should focus on *their* needs and work backward toward the technology. You don't start with the technology first. The customer wants a package delivered to the moon regardless of whether the vehicle uses trionic compensator dynamical engines or gerbils on a treadmill. The "elegance" of the engine is not a selling point if not tied to the issues of getting the package to the moon. Technologists and acedemics often get blinded by the technological or mathematic elegance. We are often guilty of </em><a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> without knowing it.

The audience wants to know why the "trionic compensator dynamical engines" will provide better "heat distribution and second-stage stability" than the "dual radial Whatsit engines" they're currently using.

        It seems you view discussion in general in terms of marketing.  You seem to treat every statement as though someone was marketing it to you, and that they've done something fundamentally wrong if they don't bother convincing you.

      <p>
        If I were attempting to sell you on an idea, as though I'd benefit (in terms of cash or convenience) from your buying into it, then NO, it would not be reasonable to demand you read 80 papers.  In fact, it would be better for me to be dishonest while dumbing it down ("for the masses") because it really might take 80 papers to convincingly explain (in depth) all the various benefits of the solution and the disadvantages of the others even if much of each paper is just repeating the others.

        But if my goal is simply to provide some wisdom and point you towards where you can learn WHY it is "wisdom", then pointing you at a 100 page paper and the five page bibliography at the back seems a very wise and efficient means to do so.  Doubly so if you think you know better and aren't willing to be convinced by me anyway.  Most people are perfectly okay if you continue to waste your (customer's) money or watching you flounder taking dead-end paths; "foolish"  will mutter those who already ran into those brick walls (or learned from those who did so)... then they'll get on with life.

But the construction of a test doesn't obviate the need for those research papers... or telling 'practitioners' to go view them.  You can't reduce 'wisdom' itself to a test.  Those papers contain the whys and hows and wheretofores of prior tests and experiments, letting you know what has failed and what has succeeded and often why... such that you can better avoid running into the same problems your predecessors did, and be more confident of your success where your predecessors succeeded.
