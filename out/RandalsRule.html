        Randals Rule
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="RandalsRule.html">RandalsRule</a> is a debugging rule that holds true so often it must be a pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Most bugs are fixed just by deleting code</em>. (i.e. not adding any)
      </p>
      <p>
        Origin is from my boss who told me it years ago and I laughed, then years passed and it's no longer funny, just ironic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specific examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some code is duplicated needlessly and should simply be removed, not refactored
        </li>
        <li>
           Some shops distribute Debug versions to customers for improved on-site diagnostics. Sometimes a Release version is distributed that had different compiler flags - a significant difference from the Debug version. Simply deleting the Release version from the project fixes the "bad version"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Really this is one of those rules that seems insane until you've heard it, then you start to notice it everywhere.

        Addendums:
      </p>
      <p>
        I just revisited this pattern in a project where I fixed a redraw problem by deleting all the HideWindow functions except one(no chokepoint, just call removals). An <a href="AhHa.html">AhHa</a> moment happened when I realized this is just <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> from a different angle. The bug was caused by having excessive (and redundant) code - most certainly a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>, and in this case it developed into a legitimate bug. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems <a href="RandalsRule.html">RandalsRule</a> is a pattern with the context of when violating <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> causes a bug. Seems so obvious now. . .
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As a corollary; if you find that </em><a href="RandalsRule.html">RandalsRule</a> doesn't hold for your project or organization, you might be religiously applying <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> already.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless refactoring a legacy system where you should apply it liberally. . .
      </p>

        Another addendum:
      </p>
      <p>
        This rule seems to apply when writing new code as well. A complicated if, else, elseif block can sometimes be reduced to just one or two lines. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Trite Example:
      </p>
      <p>
        if (default)
        {
      </p>
      <code>
        a=2;<br/>
        b=3;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        else
        {
      </p>
      <code>
        a=2;<br/>
        b=5;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        could be reduced to:
      </p>
      <p>
        a=2;
        b=3;
      </p>
      <p>
        if (!default)
        {
      </p>
      <code>
        a=2;<br/>
        b=5;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        or even more extreme as:
      </p>
      <p>
        a=2;
        b=3;
        if (!default)
        b=5;
      </p>
      <p>
        This is admittedly a trite example, but hopefully makes the point that <a href="RandalsRule.html">RandalsRule</a> is an example of the <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> pattern.
