        "Here's my current definition of a testable system:
      </p>
      <p>
        "For each logical part of the system, a unit test can be written
        relatively easily and quickly that satisfies all the following PC-COF
        rules at the same time:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "[1] Partial runs are possible
        </li>
        <li>
          [2] Consistent results on every test run
        </li>
        <li>
          [3]Configuration is unneeded before run
        </li>
        <li>
          [4]Order of tests does not matter
        </li>
        <li>
          [5]Fast run time"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a system is grown through <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, then...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          [1] partial runs are inevitable,
        </li>
        <li>
          [2] consistent results should happen (if standard TDD advice about avoiding globals, side-effects, live network connections / databases, are followed).
        </li>
        <li>
          [3] Configuration should be in the tests rather than outside of the framework,
        </li>
        <li>
          [4] Order of the tests should not matter (again, standard TDD advice), and
        </li>
        <li>
          [5] the tests should run quickly (standard TDD advice again).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So I don't think any *additional* advice regarding testability is
        necessary for people practicing TDD.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to motivate testability for code developed without the
        benefit of TDD, that's a fine goal.... but shouldn't really be
        confused with TDD. MichaelFeather's <em></em><a href="WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode.html">WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode</a><em> covered that, and the mailing list associated with the book is still around, though inactive. Search for WELC.</em>
