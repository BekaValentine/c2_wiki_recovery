        Who do you rate (and <strong>not</strong> rate) as one?
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I saw something rated <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a> as one. Unlikely, except perhaps in his younger days. <em>I'm not so sure. That original Basic was a pretty cool piece of work</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe either part of <a href="KernighanAndRitchie.html">KernighanAndRitchie</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        Can someone be <em>just</em> a software genius --- or do they some other insightful skill to be rated as such?

        I tried for a long time to figure out if I was a <a href="SoftwareGenius.html">SoftwareGenius</a> or a SoftwareIdiot.  I finally figured out that I guess I'm <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a>.  -- <a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>
