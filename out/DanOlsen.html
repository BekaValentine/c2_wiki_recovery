        Some kind individual looked up my email address (I don't know how they found it) to notify me of the <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> on my page. I was glad to be reminded of Wiki. I'll bookmark this and comeback more often, I would like to see some discussion on philosophy and public policy such as the <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a>, with regard to world events. I'll go see what topics are out there. And I'll try to keep this a <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>.

        Having just recently returned to WikiBrowsing after many months away, I am wondering what enhancements to Wiki might make it easier to browse and to contribute. I know BrowserFrames or scripting novelties and other complexities are probably out of the question, but some sort of home link or category link or up down reference on each page might help the feeling that it is easy to get lost, while at the same time still allowing that ease of getting lost that we like about wiki.
