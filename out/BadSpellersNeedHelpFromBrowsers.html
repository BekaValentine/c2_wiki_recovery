        Bad Spellers Need Help From Browsers

        Find (Ctrl-F) does not find words in textarea fields
        like the one I am typing in right now.  See, there,
        I just did a search for "textarea" and it couldn't find
        the word in the previous sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Find should search these fields when it comes to them.
        It should also properly scroll the field so that the
        found word(s) are visible.

        I run a server that relies on considerable text entry
        through forms.  I spell check this input and report
        misspellings in my response to the post.  A typical
        reaction is to backup to the posting page and search
        for the misspelling.  Unfortunately for the poster, their
        browser software is unwilling to assist them in this
        search.  Please help.

        I wonder if any browser handles this search case? -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Emacs w3-mode handles it perfectly well -- since when you edit a
        textarea you get a new buffer, with the full power of emacs there
        (for example, you can run ispell-buffer directly, as I just did.)

        There are a lot of situations where a generic browser spell check plug-in would be very useful. Ideally, it might be able to check the form field where cursor is, check all fields on the current page, and/or be configured to auto-check all form fields when you tabbed out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does anyone know anything along those lines that actually exists? I gather that the Emacs w3-mode post above is probably referring to something like that, but being unix-impaired I have no idea. Anything out there for standard <a href="NetscapeNavigator.html">NetscapeNavigator</a> or <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> on Windows or Mac?

        Unfortunately a spell checker wouldn't help with the three most common mistakes seen on the internet:

        Sometimes I wonder... didn't these people attend elementary school? At all? It boggles my mind.
