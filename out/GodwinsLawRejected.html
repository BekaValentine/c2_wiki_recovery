        </li>
        <li>
           Will it work?
        </li>

        I would have used this marker on ReligiousWar had I invented it by then. What does this say about <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>, <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a>s, foreknowledge, freewill, refactoring and the problem of evil?

        You are just following Morgan's corollary (cf. <a href="GodwinsLaw.html">GodwinsLaw</a>) in the <a href="WikiWay.html">WikiWay</a>. You can't win. I also refer you to the conclusion at the end of <a href="GodwinsLaw.html">GodwinsLaw</a>:

        <dd>Of course no reply was forthcoming. Even when the participants know <a href="GodwinsLaw.html">GodwinsLaw</a>, <a href="GodwinsLaw.html">GodwinsLaw</a> still applies.</dd>

        But if <a href="GodwinsLaw.html">GodwinsLaw</a> cannot be rejected, doesn't this reflect more of a totalitarian-dictatorship (a la Nazi Germany) style of discussion, rather than the more democratic culture of the Wiki?  Anyone who wanted to kill a thread would just have to mention the Nazis!

        The point is that once something has been compared to Hitler/the Nazis, emotional issues override any rational ones, and the discussion is derailed.  Note that <a href="GodwinsLaw.html">GodwinsLaw</a> does not apply when the discussion is explicitly about Hitler/the Nazis, because then nothing external is being compared to Hitler/the Nazis.

        [This argument is silly. Fascists will always exist. A fascist is born every minute. The measure of a coutry's good laws and good government is how much it can protect itself from a fascist. Most countries succeed.
