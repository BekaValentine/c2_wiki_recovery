        Executive director of the Jung Center for Education and Research and doctor in Intercultural studies and clinical psychology the author calls herself <strong>cantadore</strong>, keeper of old stories.
        She goes mystery- and <a href="PatternMining.html">PatternMining</a> trough stories and fairytales.  
        The material is chosen - says Clarissa - to embolden us. Her work is offered as a fortification for those on their way <strong>Para Vida</strong>, for true life. 
        Wild woman is prototypical, no matter what culture, no matter what era, no matter what politics; she does not change. 
        A transfer of hard-won wisdom.

        Subject: Installing Husband 5.0
      </p>
      <p>
        Dear Tech Support: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a
        distinct slow down in overall system performance, particularly in the flower
        and jewelry applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as
        Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5 and then installed Undesirable
        programs such as NBA 5.0, NFL 3.0 and Golf Clubs 4.1. Conversation 8.0 no
        longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried
        running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail.
