        One thing that really peeves me on this wiki is when some folks think their new edit is so important that it just has to go at the top of the page. This destroys the context of the page. It multiplies when comments are added beneath that, then the original well thought out introduction ends up half way down the page.

        Take the example that lead to the creation of this page. <a href="TwoCowPolitics.html">TwoCowPolitics</a>. Some bright spark left the page with a new entry "there's one missing" at the top. Of course this only makes sense if you've read the page before, but with a huge gob of text at the top of the page, who's to know where the original beginning was?
