        Cpp Unit Code Smell
      </h1>
      <p>
        The exercise <a href="ConsiderationsForAndComparisonOfCeePlusPlusTestFrameworks.html">ConsiderationsForAndComparisonOfCeePlusPlusTestFrameworks</a>
        helped me understand what I did not like about <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I must admit that <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> has greatly improved
        over the last few years.  It used to require far more redundant
        typing than it does now.  Nevertheless, I think it still
        has problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mainly, <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> requires redundant typing.  A test case must be
        defined as a fixture in a method, and then linked into a suite.
        It does not have a <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a> script.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> has been extended with macros that reduce
        some, but not all, of this redundant typing.
        However, these macros are non-syntactic C++ macros,
        a code smell in and of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the fundamental problem is that <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>
        structures test cases as methods of a fixture,
        and then binds the method to create an independent test case
        object.
      </p>
      <code>
        class <a href="ComplexNumberTest.html">ComplexNumberTest</a> ...<br/>
        void testEquality() { ...<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>::TestCaller?<<a href="ComplexNumberTest.html">ComplexNumberTest</a>> <br/>
        test( "testEquality",<br/>
        &<a href="ComplexNumberTest.html">ComplexNumberTest</a>::testEquality );<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This requires redundant typing that cannot be completely
        hidden by macros, and which is hard to handle in simplistic
        <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a> scripts that do not understand C++,
        e.g. that work line by line.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it is semantically equivalent,
        and much more conducive to simple <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a> scripts,
        to express test cases as void functions or classes
        with a test() method, where the test fixture is
        inherited by the test case.

        It could also use VC++ itself as the test runner. See <a href="VisualCeePlusPlus.html">VisualCeePlusPlus</a>.
