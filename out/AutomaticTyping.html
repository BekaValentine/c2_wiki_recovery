        <a href="AutomaticTyping.html">AutomaticTyping</a>, sometimes called <a href="LatentTyping.html">LatentTyping</a>, is any language typing system which requires little or no type annotations (type declarations of variables, object members, function arguments) to function.  Opposite of <a href="ManifestTyping.html">ManifestTyping</a> (wherein type information must be provided by the programmer).

        "Automatic typing" also refers to the habit of typing a particular word which starts with a given prefix by default, which surfaces as a strange sort of typo when you meant some other word and didn't notice. E.g., I have heard the complaint from a Usenetter that he would automatically type "linux" when he meant "lines".
