        Argumentum Ad Infinitum
      </h1>
      <p>
        It frequently happens on Wiki that two or more people with differing views are each unable to persuade the other.  What generally happens next is a long drawn out, possibly but not necessarily personally nasty <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> argument that may serve to illustrate the issues involved but more likely has evolved into a "who gets to have the last word" contest.  Inevitably one party through exhaustion or boredom gives up and stops responding.  The fallacy of Argumentum Ad Infinitum is the incorrect assumption that simply because people no longer argue with you that your case has been proved.
