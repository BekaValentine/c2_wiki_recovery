      <p>
        Patterns are a way of capturing knowledge, usually knowledge  in the form of expertise or rules of thumb.  Other useful forms of capturing expertise are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           discussions (newsgroup threads, compuserve forums)
        </li>
        <li>
           faqs (frequently asked questions)
        </li>
        <li>
           cookbooks (e.g. Parcplace Visualworks cookbook)
        </li>
      </ul>

        I had the great honor to spend some time with <a href="PatHoyIii.html">PatHoyIii</a>
        (that's Pat Hoy III in Wiki-ese).  He turned me on to
        metaphors, something I discovered I really didn't understand
        before, and which I understand a little bit better now.
      </p>
      <p>
        He believes that the key goal of a piece of literature
        is to help the reader re-live the experience that caused
        the author to learn something.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe patterns do that.  They encode the misfits of
        tried and untrue solutions (in the forces), and they are
        concrete enough that they appeal to the experiential side
        of our reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that sense, a PatternIsaStory, much more than it is a
        guide, a manual page, discussion, FAQ, or decision tree.
        They are decidedly NOT cookbooks.  All those things capture
        knowledge.  PatternsCaptureExperience.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a PatternIsaStory, then a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> generates the
        culture that emanates from any mythology.  Patterns are the
        mythologems of a problem-solving culture.  I think this
        is closely knit with generativity:  a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> causes
        an impression or experience to develop and grow in the mind
        of the reader, rather than just planting a "fact."  ("There
        is no such thing as a fact."  -- Deming)
