        Test Transactions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most test techniques focus on a single method, function, data source, etc.
        These often miss the failures that result from the interactions in different
        parts of the code.  So, test long transactions through the system
        This is similar to the more modern test use cases except, as I was taught
        the technique, the goal was to make the transactions as long and complex
        as possible without being redundant.
