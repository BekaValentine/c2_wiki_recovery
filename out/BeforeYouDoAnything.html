        Before You Do Anything
      </h1>
      <p>
        Before you do anything, ask yourself:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Will it make the world a better place?
        </li>
        <li>
           Will it make me a better person?
        </li>
        <li>
           Will it make me richer?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If the answer to all three questions is no, then DON'T DO IT!
      </p>
      <p>
        I would say if the answer to 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the second of the three questions is yes
        </li>
        <li>
           or if the answer to at least two of the three questions is yes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        then DO IT!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What if the answer to only the first or only the third question is yes?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you must decide <a href="WhatToDo.html">WhatToDo</a>. You will often have to deal with the rule <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a> at a personal level. The default should be <a href="DoNt.html">DoNt</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Changing something in a stable situation can often be a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>. Particularly since it may be that <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if I ask these questions at every decision point? Like at Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner, or if I feel thirsty?
