        Rules Of Propaganda
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here are five basic rules of propaganda, courtesy of Norman Davies in his extraordinary book "Europe: A History" ISBN:0-7126-6633-8.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The rule of simplification: reducing all data to a simple confrontation between 'Good and Bad', 'Friend and Foe'. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The rule of disfiguration: discrediting the opposition by crude smears and parodies.
        </li>
        <li>
           The rule of transfusion: manipulating the consensus values of the target audience for one's own ends. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The rule of unanimity: presenting one's viewpoint as if it were the unanimous opinion of all right-thinking people: draining the doubting individual into agreement by the appeal of star-performers, by social pressure, and by 'psychological contagion'. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The rule of orchestration: endlessly repeating the same messages in different variations and combinations. 
        </li>
      </ol>
