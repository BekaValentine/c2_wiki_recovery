        Background: somebody proposed removing <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> from the sample languages listed in <a href="QueryLanguageComparison.html">QueryLanguageComparison</a> on the account there is no computer-runnable implementation currently available.

           Er, download-able wasn't in the stated requirements.

           <em>True, but "at least one working implementation" suggests at least one working implementation that works, and hence can be, er, worked by various & sundry masses, which implies it can be (at least) downloaded.</em>

           I don't want to get into a semantics debate. What exactly do you want done about it? Deletion? That's too abrupt. How about a separate parallel topic for "experimental" query languages. I can live with that compromise. -t

           Math runs on human brains.  The <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> runs on computers.  <a href="TopsQueryLanguage.html">TopsQueryLanguage</a> runs on nothing.  If it was anything more than a conventional procedural language, somewhat similar to <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, then it <em>might</em> be a worthy illustration of an alternative database language.  As it stands, it offers nothing conceptually or notationally to warrant consideration.  As a tool for thought, <a href="TopsQueryLanguage.html">TopsQueryLanguage</a> can simply be replaced with the phrase "mostly BASIC-like, but with built-in database tables" or simply "<a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> rebooted".

               <em>Math is an inexorable series of logical equivalences that facilitate provable reasoning.  </em><a href="TopsQueryLanguage.html">TopsQueryLanguage</a> is a programming language that you can't use to write programs.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Math is used for many purposes, not just for theorem proving. I'm sure before the first space probes went up using FORTRAN code, the formulas were written down as math equations. Math encodes a model, and so does programming code. That model may be used for theorem proving or implementing or testing the model or documenting model suggestions. In short, you are wrong, or at least giving an incomplete picture.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Models used for reasoning are distinct from models intended to execute.  Math is used for reasoning.  </em><a href="TopsQueryLanguage.html">TopsQueryLanguage</a> is a programming language intended to execute... ...that doesn't.  Some programming languages <strong>do</strong> facilitate reasoning, because they use notations or semantics that make them ideally suited for reasoning.  LISP is one; Prolog is another.  <a href="TopsQueryLanguage.html">TopsQueryLanguage</a> isn't, because it's a highly conventional language, conceptually equivalent to innumerable others.  It has nothing to offer that isn't equivalently achieved with "mostly BASIC-like with built-in database tables" or simply "<a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> rebooted."<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               You are making up stuff. How is it "BASIC like"? You appear to be trying to boost Rel's reputation by attacking <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a>. But that can't change the fact that Rel sucks. [[I removed some of the edgier wording since. -t]]
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Is your rudeness necessary?  I'll be the first to admit, as Rel's author, that Rel sucks in innumerable ways.  However, it's a usable language and a usable DBMS.  That's infinitely better -- for pretty much any definition of "better" -- than a language that can't be used for anything.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               YOU started the rudeness, hypocrite! And there's no useful reason to keep pointing out that <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> lacks and implementation repeatedly multiple times in multiple places redundantly other than being an ass.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>In various places, you've allowed it to appear that </em><a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> is a language that can be used.  I've pointed out the fact that it cannot.  How is that rude?<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               If you can't see the rudeness above, I can't help you. Note that there's already a topic on it: <a href="ExperimentalQueryLanguageDiscussion.html">ExperimentalQueryLanguageDiscussion</a> so that we don't have to keep reinventing this argument. This should be moved there perhaps. Maybe you can then also flesh out your vague notions of what's a "modeling language" and what isn't.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>I re-read the above exchange and I see no rudeness on my part.  I've been, at worst, direct and truthful.  Factual technical truth is never rude.  Calling someone an "ass", however, most certainly is.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               "Facts" my ass! There's like four lies or unproven claims in one sentence. Even if <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> was "conventional", there's no mathematical proof that "conventional" languages are worse at modeling ideas. You pulled that out of your ass to pump up Rel's reputation.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>I haven't claimed "conventional" languages are worse at modelling ideas.  What I have claimed is that using </em><a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> for modelling ideas is redundant.  As for "four lies or unproven claims", could you identify them?  As for Rel's reputation, I don't have to pump it up.  It already has an excellent reputation in the RDBMS community.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Why is it allegedly redundant to BASIC? You are contradicting yourself: it's redundant to BASIC, yet lacks an implementation?
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>As a conceptual or "thought" tool, BASIC already covers the same territory </em>'and<em>' it's executable so you can try out your thoughts.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               That's patently false! BASIC does diddly squat to address items found in <a href="HowOtherQueryLanguagesAddressSqlFlaws.html">HowOtherQueryLanguagesAddressSqlFlaws</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Indeed.  That is why I wrote "mostly BASIC-like, but with built-in database tables" above, rather than "entirely BASIC-like".</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Superficially, Rel resembles Ada. That doesn't necessarily mean it's almost the same as Ada. Your complaint is non-specific. It could be reworked into a Lisp-like syntax, but that wouldn't necessarily change its key nature.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Superficially, Rel does resemble Ada and PL/I too.  However, the resemblance is only syntactic and therefore superficial.  </em><a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a>, however, <strong>is</strong> BASIC with tables tacked on, which is nothing more than <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>.  How does it differ, semantically, from <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>?<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               That's utter bullshit! For one, there's no explicit loops and no explicit IF statements. Second, "tacking on tables" is a non-trivial endeavor if you want to do it right. The only real resemblance to <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> is that the granularity of table-oriented statements is smaller than in SQL. It's closer to <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a>, but pre-fix instead of in-fix. "Prefix <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a>" is a far more accurate description than "<a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>-like".
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Relational algebra isn't any-fix.  There are various notations for relational algebra, some of which are prefix, some postfix, and some in-fix.  What does your </em><a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> notation offer, in terms of a tool for reasoning, that the others do not?<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               See <a href="LearningWithoutImplementation.html">LearningWithoutImplementation</a>. And I meant relational algebra as "commonly represented". (I've never seen it represented with prefix notation. If you see such, I'd be interested to examine it.)
