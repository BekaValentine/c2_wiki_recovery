        Something that can kill somebody if it fails is <a href="LifeCritical.html">LifeCritical</a>.  Electrical appliances, boats, medical equipment, are all <a href="LifeCritical.html">LifeCritical</a>.  Software is rarely <a href="LifeCritical.html">LifeCritical</a>; exceptions include life-support systems, power plant software, fly-by-wire systems, and patient monitoring software.

        Although, I guess it's not part of the official definition of an Engineer, there's a definite sense that Engineers do <a href="LifeCritical.html">LifeCritical</a> stuff.  And yet if most software is <a href="MoneyCritical.html">MoneyCritical</a> rather than <a href="LifeCritical.html">LifeCritical</a>...

        As an example, I remember the LeadEngineer for the PrinceEdwardIsland bridge talking about how few people died on the project.  Note that "few" is greater than zero. --<a href="JasonYip.html">JasonYip</a>
