        Risk Swap

      <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> this page appears to be a stub, just like on Wikipedia. Please, somebody who knows what they're talking about -- flesh this thing out, willya? It's a dozen years old and has had no value added to it!

          <em>Perhaps go to work on it yourself? Do the research (call bankers/financers/investors/silent-partners on the phone) sift it all out and write it, hmmmm? The layout has been done, so just need to follow it.</em>

        Perhaps you'll take note of the request that somebody who "knows what they're talking about" make some additions? Does that not make sense? If a Wiki page about real time OSes needs updating I'd prefer that a real time engineer make the changes rather than some IT guy whose experience is limited to Cobol try to "do the research" and make those changes. Why not here?

          <em>Of course one can hope, but this is really tricky and insider type stuff.  Usually, this type of financial risk-taking-assessment is held close to the chest as it is the foundation of a business and can mean the difference between success and not.  The original author was of rare breed, and it is not likely that such information will be just handed out in the future.  What I was trying to point out (perhaps badly) was that the groundwork has been laid, so now it is easier to follow up on one's own.  The topic of this page, and the potential information that could be found, is the groundwork for a business that provides this service to clients and lenders (bringing them together in compromise and profit potential) for a substantial fee, i.e. a separate business venture all of its own.</em>

        One way to view negotiation is as a swap of risk between the parties. The bank thinks writing software is risky. The developer thinks making money is risky. They swap these risks.

        There are different forms of contract that move the risk around in different ways.
