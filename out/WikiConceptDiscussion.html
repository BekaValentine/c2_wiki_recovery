        I've noticed that most pages seem to be focussed on a single concept of some kind.  Is this actually the case?

        Why are there so many implementations of wiki and so many different formatting rules ?
        Is there a standard set of formatting rules ?

          Since Wiki, in it's essence, got a lot to do with freedom to create, not only the work on any given wiki is rather informal, also the development of <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>s is also very 'free' in several meanings of the word. So any standard can exist only within the scope of a given <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>. See <a href="http://wikiindex.org/WikiEngineTree">http://wikiindex.org/WikiEngineTree</a> for an overview. -MH

        Most wiki powered sites usualy have somewhat formating rules but not all of them. Take for example The (wiki concept project). On there wiki you can create a listing or article with any formating you like. If the formating you put on does not work it become text and will not show. You can see this for yourself --<a href="ChrisMcClenaghan.html">ChrisMcClenaghan</a>

          What is the 'wiki concept project'? -MH

        I am relating this to an educational discussion about <a href="ThresholdConcept.html">ThresholdConcept</a>, which is the idea that there are certain key things that have to be grasped in the course of learning about something. The literature contains a lot of papers by people enthusiastic about this and others who are sceptical because it turns out to be difficult to pin down what the <a href="ThresholdConcept.html">ThresholdConcept</a>s are in any particular case. I think that could be an issue with the <a href="WikiConcept.html">WikiConcept</a>. It may be different for different people and actually evolve with time or with particular uses. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
