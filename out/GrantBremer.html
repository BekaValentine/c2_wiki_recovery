        The main point now is that -- I'm here, I'm fumbling around, and I'm seeing what's what.

        And I've installed my own Wiki at home!  Good stuff!

        <em>Welcome to Wiki, would you mind telling us alittle more about yourself?</em>

        Curiously, I was just on my way beck here to say just that.  I'm a programmer in NYC, and I've been working a lot with Python stuff for home projects, and Java stuff for money-earning projects.  I ended up trying Wiki at first at work to keep track of notes and information about projects instead of letting stuff archive in the email system.  I chose TWiki since it was labelled as a more 'corporate' Wiki.  I also installed it at home to play with.  When I upgraded my Redhat systems at home, TWiki broke due to the upgraded Perl rpm, and since I didn't have much invested yet in the TWiki instances, was learning Python, and didn't want to get into the Perl, I installed for <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a>.  So now TWiki is running in read-only mode, and <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> is the active repository.  So far, I've been happy with <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> -- it's giving me everything I need at home and at work.
