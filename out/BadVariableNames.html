        Bad Variable Names
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Alex...and I use bad variable names.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[crowd:] Hi, Alex.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in the day, while fresh out of college and wet behind the ears in the programming world, I used to name some variables very badly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The worst of which was my counter variable names. I now use i, j, k, and so on for local counts and things like activeRowCount for the more descriptive names. Before, in the early years mind you, it shames me to say, I would name my counters things like Dracula, Chocula, MonteChristo. They are all counts after all. I apologize for my intial variable naming conventions and shall go beat my face now as punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- Alex
      </p>
      <code>
        typedef int count;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Don't use i, j, and k for iterators! Use ii, jj, kk. Convention is still honored, yet searchability is increased by a million percent. The vars i, j, and k are </em><a href="BadVariableNames.html">BadVariableNames</a> too!<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Why would you ever search for an iterator like i, j or k? If you might ever need to search for a variable then give it a unique name.]
      </p>
      <p>
        If your tools cannot search for single character variables, the problem is with your tools, not with the millions of lines of code and the thousands of programmers that have had no such problem. -- <a href="AdamBerger.html">AdamBerger</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, if you have to search for an iterator, you have bigger problems. The scope of such an iterator should be only a few lines anyway. -- <a href="DougKing.html">DougKing</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Um, that's the point of this pattern! Many times, programmers have to work under less than ideal situations. Sometimes nice developtment tools simply aren't available. On other occasions, old extremely simple or poorly designed programs have to be maintained or extended. The pattern, which I recommended, has a low cost, yet provides a useful safety net for future development. I'm also not the first to use this convention; I learned it from...</em>

      </p>
      <p>
        None of that makes it a better pattern. The item about the scope being a few lines still applies. Any decent computer has vi: /\<i\> (notepad can search for whole words only too) or some similarly powerful editor.
      </p>

        'I recall a programmer who used to work for me who named variables "pig", "cow", "dog" ...'
        Some of the worst I've seen are using the lowercase "ell" and uppercase "oh" as variables:

        l = l + 1;<br/>
        This = That + O;<br/>

        A <a href="PetPeeve.html">PetPeeve</a> of mine was someone I worked with who liked to name miscellaneous C character arrays "mystring".
        Was he afraid that someone else would come along and misuse his variable?
        (I think that misuse is much less likely if you give them a clue as to what the variable's *FOR*!)

      </p>
      <p>
        A good variable name should indicate its use, like "ErrorMessage" or "InputBuffer".
        And if it has several different uses, you should probably split it up into several different variables.

        I am working on a project right now, where I have taken over someone else's Java code. It often goes something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        public class Foo {<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        private String myString;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public Foo(String theString) {<br/>
        myString = theString;<br/>

        int aPos2;<br/>

        I am a newcomer to Smalltalk, and I have come across the 'a' prefix as a standard idiom, to mean an instance of a class of objects.  I have not see 'the' or 'my' and I don't think they would be meaningful: instance variable names begin  in lowercase, and class variable names in upper case letter: so Smalltalkers don't seem to see the need to confuse things further with 'the' and 'my'.

        At a past company, the coding standards forbid using <a href="MagicNumber.html">MagicNumber</a>s.

I ended up defining FOUR = 4, etc., since I didn't have the time to enter meaningful names.

        Maybe it was a descendent of an old UNIVAC program or by an old UNIVAC programmer? Twenty eight was the number of words per sector in old UNIVAC disk hardware and it lives on to this day.

        (new speaker here) I actually did something very similar a year ago, to circumvent what seems to be a bug in the Microsoft C 5.1 compiler. While porting some code implementing the AdvancedEncryptionStandard algorithm to a legacy DOS environment (!) I found the compiler choking on shifting certain values 8 bits to the right. <em>But only when the literal digit 8 was used.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So I globally replaced
      </p>
      <code>
        >> 8<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        with
      </p>
      <code>
        >> EIGHT<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and put
      </p>
      <code>
        const int EIGHT = 8;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        at the top of the program. It worked great. Passed all unit tests. For some reason I don't think Microsoft will fix this particular bug, if indeed it is one.

        Weird as it might seem, it is not uncommon in Fortran to define constants like
        one for 1.0d0 and zero for 0.0d0. I thought it was insane at first, but after I got burned by very subtle type errors a few times, I started doing it myself. Have mercy, I only do it in Fortran.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess the real solution is to never program in Fortran, and to not release old Fortran programmers into the world. ;-) -- Mike Gertz
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some people started programming a long time ago when FORTRAN was most of what there was. Some of us have adapted and do different things as well now. -- </em><a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think you are solving the wrong problem. You should define constants with names describing their purposes not their values. You need to define constants like "NumberOfFingersOnAHand" not "Five".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Let's not confuse fingers with digits. The human hand normally has five digits, only four of which are fingers, and one digit being the thumb. "</em>NumberOfDigitsOnAHand" should be "five", "NumberOfFingersOnAHand should be "four"<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Let's also not forget polydactylism (or hermaphrodism)... The human body isn't really reliable enough to consign to constants.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There's a reason for that. Old FORTRAN compilers would use one memory location for each instance of a constant in the source file. That is, if the number 0.0d0 appeared twenty times in a program, it would appear twenty times in the compiled code. Add to that the low memory available to early FORTRAN programs, and you see why a declaration like DOUBLE PRECISION DZERO/0.0d0/ would be useful. And, of course, the older programmers teach the newer programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Memory storage really was small, bulky and expensive by modern standards thirty years ago. I have a section of memory assembly 4K x 16 bit from a Honeywell 316 which is about the size of 2 Zip disks (holding 500 MBytes)!. Also the 0.0d0 was needed as otherwise the double precision variable was initialized with single precision zero and the rest nonzero rubbish. This could easily cause errors later. -- </em><a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a><em></em>

        A similar trick was used often in <a href="AtariBasic.html">AtariBasic</a>, in which you would see the first line of a program looking like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           N0=0:N1=1:N2=2:N3=3:N16=16:N100=100:N53248=53248
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The reason was that Atari BASIC would store every constant in a program as a float, which took about six bytes, even if the number was a really small integer. On the other hand, variable references used only one or two bytes. So large programs with big memory requirements would save memory with this trick. -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This trick was also used in Sinclair Basic on the Sinclair ZX81 (which was known as the Timex 1000 in some parts of the world). Because the machine only had 1Kb of memory as standard, it was common for the first two lines of any program to be:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           LET O=PI-PI
        </li>
        <li>
           LET I=PI/PI
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Floating point numbers were stored as five bytes, so this trick saved four bytes each time O or I was used. Also, the symbol PI only took up one byte (Sinclair BASIC was tokenized), so using PI-PI or PI/PI saved two more bytes in the initialization. -- SpencerCollyer

        It could have been worse. Imagine if it was:
      </p>
      <code>
        #define ONE 0<br/>
        #define ZERO 1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>There is a product out there that defines ONE as 0, and TWO as 1 to provide handy constants for a function taking an integer parameter</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked once on a program that had a section of code sort of like this (my C is a bit rusty, so forgive any errors...)
      </p>
      <code>
        #if FALSE<br/>
        ... some code.<br/>
        #end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When debugging a section of code, I introduced a change that would break the "some code" bit, which I didn't care about because I was going to remove it shortly. Imagine my surprise when the "some code" bit failed to compile. It turned out that, about 2000 lines above this particular code snippet, somebody had done the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        #define FALSE TRUE<br/>

        There's a corporate database with a table that has two columns: KEY and VALUE
        <em>Not too bad, at least it can be a perfectly normalized relational table; and the names might make sense, e.g. arbitrary key and current value of securities. It could be a whole database stored as triples in a single table with three columns A, B and C.</em>

        It works, but when I double-checked the numbers, I was surprised to find that they assumed
        <strong>366 <em>MONTHS</em> in a year!</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           seconds/month = 31 days/month * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute
        </li>
        <li>
           "seconds/year" = 366 months/year * 2678400 seconds/month
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I can live with 31 days per month -- a reasonable compromise to compute a value used for sorting.
        But 366 months per year??? That's just an error - they clearly meant to do 366 days per year, but didn't get the numbers right.
      </p>
      <p>
        A set of constants like this would have helped:

        const MinutesPerHour = 60;<br/>
        const SecondsPerHour = SecondsPerMinute * MinutesPerHour;<br/>
        <em>...and so on, say with...</em><br/>

        I also had a discussion with a colleague who objected to using <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> as indexes in loops etc. He preferred <em>US</em> for <em>universal subscript</em>. Otherwise he was a wise programmer. We were both working on the same program - in COBOL - and so I went along with US, US2, and so on.

        Using obfuscated and / or arbitrary variable names like this is bad for code that is supposed to be useful, but I found it very liberating when learning to code that I could throw the names in without having to bother what each variable is used for. It increases your programmer capability. :)

        A program I once worked on had two modes of operation for one algorithm - either it was "FooClipping", or it wasn't. So there was a global, called
        isFooClipping. If you were not FooClipping, one array needed to be one element longer. The allocation of said array ended up like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        array = AllocateMemory(baseSize + isFooClipping)
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone has "saved" code and time by reversing the sense of the global. So now we had a isFooClipping variable that's was TRUE (1) if you were <strong>not</strong> FooClipping!

        <em>If and only if this is the least arcane solution, I routinely normalize integers in C (or even C++) as Boolean values (0 or 1) and use the Boolean value inside an integer expression. The correct way to do this is with the double-bang notation. For example, !!foo will normalize foo from 0 to 0 or non-zero to 1. Then I could use foo like "length = bar * !!foo;"--although "length = foo ? bar : 0;" is obviously clearer in this case. In the case of isFooClipping, a single bang would have been sufficient to invert and normalize the integral value. -- </em><a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a><em></em>

        I have been writing some <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> programs for calculating sumo statistics.
        There just aren't useful English words for banzuke, sanyaku, heya, etc., but a sumo fan reading the code will know exactly what I mean.
        I think mixed languages are perfectly accessible in context.
        (For the record, a banzuke is a listing of ranks for wrestlers in a particular tournament, sanyaku translates as "three higher ranks" but means either the four highest ranks or the third and fourth highest ranks, and heya is usually translated as "stable" - it's essentially a wrestling club.) -- <a href="JohnFarrell.html">JohnFarrell</a>

        John, this isn't so much a case of using mixed languages, as using the domain language (in this case, sumo jargon) for variables. It's just a coincidence that the domain language consists of words from another natural language. -- <a href="RobertWatkins.html">RobertWatkins</a>

        Various languages are often mixed with English in European (Italian, German, Russian, Czech, Finnish...) code: typically there are technical words in English and domain words in local languages, and both categories are very difficult to eradicate completely. Many teams also contain a mix of developers who want to use English, developers who try to use English but make horrible mistakes, developers who don't care and developers who take pride in inventing convoluted or fuzzy neologisms in their national language. -- <a href="LorenzoGatti.html">LorenzoGatti</a>

        In a past company, I encountered all three of the following:

        <li>
           A co-worker in the research and development group who named variables after the Marx brothers (Groucho, Chico, Zeppo, and Harpo. I don't think I ever saw Karl though). <em>Do you mean Harpo?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

           A software team leader trying to explain to management why he only realized that a team member had been commenting their code in an Eastern European language <em>after</em> that developer resigned. This supposedly was a MIL-STD-498 project with detailed code reviews...

      </ul>

        <li>
           An autopilot written in <a href="FixedPrecisionInteger.html">FixedPrecisionInteger</a>, in which constants like THREE_DEGREES, FIVE_DEGREES were defined. But, if you did the math, the relationship between FIVE_DEGREES and BITS_PER_DEGREE actually came out to 4.5 degrees or so. The justification was that initial flight tests showed that the ailerons were more effective than originally predicted, and so they had bumped down the values for various control surface settings empirically. Caused me a day's confusion when I first tried to use these "constants" in the navigation module. :-(
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>[So the constants would have been...]</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        BITS_PER_DEGREE = 72;<br/>
        FIVE_DEGREES = 325;	/* (in BITS_PER_DEGREE) */<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>And a little work with a calculator tells you that "FIVE_DEGREES" is really 4.513888... degrees.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[I guessed at the value for FIVE_DEGREES, from the text above. Please correct if I'm off. -- </em><a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>]<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If only it were so simple. I believe the conversion factor was 57.12-something-something bits per degree, for reasons that predated my time on the project and which now escape me.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In this context, the magic number 57.xxx leaps out; conversion from radians to degrees: 360/(2*3.14159265) = 57.2958...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So, the code would have read
      </p>
      <code>
        FIVE_DEGREES .EQU 0101H<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conversion factors themselves never actually appeared in the code. They were written down in a several-year-old memo in a dusty <a href="ThreeRingBinder.html">ThreeRingBinder</a> on the lead engineers' shelf. There was no point putting them in code - the 8088 assembler on the HP64000 development station had no preprocessing capabilities beyond simple (textual) macro substitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why weren't the constants commented then? Well, the HP64000 assembler had problems dealing with input files larger than ??? bytes in size, and we were always close to those limits. Development environment limitations were just some of the many areas in which we pushed the limitations of the technology used on that project.

        No variables, but bad class names. In java, instead of using packages to partition code, the programmer used very long but abbreviated class names all in the same package, and failed to differentiate functionality. SelfSubAdmTermUser, SelfSubAdmRevokeUser, SelfSubAdmAddRole, and a dozen others, all in the SelfSubAdm package. There was also a SelfSub package. I refactored into packages and renamed the classes to remove the leading SelfSubAdm prefix and give them shorter but more meaningful names.

        When I started working at my present company in April 2000, one of my first tasks was to take over the maintenance of an ancient Java applet that performed financial calculations, updating a pie graph and other goodies in response to user input. The applet consisted in principle of two classes, one of which painted the GUI, the other performed the financial calculations. The painting class had countless instance variables with names like x13, x37, y4, y15. The various components of the applet were positioned according to these variables, the values of which were constantly changing. It took me hours to figure out which variables were connected to which components. Making it worse was the fact that some of the variables weren't ever used!

        On a related note, I recently had to fix some bugs in some legacy Java code that was notorious for scattered and interconnected sections of code that were never used. It was the definition of <a href="SpaghettiCode.html">SpaghettiCode</a>. There was no way I would have been able to make the fixes without first wasting a lot of time trying to understand the code. I used a my favourite Java IDE (in my case <a href="IntellijIdea.html">IntellijIdea</a>) which was great at finding unused methods and variables, as well as doing automated refactorings (such as changing bad names and removing unused parameters from method signatures). What a life-saver. It only took a couple of days to clean up the code and then making the fixes was pretty straightforward.

        At another company I worked for, one of the previous employees had a habit of naming his nouns after places and people. So you'd have variables like texas, newyork, ... Then he'd name the method names stuff like "sucks" so the code would read "texas.sucks()"

        On the other hand, things can go to far....
        The system headers for VxworksOs contain (or contained; maybe newer versions of vxWorks have fixed the following bit of BrainDeath) the following macro definitions for boolean values (this is C code):
      </p>
      <code>
        #define TRUE 1<br/>
        #define FALSE 0<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Nothing unusual or nasty about that. However, when our application #included another header, which did the following (which is less acceptable; it was from a locally-developed <a href="PinkyAndTheBrain.html">PinkyAndTheBrain</a> library):
      </p>
      <code>
        typedef int Bool;<br/>
        #ifdef FALSE<br/>
        # undef FALSE<br/>
        #endif<br/>
        #define FALSE ((Bool)0)<br/>
        #ifdef TRUE<br/>
        # undef TRUE<br/>
        #endif<br/>
        #define TRUE ((Bool)(!FALSE))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or something like that. When we built our app, though, all hell broke loose. As it turned out, not because any incompatibility between the two definitions of TRUE and FALSE, which happened to be true (!0 is equal to 1 in our environment, though C doesn't guarantee that in general). The same header files from <a href="WindRiverSystems.html">WindRiverSystems</a> also featured this nonsense, to conditionally include/exclude code. 
      </p>
      <code>
        #if FALSE<br/>
        /* excluded code */<br/>
        #endif<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        With FALSE redefined to be the text "((Bool)0)", this caused the preprocessor to puke.

        The lessons learned:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Beware polluting the global namespace, especially in languages like <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> which don't have hierarchical namespaces as part of the language. A good rule of thumb is that only the application/framework should do so (in C/C++ parlance, that library/module which contains main).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you must redefine TRUE and FALSE, go ahead. However, don't do #if TRUE and #if FALSE. #if 1 and #if 0 suffice, are just as clear, are common <a href="CeeIdioms.html">CeeIdioms</a>, and aren't subject to having 0 and 1 redefined. (Well, you could do #define 0 and #define 1, but we won't go there...)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unless you are writing <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a> system header files (a thankless chore) or need to interface to poorly-written C/C++ header files, avoid #undef. It all by itself is a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>.

        I currently maintain and develop extensions to legacy shell and perl scripts. Part of the current infrastructure is a "template" program used to generate SQL which has the following lovely features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All template variables are named with two digit numbers
        </li>
        <li>
           Information is passed to the template (partially parsed as a perl script) by the <em>numbered argument variables passed o to the template interpreter perl script</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           The templating process is represented in myriad shell scripts with the following korn shell method
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        # Run a file through ProcessTemplateNew.pl<br/>
        # Requires at least 2 arguments: template_file query_file [[arg3] [arg4] [arg5] [arg6] [arg7] [arg8] [arg9]]<br/>
