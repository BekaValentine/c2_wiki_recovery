        This page seems heavy on attitude and light on information. I understand the attitude on this page - I HaveThisAttitude (see <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        I never heard of <a href="CodeAndFix.html">CodeAndFix</a> before - I heard of <a href="CodeAndTest.html">CodeAndTest</a>, which makes a bit more sense. After all, fixing is coding. <a href="CodeAndFix.html">CodeAndFix</a> is indeed one of the <a href="LightweightMethodologies.html">LightweightMethodologies</a>! It's so light that the entire method fits into its name.

        How can we discuss the goodness or badness of something like this without some reference to the context in which it is used?  <a href="CodeAndTest.html">CodeAndTest</a> works well for most beginners crafting a small system for their own personal use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the stuff in the right hand column far above has nothing to do with the development kernel consisting only of coding and testing. It has to do with unhelpful attitudes. Is there some value in keeping the two separate, I wonder? To what extend does an unhelpful attitude push developers to eschew practices that are neither coding nor testing?
      </p>
      <p>
        When <a href="CodeAndTest.html">CodeAndTest</a> fails of its own accord (not just because it happens to be the method of choice of developers with bad attitude), why does it fail? -- <a href="WaldenMathews.html">WaldenMathews</a>

        <em>This page follows the </em><a href="CodeAndFix.html">CodeAndFix</a> definition from the book <a href="RapidDevelopment.html">RapidDevelopment</a>. It is simply the easiest, most neophytic "process" there is: No Process.<em></em>

        <a href="CodeAndFix.html">CodeAndFix</a> sounds like a term that was made up by a marketing person, perhaps one that was selling tools for <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>, who wanted something that every customer could recognize in themselves and also feel guilty about.

        <a href="CodeAndFix.html">CodeAndFix</a> is not a methodology that might someday make sense. It is defined (per <em></em><a href="RapidDevelopment.html">RapidDevelopment</a><em>) as the most primitive and least productive methodology possible. Therefore anything you, an engineer who knows how not to f</em>***<em> up projects, can think to do will make sense, and won't be </em><a href="CodeAndFix.html">CodeAndFix</a>. I really doubt you'd abandon <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, <a href="FrequentReleases.html">FrequentReleases</a> or <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> just because of the language or time frame involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, you should hope that your 1-week of effort might someday be reused or extended or versioned, in which case you'd want it to be presentable, right?

        About <a href="AspUnit.html">AspUnit</a>, following the rule "don't test getters and setters", I disregard testing the outermost "skin". I push all the biz logic up into a <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a><em>*</em> file, and then I include that into both the skin.asp file and the test.asp file. The latter just calls all the functions and streams each test's title out into the page. Come to think of it, the project I have in mind lasted about a week ;-)
