        The Kowmungers Werea

        The Kowmungers were a hideous people who had the head of a cow, the feet of a cow, and the body of a horse.  They breathed fire, and terrorized the good citizens of the wiki.

      <p>
        At first, their terror was no more than postings onto Wiki; nothing more than pixels. Alarming, terrifying, frightening pixels, nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, in the middle of a particularly dark winter, they managed to hack the Wiki server undetected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their trump card was to patch the system so that the wiki content was tailored to the individual reader.

        What fun they had! The put words in the mouths of others; they got people sacked; they broke up projects. They sprinked bugs throughout code snippets - not in the project code, but throughout the test suites. That just about brought the whole XP movement to its knees for a while.

        In deep secret, the Kowmungers developed a secret weapon that would, at last, destroy the place called Wiki. First they used subliminal Wiki pages to steer the discussion away from XP and towards <a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a>. Next, they hired a couple of undercover agents, the dreaded <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a>, who came from far away lands where people speak in strange tongues. Pretending to oppose <a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a>, they blinded the enemies of the Kowmungers and succeeded to seed quarrels and mistrust between the members of the Wiki community.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, with the Wiki community divided, they decided it was time their secret weapon saw the light...
