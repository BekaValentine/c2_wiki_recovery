        New Considered Harmful
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page posits that the primitive <strong>"new"</strong> operator common to many <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> languages be <a href="ConsideredHarmful.html">ConsideredHarmful</a>. This is not a suggestion that <strong>"new"</strong> be eliminated, but rather that it be replaced by other primitives. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The evidence stacked against <strong>"new"</strong> is not insignificant. There exists a plethora of <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> aimed to achieve flexibility, <a href="ConfigurableModularity.html">ConfigurableModularity</a>, extensibility at the time of 'setup' for an object graph. These include <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> with <a href="PluginArchitecture.html">PluginArchitecture</a>, <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a>, <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>, <a href="ConstructorInjection.html">ConstructorInjection</a>, <a href="SetterInjection.html">SetterInjection</a>, <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> each suggest that something different is needed when it comes to <a href="PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition.html">PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition</a> for <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> languages. Additionally, there are other 'setup' time concerns related to distribution, privacy or secrecy, persistence, redundancy, memory management, and so on, complete with its own gamut of <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> (<a href="ContainerManagedPersistence.html">ContainerManagedPersistence</a>, <a href="SmartPointer.html">SmartPointer</a>, etc.). The collision of setup-time concerns between configuration and object management can, without extreme care, easily result in <a href="BigBallOfMud.html">BigBallOfMud</a> frameworks (a problem exacerbated further by Static <a href="ManifestTyping.html">ManifestTyping</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        I can only suggest that the setup-time decisions and <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> introduce a rather strong <a href="MissingFeatureSmell.html">MissingFeatureSmell</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us consider a typical implementation of <strong>"new"</strong>. The basic responsibilities for this primitive are: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Return an object name.
        </li>
        <li>
           Create a new object.
        </li>
        <li>
           Obtain memory from the memory system.
        </li>
        <li>
           Call a 'constructor' method.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Further, it inherits properties from the above that may be cause for concern:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The memory system is often fixed. If so, <strong>new</strong> inherits from the memory system its specialized properties for physical location, persistence, redundancy, trust, and memory-management responsibility. Memory-management and persistence are especially common concerns, whereas the others are more specialized to <a href="DistributedSystem.html">DistributedSystem</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>
           The 'constructor' often has side-effects. If this is allowed then the language's <strong>new</strong> further introduces synchronization and order-of-construction concerns in addition to idempotence issues when restoring objects from a persistent state
        </li>
        <li>
           The 'constructor' is often fixed. If so, <strong>new</strong> specializes the code in which it is described for a particular behavior definition. <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> or <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> can work around this.
        </li>
        <li>
           The 'constructor' often contains other constructors internally (sometimes implicitly, when dealing with member attributes). If so, then constructors <em>may</em> become specialized to an object's position in the overall object-graph. <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> is aimed to work around this.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A valid question is: <strong>Which is the greater responsibility of "new"? to create a new object? or to return an object name?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To answer <strong>"creating a new object"</strong> is to ignore the prevalence of the <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> and of data-driven access to abstractions of external systems (cameras, printers, clocks, random-number-generators). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus I posit that the answer is <strong>"to return an object name"</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, if so, I would posit that we really ought to have a primitive named something other than <strong>"new"</strong>.  I.e. <a href="NewConsideredHarmful.html">NewConsideredHarmful</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There are alternatives to <strong>"new"</strong>, especially based around the <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> and possibly the <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> construction of 'object configurations'. My own stab at doing so introduces a primitive named <strong>"construct"</strong> which applies to an object-configuration introduced by <strong>"configure"</strong> (with configurations in turn composed by <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>). A fairly trivial configuration would be to create an object-configuration consisting of a name for exactly one object - which already exists. Constructing that configuration would return the name for the existing object. Trivial? Yes. But it does illustrate the distinction between <strong>"construct"</strong> on a <strong><em>configuration vs. </em>'"new"</strong> on a <strong><em>class</em></strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under-the-hood, my language also supports <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> <a href="PluginArchitecture.html">PluginArchitecture</a> for <a href="DistributedSystem.html">DistributedSystem</a>s (described in the <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> page), which essentially operates as something of a distributed, persistent version of a <a href="ForeignFunctionInterface.html">ForeignFunctionInterface</a>. However, this is not available from the general language without explicit injection of an object that grants access to the <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> and so is subject to the <a href="ObjectCapabilityModel.html">ObjectCapabilityModel</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on my (rather <a href="DistributedSystem.html">DistributedSystem</a>s-biased) experience, I submit the following suggestions and reasoning towards designs that replace <strong>"new"</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Support something like data-driven <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a>s to alleviate the various problems associated with concrete constructors and data-driven design, <strong>BUT</strong> also ensure that every such <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> may <em>transparently</em> take as input simple references to an existing object which it shall return either intact or wrapped in some trivial fashion (e.g. to intercept messages for logging). This allows 'object graphs' to (without any special attention in user-code) be described by equal parts new and old objects. In turn, this allows new object-graphs to hook easily into existing systems.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Perhaps make this a constructor for object-graphs rather than individual objects. Doing so would imply <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> support for both object configuration and <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>, which is an important (and oft missing) <a href="PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition.html">PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition</a> feature for <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>. It would also allow a great many optimizations (block allocation, automatic distribution of whole cliques, dead-object elimination, inlining object behaviors for small objects, etc.). Further, it would allow greater <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> between object vocabulary and the configuration contexts in which objects appear.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Be rid of constructors and destructors, or more accurately be rid of side-effects other than consumption of resources. This is necessary to avoid side-effects for each persistence, duplication, and mobility operation. It also ensures that lazy construction, distribution, duplication, and persistence have an identical behavior profile to the abstraction of GodRAM - keeping all objects in-memory all the time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> between naming objects and allocating them: use <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> references that are not associated with memory-addresses in RAM. This, in combination with being rid of side-effects for constructors and destructors, eliminates remaining concerns for order-of-construction when working with object-graphs. It supports lazy allocation, lazy distribution, and allows runtime migration of objects (as opposed to the weaker one-time automatic distribution). Also allows the possibility of automatic duplication-for-redundancy such that other systems might be able to regenerate some objects should their original locations fail - a stunt that is difficult to pull when naming is tightly correlated to a memory address. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Distinguish <em>synchronous or stateful</em> objects from <em>asynchronous and stateless</em> 'ambients' or behaviors. This allows the ambients to be both 'merged' within machines (to conserve resources within a runtime) and duplicated between machines (to offer better latency and more robust service in the face of disruption). Even when not using <a href="DistributedSystem.html">DistributedSystem</a>s, the former ability to 'merge' identical objects should help with resource management. (Related: <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a>, section on <a href="PluginArchitecture.html">PluginArchitecture</a> for <a href="DistributedSystem.html">DistributedSystem</a>s.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               In addition to the above, the <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> page suggests that some plugin-driven objects may be operating as abstract subscriptions to ambient event-sources outside the object framework, such as the current time (update every second or minute), or the RSS feed from your favorite webpage, or an external <a href="PublishSubscribeModel.html">PublishSubscribeModel</a> service. To support this, one might further distinguish such event-sources from objects for purpose of deciding lazy vs. eager regeneration.
