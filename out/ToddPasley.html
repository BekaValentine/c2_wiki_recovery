        This is the wiki page for Todd Pasley.

      <p>
        Todd is a <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> student at Griffith University, Nathan Campus - Brisbane Australia (<a href="http://www.gu.edu.au)">http://www.gu.edu.au)</a> and currently works as a Software Tester/Developer for a Software Verification and Validation consultancy company called K. J. Ross & Associates (<a href="http://www.kjross.com.au).">http://www.kjross.com.au).</a> My primary task these days is the development of a testing tool named SMART Cat (Continuous Application Testing) which can be found at <a href="http://www.smartlabs.com.au/smartcat/.">http://www.smartlabs.com.au/smartcat/.</a>

        Currently I am working on my thesis. Basically, it plays on the <a href="TooMuchDocumentation.html">TooMuchDocumentation</a> mentality of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> demonstrated by <a href="XpAndDocuments.html">XpAndDocuments</a> and how some individual data collections (practices of <a href="PersonalSoftwareProcess.html">PersonalSoftwareProcess</a>) maybe be deemed as inclusive in 'Just Enough Documentation' if it can be found to better achieve the GoalsOfExtremeProgramming.

        There are a number of interesting pages within wiki that I have found to be relevant and although I'm not sure that wiki could be counted on as a reliable source of information as far as dissertations go (being that most sources should be independently validated etc.) it has given me a large number of ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will probably add some additional links to anything I find that may be interesting to others... we'll see how it goes.

        until then,
