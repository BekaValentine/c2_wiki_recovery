        One of my various dubious claims to fame is that at school I was in the set for people who were very good at French. (Had I been in the set for people who were not quite so good at French, my teacher would have been the authoress of the recent hit novel "Chocolat", which was recently turned into a film you may have seen.)
      </p>
      <p>
        These days my French is confined to foul imprecations muttered at the computer, as that is all I remember.

        I am a computer programmer by day, writing computer games. (One at a time.)

        By night I am usually asleep.

        I recently (Nov 2002) met another Tom Seddon. It unusual enough for me to meet another Tom, let alone another Seddon, but both at once... that's quite unusual. This prompted a Google search for others. Here is a small sample of who I'm not:
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not Tom "The Brander" Seddon of Eurohtec.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not the Tom Seddon who had something to do with organising Sydney's Gay Games bid.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not the Tom Seddon who organises 18+ holidays to Mediterranean countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not Tom Seddon, senior vice president of Strategic Services for Six Continents Hotels Ltd.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not Tom Seddon, son Richard John Seddon -- the former prime minister of New Zealand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not the Tom Seddon who wrote "Atom Bomb" (ISBN 0-7167-6582-9).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are others I'm not, but that will do for now. Consider this a work in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        I _am_ the Tom Seddon who wrote a BBC Micro emulator.
