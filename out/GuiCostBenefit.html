        Gui Cost Benefit
      </h1>
      <p>
        Has any one had the experience of porting a trusted character based DOS or Curses application to a graphical user interface, only to have the GuiDesign costs skyrocket out of control?
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing functioned fine in its original form. It just reached the end (or perceived end) of its platform's lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The switch from character based UI to graphical UI became a trip to the candy shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can we do this? Sure.
        And this? Sure.
        How about this? Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later... 
        How come our 500K project is now going to cost 2.5 million?
      </p>
      <p>
        Please. This is not about project management. This is about the ungodly cost of UI once the word "Design" enters the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Food for thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        If all that matters is functionality, then why not provide a Character based UI? 
      </p>

        Think of the simplicity it brings? -- <a href="JimBrosnan.html">JimBrosnan</a>
