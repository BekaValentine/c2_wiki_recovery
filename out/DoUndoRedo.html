        Do Undo Redo
      </h1>
      <p>
        Code which is augmented to the point of doing nothing in its original design, but that still contains its original running code, is suffering from <a href="DoUndoRedo.html">DoUndoRedo</a>. This stems from aggressive changelist minimization, a reluctance to properly deprecate code, and a lack of courage in fully applying a refactor (or lack of tests to guarantee it). The result is a very long chain of instructions that achieve a very simple result and that resists change by virtue of being overly complicated. Systems like this also tend to be very slow - one can only hope they become slow enough that an optimization pass would eventually find them.
