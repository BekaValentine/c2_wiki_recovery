        I hope not.  But there's not much current on it.  Can someone set the record straight?

        Squeak is not dead; it is just its website that has been neglected. Here are some resources:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Squeak's own swiki at <a href="http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak">http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           The mailing lists at <a href="http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/">http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/</a> - the squeak-dev list is quite active, with 1-2000 messages per month
        </li>
        <li>
           The Squeak People site: <a href="http://people.squeakfoundation.org">http://people.squeakfoundation.org</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Many squeakers may be seen in the #squeak channel of irc.freenode.net
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also see the <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> page -- <a href="JohnPfersich.html">JohnPfersich</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        And the new squeak.org homepage at <a href="http://squeak.org">http://squeak.org</a> -- <a href="DougWay.html">DougWay</a>

        Squeak is most certainly not dead.  Its mailing list has been getting full of more and more traffic over the years, with more people coding quite a wealth of libraries and useful applications. For me, Squeak is my desktop system, and the support is certainly there when I need it- whether I'm searching the Swiki (go there first, not the squeak.org page!), talking to folks on IRC or asking on the mailing list. In a lot of ways, the Squeak community is quite a bit more supportive than the Python or Perl community- it's smaller, but it's not so unwieldy. It is usually a lot easier to get an answer, even when it's question the Python or Perl folks would just say "read the FAQ, stoopid newbie."  You even have a chance that your question will be answered by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls or another incredible visionary.

        Squeak isn't dead it's just navel-gazing.

        It must be one heavily lint-ridden navel.  I posted this page a few weeks ago; while the absence of responses doesn't necessarily mean much, I find the lack of Squeak (and/or Smalltalk) activity here and elsewhere disconcerting.

           squeak.org: the last entry on "where is squeak headed" is from 2000.  <em>Not true any longer... see the new squeak.org website at </em><a href="http://squeak.org.''">http://squeak.org.''</a>

           CREATE Squeak Smalltalk (<a href="http://www.create.ucsb.edu/squeak/)">http://www.create.ucsb.edu/squeak/)</a> page: "stale or obsolete".  Points to squeak.org.

           link to Squeak Quick Reference at smalltalk.org, marked "New", is dead

           seems to be no squeak info at UIUC pages

        Does anyone have a positive Squeak of the Union address they can provide?

        <em>I'm not a Squeaker, but in the last two years I've heard a fair number of people in the real world (i.e. not online) talking about it. I would think it's just another small niche, where people are active, but not necessarily talking about what they're doing as much as you would think. I thought Forth was dead, until last year, and it turns out I was quite wrong; it's just...niche. But thriving in that niche.</em>
