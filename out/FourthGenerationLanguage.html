        Fourth Generation Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Marketing-speak for a procedural programming language with some or all of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A "natural language" grammar
        </li>
        <li>
           Built-in database query language
        </li>
        <li>
           Built-in user interface language
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These features apparently put the <a href="FourthGenerationLanguage.html">FourthGenerationLanguage</a>s
        above such run-of-the-mill languages as <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a>,
        marketing-speak for which is ThirdGenerationLanguage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Natural language" grammar typically results in an enormous number of reserved words, most of which do very little.
      </p>
      <p>
        The built-in features may have merit.  However, the languages tend
        to be rather poorly designed, leaving out such things as, for
        example, an easy way to write functions.  The built-ins rarely make
        up for the lack of generality in the language designs.  They also
        lock you into a particular DBMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current trend for languages is OO, without imposing any
        particular database or UI.  With OO constructs available, you can
        build and call upon pretty much any other interface you can imagine,
        databases and UIs included.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many <a href="FourthGenerationLanguage.html">FourthGenerationLanguage</a>'s seem to be modeled after some
        long-forgotten set of the designer's toy programs.  The semantics
        of the language constructs would fit those old programs extremely
        well.  The program you or I am working on today, however, could
        be a bit of a problem.
      </p>

        I once did a one week course in a <a href="FourthGenerationLanguage.html">FourthGenerationLanguage</a> called
        Progress Version 6.  One of this languages 'niceties' was, if you
        added a name to a frame, it changed from one-record-per-page to a one-record-per-line.  A fellow student (a bit more pointy-haired
        than the rest, but anyway...) was struggling with such lameness,
        gave up on frames and resorted to coding his exercises' output in
        longhand cursor positioning and text output.  The instructor
        accused him of 3GLing.

        As far as I can see, 4GLs are just examples of <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>s. It's just that often the domain is a database with a nice GUI. Does anyone agree or disagree?

        The definition for <em>n</em>th Generation Language (where <em>n</em> seems to vary from 1-5, and might even be 0 in some cases) seems to be highly author-dependent.   (Usually, the author's favorite technology or paradigm is assigned a higher value of <em>n</em>. If I had a quarter for every such definition--well, I wouldn't be <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a>, but I might be able to get a cup of coffee at StarBucks.  --<a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>
