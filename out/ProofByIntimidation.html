        <strong>Problem:</strong> Someone's suggested that you use a technique that means surrendering some of your personal empire or hold over the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong> You have no experience in the success or otherwise of the technique. You have no interpersonal skills in order to help you discuss the topic properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Shout. A lot. Helps if you're large so put a lot of weight on. You could take up some hobby that will scare people like a martial art or gun ownership. Generally act like a schoolyard bully. After a while people will decide that not using the technique is easier than the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong> People will, after a while, learn not to suggest things in your hearing. The environment will become limited to your experience field. Newcomers will import their experience and not be able to use it and get frustrated. Eventually you'll drive away talent and you'll be king nerd.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Known uses:</strong> You've been there. You know you have.

        Personally, I find this also shows up a lot in <a href="SoftwareLabourers.html">SoftwareLabourers</a> contexts.
