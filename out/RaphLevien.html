        I'm the person behind <a href="AdvoGato.html">AdvoGato</a>, uhm <a href="http://www.advogato.org/,">http://www.advogato.org/,</a> and am a junkie for collaborative Web environments. This one looks interesting as hell! I found it from <a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a>'s page.  <em>(Hey Raph!)</em> Hi!
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AdvoGato.html">AdvoGato</a> is not my only thing, far from it. Most of my time these days is doing 2D graphics. I'm the author of the <a href="LibArt.html">LibArt</a> graphics library, do quite a bit of coding on Eazel's Nautilus. Right now, I'm implementing the PDF 1.4 blend modes into <a href="GhostScript.html">GhostScript</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm too busy with work and family right now to have much time for my hobbies, but hope that will change soon. Those include archival bookbinding, photography, sexuality, <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a>, yoga (although it's been a while since I've had a daily practice), collecting books in and about exotic alphabets, etc.

        When I came to this wiki, I thought it was basically <em>about</em> <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. Yet, in <a href="MissingWikiBeforeXp.html">MissingWikiBeforeXp</a>, I see that many hope that discussion will broaden. I am intrigued enough with Wiki to consider 'moving in'. How much interest is there in discussing some of these other topics?

        <em>Ralph, I am interested in talking with you. I am trying to write a wiki, and am weak on </em><a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s. I saw your re page, and it led me to your home page. The 'persons' link on the <a href="AdvoGato.html">AdvoGato</a> site is not working. -- <a href="KirkBailey.html">KirkBailey</a><em></em>

        Update 22 Dec 2006: Wow, this is a blast from the past. Judging from what I wrote above, it sounds like six and a half years ago. I'm still doing 2d graphics, and still interested in collaborative web environments. I've tried to stay on the wagon, but now find myself implementing something rather wiki-like for <a href="http://ghilbert.org/">http://ghilbert.org/</a> . I hope Kirk got his regex stuff working :) -- <a href="RaphLevien.html">RaphLevien</a>
