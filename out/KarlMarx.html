        <em>"Conservative historian Paul Johnson wears his ideology proudly on his sleeve in this often ruthless dissection of the thinkers and artists who (in his view) have shaped modern Western culture [...]"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are probably better sources to find out more about Marx than Johnson's character assassinations of historical intellectuals.</em>

        Why do you call Marx revolutionary?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I would understand that. But why do they call him sociologist, historian or economist?</em> [Because he was all three?]

        <a href="TheoVerelst.html">TheoVerelst</a>  I recently was at the belgium <a href="http://www.fosdem.org">http://www.fosdem.org</a> (Universitee libre de Brusselles) conference on open source software, where in Tcl/Tk developers room there was this writing on the wall next to all speakers (including me):

        <img src="http://82.168.209.239/fosdem/DSC03268b1m.jpg" /> A page by me: <a href="http://82.168.209.239/fosdem">http://82.168.209.239/fosdem</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's probably along the lines of the cult like popularity of the Maxist leftwingers for instance around the sixties and in more or less intellectual circles. 
      </p>

        I heared that Marx himself was sponsored by (real) illuminati circuits making his strugle against the establishment rather schizofrenic, but it is still valid of course to observer that certain rich people want to own the productions goods which in mass production can in the longer run produce more riches and otherwise unobtainable goods than what the rich could pay for, and give power over many areas of life away to masses of more average people.
