        Like Sunir, I'm not <a href="TestInfected.html">TestInfected</a>, though I'd like to be. My main method is <a href="TestingByPokingAround.html">TestingByPokingAround</a> as I go, and since I mostly program in Lisp and Erlang which makes it easy to interactively poke at functions as I write them. It would be nice, though, if I collected these tests instead of using them interactively and then losing them. I'm a very lazy guy (I don't just mean that in the usual "good programmer" sense) so there is no point in my trying to discipline myself to write such fine-grained tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was just thinking that what I'd really need is to be able to write something as a "unit test" just as easily as I'd write it as a throw away function. Half way through pondering how unfair it is that it's not so easy, I realised that it's trivial to extend Lisp to make it so. What I need are compile-time assertions, which run when the program is compiled/evaluated and cause a compiler error if they aren't satisfied. Suppose I'm writing a "map" function:
      </p>
      <p>
        [This is actually Scheme.]
      </p>
      <code>
        ;; Build a new list by applying `fn' to each element of `ls'<br/>
        (define (my-map fn ls)<br/>
        (if (null? ls)<br/>
        '()<br/>
        (cons (fn (car ls))<br/>
        (my-map fn (cdr ls)))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then straight after this I scribble some tests by using some example expressions and saying what values I expect from them:
      </p>
      <code>
        (unit-test (my-map length '((a) (b c) (d e f)))<br/>
        => '(1 2 3))<br/>
        (unit-test (my-map (lambda (x) (impossible)) '())<br/>
        => '())<br/>
        (unit-test (my-map even? '(1 2 3 4))<br/>
        => '(#t #t #t #t))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now when I try to compile the file, I get:
      </p>
      <code>
        #<ERROR Unit test failed: (my-map even? (quote (1 2 3 4))) => (#f #t #f #t)><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Of course my last unit test is wrong and the function is correct, because 1 and 3 are not even numbers. I revise the test to expect '(#f #t #f #t) and then it compiles smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not a very flashy setup, but perhaps this is convenient enough to get me <a href="TestInfected.html">TestInfected</a>. I'll start using it and let you know how I go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's my unit-test macro:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define-syntax unit-test<br/>
        (syntax-rules (=>)<br/>
        ((unit-test expr) ; assume we want #t if no expected value is given<br/>
        (unit-test expr => #t))<br/>
        ((unit-test expr => result)<br/>
        (unless (equal? expr result)<br/>
        (error (format #f "Unit test failed: ~A => ~A" 'expr expr))))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> version:
      </p>
      <code>
        (defmacro unit-test (expr result)<br/>
        `(unless (equal ,expr ,result)<br/>
        (error (format 'nil "Unit test failed: ~A => ~A" ',expr ,expr))))<br/>
        (defun add (x y)<br/>
        (* x y))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (unit-test (add 2 2) 4)<br/>
        (unit-test (add 3 1.5) 4.5)<br/>
        (unit-test (add -1 0.5) -0.5)<br/>
      </code>

        I'm new to LISP, and curious: since (Common) Lisp is a powerful language, is it possible to adapt the language to the practice of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing so that it fits like a glove? I would ask for two things: 1) a "test" form that defines a test-case scenario for a form, and 2) change the "defun" form so that it fails unless test-case forms exist for the form the user is trying to define, and they pass. This will be interesting to see, because before a new function is defined, a user will define the unit test for it first, a la:
      </p>
      <code>
        (defun double (x) (+ x x))<br/>
        >> double error: no test-cases found!<br/>
        (test (double 2) 4)<br/>
        (test (double 1) 2)<br/>
        (test (double 0) 0)<br/>
        (defun double (x) (* x x))<br/>
        >> double error: 3 test-cases failed!<br/>
        (defun double (x) (+ x x))<br/>
        >> double ok: 3 test-cases passed.<br/>
      </code>

        There is free code called "CLOS-UNIT" <a href="http://www.lme.die.supsi.ch/~pedrazz/clos-unit/">http://www.lme.die.supsi.ch/~pedrazz/clos-unit/</a> that is a direct mirror of JUnit.  It works much as you gentleman have suggested
        here.  I am using it and seems to work perfectly well.

        I'm using the code from Peter Seibel's Practical Common Lisp (<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)</a> chapter 9.  It's lightweight and works well.
