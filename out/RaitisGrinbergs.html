        Raitis Grinbergs

      <p>
        Raitis Grinbergs is a jack-of-all-trades developer-type. His company even decided not to give him a title.

        I am a definite newbie to <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, but that won't stop me from shooting my mouth off. Fair warning!

        I can be reached through <em>raitis@raitis.net</em>. Just don't go looking for a web site... after doing that for a living for a while, I've decided that I'm just as happy without one for the moment.
