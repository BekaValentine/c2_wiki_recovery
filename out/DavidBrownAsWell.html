        David Brown As Well
      </h1>
      <p>
        I chose <a href="DavidBrownAsWell.html">DavidBrownAsWell</a> because there was already a <a href="DavidBrown.html">DavidBrown</a>, which is not really a surprise.

        I was first exposed to Smalltalk in 1985 when a good friend made me read the Blue Book. I then found a copy of Little Smalltalk by Timothy Budd, and got it working on our school's computer (I received a BS in Computer Science from Western Washington University (<a href="http://www.wwu.edu)).">http://www.wwu.edu)).</a> I did some time at Microsoft, and then got a job that actually paid me to program in Smalltalk in 1993.

        I love Smalltalk. It's probably the most elegant language I know.

        Wow. I can't believe my page is still here!

        I've changed jobs twice since then, first to a small startup that I had a really horrible time at, and now at another startup where I get to program in Java, writing servlets, and generally get to hang out with really cool people.

        This is a fantastic resource. I hope it lasts a very long time.

        I am amused that my choice of <a href="DavidBrownAsWell.html">DavidBrownAsWell</a> has sparked some interest (not much, really) in figuring out how to deal with name collisions in Wiki. Since <a href="DavidBrown.html">DavidBrown</a> is a more common name than I would like, it is something that should be dealt with.
