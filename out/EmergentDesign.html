        This paper (<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/393/part2/cavallo.html)">http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/393/part2/cavallo.html)</a> argues that <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> doesn't work for education, either, and demonstrates an alternative by teaching technology to poor rural Thais.

        <em>Interesting paper... the "jazz" metaphor of coordinated improvisation pops up in there at one point.</em>

        <em>A long time ago I thought I had to have a good design to write good code.  So I tried to get my design perfect, before I wrote any code.  My design was always imperfect and that reflected in my code.  Now I just try to write good code, and find that it has good design.</em>

        Could this be because some are a far better coders than designers? Could it be that there are some who are far better designers than coders?  To assume that code just flows as ink does from a fountain pen is to ignore the impulses that guide the pen. Code does not flow without ideas, without prior thinking, experiences, planning and focus. In a way designing is saying "what if", whereas coding is saying "here's how".  Another way this might be said: "Desigining is an encloser, Coding is a discloser". In the spirit of this page and its title "<a href="EmergentDesign.html">EmergentDesign</a>" one also sees this dichotomy between what might be and what eventually becomes. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
