      <p>
        The Precision Architecture <a href="ReducedInstructionSetComputer.html">ReducedInstructionSetComputer</a> processor was designed by <a href="HewlettPackard.html">HewlettPackard</a> for use in their Unix-based workstations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It has 32 general purpose 32-bit registers (no windowing) and a rather complete instruction set for a RISC processor.

        <em>On the interest and performance scales what sets the </em><a href="PaRisc.html">PaRisc</a> architecture apart from the Alpha and Sparcs?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I recall, it had the distinguishing feature that C function activations did not store a frame pointer to the calling frame unless they absolutely had to.  I can't remember how it avoided storing the frame pointer, or what situations required a frame pointer to be present.  And this is probably more a feature of HP's C compiler than the chip itself.  But hey, that's about all I can remember about the PA-RISC, apart from the fact that it was faster than the SPARC but, when the Alpha was released, slower than the Alpha.
