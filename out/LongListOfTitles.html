        Long List Of Titles
      </h1>
      <p>
        While filling out an application form for a fund-raising relay race we encountered this long list of titles in the drop down box where you would normally type Mr or Ms.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://c2.com/wiki/LongListOfTitles.txt">http://c2.com/wiki/LongListOfTitles.txt</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

        My wife got a laugh out of the first choice, Admiral. Imagine an admiral signing up to race against my son and still insisting to be called Admiral.

        I got a laugh out of the compound titles, like Mr & Mrs, for an individual entry form. Look through the list and notice combinations that they omit. For example, they include Prof & Mr, Rev & Mr, but not Senator & Mr. This could be a problem should the Clintons want to apply.
