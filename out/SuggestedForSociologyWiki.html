        Suggested For Sociology Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are a number of pages that may, with <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>'s blessing, be appropriate for moving to the new <a href="SociologyWiki.html">SociologyWiki</a> in addition to the suggestions on the <a href="SociologyWikiSeedList.html">SociologyWikiSeedList</a>. In the spirit of <a href="WalledGardens.html">WalledGardens</a>, I would like to suggest a cluster (MegaCluster?) that may be appropriate, and wonder if there are other candidates. Everything is, of course, open to discussion, and depends on Ward's decision, as I've mentioned. Here they are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="RuleOfFear.html">RuleOfFear</a> / <a href="SecretPolice.html">SecretPolice</a> / UsaPatriotAct / WarOnTerrorism / DefineTerrorism / <a href="WorldTradeCenter.html">WorldTradeCenter</a> and <em>all</em> the stuff in WtcIndex (which is all entirely worthy of debate - and some heavy refactoring); that list is available through its <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is only a fraction of this cluster's actual extent. Please, nobody take action in any way before the community has had a chance to ponder the issue.
