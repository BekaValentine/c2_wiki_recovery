        Destroy Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some objects in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> provide a method called destroy(); which sometimes does the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Releases any resources held by the objects (setting member objects to null, releasing system objects not managed by the <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Performing <a href="ObjectInvalidation.html">ObjectInvalidation</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="DestroyMethod.html">DestroyMethod</a> is frequently used because the Java "finalize" is non-deterministic, and may not be called at all (see <a href="FinalizationProblem.html">FinalizationProblem</a>).  Some resources are scarce, and waiting for the garbage collector to clean stuff up might take too long.
      </p>

        <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> calls this Dispose; <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a> has language support for calling it...
