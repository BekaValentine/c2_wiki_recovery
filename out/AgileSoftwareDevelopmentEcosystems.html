        Every new paradigm needs a clear, concise, yet thorough synthesis of the ideas surrounding it, and the personalities driving it. For <a href="AgileMethodologies.html">AgileMethodologies</a>, this is it. This book is highly underrated in my opinion. If you want to understand agile software development, there's only one book you need to read. <strong>That</strong> is a major accomplishment. Kudos to <a href="JimHighsmith.html">JimHighsmith</a>.
