        Informal Code Review
      </h1>
      <p>
        A counterpart to the <a href="CodeReviewPatterns.html">CodeReviewPatterns</a> page for noting and discussing informal, rather than formal, <a href="CodeReview.html">CodeReview</a> processes and patterns.

        When <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is not possible, an <a href="InformalCodeReview.html">InformalCodeReview</a> usually is good enough. XPers may disagree with this.

        '<a href="CodeReview.html">CodeReview</a>'s are not about avoiding random defects (although it might reduce the number of random defects introduced in a project). '<a href="CodeReview.html">CodeReview</a>'s are about reducing the number of repetitive defects in a project. Once a project fixes a defect that is all over the place, the same defect can be reintroduced in another part of the project, just because people are used to code that particular way. <a href="CodingConventions.html">CodingConventions</a> and '<a href="CodeReview.html">CodeReview</a>'s are the medicine to relieve that illness.
