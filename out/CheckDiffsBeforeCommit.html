        Check Diffs Before Commit
      </h1>
      <p>
        Before committing changes to the version control system, read through a diff of what you've changed.  This helps you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Help the current codebase monotonically improve
        </li>
        <li>
           Make sure you only changed what you meant to change and didn't make any editing misteaks <em>:)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Write a good <a href="ChangeLog.html">ChangeLog</a> that describes why you changed it
        </li>
        <li>
           Throw away your changes if in hindsight they were no good or just futzing, before they get into the codebase
        </li>
        <li>
           Get into a frame of mind where you avoid gratuituous changes: every diff should have a purpose, whether it be adding functionality, documentation, or refactoring
        </li>
        <li>
           Make sure your change list has a single purpose.  If your checkin comment has multiple clauses, then you didn't commit soon enough or you should split your change list.
        </li>
        <li>
           ...and your pair make sure you did the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a> (reworked hacks, formatted consistently, commented the tricky stuff, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Ensure you haven't reverted someone else's changes (if you're in a situation where the source library can't or won't do that for you).
        </li>
      </ul>

        "futzing" = fiddling around with no real direction or outcome. -- jt
