        Artist By Proxy
      </h1>
      <p>
        Architecture is generally held to be an art, albeit a very public and physical one, that, at its best contributes wonderful buildings to our environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, unlike most of the arts, the Architect has to achieve his art not through his own hands but through the hands of others: the builder and his workmen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a process unknown to the 'Fine Arts', e.g. painting.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve the finished work in shape, material and colour the Architect has also to bring administrative, management and organisational skills not required by the traditional solo artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is nearly always, therefore, some aspect of compromise, defeat, where details, features, sometimes whole aspects of a well-designed work may have to be forgone due to financial or time pressure.
      </p>

        <em>Unknown to the "Fine Arts"? What about orchestral conductors? Or, for that matter, composers?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yep, I was waiting for that one! I guess I was thinking mainly of painting, sculpture, instrumental musicians etc., particularly since it was a minor reflection on a pianist last night that brought this thought to mind.
      </p>

        There are many forms of art that demand collaboration and the compromise that goes along with that. Movies are a prime example, where a work will be in the hands of hundreds of collaborators. Writers have to deal with editors, <em>etc</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even practitioners of the solitary arts have to compromise with their medium. Your concert pianist uses the piano as a sort of proxy, don't you think?
      </p>

           No. Does the artist use his eyes as a proxy? Plato's cave.
