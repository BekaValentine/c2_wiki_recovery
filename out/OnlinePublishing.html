        Dear Wiki Forum users, interested in realizing a <a href="WikiWayOfLife.html">WikiWayOfLife</a>,
      </p>
      <p>
        first of all my thanks to <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, who has created this wonderful 
        friendly environment, where innovative tools, ideas, people, new organizations
        have a chance to evolve. My thanks naturally extend to all the authors of
        this living document.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a great pleasure for me to learn, that this forum is already ecommerce
        enabled, and that Ward was fair enough to ask the users, if this was
        objectionable. I think, it's only a small direct material compensation, not
        proportional to his contributions to the wider community. See <a href="AmazonAssociate.html">AmazonAssociate</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I can see from a peep into the list of ISBN publications, there are
        only Offline Books (please correct me, if not). Amazon has certainly 
        Online Books too.
      </p>
      <p>
        How can <a href="OnlinePublishing.html">OnlinePublishing</a> be integrated in the Wiki Forum, such that there is a
        motivation for contributors, wishing to level up from part-time Wiki to
        full-time Wiki activities?
      </p>
      <p>
        Authors of text, multimedia and software
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           collaborate in the Wiki forum, helping each other and the forum to evolve; this is (self) help + PR in the best sense.
        </li>
        <li>
           present their work as downloads, external to this forum
        </li>
        <li>
           use some sort of online payment system 
        </li>
        <li>
           grant optionally affiliation marketing to each other, with referrer/sell links in the forum or the homepage of the referrer.
        </li>
        <li>
           make optionally donations to organizations that care for people/environment
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additions, comments, discussion welcome.
