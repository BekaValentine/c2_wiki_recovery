        Much of the power of Unix stems from its ubiquitous hierarchically structured file system. We think that a wiki would enable a much more powerful metaphor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since a full-blown <a href="WikiOs.html">WikiOs</a> is still some way in the future :-), a <a href="WikiActiveDesktop.html">WikiActiveDesktop</a> might be a feasible first step. <a href="UweFranke.html">UweFranke</a> already has a first version of this running on his notebook, a local TWiki on Windows set as the Active Desktop background. It looks pretty convenient (and cool, of course!).
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step may be integrating <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a> and <a href="MicrosoftExcel.html">MicrosoftExcel</a> documents and other content into the wiki pages, and adding some BellsAndWhistles. And after that, who knows?! Ideas welcome.

        Nice thought, having a <a href="WikiOs.html">WikiOs</a> ,-).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been tinkering with the same thought that collaborative development, documentation and discussions would greatly benefit from a <a href="WikiStyle.html">WikiStyle</a> approach.
        Yet, the requirements are immense, as we would have to redefine how applications currently work and how data is being treated in these applications. We would also have to re-invent the wheel of a document description and markup language that would suit the needs of such a collaboration tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        And not only that, all information in that kind of Wiki must be revision-controlled and version-controlled, including so-called meta data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given enough developers and afront designers and architects, I think that some kind of <a href="WikiOs.html">WikiOs</a> can actually come true.
