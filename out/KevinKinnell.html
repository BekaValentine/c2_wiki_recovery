      <p>
        is a Perl & Java programmer who is currently contracting for a company in the Pacific Northwest and full time for a company in the long State south of there, but lives miles and miles from either of those places.  His wife is a Professor of Sociology who is studying the frequent miscommunications between techno-folk and everybody else.  He is interested in the algorithms underlying social systems (if there are any) and the algorithms underlying "rational thought" (if that actually exists.)  You could say he's into the "algorithm method," if you didn't say it too loud in a public place <em>and</em> didn't ask what that leads to.

        He firmly believes that 90% of everything is noise, and if you were to remove all of the noise in Wiki, 90% of what would be left would turn out to be noise.
