        Quick Diff Broken Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> has now been broken for a number of weeks. There is a page <a href="PleaseMendQuickDiff.html">PleaseMendQuickDiff</a> which has been created to ask please for it to be restored. As far as can be sorted out by trial and error, the script which used to be <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> is either broken or missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> is a very useful tool for any <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> attempting to sort out the difference between useful edits and ones which need to be reverted quickly to keep things here on an even keel. Only someone with access to the actual wiki system is able to find out what is wrong with <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> and put it back in order.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason for this discussion is the lack of response there has been to <a href="PleaseMendQuickDiff.html">PleaseMendQuickDiff</a>. Usually things like this get fixed reasonably quickly. Is there some reason why this has not been fixed?

        <em>Have you asked </em><a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>?  These days, he appears not to monitor <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> and very rarely posts on it.  It's possible he doesn't know <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> is broken.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        An email to <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> has done the trick and <a href="QuickDiffIsMendedNow.html">QuickDiffIsMendedNow</a> - see <a href="WikiWikiSystemNotice.html">WikiWikiSystemNotice</a>
