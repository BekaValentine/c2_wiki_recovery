      <p>
        <a href="JavaEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaEnterpriseEdition</a> is a simplified name for <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a> created at JavaOne 2005. The first product release is expected in early 2006, called <a href="JavaEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaEnterpriseEdition</a> 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the technology improvements are said to be based on <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a> v3 that is in draft form in late 2005. <em>See </em>EjbThree<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It will feature increased compliance with <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> standards. Which ones and which version?

        For people interested in <a href="JavaAndDotNet.html">JavaAndDotNet</a>, it may be of interest to note that initially <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> had no support for the equivalent of "<a href="ContainerManagedPersistence.html">ContainerManagedPersistence</a>" (CMP), (as of NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 it includes the <a href="AdoNetEntityFramework.html">AdoNetEntityFramework</a>)  so applications built using that feature may not be readily ported to using <a href="EnterpriseServices.html">EnterpriseServices</a>, which is otherwise a <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> equivalent of EJB. Source: MS Doug Purdy at 2005 Java One. Looking back, I can confirm this has been a "known situation" from the early days of <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>.

      <p>
        <em>What is </em><a href="ContainerManagedPersistence.html">ContainerManagedPersistence</a> and what purpose does it serve? And is there not another way of solving problems using other EJB tools / facilities such as JavaDataObject?<em> </em><a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> please.

           Later, I found some mid 05 discussion by Application developers, and one person claimed CMP allowed for top down DB design. However my <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> and <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> experience suggests to me CMP enabling topdown design would not have been a material benefit. <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a> requested by <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>
