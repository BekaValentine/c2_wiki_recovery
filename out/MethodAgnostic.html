        Method Agnostic

      <p>
        The terminology that I use when describing someone who doesn't fall for all the religious BS involved in MethodologyFundamentalism and instead has the ability to <a href="PickTheRightToolForTheJob.html">PickTheRightToolForTheJob</a> based on the nature of the problem.

        A <a href="LanguageAgnostic.html">LanguageAgnostic</a> could be a special kind of <a href="MethodAgnostic.html">MethodAgnostic</a>.
      </p>

        No method fits every <a href="ProblemFrame.html">ProblemFrame</a>, even YourFavouriteMethod, even XP.

        I used to be Method Agnostic.  I've worked in dozens of different companies, each with their own methodology that is better than all the rest.  Until I had to work on an XP/Agile project.  Now I'm an 'AnythingButXPist'.

        Seems like a <a href="MethodAgnostic.html">MethodAgnostic</a> is a FreeThinker
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A </em><a href="MethodAgnostic.html">MethodAgnostic</a> is one of the things a FreeThinker should be (if they worked in software development). If you were convinced that the <a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a>, or <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, or <your favourite method here> fits any and all development scenarios, then you would be neither.<em></em>

        <em>This is really hard to do. As with </em>CommunicationStyles, LeadershipStyles and many other fields: we may know that there are many techniques available that are differently applicable in differing circumstances, but when in a hurry, or under stress, we all tend to revert to one style. We will attempt to communicate with others in the way that gets through to <em>us</em> best; to lead others in the way that <em>we</em> would  prefer to be led, and not to talor our actions according to the best techniques to use with the people we are trying to communicate with, or lead.<em></em>

        <em>So with method. I like formalism, having been down the maths and physics route in my earlier education. It's a real effort for me to look at the development situation in hand and throw out the upside-down A's and reversed E's in favour of CRC cards, when that is appropriate.</em> --<a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>
