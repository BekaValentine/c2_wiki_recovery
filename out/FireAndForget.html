        Used to describe an operation where, after one initiates it, it is not necessary to monitor its status or to check the final result.  It is the responsibility of some other entity to guarantee completion or to handle non-completion.  Often used in the context of <a href="MessageQueuingArchitectures.html">MessageQueuingArchitectures</a>.

        Also used by managers to describe employees who do not require much supervision. You can just tell such subordinates what you want done, and then wait for them to tell you they are finished. In contrast, some subordinates require constant monitoring to be kept on the right track.

        (The term originally referred to guided weapons systems that do not require the operator to manually guide the weapon to its target after launch.  The operator picks a target, presses the trigger, and then moves on to some other task while the weapon automatically homes in on its target.  This capability is very useful for fighter pilots and other people who have lots of important and urgent demands on their attention.)
