        Some PHBs will drive you to work for the competition. When you announce you are leaving, they might just throw a chair across their office, and emit an obscenity-laced tirade implying they are going to "bury" that competition. <em>See </em><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/05/chair_chucking/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/05/chair_chucking/</a> for the incident that inspired this paragraph.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The value of this tactic in retaining the employees needed to accomplish that "bury" <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> using clean code (instead of dirty tricks) is currently a matter of debate.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can "bury" the competition <em>literally</em> with dirty tricks (ie, have them rubbed out), or you can "bury" them <em>figuratively</em> by producing a superior product. The "<a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>" thing is just an extension of the metaphor, I think. In any case, chair-throwing is not the way to accomplish it, and is a symptom of acute <a href="AlphaMale.html">AlphaMale</a> TestosteronePoisoning.

           <a href="MicroManagement.html">MicroManagement</a> prevents you from doing X, even though it's very low risk and will improve things.

        <li>
           "I only understand practices A, B, & C, but not their complementing practices X, Y, & Z. So I'm going to relentlessly micro-manage you on the former, then complain when you go off schedule."
