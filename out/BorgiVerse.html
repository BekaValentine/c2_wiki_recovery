        The Borgiverse, a play on Universe is the place where <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> (from <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a>) live. Well, they really live in their cubes, but there are places where there are what seem to be space stations. Someone should know what I am talking about. I guess it's their version of a home world.

        I bring this up only because of some <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s about <a href="NanoTechnology.html">NanoTechnology</a> and the FutureOfHumanity.

        Is it possible to have a human <a href="BorgiVerse.html">BorgiVerse</a> using Nanotech? Can we survive in space without a planet?
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes we can, eventually. Even in the unlikely event we remain biological. Google this: Dyson Spheres

        <em>What's more likely is that computers will know better than to tell their human charges anything unless asked. So if no human asks "Am I really not on a beach? Am I really in a beach-shaped habitat inside a humongous floating habitrail floating a thousand light years from Earth's local group?" the computers will keep their mouths shut.</em> -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        Yep. And then you get into "Am I really not on a beach? Am I really in a beach-like simulation of reality created by <a href="TheMatrix.html">TheMatrix</a>?" :P -- <a href="GavinLambert.html">GavinLambert</a>

        I wasn't thinking of <a href="TheMatrix.html">TheMatrix</a> in particular, just something along those lines. And what if even the computer doesn't know the answer? Perhaps right this very instant our entire known universe is just a computer simulation. And the computer simulation is itself another simulation. And even that simulation is just someone's (outside our reality) dream? And what if... (brain turns inside out) -- <a href="GavinLambert.html">GavinLambert</a>

        <em>We all know that the world is on the back of a giant turtle, who is standing on the back of a giant turtle, and it's turtles all the way down. So the simulation must be written in the </em><a href="LogoLanguage.html">LogoLanguage</a>.<em></em>

        But what about the elephants? THE ELEPHANTS?!?!?

        Does anyone care about the specifics of their physical environment that much?  I mean, is a beach on a planet any worse than one in an orbital colony?  I can see someone caring if they are in a (mental) simulation a la <a href="TheMatrix.html">TheMatrix</a> versus some physical reality that may or may not mimic a planetary surface, but that's got bigger implications.
