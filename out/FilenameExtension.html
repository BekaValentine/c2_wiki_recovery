        Filename Extension
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some operating systems use the last few characters of a file's name, its <a href="FilenameExtension.html">FilenameExtension</a>, infer the file's type.  For example, to MS-DOS and its cousins, a filename ending in ".exe" is an executable file; a filename ending in ".txt" is a text file, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some systems don't use them; (older) Macintosh files use a 4-character file type code not stored in the FileName.  Unix uses a directory flag to indicate whether or not a file is executable.  Unix filenames don't have extensions <em>per se</em>, but periods are legal elements of filenames and so file name suffixes can be used and understood by Unix programs. For example, a C compiler usually takes <strong>foo.c</strong> as input and produces <strong>foo.o</strong> as output. Most systems also support "<a href="MagicNumber.html">MagicNumber</a>s", in which the first two bytes of a file encode the file type. This is what makes the <a href="SheBang.html">SheBang</a> trick (as in <strong>#!/bin/perl</strong>) possible.
      </p>

        Others store more data.  <a href="VmsOperatingSystem.html">VmsOperatingSystem</a> files have a version number after the extension: [directory]name.ext;123.
