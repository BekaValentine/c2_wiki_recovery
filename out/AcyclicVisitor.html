        "The <strong>Acyclic Visitor</strong> pattern allows new functions to be added to existing class hierarchies without affecting those hierarchies, and without creating the dependency cycles that are inherent to the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a>."

        The receiver of the Visitor dynamic_casts the Visitor to determine
        if it is the type of Visitor it will accept, and if so, passes itself to
        the Visitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        How is this better than:
      </p>
      <p>
        An operation or class that will only operate on a specific subtype
        dynamic_casts the instance to determine if it is of that subtype.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Visitor pattern has two purposes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) Enumeration -> as target of an iteration through a collection of a known set of subtypes
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) Type Determination (CapabilityQuery) -> determine which subtype we are currently examining.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If there is no need for an enumeration target, and a dynamic_cast is acceptable
        for the Capability Query, there is no need for the Visitor Pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does anybody want to comment on this observation?  Does it make sense?

        I developed <a href="AcyclicVisitor.html">AcyclicVisitor</a> independently in designing class frameworks. (<a href="JohnVlissides.html">JohnVlissides</a> also developed a variation in <a href="VisitorInFrameworks.html">VisitorInFrameworks</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In a particular <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> framework, a state machine (<a href="StatePattern.html">StatePattern</a>) controlled the software's progress through a dialogue with the user. When the user acts, this can cause an event (<a href="CommandPattern.html">CommandPattern</a>) to be sent to the state machine, causing it to change to the next state in the dialogue. But what events might a state receive? And how might it handle these events? Answer: It depends on the application. But I can't recompile the framework every time someone wants to create a custom event in a new application. That's that nasty cyclic dependency.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I pushed the issue of event-handling onto the application. For each event class the application defined, it needed a corresponding event receiver class. If a particular state needed to respond to a particular kind of event, the state class would inherit from the appropriate receiver. The event would then <a href="DynamicCast.html">DynamicCast</a> to the corresponding receiver class, executing the event if the cast was successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In another instance, I was creating a diagnostic framework. Diagnostic tests inherited from a test base class (<a href="StrategyPattern.html">StrategyPattern</a>). Each class of test would generate test-specific status, which could be relayed to the user. But the application needs to be able to use application-specific test classes, with application-specific status classes. And the diagnostic framework needs to be completely decoupled from the UI, which may even have its own completely separate framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        So for each status class, there is a corresponding status receiver class. Each status class knows what kind of receiver can grok it, and <a href="DynamicCast.html">DynamicCast</a>s to it. One status message, one <a href="DynamicCast.html">DynamicCast</a>. At least it's better than a list of twenty <a href="DynamicCast.html">DynamicCast</a>s in a gigantic if-then-elseif, as the UI code hunts around for a kind of status it knows about.

      <p>
        I recently refactored my way into a situation identical to that Tim describes (quite a testament to the magic of
        refactoring): State + Command compelled Visitor, and then I had a peloton of cycles to get rid of.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that <a href="AcyclicVisitor.html">AcyclicVisitor</a> as written, translated into <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, still has a cycle between each element-
        Visitor pair. Element subclasses (commands) refer to each Visitor subclass (state) via an interface; each 
        Visitor interface must refer to an element subclass, and we have a cycle. The cycle doesn't affect the framework,
        but I don't like to tolerate even little local ones.The cycle can be easily removed by having
        Visitors refer to elements via interfaces, but I had a large number of elements, they were quite simple,
        and the code bloat of having an interface for each element seemed excessive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking for better solutions I came across <a href="UncleBob.html">UncleBob</a>'s Java version,
        <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/visitor">http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/visitor</a> ,
        which has the same issue, perhaps indicated by the bidirectional arrows in the diagram, although not explicitly
        discussed. (I believe the issue almost goes away in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> if the elements and Visitors see each others' declarations
        but not their definitions, but I haven't worked through it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I settled for using reflection, more or less as described in
        <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip98.html">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip98.html</a> . This completely removes any knowledge of the whole
        business from the elements. The reflective dispatch can be done in one place in a Visitor superclass. The result
        is quite economical and easy to follow. The only hitch is that because the visit methods are only called via
        reflection, code checkers think they're unused.
