        The <a href="DiscWorld.html">DiscWorld</a> series of books by <a href="TerryPratchett.html">TerryPratchett</a> are incredibly funny, well worth reading, fantastic, fun page turners; you wish they would never end!
      </p>
      <p>
        As a bit of a background, the setting is a large disc that sits on the backs of four great elephants (The Fifth Elephant had a nasty accident), these in turn stand on the back of a turtle.

        As well as some magic and fun fantasy, it explores some rather unique physics that makes this series attractive to your average <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also attractive to anyone that likes a bit of light-hearted social commentary with their humor.
