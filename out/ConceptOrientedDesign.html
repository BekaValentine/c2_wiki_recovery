        Concept Oriented Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        The concept-oriented design (COD) is an approach to system design based on the principles of the <a href="ConceptOriented.html">ConceptOriented</a> paradigm. This method is based on the assumption that all components of the system are living in some environement or container with concrete borders. An environment can be included into other environments and include itself [in] many internal environments. The structure of the system containers determines most of its functionality and has to be defined before objects are placed into the system.
