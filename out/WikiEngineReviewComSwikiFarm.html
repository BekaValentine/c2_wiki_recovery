        Wiki Engine Review Com Swiki Farm
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Review of the </strong><a href="ComSwiki.html">ComSwiki</a> used at the <a href="SwikiFarm.html">SwikiFarm</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Swiki Versions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am confused about Swiki versions.  This review is primarily about the swiki in use on the <a href="SwikiFarm.html">SwikiFarm</a>, <a href="http://www.swiki.net/.about.">http://www.swiki.net/.about.</a>   I suspect that I have confused features of Swiki 2.8, <a href="ComSwiki.html">ComSwiki</a> 11, and the <a href="ComSwiki.html">ComSwiki</a> in use at the <a href="SwikiFarm.html">SwikiFarm</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My last communication with the <a href="SwikiFarm.html">SwikiFarm</a> leads me to believe that they are running a unique version.  The following is quoted from an email from Mike Sheridan:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"ComSwikis are Comanche based Swikis...which is what we're using.  We used Comanche and Swiki before they became <a href="ComSwiki.html">ComSwiki</a> beta 1, and in fact contributed a lot of the code that was used for the <a href="ComSwiki.html">ComSwiki</a> releases.  Since then, we've picked up some features added in the <a href="ComSwiki.html">ComSwiki</a> release."</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Swikis are written in Squeak, which is a version of <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>.  I don't know much about Squeak or <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, but I have the following impressions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Squeak is very portable between operating systems
        </li>
        <li>
           Squeak creates what I will call an "environment" on the computer it is installed on.  This environment contains things like a built in webserver and a means of persistent data storage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have the following impressions about Swikis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A Swiki is built into Squeak, or a Swiki can be loaded into Squeak by a mechanism called a "filein" or as a "goodie" (are they the same thing?)
        </li>
        <li>
           I believe that more than one swiki exists and can be loaded into Squeak as a "filein" or "goodie".  
        </li>
        <li>
           The two major variants are Swiki 2.8 (part of Squeak 2.8), and <a href="ComSwiki.html">ComSwiki</a> 11.  <a href="ComSwiki.html">ComSwiki</a> uses the Commanche webserver, which may also be a "filein" or "goodie".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Swiki on the <a href="SwikiFarm.html">SwikiFarm</a> looks good (see the review summary), but with the following drawbacks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No diffs
        </li>
        <li>
           No means to delete pages (even by the administrator -- short of creating a new swiki and moving only the desired pages to the new swiki)
        </li>
        <li>
           No means to delete snapshots (short of creating a new swiki and moving only the desired pages to the new swiki, saving newer pages over them so they become history)
        </li>
        <li>
           Search mechanism is not as flexible as I would like (no phrases, within x -- it does allow words, multiple words, or portions of words)
        </li>
        <li>
           Storage mechanism is unique to Squeak (??), thus making it difficult to consider improving search by using an external indexing and search tool
        </li>
        <li>
           For someone who uses Squeak or <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, it may be easy to extend the swiki to include expanded search and diff capabilities, but I suspect it is not worth my time to learn <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> strictly for that purpose.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Good things about swikis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Looks fairly easy to install on many operating systems, with minimal need to learn Squeak (??)
        </li>
        <li>
           Password protection, "invitations", and page locking look useful, and can be used to minimize dangers of allowing embedded HTML
        </li>
        <li>
           There is a farm which will host public or private swikis, for free up to 25 megabytes (and this size restriction may have been lifted). 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I wonder how difficult it would be to provide diffs, improve the search capabilities, and provide a means to delete pages and revision snapshots?  I suspect it would not worth my effort to learn <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> in order to attempt those changes.

When I first tried the test, headings did not work properly, but bulleted lists did.  (The numbered and nested lists were added to the test page later.)  Now headings are working but lists are not.

           <em>Embedded HTML (risky):</em> Yes ("any HTML" in <a href="ComSwiki.html">ComSwiki</a>", "simple" HTML? in Swiki(?)).  Risk can be mitigated somewhat by limiting editing privileges to a trusted group using password protection, invitations (lists of authorized users), and locks, but at the cost of losing some <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Password protection?</em> Yes.  Looks like a useful approach.  Owner can allow anyone to view and edit, allow anyone to view but limit editors (invitation only), or make the swiki private (invitation required to view or edit).  If you are invited you must sign up, create a password, and then log on to view or edit.  If anyone is allowed to view or edit, passwords and log ons are not required.  Extending an invitation sends email to the invitee.

        <dd>The wiki owner can also invite people to help with user and/or site administration.  See also locks under "Extra Features".  The edit button can be hidden but people "in the know" can still edit the page. </dd>

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Delete Snapshots?</em>  No, except by creating a new swiki and transferring only the desired pages and desired history.  The 25 megabyte limit is generous, but you can chew a lot of that up with snapshots, especially if you "save" often while editing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Delete Pages?</em> <New attribute, not sure I'll leave it here, but will pick a place and then modify template, etc.>  Similar to snapshots, there is no means to delete pages -- one recommendation is that when you empty a page you keep track of it and reuse it when you want to create a new page.
