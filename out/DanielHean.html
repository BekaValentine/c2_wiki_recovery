        I am a Kiwi (from New Zealand). I used to work full time as a Computer 
        Consultant/Programmer, and I have a degree in Electrical and Electronic 
        Engineering, and a Master's degree in Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the last few years I have taken a break from work and I have been 
        traveling, seeing the world. I had the opportunity open up with what seemed 
        like (at the time), a bad situation, but as the saying goes, maybe that 
        dark cloud has a silver lining. It may not have been silver, but it has 
        been amazing and not at all what I expected, and I have learnt a tremendous 
        amount (of course not all of that are things that I would have wanted 
        to learn, but life is life ;-).
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I started traveling, I did my Master's thesis (while working full-time) that has the practical (and some theory) at <a href="WhyEdit.html">WhyEdit</a> <a href="http://www.YEdit.com/">http://www.YEdit.com/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        At the beginning of 2004 YEdit was re-written and split up into easier to read sections.
