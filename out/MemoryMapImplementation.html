        Memory Map Implementation
      </h1>
      <p>
        A "memory map" is a collection of vectors with normalized factors. It may go by different names, such as "Self-organizing Maps (SOMS)", and variations on this theme are common in AI and neural research. The question at hand is about making such algorithms more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is an example map with a zero-to-one normalization range that a space probe may use as it samples planets:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           brightness (reflectivity or albido) - 0=dark, 0.5=grey, 1.0=white 
        </li>
        <li>
           absolute brightness - 0 is dark and 1 is say surface of sun. A log scale would be used.
        </li>
        <li>
           variability of planet image(s) - 0=smooth, 0.5=medium variations, 1=full contrast (black and white only)
        </li>
        <li>
           Air pressure - log scale from 0 to 1, zero being empty space pressure, and 1 perhaps being threashold of probe. An expendable sub-probe may be needed for this measurement since gas giants won't let a probe come back out.
        </li>
        <li>
           Oxegen amount - log scale (0 to 1) - Note that percentage might not be sensative enough to low amounts, thus we may want to stretch the lower-end using a reverse log scale or the like.
        </li>
        <li>
           Hard surface detected - 0=no surface detected, 0.5=mushy-or-soft, 1=hard surface
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So we get a list of 6 measurements. Now suppose we had a database of planets in the galaxy. We could use probe samples to guess which planet it landed on. The basic algorithm to find the closest match is:
      </p>
      <code>
        s = getSampleVector();<br/>
        best_sample = blank;   // initialize<br/>
        min_diff = 999;  <br/>
        for p = each_planet_in_galaxy() {<br/>
        diff = abs(p1-s1) + abs(p2-s2) ... + abs(p6-s6);<br/>
        if (diff < min_diff) {<br/>
        best_sample = p;<br/>
        min_diff = diff;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        print("Best matching vector: " . showV(best_sample));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A fancier version would show multiple top-ranking matches, something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        Rank Diff         Sample              Planet<br/>
        -----------------------------------------------------<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
              0.25  (0.25,0.52,0.98,...) (0.26,0.50,0.95,...)
        </li>
        <li>
              0.30  (0.25,0.52,0.98,...) (0.24,0.58,0.93,...)
        </li>
        <li>
              0.32  (0.25,0.52,0.98,...) (0.15,0.61,0.91,...)
        </li>
        <li>
              0.40  etc...
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The question I have is, what kind of algorithms can be used to speed up the matching/scoring process such that one does not have to do a sequential search? Some of the simplistic approaches I have thought of (eg. index strings) tend to weigh some factors heavier than others, which is not what we want. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Notes</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           For descrete categories, such as clothing (shirts, pants, socks, etc.), one could adjust it so that a match would be 1 and a non-match would be zero. It may complicate our storing process, but not necessarily our scoring algorithm (once translation is done).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Variations put different weights on different factors. Here is an example where w[n] is the weighting factor:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        diff = w1*abs(p1-s1) + w2*abs(p2-s2) ... + w6*abs(p6-s6)<br/>
