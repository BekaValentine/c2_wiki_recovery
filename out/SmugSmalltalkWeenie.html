        The website <a href="http://www.smalltalk.org/">http://www.smalltalk.org/</a> has a section called "Quotes on Smalltalk".  It contains eight quotes, some from various notables (and a few anonymous ones).  TWO of the quotes are about Smalltalk.  FOUR of them are slams on <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a> (including the "nailing <a href="ExtraLegsOntoAdog.html">ExtraLegsOntoAdog</a> to make an octopus" crack).  One is a quote from <a href="LinusTorvalds.html">LinusTorvalds</a> that has nothing to do with <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>s (but which appears to be an observation that the best technology doesn't always win... implying guess what?)  The final is an out-of-context quote from <a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a>.

        I like <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>.  It's a cool language.  But it's in a tight race with <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> as to which language has the smugger weenies. -- <a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>

        <li>
           I too also use Scheme in my spare time.  In fact, I'm trying to use Scheme to write a <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a> with Smalltalk-ish syntax. -- <a href="JasonArhart.html">JasonArhart</a>

           Hi, I'm a random moron wasting your time on Ward's wiki. My name is <a href="CaseyRansberger.html">CaseyRansberger</a>, and while I don't have fun all the time, when I do, I do it with a Squeak VM. I also <3 LISP. So there. I have brought balance to the forceâ€¦ er, wiki. I'll also say that <a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a> is onto something with his comment above.

        Folks who want to become <a href="SmugSmalltalkWeenie.html">SmugSmalltalkWeenie</a>s, but haven't learned the language (or are mere beginners):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I've been lurking here for a while. I've been intrigued by all of the talk of Smalltalk on Wiki, and looked into some <a href="SmalltalkTutorials.html">SmalltalkTutorials</a>, but I haven't actually written anything in it yet. It looks extremely interesting, and I like the syntax a great deal - I'm still working on understanding things like MetaObjects. -- DavidWatson

        I visited <a href="http://www.smalltalk.org">http://www.smalltalk.org</a> . Bravo for them, to have implemented a portal server in smalltalk! There's mud in yer eye, for everyone who says it isn't a serious commercial language! -- <a href="PaulMurray.html">PaulMurray</a>
