        The Life Of The Cosmos
      </h1>
      <p>
        A book by <a href="LeeSmolin.html">LeeSmolin</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book contains a theory of Smolin's which he emphasizes as an alternative explanation to that offered by the <a href="AnthropicPrinciple.html">AnthropicPrinciple</a> (in either form, the WeakAnthropicPrinciple or the StrongAnthropicPrinciple) in regard to certain implications of the StandardTheoryOfElementaryParticles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the book is less to present or defend this theory than a context to talk about much in the history of science and the scope of what science is able to talk about.
