        Mutability Revocation
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> has <a href="MutabilityRevocation.html">MutabilityRevocation</a> as a runtime feature, not statically checked: a container can be either +w or -w (chmod'able at will), and it's an error to try to change a -w container element.   In other words, you can create a container, mutate it, and then when it's just how you like, make it read-only.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is called <a href="MutabilityRevocation.html">MutabilityRevocation</a> (a term I just coined; if someone knows a more standardized term in the literature, please <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> this page).

        An example of <a href="TypeMigration.html">TypeMigration</a>.

        Consequences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A good solution to the non-trivial construction problem (where an object must be constructed piece-by-piece; and this is difficult to do with a single constructor call).
          <ul>
            <li>
               However, this may expose a partially-assembled object to the world.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Likely interferes with <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a>.  Methods that used to work may no longer work suddenly, due to something done to the object somewhere else.  Languages with <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a> might not have this problem, assuming they always do the necessary checks (and don't cache away "OK, this operation is legal on this object").
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anything have it besides <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>?
      </p>

      <p>
        As a side note, Postscript permissions are extremely similar to Unix permissions: containers have read permission, write permission, and execute permission, and each can be turned on/off at any time dynamically.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's an interesting interplay with other language features: the difference between a data array and a function is simply that the function is marked executable, while a data array is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is one of the principles behind </em><a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a>, and it doesn't need permissions at all to achieve this.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Permissions are one of Self's principles, and it doesn't need permissions to achieve this? Say what?
      </p>
      <p>
        Exactly what do you think is the difference between Postscript "execute on/off" versus Self's "execute on/off but this isn't a permission"?
