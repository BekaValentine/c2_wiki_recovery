        An approach to <a href="RequirementsEngineering.html">RequirementsEngineering</a> pioneered by Professor Eric Yu at the University of Toronto, under the name of the <strong><em>i*</em></strong> Modelling Framework.

        An approach to <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>. John Mylopoulos (also at the University of Toronto) and others have used <strong><em>i*</em></strong> as a basis for their Tropos software development methodology. See: <a href="http://www.troposproject.org.">http://www.troposproject.org.</a>

        <strong><em>i*</em></strong> represents "distributed intention". As EricYu puts it:

        <dd>"The complexity of today's systems and our expectations on them have grown to a point where a social paradigm for modelling and analysis has become more appropriate than the traditional mechanistic paradigms. A requirements modelling approach centred around a concept of agent can offer powerful new ways for characterizing and analyzing the interactions and relationships among the many semi-autonomous entities in the system and in the environment. Based on observations about the changing needs of requirements modelling, we propose six properties that are desirable for a concept of agent as a modelling construct: intentionality, autonomy, sociality, contingent identity and boundaries, strategic reflectivity, and rational self-interest."</dd>
