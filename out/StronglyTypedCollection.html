        Strongly Typed Collection
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most object-oriented languages and frameworks contain classes for managing collections of objects. In many cases, the collections provided by the language or framework will allow any object to be inserted into collections, and when objects are accessed in the collection, they have only the generic "object" interface and must be explicitly downcast to a more specific type.
      </p>
      <p>
        This leads to a few common problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All collections are of generic types, such as OrderedCollection or Dictionary. So the collection class name gives no indication of the specific usage within the program.
        </li>
        <li>
           Programmers accidentally insert the wrong type of objects into the collections. They can't take advantage of static type checking at compilation time, nor will dynamic run-time checks detect errors early.
        </li>
        <li>
           When using languages with static type checking, programmers must use downcasts to coerce the objects to the necessary types. This adds noise to the code, and the validity of these casts generally cannot be checked at compile time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When using collections of objects where all elements must support a particular interface or be of a particular type, define a <a href="StronglyTypedCollection.html">StronglyTypedCollection</a> class that only allows objects with the necessary type to be added to the collection, and which automatically downcasts the objects as they are accessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementation of such a collection usually consists of wrapping or subclassing an existing collection class with functions that perform the necessary type checking and casts. It is also desirable to support standard collection interfaces for iteration, serialization, etc., so that the type-safe lists can also be used by code designed for generic collections. Some frameworks are designed to support this (for example, <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> provides the CollectionBase and DictionaryBase classes for this purpose).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some programming languages provide support for ParameterizedTypes or <a href="GenericType.html">GenericType</a>s. These languages allow programmers to define something like <em>a collection of objects of type T</em>, and then substitute any type for <em>T</em>. Such facilities provide static type checking and sometimes automatic type inference. C++ templates can be used for this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strongly typed collection classes tend to all look alike, except for the names of the types involved, so it is easy to automatically generate them using programmable editors, with a programming-language facility such as macros, or with a utility designed for the purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        When replacing a generic collection class with a new strongly typed collection class, look for opportunities to utilize the <a href="MoveMethod.html">MoveMethod</a> refactoring to move generic collection-usage code from the clients into the new class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a language like Smalltalk, where there is no static type checking, strongly typed collections are less necessary, and may even be detrimental to the intended use of polymorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional classes add overhead. Extra coding is required, and program size increases. People who create collection classes are likely to try to support every possible collection operation, rather than only those that are needed. Adding all this code simply to provide type-safety may seem like overkill in many circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can lead to a lot of extra work while refactoring (as is typical for languages with static type checking).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a simple C# collection class that allows only objects of class <em>Person</em> to be inserted. It implements the standard .NET <em>IEnumerable</em> interface, allowing programmers to write "foreach (Person p in aPersonList) ...". (One might also implement the standard <em>ICollection</em> interface if it is useful.)
      </p>
      <code>
        public class PersonList: System.Collections.IEnumerable<br/>
        {<br/>
        private ArrayList innerList = new ArrayList();<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public void Add(Person aPerson)<br/>
        {<br/>
        innerList.Add(aPerson);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public void Remove(Person aPerson)<br/>
        {<br/>
        innerList.Remove(aPerson);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public int Count<br/>
        {<br/>
        get { return innerList.Count; }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Get/set element at given index<br/>
        public Person this[int index]<br/>
        {<br/>
        get { return (Person) innerList[index]; }<br/>
        set { innerList[index] = value; }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Support IEnumerable interface<br/>
        public System.Collections.IEnumerator GetEnumerator()<br/>
        {<br/>
        return innerList.GetEnumerator();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        It would seem like the MicrosoftDoneThing is to derive from CollectionBase for this kind of stuff, but it seems like even more extra work, although code generation tools are available. I also don't understand the full implications of the name hiding magic going on there, so off I go to read the spec!

        The thing that bugs me most about using generic collections (like <a href="ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a> in <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>) is that casting from Object is required. A true strongly-typed collection shouldn't be using Object collections at all, even under the covers. It's not actually that hard to build a dynamic collection on top of a typed array (but a tool would make it a snip).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Look, either you want run-time type checking, like Smalltalk, in which case collections work just fine, or you want compile-time type checking. If you want compile time type checking, and you want collection classes then the only sensible option is <a href="GenericType.html">GenericType</a>s. All this having to subclass from some base collection class is garbage. I just want to declare something as '<a href="OrderedCollection.html">OrderedCollection</a> of Widget' or whatever.

        I can't see why this wasn't obvious to the designers of <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, perhaps they were hung up on the <a href="WriteOnceRunAnywhere.html">WriteOnceRunAnywhere</a> bit, but it should certainly have been blindingly obvious to the designers of <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> who had no excuses.

        Generics would be lovely (and both Java and <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> will have them someday, I'm fairly sure), but I don't think generics/templates are as important in an environment where everything is an object, which is possibly why it was low on the list for the designers of both environments, but such a boon for C++ (correct me if I'm wrong, somebody).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        But in Java everything isn't an object, some things are primitive data types (yuck!). Anyway, I don't see why generic types aren't just as important in an environment where everything is an object? - <a href="StephenHutchinson.html">StephenHutchinson</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Because by treating everything as an object, you achieve genericity. Instead of
      </p>
      <code>
        ArrayList<string> list;<br/>
        list.Add("Foo");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        you do:
      </p>
      <code>
        ArrayList list;<br/>
        list.Add("Foo");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        So you lose strong typing, but you gain simplicity through a common type hierarchy (at least in <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> you do, by hook or by crook). How would you implement the equivalent of <a href="ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a> in C++ without resorting to untyped pointers or demanding that the elements implemented some interface? (Please tell me, I really don't know and I'm trying to learn C++!)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The question is really "why would you want to implement an untyped </em><a href="ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a> in C++?"  If you don't know what is in the list, what are you going to do with objects you retrieve from the list, without casting? And if you cast you are breaking the type system, so you might as well use a template to avoid the awkward cast syntax and make your program safer. Untyped collections are only useful if you don't need to cast, as in dynamically typed languages.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        By using templates, of course:
      </p>
      <code>
        #include <vector><br/>
        #include <string><br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        int main()<br/>
        {<br/>
        std::vector<std::string> messages;<br/>
        messages.push_back("Look ma!");<br/>
        messages.push_back("No casting!");<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Uh, exactly (although I think I meant to say "how <em>else</em> would you implement..."). See my point? Having everything as an object means templates in a language are less important, which is why they're not a feature of C# or Java. The only thing templates would bring to those language is less casting (which is reason enough to introduce the feature, but not a show-stopper).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The other advantage is static and dynamic type checking. You can't accidentally put the wrong type of object into a typed collection. I know </em><a href="RealObjectOrientedProgrammers.html">RealObjectOrientedProgrammers</a> never make mistakes like that, but for those of us who do, it is useful. Also, in C++, templates allow for optimizations that aren't feasible with the "everything is a subclass of Object" paradigm.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        But in C++, everything <em>is</em> an object. A C++ object is just a chunk of memory that is typed and has been initialized, either by a constructor or by a primitive language operation (which is undefined for auto variables of primitive types).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That is the C++ definition of "object", but it is not much like the other uses of the term relevant to this page. In particular, there is no Object class with an interface and methods to be inherited (unless you consider low-level stuff like 'operator new' or 'operator &' to be methods), and there is no standardized nor useful way to have a collection of references to untyped "objects".</em> <strong>But the point is that this does not matter if you have strongly typed, generic collections. You never have, or indeed *need* references to untyped "objects". E.g. as stated in the paragraph below (which follows on from the one above).</strong> <em>I think we are in agreement here - I'm just pointing out that the intended meaning of "everything is a subclass of object" above refers to the Java/.NET/Smalltalk concept of "object".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        An untyped collection is only useful if you have true polymorphism. In a statically typed language, the Object base class is not useful, and you have to cast types whenever you query a collection. Generic types make collections much more convenient. For example, compare collections in the <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a> and those in the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> - Eiffel is light-years ahead of Java.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I have seen this recently in a Java application, and it drives people (at least me) nuts, because a PersonList is not a List (i.e. it does not extends List), therefore you cannot pass a PersonList to all those neat methods that accepts a List (such as Collections.unmodifiableList()). When applied liberally in the application, you get lots of these "almost like" a list things that you have a hard time remembering which XXXList supports which subset of List methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would very much prefer a ListWrapper (or whatever better name) that is used like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        List personList = new ListWrapper(Person.class, new <a href="ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>());<br/>
        personList.add(new Person()); // fine<br/>
        personList.add("wrong"); // throws an exception by ListWrapper<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It ensures the list contains what you want, even though you still have to downcast when retrieving.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In C++ with STL, those "neat methods" are also generic, solving this problem in style, I think.

        I notice someone in the above discussion, defending Java's approach to collections saying <em>So you lose strong typing, but you gain simplicity</em>. Well, that sounds awfully like an argument for Smalltalk. I mean, I don't mind people advocating strong typing, and I don't mind languages that do it properly like Pascal or Eiffel. What sticks in my gullet is when people drone on about how Java is much better than Smalltalk because it's strongly typed when there is a hole in the type system that you can drive a coach and horses through called collections. In fact, you need to regularly drive a coach and horses through it in any real program. - <a href="StephenHutchinson.html">StephenHutchinson</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Java type system also lets you assign any array of objects to a variable of type Object[], which is a hole in the type system. E.g. this is allowed by the type system, but is incorrect:
      </p>
      <code>
        Integer[] integer_array = new Integer[10];<br/>
        Object[] object_array = integer_array;<br/>
        object_array[0] = "ERROR!";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Assignments to array elements therefore have to be type-checked at runtime, and can throw ArrayStoreExceptions.

        In <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a> I can do this:

      <code>
        < x : float; .. > -> unit<br/>

      <p>
        In other words, a function taking as argument an object that implements <em>at least</em> a method x with type float. The type system allows me to express covariance and contravariance.

        How can it tell that a method name in one class <em>means the same thing</em> as the same method name in another?

      <p>
        Although I'm sure it's correct in most cases, matching by name only is going to let some type errors slip through the static check which is why most statically typed languages check types by type-name equivalence, not structural equivalence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, it matches on name and on signature. Of course, type-name equivalence doesn't give any strong guarantees either, since I can always subclass a baseclass and override all methods with nonsensical implementations. More generally, 100% unforgeable contracts cannot be unified with subclassing, so O'Caml doesn't even try. If you want unforgeable contracts, use abstract data types (which O'Caml also provides)</em>
