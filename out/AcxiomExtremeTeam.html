        Acxiom Extreme Team
      </h1>
      <p>
        Our Acxiom team (<a href="http://www.acxiom.com)">http://www.acxiom.com)</a> has been implementing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> techniques for the past two and a half years. The team has built a large and complex campaign management application for our client's data warehouses. We developed the application using Forte (<a href="http://www.forte.com),">http://www.forte.com),</a> a distributed Object Oriented development tool. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We feel our team has put together a very successful process for developing software. At the start of the project, we did not use <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. From the time we implemented this methodology, we have made great strides in improving the productivity and development of our team members as well as the quality of the application. I wrote an article about our team's experiences developing the application using <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.

        Hi Jim, glad to hear you're having good success. How about posting which of the XP practices your team does and does not follow?
