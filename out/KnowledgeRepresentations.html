        Knowledge Representations
      </h1>
      <p>
        Knowledge Representations are ways of capturing knowledge and encoding it.  The foremost example is <a href="NaturalLanguage.html">NaturalLanguage</a> which has been with the human race in oral form for no-body knows how long and in written form for some more than 5000 years.  It achieved sophisticated form certainly no later than 500 BC or earlier -- the works of the great Greek philosophers <a href="ThreeOldGreeks.html">ThreeOldGreeks</a> dates from about the mid-350's BC --- today's versions include AI KRL's (Knowledge Representation Languages) ontologies and more commonly the various data base systems.

        We still seem to have a long way to go though before we have a system that is complete -- See <a href="IncompleteNotations.html">IncompleteNotations</a>  --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>
