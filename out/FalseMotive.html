        False Motive

      <p>
        A pervasive <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>.

      <p>
        You are told that the reason you are doing something is to
        SaveTheWorld or to give better service to "the customers"
        or to HelpMankind or whatever, when the actual reason is
        ShareholderEnrichment.
      </p>
      <p>
        It isn't that ShareholderEnrichment is bad, but you aren't given
        that reason because someone thinks you will object to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your vision of the goal of your work does not match the vision of
        the person making the rules, so you find yourself encountering
        barriers that don't make sense in the context of the reason you
        were given.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can lead to cynical viewpoints "EverybodyLies" or
        "CompaniesAreEvil" neither of which are true.
      </p>
      <p>
        The typical <a href="MissionStatement.html">MissionStatement</a> is usually a <a href="FalseMotive.html">FalseMotive</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes we adopt a <a href="FalseMotive.html">FalseMotive</a> of our own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Guided by the bombardment of PR that happiness is ThePerfectHome,
        ThePerfectCar, ThePerfectMortgage, ThePerfectBurger, or
        ThePerfectCareer, we put spurs to our trusty steed and
        pursue ThePerfectThing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare what you're doing, and the rules that govern it,
        to where you think it's going.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hmmm.  I sound a little cynical today.
      </p>

      <p>
        It seems that the more pernicious of these is the one you do to yourself.
