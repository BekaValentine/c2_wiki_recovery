        Husserls Phenomenology
      </h1>
      <p>
        Has anyone read or studied Husserl's phenomenology?  I am starting on it, and it seems interesting, relevant to cognitive psychology and AI (e.g. Minsky's frames).  The book I am using is Husserl, Phenomenology and Intention.  Hard going, but if I squint right, I catch some strains of some interesting music.

      <p>
        The history of phenomenology shows that 
      </p>
      <code>
        the notion "life", "live", "life world" and others become important in contemporary phenomenology. <br/>
        Husserl's stand in his latest works is still connected with <br/>
        the way, <br/>
        which links phenomenology with its <br/>
        turning to concrete subjectivity and its life. <br/>

        The pure life
      </p>
      <code>
        is the basis for reduction in Husserls phenomenology, acknowledges Celms.<br/>
        Life is grasped in phenomenological reflection. <br/>

      <p>
        In describing the model of Husserl,s reflexive consciousness Celms 
      </p>
      <code>
        stresses that <br/>
        life does not consist of objects but of experiences <br/>
        (besteht mein Leben nicht aus Objekten, sondern aus Erlebnissen). <br/>

      <p>
        We perceive experiences as an infinity of an immanent observation process.
