        Tomb Stone
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a> is a design pattern, similar to (possibly a subset of) <a href="BridgePattern.html">BridgePattern</a> - however, <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a> serves a somewhat different purpose. <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>s are commonly found in <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a>s/memory management systems, <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>s, and the like. A <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a> is a fixed-size object, often containing little more than a pointer to a real object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a>s and <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>s use <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>s to decouple the references to an object stored elsewhere in the program (within other objects, or in variables) with its actual location. All references to the object are really references to the <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>; the <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a> holds the sole pointer to the object itself. (The <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a> might also hold a pointer to a <a href="VeeTable.html">VeeTable</a> or something similar; as a performance optimization - the important thing is that the <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a> is of fixed size. Other metadata might appear as well, such as scratchpad space for the <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a>). <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>s are typically held in their own area of memory (the TombstonePool) as a cache optimization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> specification specifically allows (but does not require) use of <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>s. <em>Anyone know which JVMs use </em><a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>s and which don't?<em> Many </em><a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> implementations use <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>s (see <a href="ObjectTable.html">ObjectTable</a>, <a href="ObjectTableEntry.html">ObjectTableEntry</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequences of using <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Operations and techniques like heap compaction, safe object destruction (destroying an object which still has references to it), <a href="WeakPointer.html">WeakPointer</a>s, references that aren't memory pointers, etc. are easier to implement - the GC/VM need only alter the reference in the <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>. (Of course, it may be cached in registers, which complicates things). Even conservative collectors can support heap compaction if <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>s are used. (The <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a> pool itself does not need compaction, as all <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>s are of fixed size and thus do not suffer fragmentation).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Any dereferencing of an object reference now requires an additional memory access - to read the true address of the object from the <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>. In many cases, the true address of an object can be cached in registers - at the expense of complicating any operation that alters that address.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WeakReference.html">WeakReference</a>s become trivial to implement - they are simply non-reference counted references through the <a href="TombStone.html">TombStone</a>.  When the object is destroyed, the weak reference will point to an empty tombstone and thus will be able to report the object missing.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Is the above text attempting to describe a Smalltalk <a href="ObjectPointer.html">ObjectPointer</a>/<a href="ObjectTableEntry.html">ObjectTableEntry</a>? Is there a problem with using the terms <a href="ObjectPointer.html">ObjectPointer</a> and <a href="ObjectTableEntry.html">ObjectTableEntry</a>?

        Why are they called "tombstones"?

        This sounds a lot like the Mac OS "handle" concept. -- <a href="TaralDragon.html">TaralDragon</a>

        <em>The tombstone I've heard of is the remnant of a deleted object in </em><a href="ActiveDirectory.html">ActiveDirectory</a>. You need something to say this object used to exist, so that replication from another copy that hadn't got the deletion doesn't accidentally resurrect the object. Called DeletionStubs in <a href="LotusNotes.html">LotusNotes</a>.<em></em>

        Conceptually it's subset of <a href="ProxyPattern.html">ProxyPattern</a> because outer object controls access to inner.
