        Static Data Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        Management of static data has been an issue in nearly every project that I have worked on.
      </p>
      <p>
        By static data I mean data that influences program behaviour.  For example, a program that checks the validity of input against a <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a> and reacts accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the system gets migrated through the various release levels (Development, Staging, UAT, Production) the data in these tables needs to be migrated as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most common way to manage the data changes related to a release has been, in my experience, to store a bunch of SQL scripts in the <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a> system.  I have found that this technique nearly always leads to problems as the number of developers and complexity of the project increases.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do other projects manage such things?
      </p>

      <p>
        It seems database tools for version control are less mature than those for files. It is a fairly common issue, so I am surprised there are no commercial tools for it.

        We use an <a href="AutomatedConfigurationManagementEnvironment.html">AutomatedConfigurationManagementEnvironment</a> that invokes batch files for such things
