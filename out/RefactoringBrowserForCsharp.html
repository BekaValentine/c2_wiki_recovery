        Why do I get the feeling this is going to be indicative of C Sharp? In Java, I've got a bunch of free and powerful tools. What do I have in C Sharp?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Of course, for <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> in general, there'll be a lot of free and powerful tools... but I don't want to write everything in Perl and Python!)

        I've tried C# refactory and it's a nice tool. I'll probably give the other tool a test drive tonight. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a bit saddened by the fact that there does not seem to be any free tools out there. There are a number of efforts under way, and I dimly remember having read that <a href="SharpDevelop.html">SharpDevelop</a> will get a refactoring browser in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps I will have to write the first free refactoring browser for CSharp myself, but rather would have someone else do it.

        ReSharper is outstanding feature-wise but it is cripplingly slow and constantly crashes and leaks memory for large projects. I would suggest it only for small to medium ones.

           Just tested the latest Beta (4.5 Beta) and they massively improved memory and performance. It is now actually usable.
