        <em></em><a href="BackusNaurForm.html">BackusNaurForm</a> is a language (method?) to formally describe the<em> </em>'syntax<strong> <em>of programming language constructs.

        This sounds interesting. Would someone care to either elaborate or provide references?

        The term comes from the field of AxiomaticSemantics of programs.  A Hoare
        triple has three parts, a precondition P, a program statement or series of
        statements S, and a postcondition Q.  It's usually written in the form
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>{P} S {Q}</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The meaning is "if P is true before S is executed, and if the execution of
        S terminates, then Q is true afterwards".  Note that the triple does not
        assert that S will terminate; that requires a separate proof.  There's a
        little calculus for manipulating the triples.  For example, if P and Q are
        propositions, Q involves the program variable v, and you've proved that
        P implies Q[E/v] (i.e., Q with the expression E substituted for v), then
        you can conclude that the triple
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>{P} v := E {Q}</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        is valid.  Or if you know {P} S1 {R} and {R} S2 {Q}, then you can deduce
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>{P} S1; S2 {Q}.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Things are pretty mechanical until you get to loops.  Then you have to guess
        a loop invariant.

        There are also other styles of programming language semantics, the main alternatives being <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> and OperationalSemantics.
