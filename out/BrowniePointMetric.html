        Brownie Point Metric
      </h1>
      <p>
        This metric is determined by an instructor of a class to measure how obedient his students are.  The more obedient the students, the higher the <a href="BrowniePointMetric.html">BrowniePointMetric</a>.  Such points may also be earned by performing tasks for said instructor which bear little or no relevance to the actual material of the class, with more points being scored for less relevance.  Higher values of this metric for any single student will by definition transfer into a higher grade for the class, which will transfer to a higher average grad for all classes, which, naturally, indicated that the above student shall of course be more successful in live and in career <em>and spell worse</em>.  This metric may be suitably modified to fit any situation where one person depends on the approval or acceptance of another.
