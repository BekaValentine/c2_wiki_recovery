        Multi Methods Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is some discussion of <a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a> on <a href="ObjectFunctionalDiscussion.html">ObjectFunctionalDiscussion</a> discussion which has been moved here.

        <em>If you are aiming to support </em><a href="DomainModelling.html">DomainModelling</a> <strong>with</strong> <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>, then <a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a> are a reasonable option for that goal.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But I do suggest you take a step back and carefully examine the assumptions that lead you to this goal. For example: why do you assume you are stuck with </em><a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>? The fundamental goals of modeling include things like: "make useful and accurate predictions", "derive interesting information", and "support planning and problem-solving". Even with <a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a>, <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> will be ill-suited to modeling goals, if only because such methods still have <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s and are generally irreversible. And those <a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a> are not free: they require violating various forms of encapsulation that make <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> suitable for <a href="ModularProgramming.html">ModularProgramming</a> and independent testing. If you aren't careful, the end result of adding <a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a> to <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> will be a language barely suited for anything at all.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OTOH, if you don't assume support for the </em><a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> must be an enhancement to OOP, then other options open for you. Now, the goal doesn't change - we still wish to integrate some domain code into the programs. But <a href="MetaProgramming.html">MetaProgramming</a>, i.e. via use of an <a href="EmbeddedDomainSpecificLanguage.html">EmbeddedDomainSpecificLanguage</a> or <a href="DomainSpecificTweaks.html">DomainSpecificTweaks</a>, might be quite suitable for this purpose. Alternatively, one could aim to integrate another paradigm. Those well suited to domain modeling include <a href="TermRewriting.html">TermRewriting</a>/<a href="RewriteRules.html">RewriteRules</a>, <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a>, <a href="ConstraintLogicProgramming.html">ConstraintLogicProgramming</a>, and <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>. <a href="ComplexEventProcessing.html">ComplexEventProcessing</a>, <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a>, and <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a> are also useful as they can efficiently integrate modeling and communications. Of course, if integrating another paradigm one must be careful to avoid weakening the properties of either; for this purpose, I would suggest a 'layered' approach rather than a 'hybridized' approach.<em></em>

        Thank you for this interesting contribution, which was at risk of being lost in <a href="ObjectFunctionalDiscussion.html">ObjectFunctionalDiscussion</a>, one of the <a href="LongPages.html">LongPages</a>. I have moved it to a new page <a href="MultiMethodsDiscussion.html">MultiMethodsDiscussion</a> with a reference from there.  -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <em>I wrote the above in response to this relatively fresh section. I'm not sure it is related to </em><a href="ObjectFunctional.html">ObjectFunctional</a>; the discussion on <a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a> seems a divergence from the original topic. Copying any interesting bits to <a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a> might be reasonable. But, with the way <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> is right now, I suspect anything written here is at risk of being lost.<em></em>

        Don't despair. Quiet building continues. A lot of this wiki is like a castle with closed off rooms with echoes of past conversations. Some of them I took part in and can remember, some I can only guess at.
