        It is a recognition of this wiki's achievement of accumulating 35,000 plus pages on July 10, 2011, having existed since around 1995-1996 (See <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a>) or about sixteen years.

        The use of the internet and its social communication abilities have changed in dramatic ways since then.  It is now not uncommon for two people, or a group of people, from ordinary desktop, laptops, or handhelds to communicate in <a href="NearRealTime.html">NearRealTime</a> from nearly any populated region in the world, using video, audio and data modes to transfer information in the same time slots, while using their devices for other things during the exchange.

        During that period of transition, this wiki has remained a dependable, consistantly available locale for the interchange of information, techniques, methodologies and for general collaboration on a number of projects and subjects.

        It has maintained this ability by the use of a simple method of hyperlinking via WikiWords and other text located in pages with a <a href="MeaningfulName.html">MeaningfulName</a>, most often descriptive of the subject or message of the page. Ward has maintained this reliability by establishing an initial philosophy of Using <a href="TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>. Best Wishes to <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> , from a grateful bunch of <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a>, who say <a href="ThankYou.html">ThankYou</a>.
