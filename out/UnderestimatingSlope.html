        Underestimating Slope
      </h1>
      <p>
        Reading the short explanation for <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a> on <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a> ('A leads to A^n'), let me think, that many arguments fail, because of the following pattern:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           more B is good
        </li>
        <li>
           more A leads to more B
        </li>
        <li>
           therefore more A is good
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (or the like, depends on A and B of course).
      </p>
      <p>
        This reasoning is definitely not sound, if the dependency between A and B is not linear (assuming, that the <em>goodness</em> of A and B is the same).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's an ends justifying the means problem... which is always a problem of economy.  There is, in reality, no way to justify any means except by its ends, but doing so requires analysis of cost of means (including all 'side-effects') vs. utility of ends and a comparative analysis of alternative approaches.  Your above statements don't even consider alternative approaches: More C leads to more B, therefore more C is good... but is C or A better?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Having more money is good.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Working as a mercenary, killer-for-hire leads to having more money.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Therefore obtaining more work as a mercenary, killer-for-hire is good.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>And even better would be developing a culture where a killer-for-hire is never out of work...</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>This is aside from the discussion below, but is somewhat of another large fallacy extant in the same logic structure you just described.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases,
        a significant amount of A may lead to insignificant changes to B in the beginning, but additional amounts of A may lead to much more B later (exponential growth; "priming the pump", "tipping point", etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        In other cases,
        more A may lead to more B in the beginning, but additional amounts of A may lead to smaller and eventually insignificant amounts of B (saturation).
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be expression mathematically e.g. like
      </p>
      <code>
        B = A^r (direct polynomial dependency, if r>>1 a little bit A make much B, reverse if r<<1)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or 
      </p>
      <code>
        B = A+p^A (late, but sudden increase e.g. if p<<1)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or 
      </p>
      <code>
        B' = A'^r (dependency in the derivative)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That was my image of <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a> at first: Not slope, that lets one fall deep down, but uneven slope which lets one stumble.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Sending more fishing ships leads to more fishes caught, therefore send as much as you can. This ignores, that this will lead to diminishing returns if the resources become depleted.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Doing a little bit XP gains no or very few advantage therefore doing much XP gains no or very little advantage too. When in fact doing much XP, 100% at best, gains a large advantage (see AllOrNothing, I know, that there is an XP page about it, but cant find it).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>My example in fact was:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A little of A leads to a very few of B, therefore more of A leads to a little bit more of B.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Which is used in the argument as follows:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           More advantage is good
        </li>
        <li>
           More XP <em>does not</em> lead to more advantage
        </li>
        <li>
           Therefore more XP is <em>not</em> good
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I agree, that the example was not well chosen, because it requires the negation. I just wanted to use an XP example.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But anyway, I do not seem to be able formulate my thoughts about this concept clear enough. Let me think about it some more time.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's definitely a fallacy around assuming that because a little of A causes some increase in B, then more A will result in more B. I would argue that performance related pay is one of these. Also see <a href="SelfSealingBelief.html">SelfSealingBelief</a>.
