        Good morning, mjd.  How goes the war? -- <a href="ThomasColthurst.html">ThomasColthurst</a>

        Actually, mjd didn't create this page, and as far as I know hasn't seen it. I created it, because I referred to him in a comment added to <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, and it seemed like a logical thing to do to have a page for him, rather than describing who he was inline with that comment. But then I'm very new to wiki, and might have been violating a social norm without realizing it. If I did, my apologies. -- <a href="JohnCallender.html">JohnCallender</a>
