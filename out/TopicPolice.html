        Okay buddy, stop that editing right where you are. Fingers in the air. Spread 'em! Don't you know that this is <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>? And <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> has a code of <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>ness, bud. Okay, so Ward never actually specified it. But other people did a long time ago. So it's the law. Make one <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> edit and I'm going to put you in <a href="DeleteOnceRestoreOnce.html">DeleteOnceRestoreOnce</a>. And if you don't abide by that you are obviously an anti-democratic enemy of all <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>s, and deserve what's comin' to yer. Me and my possee will make you wish you'd never set your browser on the place ...
