      <p>
        Infrastructure software that is the building blocks or base platform for domain applications software or used by application developers. Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Operating systems
        </li>
        <li>
           Compilers and interpreters
        </li>
        <li>
           DBMS implementations
        </li>
        <li>
           File systems
        </li>
        <li>
           Device drivers
        </li>
        <li>
           Graphics libraries
        </li>
        <li>
           Web and network server-infrastructure-related services
        </li>
        <li>
           API's that don't target a specific organization
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Contrast this with domain applications (eg. payroll processing), and custom internal applications.

        Quasi-<a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> are tools that may cater to a domain or specific shop, but are more "core" to the applications. For example, an in-house GUI library that creates a customized view or version of a more general GUI library that fits shop conventions and needs better. Such tools are pre-digesting a vendor or "general purpose" GUI library to hide features not typically used by the shop and streamline for patterns heavily used by the shop.
