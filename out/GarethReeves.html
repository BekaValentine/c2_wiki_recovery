        What do I do?
        Right now I am coaching two XP projects at Lante[1] corporation. Lante is a internet consulting company and we have been experimenting with XP since Febuary 2000. I have been advocating it in the company since long (in internet time) before that and I am now very pleased to see it catching on.

        What is my background?
        Before doing XP I built enterprise Java systems. I have about 4 years of Java programming experience.
