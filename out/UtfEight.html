        UTF-8 is short for <em>Unicode Transformation Format, 8-bit representation</em>.  A way of representing <a href="UniCode.html">UniCode</a> as a stream of bytes, with the advantage that legacy <a href="AsciiCode.html">AsciiCode</a> documents are also valid UTF-8 documents.  Also, UTF-8 is independent of byte order.

        UTF-8 was designed by <a href="KenThompson.html">KenThompson</a> and <a href="RobPike.html">RobPike</a> in 1992, to give <a href="PlanNineFromBellLabs.html">PlanNineFromBellLabs</a> <a href="UniCode.html">UniCode</a> support.

        As of May 2006, UTF-8 is the reported encoding used by <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.  Prior to May 2006, Wiki sent out neither a CharacterSet meta-tag nor Content-Type HTTP header on web pages, which meant that the user's <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a> used whatever local character set was used by the system, or whatever default encoding was set up in the browser's preferences.
