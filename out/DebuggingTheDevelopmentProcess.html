        I read this book years ago, found it very relevant, and still do. One interesting point is that the author emphasizes the idea that each feature should be fully implemented <em>and</em> fully debugged, before the developer(s) responsible for that feature move on to the next feature. I think this has a lot in common with agile methodologies - where the system developed feature-by-feature with continuous testing to ensure a low defect rate. -- <a href="JohnRusk.html">JohnRusk</a>

        In fact, <a href="FeatureDrivenDevelopment.html">FeatureDrivenDevelopment</a> is all about just that - working on getting the system built one feature at a time. -- <a href="BevanArps.html">BevanArps</a>
