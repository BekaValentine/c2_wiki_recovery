        An agile enterprise ecosystem by <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>. 4 values and 6 principles all supersets of the <a href="AgileManifesto.html">AgileManifesto</a> ones. Pete says, "grounded in SAFe, Spotify and BDD, XSCALE is a continuously delivering, continuously self-organizing, continuously adaptive Agile enterprise ecosystem that turns all the knobs to ten."

        It's basically 4 things plugged together. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There's a product planning bit that uses something called FeaturePoints. They're not like <a href="StoryPoints.html">StoryPoints</a> because SPs are just relative effort where FPs are relative cost estimates with an empirical basis. You figure them out using a variation on <a href="PlanningPoker.html">PlanningPoker</a> Pete calls BacklogBingo. And they tell you how much different feature-sets cost. Then there's another game called swelp us RoadmapRefactoring that's basically about horse-trading featuresets based on MVP.
        </li>
        <li>
           There's a kind of inverted govenance mechanism, a cross between <a href="OpenSpace.html">OpenSpace</a>, KanBan and <a href="WikiWikiGovernment.html">WikiWikiGovernment</a> based on the historical <a href="IroquoisConfederacy.html">IroquoisConfederacy</a>. Pete calls 'em IroquoisCouncils. Pretty simple way to do ConsensusDecisonMaking. More horse-trading games, naturally.
        </li>
        <li>
           There's a method for iteratively transforming an organization, a bit like AgilePath but with more structure. Pete calls it the SevenSamurai pattern language because he sees it reflected in Kurosawa's film by the same name.
        </li>
        <li>
           And then there's a collections of standard bits and pieces - SpotifyModel, ScrumXp, <a href="BehaviorDrivenDevelopment.html">BehaviorDrivenDevelopment</a>, <a href="LeanStartup.html">LeanStartup</a> and LeanUx but all bolted together using the above bits and bobs. It looks big but really it's all just current best practices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So it's a solution ... but to what problem? Well, Pete says it's about scaling Agile. There's no shortage of frameworks that claim to do that. But Pete says this one is the best one. Who am I to argue with logic like that? Anyway go see what it is and make up your mind for yourself. There's a page full of it at <a href="http://agiletng.org/2014/04/21/xscale/">http://agiletng.org/2014/04/21/xscale/</a> and apparently that's going to become a book soon. As if there weren't enough books already ...
