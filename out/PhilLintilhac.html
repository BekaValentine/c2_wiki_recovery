        Phil, I hope you don't mind my creating a home page for you here. If you dislike what I wrote, please change it; if you dislike that I created this page at all, let me know and I'll delete it. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        Phil spent many years as a Botany prof. at UVM (University of Vermont), and established the Lintilhac Foundation and the Lintilhac Foundation Scholarship Challenge to aid UVM.

        He credits UVM professors - including Fred Taylor, Jim Marvin, and Tom Sproston - for sparking his interest in plant biology through classes he took as an undergraduate.

        I am greatly enjoying the discussion on <a href="AboutCells.html">AboutCells</a>. As for its relevance to wiki wiki, it's much more relevant than a great deal of stuff which has been allowed to stay on this site until it amassed sufficient critical mass that it could be spun off into a sister site. Eventually, biology pages should be spun off into their own sister site, along with discussions of molecular nanotechnology. Biological structure and messaging would be extremely relevant to any large-scale MNT architecture, which, of course, is the future of computation. -- RK
