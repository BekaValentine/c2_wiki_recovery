        First Class Software
      </h1>
      <p>
        First Class Software, Inc. is our attempt to balance 
        work with the rest of my life.  Currently I am the 
        lone full-time employee, while my wife Cindee Andres 
        handles accounting, graphic design, and developmental 
        psychology (for me and the kids). Our goals are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Live in a peaceful place.
        </li>
        <li>
           Raise happy (or at least interesting) children.
        </li>
        <li>
           Work on what juices us.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make enough money to set us and our kids up financially.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We realize any financial comfort is 
        an illusion, though, so when objects are as passe' 
        as Cobol is now, we're prepared to do lots of other 
        interesting things to make a living.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our fundamental observation is that the 20th century 
        encourages people to give up responsibility for most 
        parts of their lives without any concomitant benefit.
        We're not Luddites, we just want to be conscious of 
        the choices we make.
