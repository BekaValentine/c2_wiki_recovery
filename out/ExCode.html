        Apple's Xcode <a href="IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.html">IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment</a>, a rewrite of <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a>/<a href="ProjectBuilder.html">ProjectBuilder</a> for <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> 10.3.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        When released it had several interesting features, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Distributed builds
        </li>
        <li>
           Edit and continue
        </li>
        <li>
           "Zero link" (during development libraries are only linked as needed at runtime)
        </li>
        <li>
           Predictive compile (compiles changes in the background before programmer invokes run)
        </li>
        <li>
           "Smart groups" (like iTunes smart playlists, basically saved on-the-fly searches)
        </li>
        <li>
           Pretty
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Uses <a href="GnuCompilerCollection.html">GnuCompilerCollection</a> and GnuDebugger underneath
        </li>
      </ul>

        How does its code manipulation capabilities compare to, say, <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a>? Refactorings? Code completion? How about JUnit integration?
      </p>
      <p>
        Xcode 3 implements some refactorings, but only for Objective C.
      </p>
      <p>
        Xcode doesn't implement any refactoring tool, and IMHO, the editor is sluggish and quite unusable (buggy display, buggy keybindings etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Code completion, on the other hand, is very polished and extremely usable. Xcode complete code with placeholders, such as [doSomething with:<# arg1 #> and:<# arg2 #>] (it's a method call) allowing you to complete and code very fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since version 2.1, XCode ships with standard Unit<a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a>s for <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>, and sample project build settings for adding <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s for your application build process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a> (shipped with XCode) is the GUI tool to design GUI, and is extremely easy to use and very powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        To sum up:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           XCode build and project management features are excellent. eg. you can use <a href="SubVersion.html">SubVersion</a>, CVS or Perforce to manage your rcs.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a> is very well thought out.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        FWIW, I haven't noticed any bugginess or sluggishness with the editor. Sure, I'd rather use Emacs, but Xcode's editor seems to be as good as any other built-in IDE editor I've seen.  (The fact that Mac OS X supports many Emacs keybindings in text fields makes me a happy developer.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Its CVS integration leaves a lot to be desired.  It doesn't handle the nib files generated by <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a>, which are a pretty important part of an Xcode project.
