        <a href="SuperPeer.html">SuperPeer</a> uses the concept of clustering. There are two kinds of entities in a <a href="SuperPeer.html">SuperPeer</a> architecture, endpoints and joints. Sometimes we don't care which one they are; at that point, we call them nodes. An endpoint can connect to only one joint. A joint can have many endpoints connected to it. A joint can have many connections to other joints. These connections have the concept of parent and child. When an endpoint is connected to a joint the joint is the parent and the endpoint is the child. A joint can only have only one parent, but it can have many children. This description was for a hierarchical <a href="SuperPeer.html">SuperPeer</a> network, I think there is at least one other type, that uses gateways instead of hierarchies.

        <em>You wrote "A joint can have many connections to other joints. These connections have the concept of parent and child." Which connections?</em>

      <p>
        <em>Also, you wrote "An endpoint can connect to only one joint." Does it have to connect to a joint?</em>
