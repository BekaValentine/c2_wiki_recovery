        Polar Quad Monitor

      <p>
        <a href="RickWartzok.html">RickWartzok</a> built this thing from a block diagram by 
        <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>.
        It used an analog four quadrant multiplier and 
        other AnalogStuff that has faded from memory.
        It was suppose to display an orb that wiggled and pulsed
        with the average volume level on each of the four channels
        of a quadraphonic recording.  The goal was a display that
        was more ergonomic than four VU meters in a row.

        It was never put into service.  But it did draw some
        pretty incredible pictures in prototype form. 
        The best images came from an fm stereo when tuned to 
        interstation noise.
