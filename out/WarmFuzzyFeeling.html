        Warm Fuzzy Feeling
      </h1>
      <p>
        The feeling of comfort, sort of like the feeling one gets from a warm, soft blanket; usually a feeling one gets when one embraces the familiar.  The opposite, in many ways, of <a href="FearUncertaintyAndDoubt.html">FearUncertaintyAndDoubt</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frequently used by marketeers--in the absence of objective data (or even in its presence!) to demonstrate the superiority of their solution/product, try to make that which is being sold seem familiar, comfortable, and coming with minimal risk.  <em>Wouldn't you really rather buy IBM?</em>  The companion technique--again--of <a href="FearUncertaintyAndDoubt.html">FearUncertaintyAndDoubt</a>.

      <p>
        The term "<a href="WarmFuzzyFeeling.html">WarmFuzzyFeeling</a>" often has a derisive meaning--implying that the perceived advantages of something (the "warm fuzzies") are superficial, and that the person perceiving the <a href="WarmFuzzyFeeling.html">WarmFuzzyFeeling</a> is reacting based on emotion and/or instinct, rather than doing a careful analysis of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Term also refers to emotions one feels upon doing something that someone believes to be a good thing.  (Or a bad thing that one enjoys; CatBert is known for getting warm fuzzies from implementing obnoxious HR policies that further afflict the poor employee's at Dilbert's corporation).
