        <a href="HalSmith.html">HalSmith</a> is Hal Smith, who has been a bit twiddler and propeller head for a long time. He also has a non-computer life, on occasion, such as being a spouse and parent in a family of propeller heads.

          -1029. Life goes on. Hal has retired from the company by pulling the rip-cord on early retirement, and exercising a non-goldend parachute. This happened in the summer and he is just getting around to updating his page.  Keeping up with the times and <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> can take time.  Maybe now. I can, maybe I will get another J.O.B........ So I won't keep up as well. And I have refactored newest to oldest.

               January, 2006 In addition to the above, I am now doing IT budget planning and continuity planning. Oh fun!  And fighting with the SecurityNazi mentality folks about what developers need to be able to do. <em>n.b. original was not instead of now, but no real difference in the long run</em>

               circa August 2004 I should know better than to go on vacation and expect to come back to the same job assignment.  Since lat summer 2004 I have been the lead on our anit-spam team and doing DBA and Web from the application design side, trying to get standards updated and adopted, (can you say CMMI := -0)? and trying to get our remaining developer tools upgraded to current versions.

               He's also an IS professional in a company where he leads a team of Delphi developers for the good stuff. He also supports several legacy "big iron" systems (a.k.a. the bad old stuff) and is going bonkers over the usual lack of staff and impossible user demands. 2000-1229
