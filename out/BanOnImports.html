        Ban On Imports
      </h1>
      <p>
        GiladBracha, a primary author of <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> and now <a href="NewSpeak.html">NewSpeak</a>, posted a couple interesting articles in 2009:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2009/06/ban-on-imports.html">http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2009/06/ban-on-imports.html</a>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The basic argument is that the <strong>import</strong> statement (in its various incarnations across most languages) undermines modularity in a <em>"deep and insidious"</em> way:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           to reuse a module elsewhere, you've got to drag along a whole dependency forest
        </li>
        <li>
           to replace dependencies imported by a module, you either replace either the import statements (invasive) or replace the library named by the import (global).
        </li>
        <li>
           it creates a global namespace, with all the name collision issues
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The articles are clearly written, so I won't repeat the argument here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution Bracha promotes is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           parameterize the modules with the dependencies
        </li>
        <li>
           handle configuration by passing a big <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> around (noting his is a latently typed language)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I can't say I'm fond of explicitly passing around a big <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a>. I wonder if some support for <a href="DynamicScope.html">DynamicScope</a> or <a href="ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext.html">ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext</a> would solve the problem without the hassle. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I'm taking this approach with a configuration language I'm developing (based on <a href="MarkupLanguageNine.html">MarkupLanguageNine</a>), using an <em>implicit</em> <a href="PowerBox.html">PowerBox</a> instead of an explicit <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> (with <a href="ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext.html">ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext</a>, so you can access the powerbox or replace it). The idea is ween the application off the powerbox as the dependencies get deeper. Initially, I was going to use '@import' and '@export' and so on, but on Bracha's advice I'm going to try without imports.
      </p>
      <p>
        My idea is to have each module to specify which 'service' it provides, allowing for conflicts:
      </p>
      <code>
        @module {service=foo, ...}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The idea is that I'll have a directory full of modules. Anyone who asks for '@foo' might select this particular instance. So, rather than importing by name, I'm introducing an intermediate discovery service. If there is more than one module serving 'foo', the choice is made using principles of <a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a> and preference heuristics. (The choice will be deterministic and traceable.) Additionally, the module receives whatever parameters. Given:
      </p>
      <code>
        @foo {a=1, b=2, c=3} Hello<br/>
        World<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The module specified with:
      </p>
      <code>
        @module {service=foo, args={a=A, b=B, data=D}}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Would receive parameters A=1, B=2, D="Hello\nWorld". The parameter 'c', in this case, is lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wouldn't take much effort to produce a simplified summary of which service each module provides, dependencies, security level, policy and features for <a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a>, et cetera so that I don't need to parse every module on startup.
