        Actor Languages
      </h1>
      <p>
        A family of languages (not a specific language) based on the <a href="ActorsModel.html">ActorsModel</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these languages are described by <a href="GulAgha.html">GulAgha</a> in <em>Actors: A Model of Concurrent Computation in Distributed Systems</em> (The Mit Press Series in Artificial Intelligence) ISBN:0-262-01092-5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actors are objects that change role and send messages to mailboxes instead of directly to each other. They are a very elegant distributed programming concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some discussion of the actors model that was here previously has been moved to <a href="ActorsModel.html">ActorsModel</a>.

        PlasmaLanguage and ActLanguage (Act 1, 2 and 3) are the original actor languages designed at MIT by <a href="CarlHewitt.html">CarlHewitt</a> et al.

        <a href="SalsaLanguage.html">SalsaLanguage</a> is an actor dialect of <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>.

        <a href="EeLanguage.html">EeLanguage</a> is an actor language that focusses on the security benefits of the actors model.

      <p>
        <a href="GeraldSussman.html">GeraldSussman</a> and <a href="GuySteele.html">GuySteele</a>'s attempt to understand <a href="CarlHewitt.html">CarlHewitt</a>'s <a href="ActorsModel.html">ActorsModel</a> resulted in the creation of the <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>. A language based on Scheme that is even closer to the pure actors model is <a href="DoubleYouSeven.html">DoubleYouSeven</a>.

      <p>
        <em>Sussman and Steele arguably got continuations wrong; continuations in the actor model do not have the security problems that caused them to be omitted from </em><a href="DoubleYouSeven.html">DoubleYouSeven</a>. In particular, Scheme continuations can return more than once to code that is unprepared for this. In the actor model, OTOH, an actor <em>can</em> be written to respond a continuation more than once, but that would have to be explicitly programmed. Also note that actor continuations are a derived concept, whereas in implementations of Scheme they have to be supported as a primitive.<em></em>
