      <p>
        I've been developing software professionally since 1993, mostly shrink-wrap software.  I have three games to my credit, but lately I've been working at SPSS on graphing software.  I've always been interested in object oriented design and software engineering.  I discovered the Agile movement in 2000, and I've been trying to practice Agile methods and help others be Agile ever since.
