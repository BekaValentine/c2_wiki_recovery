        File Trees To Manage Code Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Because of <a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a>, I believe that the existing hierarchical file systems are insufficient to manage the code of non-trivial applications. I would like to hear other opinions on this. However, most existing tools are hard-wired to work with treed files only. -- A <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>

           Uh, wrong. In many languages, little assumption is made about what "contains" functions; many languages explicitly decouple the structure of a program from the structure of the storage mechanism that the <a href="SourceCode.html">SourceCode</a> is stored in. Many development environments assume hierarchical filesystems, because that's what most operating systems (which host the development environments) provide. But I can't think of <em>any</em> language that requires that its code be in a file in a hierarchical filesystem (Java?). Your average C compiler will happily take its input from anywhere the OS allows - a file, a terminal, a pipe (which allows the source to come from the output of another program - <em>or a database query</em>), or a monkey typing on the keyboard. This is almost always an <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> issue, an environment issue - not a language issue.

           I don't think C is a good example because it builds it's own internal structure before making an EXE file(s).
          <ul>
            <li>
               The same is true for most other things. The one difficulty is languages that do textual inclusion - #include "foo.h" assumes a filesystem in most C/C++ implementations, though the standard states that the semantics of #include <> and #include "" are <a href="ImplementationDefined.html">ImplementationDefined</a>.

           Some languages, like <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, avoid the filesystem altogether by putting everything in an image (see <a href="ImageBasedLanguage.html">ImageBasedLanguage</a>). Many such languages do structure things hierarchically somewhat, but an in-memory image can easily be organized however you like - including along relational lines.

        How does A know where to find B in an interpreted environment?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Interpreted" language usually only refers to the back-end. Most interpreters parse as much text as they can, and build up the symbol table as they go. A has no problem finding B, as by the time A gets to run, B is already in the symbol table and is well-known. Most symbol tables are somewhat hierarchical (a symbol table can be an element of an enclosing symbol table, this is how nested lexical scopes are implemented), but this has nothing to do with the filesystem. If the language supports eval(), and the argument to eval cannot be pre-parsed; it is parsed when it is run.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some interpreted languages will find B by searching first in current memory cache, then current application directory, then along the OS executable search $PATH, while others will require you supply a location or list of locations to test for the existence of B at run time.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Maybe you should have a look at <a href="IntentionalProgramming.html">IntentionalProgramming</a>. There all "symbols" are in a 'data base' and can be viewed and edited in different ways. I heard Outlook was built this way. -- <a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a>}

        <em>Maybe that is the problem. If the language has its own "symbol table", then we have a </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> sin with regard to the database. At least some of the symbols, such as function names, are already in a table if you use a RDBMS to manage code.

        <li>
           A symbol table could be implemented as a relational table, easily enough... and given that the parent attribute of any symbol would be a symbol, you could even do useful joins on such a creature. Most compilers don't do that for performance reasons.

        <li>
           All modern programming languages already have a "dictionary" <a href="DataStructure.html">DataStructure</a> as part of definition or standard library; so no violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> occurs here. Unless, of course, somebody decides to write their <em>own</em> dictionary class, in which case they're just being stupid. :) And of course, the discussion of the symbol table is rapidly diverging from the topic of this page, which is use of files, more specifically <a href="HierarchicalFileSystem.html">HierarchicalFileSystem</a>s, to manage codebases.

           My goal here to improve human management of code. If performance is the only reason not to, then at least lets explore the future when such concerns will seem silly. O/R mappers, for examples, are performance hogs, but people still use them with the assumption that it performs a software engineering benefit. There are many situations where managing complexity is more important than benchmark performance. Note that a file server is usually not part of the desktop that runs an app from the file server.

        It seems to me that you are just trying to emulate <a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a>. This may be good if you don't want to mess around with an OO model for your data. But, the downside is having some messy SQL code deciding which function is really called, instead of a single and elegant call, and letting the compiler or runtime to decide which one is really called.

        <em>Why is it "</em><a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a>"?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I guess that if this happens at compile time, it is just some way of conditional compilation. However, if you do this at runtime, you basically are applying different (but probably related, so the query has some sense) functions depending on the data, without going into a if or switch statement (in C and the like) to determine the function. That I see as <a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a> (in a broad sense).
      </p>
      <p>
        >>My goal here to improve human management of code. swing-developer replies: this is a jolly good idea, and an RDBMS is a natural fit. There's a lot of information which is lost when code is edited, and if the editing of code had as a side effect a transaction within a database, then that act of editing itself, complete with some aspects of the intent of the human who did the edit (let's start there at least) could become a first class citizen. That's very interesting information. Of course, I myself could never stand to give a reason why I had committed something to version control and no programmer is going to accompany every edit with a little story about what they were thinking, but that's not required. Performing refactorings like "rename variable" or "extract method" have built into them, if they're executed as committed macros (which they all are nowadays) what that aspect of intention was. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It may not sound like an interesting thing to know that such and such edit was performed as part of, say, a global rename of some variable, but that information identifies the persistence of a thing, that variable, which otherwise might be missed. Identifying the persistence of things which may mutate forms over time is a first class Hard and Interesting problem that can be leveraged in very many ways. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, in the case of "extract method", it would be hard to know that the appearance of some lines of code that used to appear in Method A but are now missing from that method yet appear in Method B is definitely an example of "extract method" without recording the execution of extract method explicitly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The utility of the RDBMS in this scheme is it provides a gatekeeper through which all edits must pass thus providing a way to know when any line of code has been edited, which in turn permits arbitrary code to be run in response. As it is now, there really is no centralized mechanism that distributes the fact of the event of an edit.  Furthermore, edits can come from any number of processes or actors. To obtain global knowledge of all edits, you could try to write document listeners for each file, and integrate that into the IDE (if you have access to the source), but without the cooperation of not just the IDE but all plugin writers who cause edits to occur also, you can't know what the intentional semantics (a made up term whose meaning should be clear within the context of this post) of an edit were. Writing listeners that listen to every file in a project is No Fun. Trying to interpret the meaning of those edits just from the changes they inflict on a file is Even Less Fun.

           Huh? What do filesystems (hierarchical or otherwise) have to do with this? Or are you equating <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a> with hierarchical filesystems (and their bastard cousin, the dreaded <a href="NetworkDatabase.html">NetworkDatabase</a>) just because it's tree-structured? I'm not sure what you are getting at here, top. At any rate, most languages <em>do</em> work with <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>s, and other than perhaps <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> (which uses filesystem hierarchies for its package structure - a design decision that is controversial within the Java community), most languages don't care one whit about how persistent storage is structured.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you read the JLS spec, there is nothing that requires filesystem hierarchies, it is just that many IDE designs thought it was advantageous to take advantage of that mechanism to "find" source files from FQNs so that they didn't have to maintain an index of classname to file location.  But they now have so many symbol location tables and all kinds of other meta-data that it is rediculous.  Eclipse will not accept a source file not located where it package says it should be in the filesystem hierarchy.  Netbeans will, but it doesn't use any mappings so if a file is not in the correct directory, it will get compiled over and over because netbeans will look in the same relative directory path for the output class file and since it never gets compiled there, netbeans always thinks it needs to recompile.  Filesystem access and directory traversals are expensive because they are "small" amounts of data transferred between kernel and user space using tons of calls.  Databases can be much more performant because they transfer large amounts of data over open ended pathways (the network) and you can use multi-threading/multi-tasking to weave the data transfer latency into other operations. - ggw

Your claim that "[l]anguages are tuned to hierarchical file systems out of historical habit" is incorrect for Java and Smalltalk (and probably C, C++, C#, etc.). Most of them aren't "tuned" to any specific storage system but allow compilers/interpreters to define that. IBM's Visual Age series worked this way in an attempt to facilitate team coordination. The idea was interesting but the implementation was problematic (code and comment format between methods wasn't preserved properly, for instance). Today most teams keep their source in a version control database and check out entire files as needed.

           [Certainly. Most compilers, interpreters and virtual machines read source and/or byte code from files. I didn't know that was being questioned.

           At this point I suspect it is because of performance issues. Databases are generally not tuned for such purposes in practice. But, <a href="MooresLaw.html">MooresLaw</a> and the need for a "structure" more powerful than a tree may eventually change the decision equation. (AS/400's file system can allegedly double as both a hierarchical system and relational.) If anyone encounters reasons other than performance, please let us know. I admit I was sloppy in my usage of "language" versus "interpreter". I apologize for that lack of precision and any confusion it may have caused.
        </li>
        <li>
           [First, languages don't require a structure more "powerful" than a tree. They don't even require a structure <em>as</em> powerful as a tree. All they need is a map. Many modern languages provide hierarchical namespaces to prevent name collisions, but those namespaces are flattened in implementation to become part of the names. For instance, when a Java VM loads "com.foo.Bar", it doesn't load "com", then load "foo", then load "Bar". It loads a class named "com.foo.Bar". It could just as easly be named "comfooBar" for all the VM cares. The tree is merely a convenient way for humans to organize classes. Second, performance hasn't been the problem. The problem has been lack of benefit. Keeping code units in a database hasn't been demonstrably more convenient than keeping them on a filesystem, and in some ways it's less convenient.]
        </li>
        <li>
           I meant for <strong>human convenience</strong>, not necessarily machine or algorithm convenience. Large code trees seem to suffer many of the problems described in <a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a>. I sometimes have to create a parellel "meta-base" to keep track of file or code snippet attributes. Granted, if I wrote the code in such trees, I would probably have taken steps to reduce problems encountered, but directory trees in practice just grow into messes.

           [So you're saying that a bag of classes will be less messy than a tree of classes? Why would that be?]

           It is easier to keep to <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> outside of trees. Trees don't handle orthogonality very well, as described in <a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a>. One needs to go outside of trees to fix some of that. As far as "messy", I find normalized tables the most convenient, but If we are just comparing trees to other navigational (non-relational) structures, then it is hard to say which is more "messy": the duplication needed in trees, or the spider web of pointers in the other solutions. Sometimes the tree is better even <em>with</em> duplication, but sometimes not. It is a nasty battle of duplication versus tangled pointers. It is like deciding between being forced to go to work naked or in drag.

        The <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> implementation of <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> stores all user-defined code definitions within a relational database.  All code resides in the database as source.  There is no code repository outside of the database.  Upon the first invocation of a given function, its source code is looked up in the database, compiled to an executable form, the executable form is cached, and finally it is executed.  Subsequent invocations execute the cached version.
