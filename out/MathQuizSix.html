           What is the meaning of this sequence?

      </ol>
      <code>
        [1,2,3,2,1,2,3,4,2,1,2,3,4,3,2,3,4,5,3,2,....]<br/>

           Take an integer <em>x</em> greater than zero. Add together the squares of each digit. Repeat. <em>x</em> is a "happy number" if the result ever becomes 1. For example:
          <ol>
            <li>
              : 1+1=2
            </li>
            <li>
              : 4=4
            </li>
            <li>
              : 16=16
            </li>
            <li>
              : 1+36=37
            </li>
            <li>
              : 9+49=58
            </li>
            <li>
              : 25+64=89
            </li>
            <li>
              : 64+81=145
            </li>
            <li>
              : 1+16+25=42
            </li>
            <li>
              : 16+4=20
            </li>
            <li>
              : 4+0=4
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

        Therefore, 11 is not a happy number in base ten. It can be proved that all numbers that are not happy numbers in base ten make the same sequence repeating: 4,16,37,58,89,145,42,20,4,... Prove that in base 4, all numbers are happy numbers.

           Ask the Romans! <em>(Actually, you are close to the right answer! But it is not completely correct, and you have to be more specific as well.)</em> [I could have been specific, but the clue proves I know without totally giving the game away.] <em>(Oh, OK, you know, you win!)</em>

           Trial and error. <em>(No. You have to do it without trial and error. Trial and error is not proving anything!)</em> [Plus induction, obviously. Someone else has completed the proof below.]

            Sketch: 1, 2, and 3 digit numbers are happy (Try them all; 1 itself is trivially happy, despite being the loneliest number). For an n digit number with n>3, we have 9n<4**(n-1), and the sum of squares of digits is at most 9n and so has fewer than n digits, and is happy by <a href="ProofByInduction.html">ProofByInduction</a>. <em>(OK, I guess this is correct.)</em>
