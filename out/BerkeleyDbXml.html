        This is one of the better known native <a href="XmlDatabaseServers.html">XmlDatabaseServers</a> that can also be run under <a href="WindowsOperatingSystems.html">WindowsOperatingSystems</a>. It is based on the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>d BerkeleyDatabase.

        I am looking for an expert to help build an MSWindows <a href="ComComponent.html">ComComponent</a> that can allow <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> to create and change XML DOM objects, using dbXML as the storage medium. I would like to use this as a means to learn XmlProgramming but I lack <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> skills. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of where to get <a href="BerkeleyDbXml.html">BerkeleyDbXml</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml">http://www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml</a>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I do not know whether the SleepyCat version listed above is open source or not. It is available for download so assumption is taken it could be free for developers.

           <a href="BerkeleyDbXml.html">BerkeleyDbXml</a> is based on BerkeleyDb C library.

           dbXml is pure Java, and is more recent.

        <em>What does it mean pure Java, does it work at all in Windows 9x and using Microsoft Java?</em>

        Note that "native XML" is a bit misleading.  <a href="BerkeleyDbXml.html">BerkeleyDbXml</a> is a layer on BerkeleyDb; it parses XML, cracks it up into fragments and stores these in the original db format.  The interface is extended by a mechanism to execute queries against the Xml tree.  Apparently it can also create indices to accelerate the queries, though I had no luck in getting to perform anything, let alone with decent performance.
