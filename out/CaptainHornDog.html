        Captain Horn Dog
      </h1>
      <p>
        And you thought <a href="CaptainHornHair.html">CaptainHornHair</a> was bad? How about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You guys keep working to fix this planet's problems.  I'm off to improve relations with the naked green chicks.
        </li>
        <li>
           I've had superintelligent chicks, alien queens, fembots, real live godesses, even Joan Collins in her prime. But even though we just met you make me feel like I never felt before.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
           Climb up into the <a href="JeffriesTube.html">JeffriesTube</a> with me, yeoman. No, you first ...
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
           Lieutenant, when stranded on a frozen planet, sharing body heat is a vital survival technique.
        </li>
        <li>
           I know the rest of Starfleet updated the female crew uniform years ago, but on this ship, we honor tradition!
        </li>
      </ul>
