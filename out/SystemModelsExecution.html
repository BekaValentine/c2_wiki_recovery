        System Models Execution
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> contains, in its runtime environment, a model <strong>of</strong> its runtime environment. Methods and blocks are invoked from instances of Context, which act like stack frames. Instances of contexts are linked together into instances of Process.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Smalltalk, therefore, a "continuation" can be defined as part of the behavior of the execution of block. This means that when the block is "continued", for example on <strong>any</strong> exit, the virtual machine can resume execution at the specific context where the continuation was applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes it possible to assure that the continuation is executed upon every exit from the block (even exceptions), except under the most catastrophic of situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The execution model of Smalltalk also makes it possible to support powerful exception facilities within Smalltalk.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know whether <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> models its execution in this way, but I believe it is possible. <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, without special attention from the developer or environment, does not model its execution this way, and I believe it is very difficult to make it do so (I once started <a href="ComponentSoftware.html">ComponentSoftware</a>, a company that spent several years and much investor money attempting to accomplish this feat. Ontos accomplished such a model, but it was large, cumbersome, and very very slow).
