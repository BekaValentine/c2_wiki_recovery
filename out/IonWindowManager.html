        Ion Window Manager
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ion is a somewhat minimalist X11 <a href="WindowManager.html">WindowManager</a> which does not partially overlap windows being managed. It is usable with both the keyboard or the pointing device, favouring the keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        The screen is divided into frames, each of which can have as many windows as wanted. Within a frame, only one window is visible at a time; a system of tabs in the title bar space is used to switch between them. There is support for as many workspaces (like VirtualDesktops) as need be.
      </p>
      <p>
        It resembles screen(1) in its multiplexing of the available display (see <a href="ScreenMultiplexor.html">ScreenMultiplexor</a>).

        Ion uses the <a href="LuaLanguage.html">LuaLanguage</a> as an extension and configuration language. See the Ion-devel <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> at <a href="http://wiki.ael.be/ion/">http://wiki.ael.be/ion/</a> for documentation, scripts, configuration files and other tricks and thoughts.

        For me, Ion is the only window manager worth running. If it is not available, I use the Linux console or screen. -- <a href="PanuKalliokoski.html">PanuKalliokoski</a>

        Development of ion stopped sometime in 2009.  More recently a fork called notion is being actively maintained and is available here: <a href="http://notion.sourceforge.net/">http://notion.sourceforge.net/</a>
