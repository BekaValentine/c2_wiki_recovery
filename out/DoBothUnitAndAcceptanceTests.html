        Do Both Unit And Acceptance Tests
      </h1>
      <p>
        Would someone care to expand on why thorough <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s would not be superior to <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s?  Why do both?  (I may be missing what is implied by that statement, "XP <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s belong to the programmers, and <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s to the customer.").  -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        My take on it is this: <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s (nee <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s) for a system make the customer confident that the system does what he wants.  <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s for a class make the developer who uses the class confident that the class does what she wants.  There are some differences, of course (e.g. the developer can change the class; the developer might even be the one who wrote the class; etc.)  But the principle is as old as Simon and Garfunkel: "One man's ceiling is another man's floor."
      </p>
      <p>
        This goes for black-box vs. white-box, too: a test for a component that just uses its interface is a black-box test for the component, but a white-box test for the system as a whole.  (I still don't know what a <a href="GrayBoxTest.html">GrayBoxTest</a> is supposed to be.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So "Why do both?"  You do the <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s to make sure you give the customer what he needs.  You do the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s to make sure you give the developers what they need.

      </p>
      <p>
        A simple answer to the "Why do both?" question is: Because a combination of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s will yield a better overall benefit-to-cost ratio, than <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s alone. Depending on the size/type of the project/organization, the ratio will be different. <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s alone are not viable due to exponential explosion of the number of test cases as the system grows: each new feature will multiply the cost, but only add to benefit. Plus, <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s (which are also frequently <a href="ProgrammerTest.html">ProgrammerTest</a>s) provide unique benefits, such as liberating developers, and allowing to test parts of the system hidden by design (think caching). -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I write unit tests because they help me program faster, with less stress, and they improve my designs. <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s are too big to help with detailed design. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        But how do <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s help? It's unclear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unit testing, to me, is the obvious and logical extension of Divide and Conquer. Without unit testing, we're reduced to testing all 67,934 lines of code in a project. I've been in the situation of working with a developer who didn't unit test; during integration, I was constantly having to diagnose bugs in his code. I think time spent building and running unit tests will always (or almost always) be made up with faster acceptance testing and less rework at the end. -- <a href="BillyChambless.html">BillyChambless</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I disagree with the phrasing.  You still have to test all 67,934 lines of code.  What you avoid, perhaps, is having to test all of the possible paths/combinations - 5 + 5 tests rather than 5 * 5 -- </em><a href="DanilSuits.html">DanilSuits</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well.... I agree with your disagreement with my phrasing. I should have said "...all 67,934 lines of code at once...". If I know for certain that the Do_Stuff() method does what it's supposed to, I must be calling it wrong. -- <a href="BillyChambless.html">BillyChambless</a>

        <dd>"<a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing = friction" turns out not to be the case. Programmers who use test first programming find that they go faster, not slower, over the course of the project. In addition, they get better interfaces and simpler implementations.

        This might be true in some people's experiences. It isn't in mine. Every time I write <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, they get in my way. Now, perhaps this has to do with the difference between what I define <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and what XP defines <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. In which case, I think we probably agree. <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s make life good.

        I agree people won't write <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. They're boring and they don't improve people's lives. <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s allow <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> at a subsystem level, not a class level. Here's a hint: your user doesn't care what classes you use, just whether they work. Your testing shouldn't constrain your ability to improve the class tree of the system design to improve the business value of the system of the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOME people wont write <a href="UnitTests.html">UnitTests</a>s. I wite them all the time because they are fun and they have improved my life a huge amount. They are fun because I get continual positive feed back for very little code. They have improved my life because I know my code works and if I change something I have a safety net. And when someone sends me a bug report it takes me ten minutes to prove it's not my code.
        Here's a hint: Your customer doesn't care about anything as long as your application meets their expectations. What's a class? Nicely formatted code? Design Patterns? Smalltalk? They don't know what this stuff is and even if they did they wouldn't care. You could have the worlds most beatiful code or a complete pile of crap, they don't care as long as the app works. Only programmers care and that's what make these sorts of arguments pointless. - hjm

        My interest in software process is entirely about coping with software development given the stresses of the industries I work in. I have to move <em>fast</em>, and I prefer to not write bugs (they show up by the <a href="LawOfDemos.html">LawOfDemos</a>). So, developing optimal strategies is more interesting than developing provably correct strategies. Strictly speaking, writing a lot of tests is better than not to improve the confidence of a correct system, but it's much slower. It's also annoying, so people (including myself) don't do a good job of it. These are real concerns.

        Could it be that <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s more easily automated than <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s?  And isn't the presence of <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s generally required for confident, cost-acceptable refactoring?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I would think that automation is a huge reason to use <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s more often than  <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s. However, automation is why <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are easier to use, not the reason for which you use them. From the standpoint of the customer, they don't care about <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are for the programmer; to insure that when he/she finishes coding that the code accomplishes the task designed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is especially useful when one is writing large groups of classes that are interdependent. Without <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s you cannot be sure a piece is functioning until you have written all the dependent parts. Then you end up running your <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s to make sure the new code works? Then you end up spending a good deal of time pulling apart the pieces to track down the problems. <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s allow you to be sure the code is functioning before completing the other pieces, and writing them takes much less time then debugging 20 different classes at the same time. -- ToddEdman

        I've been using developer tests at the executable unit level rather than the class level for development and I haven't seen this problem.  I have been following the basic <a href="TestFirstDesign.html">TestFirstDesign</a> approach where I add things one at a time and I find I usually do not have to change a lot of things at once.  I have also used this approach for code refactoring.  The only times I have gotten into trouble is when I try to do multiple things at once, and I am not sure <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s would provide much more help in this case.  The tests are programmer written, so I guess they don't qualify as <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s, but they are also at a much higher level (and quite fewer) than <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, so I am not sure where they fall into the naming conventions.  -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Lately I've been writing a lot of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s (out of my own free will!). They haven't helped me find a single bug, and they are quite extensive. I followed the traditional route of checking all the boundary cases, plus normative cases, random cases, erroroneous cases. They have made my project take about five times longer than it could have taken (one class per day, versus one class an hour). I also have XML files and an XML parser that will flex the entire interface at a higher level, one that's much easier to write for.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't regret writing the tests. The major reason the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s exist is to make the compiler complain when the interface changes as this is a public API. The second reason they exist was because the XML part was written by someone else, so I needed a way to execute my own code, not that it helped. I think my code was too simple to screw up anyway (get, set, get, set, get, set.).
      </p>
      <p>
        But now The XML is sufficient. I've even done some significant reworking. The <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s didn't find any problems (except in themselves), but the XML test files did (errors in graphical output). It comes down to using the right size screwdriver for the job. Sure, we need to use a screwdriver, but picking a jeweler's screwdriver for a 1/16" slotted screw is not appropriate. Of course, the observant reader will notice that they are both screwdrivers; i.e. unit tests and acceptance tests are basically the same thing at different levels of abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, since I had to use a higher level test anyway, if that higher level test gives you sufficient confidence in the system, then that's all you need. Why do more work? I think XP has a point that if you do all the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, you are more likely to do all the ones that count, even if you do more than necessary. But that's kind of overboard (extreme, you might say) for a lazy slob like myself. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

      <p>
        Sunir, my immediate reaction is that you're writing too many <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s.  It's as if, in the old days of commenting code, someone said, "I tried commenting my code and now it takes me three times longer to write code"-- you would react that they must be writing too many comments, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        In my experience of writing a single, isolated class, testing adds about 50% more time and roughly doubles the amount of code.  I test only the things I think might break, plus a few extreme and degenerate cases.  I do not test everything that could conceivably break.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the <a href="TestEverythingThatCouldPossiblyBreak.html">TestEverythingThatCouldPossiblyBreak</a> page, <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a> reminded us that the 80/20 rule applies to testing: <em>"80% of the benefit of testing is gained with 20% of the effort that would go into the mythical "complete test" (if there is such a thing)."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me also quote an anonymous post on the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> page in answer to, <strong>Are we Testing Too Much</strong>: "The purpose of unit testing is to increase developer mobility. It is not to verify the correctness of your program. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Are you testing privates? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Are you testing simple accessors? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Are you trying to make unit tests perform 100% code coverage?"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But what's even more important is what happens later in the project, when I have multiple, interacting classes.  I find that unit tests greatly shorten my development time.  They help me reconsider my design, reorganize my classes, and even sometimes eliminate classes.  Any of my co-workers can look at the code, notice a simplification or refactoring, and do it, secure in the knowledge that the unit tests will prevent them from breaking anything.  Pretty soon, a user comes to us with a new, unexpected feature, and we're able to add it in just an hour (rather than taking a whole day, as in the past) because the design is so modular and flexible.   Remember, the goal is increasing developer mobility, not verifying correctness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have proof, but it's my experience that <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s add about 50% more time in the beginning but save "a lot" of time later in the project.

        It sounds like you're working on your own and not pairing with an experienced XP developer.  Take a look at the <a href="ObjectMentorBowlingGame.html">ObjectMentorBowlingGame</a> for an example of writing only tests that matter.  In that example, there are 104 lines of bowling-scoring code and 114 lines of test code.  The session also has examples of refactorings inspired by unit tests.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The page <a href="CanYouHaveTooManyUnitTests.html">CanYouHaveTooManyUnitTests</a> cites an example with "30,000 lines of production code with about 5,000 lines of test code comprising 500 tests.  In this case, because of heavy dependence upon a database, the tests would run for over 2 hours" which people felt was taking too long, which discourages programmers from running their tests frequently, which is bad.

        ATs (or system or functional or whatever you call them) validate the system; in XP, these are the only things that matter for validation - if the customer hasn't made a test for a requirement - it's not a requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        UTs have two uses - driving the design (test-first) and isolating the code responsible for a defect (defect meaning an AT failing, regardless whether it's a new AT [new feature] or old one [bug]).
      </p>
      <p>
        If we could put that burden on the customer (all required functionality covered by ATs), then we could even go so far as to say that if the ATs pass and the UTs fail, the problem is in the UTs, not the real code.  In a chart:
      </p>
      <code>
        |	UTs	|<br/>
        ATs | pass | fail |<br/>
        ----+------+------+<br/>
        pass|	A  |	B  |<br/>
        fail|	C  |	D  |<br/>
        ----+------+------+<br/>
      </code>

        <strong>Actions:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A - stop working, the system is up-to-date
        </li>
        <li>
          B - fix your unit tests until they pass
        </li>
        <li>
          C - fix your unit tests until they fail
        </li>
        <li>
          D - fix the code until your unit tests pass
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Transitions:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          From A - get new AT, you should end up at C (but could be A again)
        </li>
        <li>
          From B - you'll be at A when done
        </li>
        <li>
          From C - you'll be at D when done
        </li>
        <li>
          From D - you could end up at A or C, depending whether your code actually met the requirement
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> There's no obvious transition to B; the only way to get to B is to remove or change dead code that is still under UTs but not under ATs.  For example, an AT is removed, and you clobber the associated code but not the UTs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The most obvious transition from A to B is to refactor across classes.  You will break your </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s but should not break your <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: In my original comments, I specifically avoided the term "<a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>" and used "functional test" instead.  This was deliberate in order to avoid the issue described below.  Please take care when editing text not to change its meaning.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For this to work, we have to have the ATs done test-first (yeah, that'll happen), and we need a way to add ATs to the suite one at a time.  The ATs "in the suite" are like UTs - they all must pass (except the <em>one</em> you're currently working on).

        I think the area that concerns me most is the level of effort required to keep unit test drivers, stubs, and the actual production code in sync.  It seems the most problematic areas of the codes base I am currently working with involve complex and inappropriate interactions between classes.  What I am tyring to do is preserve the existing system functionality while altering the internal classes and their interfaces.  If I use a set of system level functional tests, I can make my class level changes and verify operation without changing the tests.  If I use class level unit tests, I must change both the code and the test and when I'm done, it is still unclear whether I maintained the system level functionality.  Is this assessment correct or am I missing something?  -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
