        States Using Function Objects
      </h1>
      <p>
        In languages like Java or Smalltalk, function objects are easy to
        create. You can use them to encode stateful behavior. This
        is a variant on ObjectsForState [<a href="StatePattern.html">StatePattern</a> ?].

        Suppose you have file browser with a "More" button.
        When it comes up, it shows only "html" files. Next time
        it shows ".img" files as well. Finally, it goes deeper down
        the directory tree. (Yes, its a bit contrived :-).
        One way to program this would be to keep several
        variables for file types, a "times" variable etc. and use
        nested ifs to do the right thing.
        But this can quickly get out of hand.

        Instead, keep a list of "whatNext" functions that
        holds function objects. Functions in the list are
        invoked one by one, and then it "wraps around".
        In the above example, whatNext is ShowHTML 
        followed by ShowIMG followed by ShowDirectories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maintaining a list or tree explicitly, with a policy
        for choosing what next separates out the
        choice of what to do next from the functions themselves.
        This can be clearer than using ObjectForState [<a href="StatePattern.html">StatePattern</a> ?], where the state
        itself chooses what to do next.
