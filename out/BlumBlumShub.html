        <a href="BlumBlumShub.html">BlumBlumShub</a> refers to a cryptographically strong <a href="PseudoRandomNumberGenerator.html">PseudoRandomNumberGenerator</a> designed by Lenore Blum, Manuel Blum and Michael Shub.

        The sequence is:
      </p>
      <p>
        X(n+1) = X(n)^2 mod M
      </p>
      <p>
        Where M is the product of two large primes P and Q, both congruent to 3 mod 4. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Only the lowest order bits of X should be used, however, in general, the lowest log log M bits. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, to ensure a long period, gcd(phi(P-1), phi(Q-1)) should be as small as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="BlumBlumShub.html">BlumBlumShub</a> is suitable for any cryptographic application, because it has been proven that breaking the generator is at least as hard as factoring M. It is, however, really, <em>really</em> slow.
