I am a Canadian software architect, with projects in the USA and Canada. My primary language is Delphi, with lots of SQL Server and Oracle systems. I have been known to code in VB when hard pressed. C++ is not a forign language, but Delphi code is clearer. 

My software designs have been primarily business and financial, with transaction volumes ranging into the billions of dollars.

Architecture is a tool of common sense. Anyone who brings their A game, and expects high standards will debate these matters and think about them often. But all of these ideas will be defeated by narrow minded managers insisting on doing things the old way. (Yes I recently suffered at the hands of such a person, who was the repositor of my paycheque. Alas my determination to do the best work possible met with the ire of another Canadian boss who thought I was trying to make him look bad.)

The two best reasons to change anything, are 
    1) improved confidance in the outcome, and 
    2) lower energy required to achieve the desired outcome. 
Quality and effort. As disciplines, 6 sigma, and Lean.
