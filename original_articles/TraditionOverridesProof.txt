It is just too hard to produce an SimpleProof of why a particular approach is better, lets just say it is better because it is what someone alse we trust told us, lets follow tradition, simple proofs are just too hard.

Maybe we can extract a law from this, something like:

*As the size of the text describing (or the amount of experience required to understand) the Proof (or ObjectiveEvidence) increases, the likeness of it becoming a Tradition increases too.
