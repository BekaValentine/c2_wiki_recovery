It's TuringComplete, after all... and use of InterCal for your next project has advantage of increasing demand for programmers, hence boosting the economy.  If we all used InterCal rather than those wimpy OO languages with GuiBuilder''''''s and GarbageCollection and HigherOrderWhatever''''''s, we could find work for every programmer in the US, Europe, India, China, and Japan...and still not finish any productive software on time.  '''Then''', automation would grind to a halt, and numerous other workers who were replaced with computers would find work again.  

Hey, it's an idea.... :)  And besides.  It's still better than Java.
