Add-on for AppMaker generating code for Windows including resources. It can generate code either purely for MFC or for PowerPlant on MFC using the PP2MFC library.

A cut-down version was included on the CodeWarrior Pro8 CD's as a free Windows resource editor, using the demo AppMaker and just generating resources and header files.
