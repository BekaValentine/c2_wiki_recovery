(WikiWordified in this ugly way to avoid spelling mistakes. A compliment is a favourable remark.)

This concept can be helpful when thinking about things which elude your MentalGrasp, but currently I'm having a hard time explaining how or why.

In my mind this is an UncrystallizedThought, but in the minds of people like NielsBohr and RobertOppenheimer it was a .. tool? A way of thinking?

Despite the fact that physics introduces the idea at A-level (or earlier? I forget. 16 year olds can be expected to parrot these apparent facts, even if they don't understand), it wasn't until reading MakingOfTheAtomicBomb by RichardRhodes that I saw how it affects thought.

'''Examples in physics'''

	* There are pairs of properties which, according to the UncertaintyPrinciple of QuantumMechanics, are linked. The more you know about one, the less you know about the other
		* Position and momentum
		* Energy and time
	* Particles and waves

'''Other'''

''(things I haven't fitted to the plan yet)''

	* MappersVsPackers, ''re.'' ReciprocalityTheory.
Maybe the mappers shouldn't write off the packers. Maybe they should embrace also their packer nature? Will ReadRefactorWrite. Three 'R's.

	* GoodAndEvil? Or is that stratching the point?
