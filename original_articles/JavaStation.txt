Now superseded by the SunRay "information appliance", the JavaStation was a small NetworkComputer running JavaOs, the HotJava browser and other Java apps and tools. They had award-winning industrial design (which happened, in this case, also to be quite good industrial design), but were almost useless as computers. Apparently, with some effort they can be turned into low-powered Linux boxes (see http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/JavaStation-HOWTO/).
