You'd think that the SQL-92, ODBC, and JDBC standards would make it reasonably easy to write programs that can work with many different RelationalDatabases.  They help, but there's a long way to go.  I'm starting this page to document differences between SQL databases as I find them.  Hopefully it will turn into a useful resource.

Some portability issues to get started:

	* PortablePrimaryKeyGeneration
	* PortableSqlDataTypes
	* PortableSqlMetaData

How about:
	* Selecting at most N records, SELECT .... LIMIT N vs. SELECT TOP N .... vs.?

EditHint: Consider merging with DatabaseVendorLock, because this is small.
