You are a PatternPerson if:
	* You constantly bring up Patterns at design meetings.
	* You tell your friends that the GangOfFour book changed your (programming) life.
	* Your copy of PLoP94 proceedings is already showing signs of being well-thumbed.
	* You find yourself constantly quoting ChristopherAlexander in work related software documentation.
	* Your co-workers avoid you in the halls when they see you carrying the PLoP94 book, any book by ChristopherAlexander, or the GangOfFour book.
	* You get angry when a co-worker tells you that Patterns are just another way to write documentation.
	* You 'reload' the RecentChanges page more than twice a day.

Are there more identifying traits?
