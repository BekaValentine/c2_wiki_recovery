While wiki is a collaborative environment where the exchange of information occurs between wikizens, one must also consider that some consider it to be a spectator sport.

It would be well for authors, editors, refactorers, and others who initiate and transform ideas in this space, to make sure that what appears will reflect this awareness.

To that end, navigation mechanisms can and should exist to make the reading of wiki a rewarding experience.
