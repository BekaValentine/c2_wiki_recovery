'''Choices''' is an ObjectOrientedOperatingSystem written almost entirely in CeePlusPlus.  It utilizes FrameWork''''''s, DesignPattern''''''s, and ObjectOriented concepts extensively.

* Choices is written as an object-oriented operating system in C++. As an object-oriented operating system, its architecture is organized into frameworks of objects that are hierarchically classified by function and performance. 
* The operating system is customized by replacing subframeworks and objects. 
* The application interface is a collection of kernel objects exported through the application/kernel protection layer. 
* Kernel and application objects are examined through application browsers. 
* Choices runs on bare hardware on desktop computers, distributed and parallel computers, and small mobile devices. 
* Choices is supported on the SPARC, x86 and ARM processor architectures. Virtual Choices (VChoices) also runs under UNIX System V and Linux.

* There is a paper that was presented at OOPSLA96 on instrumenting the system.  It has some really good ideas about profiling object oriented systems at the object and subsystem level. [ftp://choices.cs.uiuc.edu//Papers/sane/arch-vis.ps.Z] BrokenLink (see below next Horizontal Rule)

Architecture-Oriented Visualization
* HohlalefiSefika, AamodSane, and RoyCampbell, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
** Tracing the changing dynamics of object-oriented frameworks, design patterns, architectural styles, and subsystems during the development and reuse cycle can aid producing complex systems. Unfortunately, current object-oriented programming tools are relatively oblivious to the rich architectural abstractions in a system. 
** This paper shows that architecture-oriented visualization, the presentation of system dynamics in terms of its architectural abstractions, is highly beneficial in designing complex systems. In addition, the paper presents architecture-aware instrumentation, a new technique for building efficient on-line instrumentation to support architectural queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the scheme with case studies in the design of the Choices object-oriented operations system.
