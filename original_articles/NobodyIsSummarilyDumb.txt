Barring physical brain damage, I don't believe that anyone is really just born dumb. Their brain is working on something. It just may be focused on something that we deem unimportant or irrelavent. It may be sports, social conflict, etc., but it is still working on such problems. For example, if maybe one can relate math to a sport that a sports-fan is quite familiar with, then it might click. It is translating something that is remote or foriegn into something that is familiar and comfortable. Similarly, maybe if somebody could put social etiquite into a mathematical or algorithmic form, then a socially-lacking math nerd may be able to at least act more sociable when needed. We all have frameworks in our head. No framework is perfect, just a (hopefully) very UsefulLie. Some problems fit that framework, and some don't.
