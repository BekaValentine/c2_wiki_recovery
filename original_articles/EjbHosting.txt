Can EjbHosting be an alternative to HailStorm?

Imagine a scenario:
Specialized companies offer hardware for EjbHosting,
where EjbServer''''''s are installed and maintained.
Software developers deploy their applications on these
EjbServer''''''s.

Users can access the ejb applications, where keep their personalized 
data. The services can accessed by different tools
(e.g. with a WebBrowser, a mobile or with a Java applications).

''And how is this different from a standard ASP (Application Service Provider) hosting agreement?  There are literally dozens of ASP-hosted sites I've built with EJB technology...  KyleBrown''

And why would you need to differentiate an alternative to HailStorm by the technology used?
