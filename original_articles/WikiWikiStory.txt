'''Wiki Wiki Story'''

'''O'''n February, 28 2004 a GoogleSearch brought a NetiZen to a WikiPage deep within TheWikiForest. The SearchParameter lost the moment he began to read. From the first WikiWord he knew this was different. He had that feeling you get when you find something that you never knew was lost.

'''T'''he words clung to him as if they were his grandfather telling him a story. As he clicked his way through the pages he began to realize that he was in the midst of a completely different world. With EditText on every page, the WikiPuppy had discovered WardsWiki.

'''T'''he more he read the more he wanted to become a WikiCitizen. He created his HomePage and continued to read while CollectingSeashells along the way. He learned about WikiHistory, WhyWikiWorks, RecentChanges, and so much more. He even had the pleasure of meeting a WikiCitizen and caught a glimpse of a WikiGnome.

'''S'''oon, he began to watch RecentChanges and RecentEdits and he realized that a tremendous amount of WikiMaintenance is required to keep WardsWiki presentable to WikiVisitor''''''s and helpful to WikiNewbie''''''s. He understood that WhyWikiWorks is due to the dedication of many WikiGnome''''''s, WikiCitizen''''''s, and more.

'''E'''ager to learn more, Tim traveled deeper and deeper into WardsWiki. However, the deeper he traveled the darker it became. Filled with contradiction and WikiWar''''''s, somewhere along the line, the WikiSpirit had broken. WikiPage''''''s throughout WardsWiki have been stopped in their tracks via ThreadMode, SignedComment''''''s, and AnonymousDonor''''''s. Smelling of disaster from the BigWikiFireOfDoubleOught to more recent EditWar''''''s, TheWikiWay somehow carries on.

'''T'''hinking about everything he learned from GoodStyle, to PatternMatching, and from the FrontPage to SisterSites, he was reminded of a saying from a long time ago. ''ItWorksIfYouWorkIt'' As new as he is to wiki, Tim believes in TheWikiWay and the LifeForce planted by WardCunningham. With his team of InvitedAuthors and all those that have come and gone, Ward has inspired this WikiCommunity. In honor of WardCunningham and all of the WikiCitizen''''''s of TheOriginalWiki, I invite you to join in on '''CleaningWardsWiki'''.
