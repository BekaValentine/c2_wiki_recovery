JDOMax is no longer an active project. It has been supplanted by ShadesDb.

JDOMax was a non-commercial implementation of Java Data Objects (JDO) based on Object/Relational mapping. JDOMax was designed from the ground up based on the JDO 1.0.1 specification.

JDOMax provided command-line tools designed to automate the process of O/R mapping. If you are starting with a Java object model, JDOMax will autogenerate an XML-based object-to-table mapping file, as well as SQL table creation scripts. JDOMax also provides a GUI for playing with JDOQL and navigating objects.

If you were working with an existing relational data model, JDOMax provided the flexibility to support a variety of ObjectRelationalMapping styles.

JDOMax was very fast. It shipped with a speed test and a webapp.
