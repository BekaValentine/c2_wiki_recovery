I was in the train this morning working on a post for my blog. Lost in the "outercyberspace", no network at all... completely disconnected.

It came to me that with all those wireless devices that are coming to life, connectivity of our applications is not really the question. Getting all those applications to work in a flow of DisConnectivity is. How do we get software to work when connected to a network and keep working when disconnected?

Anybody share the same feeling with all those cellphones, PDAs and TabletPc''''''s?
