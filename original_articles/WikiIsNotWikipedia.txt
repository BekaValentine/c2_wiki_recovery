This page is required reading for all wiki users, whether they be newbie or old-timer.
------

As this wiki matures a curious pattern emerges.

In the olden days, people learned to Wiki here then migrated out to other forums.

These days, WikiPuppy''''''s who grew up with WikiPedia come here. Sometimes, they start applying its norms to our edits.

The following are the norms for this wiki:

* unattributed viewpoints
* original research
* fussing, noise, fun, actual and inactual advances
* ThreadMode, jokes, and transclusions
* signed works by WikiAuthor''''''s
* content shamelessly ripped off from other forums, possibly without attribution
* unsigned works by professional authors

Nothing here needs to be chronically cleansed of any potential for dissent!

The corollary of which is that WikipediaIsNotWiki
