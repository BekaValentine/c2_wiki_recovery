CrystalPalace is the name of a location in LondonTown.

There was once a 'palace' there, actually a rebuild of the exhibition hall from the Great Exhibition of 1851, rebuilt on a hill in south London and burned down in 1934.

There is now a large park with an athletics stadium, a railway station and a London suburb.  Also a TV tower visible for miles around.
