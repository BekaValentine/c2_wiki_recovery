Evading an issue by making excuses or taking the easy way out.  You are arguing with someone and they give you an annoying CopOut, usually an excuse to DodgeTheIssue. Often a person using a cop out will avoid logic and reason in favor of some one liner OneFitsAll excuse like EverythingIsRelative.

''Poop smells bad, I can prove this using logic and science but it is obvious so '''I shouldn't even have to prove it to you''' on WikiWiki. If you want proof that poop smells bad, though, here it is: the human brain detects the poop smell and triggers negative stress chemicals in the brain, making us feel less joyful. If you want more details see the book: "brain chemistry and smells..."''

''Ahh, BookStop! And EverythingIsRelative. You can't objectively say poop smells bad because one man's poop is another man's gold. EverythingIsRelative and poop is a matter of psychology.''

''That's just a cop out, everything is psychological to you, or everything is relative so we can never get anywhere with you... Did you even read the book or article on brain chemistry and smells? I assure you there is hard evidence there about why poop smells bad, it's all there, you just have to read it!''

''It doesn't matter, you can't objectively prove anything anyway! Everything is ultimately subjective. Plus, if you were on an alien planet somewhere else, poop might smell great there, because it is relative to the planet you are on. Plus the guy who wrote that book is just an academic who thinks he is an authority on the subject! He doesn't have any real world experience, he's just studied poop and the brain in his ivory tower lab! There are plenty of people who enjoy the smell of poop, and he hasn't traveled to alien planets where poop smells great.''

''What a CopOut! I'm tired of this CopOut game you play. You just DodgeTheIssue. It's tiring to argue with you.''

''IsYourRudenessNecessary? Where is your C''''''opOutDefinition? Can you objectively prove it's tiring to argue with me, or are you just HandWaving? You claim to use logic, but I don't see it. Logic has numbered lines! Where are your numbers? It's not my fault you don't know science and can't handle the truth about software.''
