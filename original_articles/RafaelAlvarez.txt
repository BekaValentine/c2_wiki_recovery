I'm a Computer Engineer from Universidad Simon Bolivar (Caracas - Venezuela).

I majored in Computer Language Theory (focusing more in VM and optimizations like Partial Evaluation), Artificial Intelligence (focus on Planning and Rule-Based engines) and Application Benchmarking (focus on web-based apps).

I'm a proponent of XP as a software methodology, and a converted into TestDrivenDesign, UnitTest''''''ing and PairProgramming.
