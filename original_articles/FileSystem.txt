CP/M, DOS 1.x, and the original AppleMacintosh didn't have HierarchicalFileSystem''''''s.

The MainFrame operating system VM/CMS had a non-hierarchical file system. That, plus the rather low limits on filename length, made working with it rather ... interesting.

These are nowadays (2005) considered anachronistic and not-quite file systems. That's probably the reason why FileSharing systems aren't called file systems. But historically they are and the modern ones are just hierarchical cousins.
