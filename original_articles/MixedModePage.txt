Definition of a page type that uses both, ThreadMode & DocumentMode.

* Unless specified differently, most pages on this wiki fall in CategoryMixedModePage. That does not mean, somebody added this CategoryTag to that page. It means that the pages are actually used as if they where tagged or defined as MixedModePage''''''s. 
* It is the 'natural' behaviour by default: Somebody starts a page and gives a statement and another adds to it an opinion. 
* The next constructive step would be to add something to that page to makes obvious that it is a MixedModePage. If the creator of that page did not intend it to be mixed mode, it is than about time to clarify that. 
* If the intention was the page to be in mixed mode, after some content has been accumulated, the next step to clarification would be to split that page explicitly 'in the middle' and declare resulting parts to be DocumentMode and ThreadMode respectively.

End of DocumentMode, start of ThreadMode {in this instance this marker is part of the explanation and does not actually indicate an change in mode, so please do not write comments right under it!}

* If DocumentMode was to be the upper part of that evolved MixedModePage, all document like content has to be moved to the upper part and thread like content has to be moved to the lower part of that page, thus doing first steps in the ReFactor''''''ing process. This can't be done too early, because it gets forgotten to do it at all too often. 
* If the activity on that pages evolves further and it becomes quite lengthy, or if the document part has evolved to an extent, that it can de considered as finalized, it is time to depart from the mixed mode and declare the page as in DocumentMode and create a DiscussionPage additionally and move remaining ThreadMode content over there. Remember to create a forward link to the DiscussionPage and from there a BackLink to the DocumentPage! Assign the relevant CategoryTag''''''s to those pages and remove the MixedModeTag from the DocumentPage. 
* HomePage''''''s are originally MixedModePage''''''s as well. Certainly it might help to define a visitors area for those who want to leave personal messages. If one wants others to leave ones HomePage alone, there is the new concept TalkPage. To use the concept DiscussionPage would be misleading because that would indicate a discussion of many about that person who's HomePage''''''name was used to create the DiscussionPage. There are DiscussionPage''''''s about known and unknown WikiCitizen''''''s. They either 'praise' inventors and creators or 'dispraise' activities that seam to fit the definition of WikiTrolling and the like.

There are well over 30,000 pages on this wiki which will almost all be MixedMode in some form or other. The important thing about this wiki is the content which has evolved and keeping it relevant to people who come and read with different queries. It will never be a perfect place with a uniform model of pages. The important thing is that the content makes sense. I can live with some imperfections. -- JohnFletcher
