Since 1985 I have the vision of '''one''' tool that covers all the needs and pains I have experienced in my consulting live.

Hi Mirko, I HaveThisPattern (PfompVision) too, though I'm not as deep into consulting as you, but rather deep into computer-science. I have read quite a lot research papers about realizing such an vision (e.g. ACM TOPLAS). If you have mainly goals, I could help with ''algorithms and data structures'' to realize that vision. -- GunnarZarncke (also from Germany)
