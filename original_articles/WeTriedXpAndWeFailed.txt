WeTriedXpAndWeFailed is what people really mean who say WeTriedXpAndItFailed.

If it is people not tools who solve problems, then surely it is people not tools who fail to solve problems.

On WeTriedXpAndItFailed, there was a different take on it, that I think is more likely to be true, given human nature:

Proponents will say, "We tried X and '''''we''''' failed." Opponents will say, "We tried X and '''''it''''' failed." The unbiased might say "We tried X and were unable to duplicate the successes expected."
