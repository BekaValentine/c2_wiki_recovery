Here are some examples as to how to use CppUnit.
Some are sketchy.

(This example extracted from the CppUnit discussion)


I'm wondering if I can use CppUnit to verify the pre-condition and post-condition of the input parameters. For example, for a function like this

 void swap(int &a, int &b) {...skip}

how can I use CppUnit to make sure that a and b are exchanged? Thanks.

''I'd write something like this (using my particular flavor of CppUnit):''

 void S''''''omeTestClass::T''''''estSwap()
 {
	int a = 13;
	int b = -57;
	swap(a, b);
	unit_AssertEquals(-57, a);
	unit_AssertEquals(13, b);
 }
