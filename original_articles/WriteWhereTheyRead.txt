WriteWhereTheyRead is a technique taken from TipsFromWardCunningham to facilitate communication on WardsWiki.

I suggest persons who adopt this approach cleanup (or better, improve) the page where they have started this kind of dialog.

''If you're still talking about the dialogs people have held on your homepages, don't forget that that's a little bit of a special case, and there typically isn't any harm in your just deleting any such clutter on your homepages.''

''If you're talking about something else, then, umm, never mind. :-)''

* I do refer to pages on subject matters such as Xp, Java, DotNet, etc
* you have not discovered my tactic of moving house, once it get cluttered by other IpUsername''''''s. I do not often read my homepage and did you see clutter? I missed them dearly :( :)
