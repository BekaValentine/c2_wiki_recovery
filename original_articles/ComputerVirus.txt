A secretive malicious program, that attempts to travel from system to system by attaching itself onto other files. Some of these babies use Stealth, meaning they disguise the fact that they are attached to their host, by for instance misinforming whoever asks about the size of the file.

A ComputerVirus can have what is called a "payload" : in this case some extra functionality to do something funny, mischievous or downright evil on the Computer that is infected. Such a SideEffect can be triggered by certain circumstances, like the reaching of a certain date, or the availability of certain files on the system.

Viruses are normally fought using antivirus software - example antivirus software programs are:
