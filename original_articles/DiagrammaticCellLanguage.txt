A UnifiedModelingLanguage for the chemical pathways thru cells. Invented by GeneNetworkSciences ( http://www.gnsbiotech.com ) in Ithaca New York.

A scriptable & automatable notation for describing cascades of chemical changes, including reused subroutines, low or high resolution molecule descriptions, and cellular sub-assemblies. Invented by scientists who write in a clear and humble style .

Gene Network Sciences has created a complete language to describe the molecular interactions that control cellular processes. This language originated from ideas in the theory of computation and linguistics (to be submitted for publication). Using this language, GNS has created the most complex molecular circuit diagram of colon cancer to date. 

''Strong metaphors, circuits & computation, but there are some who think these metaphors are actually holding biological science back.''

The above notation covers what cells do. The notation describes how they do it, but adds very little. Forgive the scientists who pad out their disertations 
waxing philosophic about things like wiring diagrams that they don't really understand, but for biology to go forward they must soon scale
a very high mountain range of incredible complexity. Every little bit helps.

The diagram looks more like a ProcessDiagram than a WiringDiagram. Those who understand the term P&ID would also see the similarity. As such it takes on characteristics exhibited by multiple and singular processes, including those which are contained or uncontained, controlled or uncontrolled, interacting or not, dependent(interconnected) or not, processes which can be completed, or are continuous or those which are intermittant(triggered/initiated), therefore requiring many programs.
