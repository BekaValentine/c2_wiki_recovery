GeraldWeinberg in his foreword says "It's customary, when writing a foreword, to say "I couldn't put the book down." I can't say that about Journey of the Software Professional. I not only could put it down. I had to put it down often."

I keep picking it up, and find useful things every time. Keep showing parts to colleagues with "read thisses" or "try thats". -- MartineDevos
