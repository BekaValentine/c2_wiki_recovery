AgilePlan is a hosted solution for projects.

It supports the Extreme Programming planning model with iterations, stories and tasks. Estimates and completed points get entered on task level and added up on story and iteration level. Business points can be given to stories to show priority.

The second part of this hosted service is a bug and issue tracking system. All text attributes of an issue can be customized to support different areas, e.g. different products, HW/SW, etc.

To round it up we added a wiki for the project documentation. All plan and issue data and wiki documents can be downloaded in a zip-file at any time. There is a free limited service for testing and non commercial projects and two paid levels with more capacity.

We use a very flexible framework underneath - so if you need a special feature just tell us and we can add it quickly.
