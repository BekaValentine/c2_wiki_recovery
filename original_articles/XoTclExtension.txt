Is XoTclExtension just an extension? It seems to me to be a complete language that just uses ToolCommandLanguage as an underlying layer. Perhaps there should be just an XoTcl page. -- BenThomasson

All ToolCommandLanguage extensions are more or less new languages that use Tcl as the underlying layer. That's exactly how Tcl is meant to be used.

Would anyone object to renaming this page (and all references) to be ExtendedObjectTcl?
Seems like a good name, given that "XOTcl" stands for "Extended Object Tcl".
