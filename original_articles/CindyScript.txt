CindyScript is an easy to learn yet still very powerful FunctionalProgrammingLanguage. It is designed to allow high-level interaction with geometric constructions or physical simulations created in Cinderella.2. Nevertheless, it can also be used as a standalone language for performing mathematical calculations.

20081106 just found it after looking at some cool applets in http://www.gfalop.org/I/ 
It's new to me, and I wanted to see what c2 had to say about it.
A new language for the WikiWikiWeb! -- ChrisGarrod

* Samuel A. Falvo II sez: ''The language appears to be very strongly inspired by IoLanguage, as far as its syntax is concerned. I like the syntax, at least, even if I'll never use the language. :-)''

* It looks ok, though somewhat awkward. I don't see much sense in functional control flow. I would have chosen to make minor extensions to JavaScript. There's probably more code written in C, C++, or JavaScript than anything else. Comfortable syntax and semantics.
