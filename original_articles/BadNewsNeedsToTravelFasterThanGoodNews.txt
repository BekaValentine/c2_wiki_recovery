Common sense if you think about it.  XP appears to support this.  GoodNews needs to be the norm (all the tests passed), rather than BadNews (the build is broken).  Unfortunately, many of us have worked in shops where the inverse is true.  --SalvatoreSferrazza

''Doesn't this assume a conservative culture in which no news means no change?  On a high risk project that's frantically searching solution space for something that works, good news needs to travel fast, too.''

I think the travelling at issue is more up the management chain and to other divisions working on related projects, than among teammats working closely together.
