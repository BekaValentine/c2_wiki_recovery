XpUniverseTwoThousandTwo abstract: ''One of the core values of XP is feedback, which involves going beyond just talking about something to actually doing it as quickly as possible, because only then do you know if it makes any sense. So, instead of just coming to XP/Agile Universe and talking about XP, why not do some XP, too? It seems fitting to go beyond just talking about abstract concepts to actually implementing them in a simple format. In the style of OOPSLA's AnalysisFest, DesignFest and CodeFest, with their waterfall view of software development, you can participate in XPFest at XP/Agile Universe. Contact: DuffOmelia''
