I've wanted to be an extreme programmer long before I knew there was such a thing.  Those things I did which were extreme were easy.  Those things I did which weren't extreme were hard.  Still, I spent many years thinking that I didn't understand programming, because some Very Important People wrote some Very Important Books to tell me that my code must not be very good after all, because I wasn't following The Process.

Those were hard years.
