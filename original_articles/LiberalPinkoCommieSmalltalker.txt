The opposite of a RedneckSmalltalker:

You are a LiberalPinkoCommieSmalltalker if

	* You choose to live in countries with comprehensive national health services and do not take out private health insurance even if working (undercover) in a 'city'bank
	* You support gun control

	* You travel to work by public transport
	* ... and don't own a car
	* ... and don't know how to drive
	* ... alternatively you may cycle in
	* So that you can keep writing code while commuting
	* ... except when cycling in

	* You write class comments
	* ... and sometimes even method comments

	* You also write documentation (red cover optional)
	* ... but not too much (save those trees!)

	* You use a neat testing framework
	* ...religiously (using this word, as always, as a metaphor)
	* ...even if those rednecks wrote it

	* Refuse to smalltalk with Austrians (''the nationality, or the economic school?'' ;-)
	* ...unless they commit treason

	* You think it's great that Smalltalk treats every object equally to every other object
	* ... in fact, you've redefined Object== to make this the case :-)

	* You describe refactoring as "class struggle"
	* Every class is a working class

	* You dismiss SOAP-based systems, because they are only for the "chattering classes"

I think it must be significant, somehow, that this page is decidedly '''not funny''', unlike RedneckSmalltalker.
