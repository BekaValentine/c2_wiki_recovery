Even though I typically enjoy structured documents, I have to say that my first impression of PatternForms (such as the CanonicalForm and GoFform) was that:
	* They placed an unnatural order on documents.
	* They relied on previous understanding of the form.  ("'Forces'?  Forces on what?", I asked.)

Over time, I've learned to understand PatternForm, and now feel that in many cases using it is a great way to document an idea (for example, "LetsPlayTeam").

My point is this:  There is a certain amount of overhead that each person will have to go through before PatternForm becomes a natural way to read.  Until the reader has gone through this, they could be distracted by it, defeating the point.

'''Solutions:'''
	* If a document resists being put into the form, consider it a TextSmell to be heeded.
	* Put a link to the PatternForm you used.  This will be redundant to those who already get it, but for those who don't, it could help a lot.

Forces are easier to understand if you understand EasternPhilosophy. Other lessons from the East that are important include simplicity, especially in names and explanations.
