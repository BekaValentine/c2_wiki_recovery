Disposable Information has two complementary meanings:

	1 Information is available and you can use it here and now, e.g. tomorrow's weather forecast.
	2 Information has to be thrown away when obsolete, e.g. yesterday's weather forecast.

However, while yesterday's forecast is not today's forecast, it is an input to today's forecast, so the information is not really disposed of.

Disposable information is a form of RealInformation because it includes context, ironically, it is the context which is ephemeral and which results in the disposal of the information. -- JonGrover
