A user could read two or more wiki's at once by the following means -

Create a WikiUrlScheme so that links are of the form wiki:WikiTopicName. The user's browser can then subscribe to a specified set of wikis, and interpret a URL of the form wiki:WikiTopicName by bringing up pages from all the subscribed wiki's that have that topic name. -- PhilipDorrell

''ThankYou for re-concepting the WikiPortal project. Have fun!''

''"re-conceiving"? -- Did you mean coming up with the same idea, or did you mean creating a different concept with the same label?''

''You're welcome!  Great minds think alike! (-- AnInnocentBystander)''

Are the pages to be displayed sequentially (As in MartinFowler's Bliki) in the same frame or window or separately? There would seem to be more value in a sequential representation.
