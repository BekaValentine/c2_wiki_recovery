95 theses about the communication between companies and customers, which a long time ago was a conversation between human beings.

The weakness of Cluetrain is that while it describes an emergent process, which is goodness, it acts like there is no way to influence the process, which is blatant crap. What I am looking for is a business book that describes an initial set of "rules of business" with good emergent properties and a process for tracking and evolving those rules. --KentBeck

''Oh. I thought it was about communication.'' -- OleAndersen
