SqueakMap is a public package catalog system for SqueakSmalltalk 3.2.1 and later versions.  '''SqueakMap has become the standard way to register and make packages/applications available for Squeak users.'''  It is designed to be accessible from a SqueakMap client installed in a Squeak system, from which packages can be easily searched, browsed and installed.  SqueakMap only offers rudimentary access for conventional web browsers.
