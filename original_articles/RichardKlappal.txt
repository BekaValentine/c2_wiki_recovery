I was a software engineer and software quality engineer for 15 years at Bell Labs in
Naperville, IL, but was part of the 50,000 laid-off in 2001.  I have a certificate in Software Quality Engineering from the American Society for Quality.

Interests are software development processes and software quality, astronomy, and photography.  I am currently working on some documentation for The Amateur Sky Survey.
