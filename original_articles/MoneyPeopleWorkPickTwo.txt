I've heard an interesting saying. If your job possesses a '''good two out of three''':

* Money
* People
* Work

Then keep it. Maximizing all three is so rare and/or temporary that it is an unrealistic goal.

Also consider '''One good, two more than acceptable''' or in general: FindingTheMiddleWay. For me, it currently looks like:
* Money 0.8
* People 0.9
* Work 0.4
which sums to 2.1, which is OK.

''I know some people I consider fractional.''
