I work in the Museum world and am trying to help set up group working projects.

I was so impressed with wikipedia.org that I'm seeing if I can do something similar with my own sites.

NoteWiki looks great but could I export the pages to another web based wiki at a later time?

''If all you use is text and WikiWord''''''s, you shouldn't need much conversion.''

I'm really after a wiki that I can implement on the web as easily as NoteWiki.

I've used SeedWiki and found it good but not sure how and when they start charging as I have so many ideas I'd like to try out!
