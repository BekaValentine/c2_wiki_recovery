 I don't remember the good old days
 before this Wiki could delete.
 Pardon me while I enter the frays
 revealing my repressive streak.

 I'm a DeleteJunkie;
 I delete more than I write.
 I'm your topic police
 squad of one tonight.

 If your HomePage is too short,
 or your argument too long,
 if your humor too thin,
 or you ripped too much bong.

 I'm a DeleteJunkie;
 I get community spirit
 taking down poetry too
 'cause I don't want to hear it.

 I'm a DeleteJunkie
 I know where you live,
 get my kicks with a click,
 and I don't want you to give.

 And I can't learn
 So I just burn
 Your low spiels
 Defying high ideals

 I'm a DeleteJunkie,
 what you create I delete.
 You can't avoid my key,
 as it makes me feel complete.

 If you don't take the hint,
 and foolishly restore.
 My eyes shine with a glint,
 as I delete it once more.

Brilliant! :-) Wonder if any DeleteJunkie''''''s will get the hint....

Just as it's easier to destroy than create, it's easier to delete than refactor. Deleting small pages is simply picking the LowHangingFruit.

''Thanks, to AnonymousDonor, for mistaking as "brilliant" my attempt at D''''''eleteBait. I was just taunting the deleters they can't delete me taunting them with terribly bad poetry begging to be deleted.''

''However, the more newbies discover this Wiki, the more droning blogs and WalledGarden''''''s it may attract, so Delete away, holmes!''

 Delete Police they live inside of my head
 Delete Police hide out under my bed
 Delete Police they're coming to arrest me
 Oh no!
and so on, to the tune of "Dream Police" by Cheap Trick

I'm so tempted to delete this just for the irony...

InSovietRussia, Wiki delete YOU!
