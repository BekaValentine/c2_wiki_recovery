For little bit, that is. 

Besides being a place where original content is generated and discussions and give and take following, Wiki is a good place to make notes about things that will make WardsWikizens AwareAndAccomplished.

This they do by sharing with each other important related stuff found in other places. Breaking or BleedingEdge technologies, whether software or hardware related. Also pointed to from here are artifacts of reference which elaborate or reinforce stuff that is here.

Many things I might never have known about, I heard about first in this place from other wikizens. This is what I call Springboarding. The things of help may be files containing text, graphics or multimedia. 

Kinds of stuff:
* Programming Languages
* Programming Techniques and Methodologies
* Subject Matter Experts and Sites
* Questions and Answers shared among participants
* Helpful and Related Videos and Podcasts
* Introductions, Clarifications, CriticalThinking
* and as always TheOtherThings
