The author of ''Cybernetics: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine''

[ISBN 026273009X], 


''The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society'' [ISBN 0306803208], and many other seminal works in the computer industry.  I believe he invented the term 'cybernetics', derived from the Greek 'gubernetes', a governor (?).

(Hey, I'm surprised he didn't have a page before!)
