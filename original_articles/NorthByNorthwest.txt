One of AlfredHitchcock'''''''s best movies.

Starring:

	* Cary Grant
	* Eva Marie Saint
	* Martin Landau
	* James Mason
	* Leo G. Carroll
	* Jessie Royce Landis

Synopsis:
	 :	Urbane Professional Roger O. Thornhill is mistaken for a secret investigator by a group of nefarious spies. They try to kill him and then frame him for the murder of a diplomat. In order to clear his name, he ends up chasing them across the county, to a climax at MountRushmore.

Considered the prototype of the JamesBond films. As far as ProtoType''''''s go, this was NOT one to throw away.

Albert "Cubby" Brocolli, who became the producer of the James Bond films, was a friend of Cary Grant's since the 1930s. 

A wonderful scene in ''High Anxiety'' when Mel Brooks asks someone to meet him at the "north by northwest corner."
