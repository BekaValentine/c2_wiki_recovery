A DesignPrototype is a prototype developed to explore and understand a system's implementation architecture, according to SucceedingWithObjects.  It forms the basis for evaluating performance, and redundancies or inconsistencies in design.  This may be part of what is meant by the terms SpikeSolution and TracerBullets.  --RandyStafford
