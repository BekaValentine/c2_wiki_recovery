''Seuss ain't at all bad, and far better than anything that comes out of the mass media, but please don't let this be all you read your children. RudyardKipling's "Just So" stories, Grahame's ''Wind in the Willows,'' Lindsay's ''MagicPudding'' and of course AaMilne's ''WinnieThePooh'' are just as good if not better than Seuss. Older children will further appreciate Lofting's ''Doctor Dolittle'' series, White's ''Charlotte's Web,'' and Gibbs' ''Snugglepot & Cuddlepie.'' If you want your children to become extraordinary people, begin by reading them stories written by extraordinary people.''
