Hi. I recently graduated from an Interior Design course at Leeds Metropolitan University in the UK. I'm looking for work in London: if anyone needs a bright young thing for their office (!), let me know!

I find the concept of wiki sites very interesting, though a little scary. What's to stop someone changing this after I've gone? Nothing, it seems. Doesn't that result in chaos? Apparently not. Maybe there are more good people than bad on the web after all?Cheryl.

Abusers won't come back anyway I suppose. Good luck with finding a job :-). DreadNought ''Yes, someone might change it maliciously, but then a WikiGnome will fix it back.''
