CategoryMethodology:
-----
From "Little Gidding":
 ''We shall not cease from exploration''
 ''And the end of all our exploring''
 ''Will be to arrive where we started''
 ''And know the place for the first time''
-----
From Lewis Carroll's HuntingOfTheSnark.  

 ''He had bought a large map representing the sea, ''
 ''Without the least vestige of land: ''
 ''And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be''
 ''A map they could all understand. ''
 '' ''
 ''"What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,''
 ''Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?" ''
 ''So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply ''
 ''"They are merely conventional signs! ''
 '' ''
 ''"Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and  capes! ''
 ''But we've got our brave Captain to thank:" ''
 ''(So the crew would protest) "that he's bought us the best --  ''
 ''A perfect and absolute blank!" ''
