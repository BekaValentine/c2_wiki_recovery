A CORBA implementation in Smalltalk.  Born, at HewlettPackard, as HP Distributed Smalltalk.  Sold to ParcPlace-Digitalk in 1996 and renamed Distributed Smalltalk.  Interesting features include:

	*  Support for transparent (IDL-less) communication between Smalltalk images
	*  Hiding much of the CORBA infrastructure
