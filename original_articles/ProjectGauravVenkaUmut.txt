As far as I understand we are not supposed to play with the words switch their places, etc. it is the 
job of the MT system. We will just tidy up. Concerns we may want to look at,


1.	Capital letters:
	a. at the beginning of the sentence
	b. Country/Human names (Should we be correcting this) (Will we have a lexicon for special words then,
		or will we just use identifying info like Mr. Mrs.?)
2.	Spaces/punctuation
	a. extra spaces before punctuations
	b. There are no dots in chinese example output of MT!!
	c. 
3.	Numbers
	a. million-billion-etc.
	b.
4. 	Signs 
	a. American dollars, cents (what did they want about this, the sign or total name)
	b. Percent (Same question with part a)
	c.
