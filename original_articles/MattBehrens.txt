Full-time Unix geek.  PerlLanguage, JavaLanguage programmer and reverse-engineerer (is that a word?).  Everything-else programmer in my free time.

I like FreeSoftware, though I'm not a fan of the GnuGeneralPublicLicense.  The guys at ZopeApplicationServer gave me CVS access for some strange reason, where I've been mostly trying to squash bugs that I run into, and participating in BugDay''''''s.

I used to run into ShaeErisson on the FreeNode InternetRelayChat network from time to time.
