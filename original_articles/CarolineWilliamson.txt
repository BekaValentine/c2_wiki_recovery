Techie(ish), mostly working in systems design. Don't program much, but can if pushed to. Mostly designing interactions between databases and data processing systems.

''Welcome.''

Thank you. I've been lurking for a while and think I've got the hang of things. Is there anything specific I should read or know?

''Nothing I can think of off the top of my head. I notice you've been contributing to some pages and gnoming a bit. As far as I'm concerned, you're doing just fine. Have fun here! -- ElizabethWiethoff''

Caroline, I'm interested to know what led up to your current work - specifically, what mix you had of directly relevant academic learning, learning from books or training courses, and in-house learning.

''My original degree is in linguistics, but that was a '''long''' time ago. After being out of work for many years I did some freelance proof-reading and copy-editing. Then when working with one of my clients I made a comment about some aspects of a design, and was asked to write a report. It progressed from there. I have no specific training - my ideas are passed to others who then vet and integrate them. I guess I'm not really a techie, but it feels that way. I live between the user interaction design world and the systems interaction programming world, helping the two to get along. I've also picked up some programming along the way, so I can talk with the programmers. -- Caroline''

Do tell. My father is one of the few other people I've ever known who wound up in that kind of job. Back in his day, the "techies" were building the Atlas and Saturn rockets, and his job pinned him securely between the engineers/scientists and the people who had to design, manage, and apply what they did. He had (has, actually) an odd mix of degrees, like General Semantics ''and'' physics, with minors in other stuff, and could quote Shakespeare and sing GilbertAndSullivan. He's 86 and still sharp as a tack. He was, I suppose, a "purveyor of understandings", of which there are far too few in this world. The ability to bridge the gap between two disparate kinds of thinking is a rare talent. I admire that. So, welcome; sit and stay a spell. Tea or coffee? -- GarryHamilton

''Thanks Gary - tea, white, no sugar. I suspect you do me more credit than I'm due with regards the mixing of thinking. It's really all people to me, although working with techies is something of a challenge. They do think differently from the humanities people I originally worked with, but once I accepted that as a real effect, valid and equal, and not just prejudice, then I found it wasn't so hard to work with them. -- Caroline''

Sorry to hear you won't be participating beyond lurk mode. -- Eliz

I suspect I'll just be cautious for a while. It remains to be seen - thanks for your encouragement. -- Caroline.
