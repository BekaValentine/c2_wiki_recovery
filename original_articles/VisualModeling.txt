VisualModeling is a way of building models of systems using an abstract, graphical representation. Not limited to modeling software, VisualModeling is also extensively used for BusinessModeling, OrganizationalPlanning and many other non-software domains. Currently, the most popular modeling language is the UnifiedModelingLanguage, a standardised notation that allows the visual descriptions of systems using an object oriented paradigm. VisualModeling is almost always not sufficient to describe the entire system being modeled and usually a great deal of work is necessary to actually construct the system being modeled. This is contrasted with VisualProgramming (or GraphicalProgrammingLanguage''''''s?), for which the visual model has a 1-to-1 mapping with the code generated, but is generally regarded as lower level and less abstract than VisualModeling.

With recent additions to the UML, such as the ObjectConstraintLanguage and changes to the Activity Diagrams and other features, the gap appears to be closing between VisualModeling and GraphicalProgrammingLanguage''''''s. Also recently entering the scene is a hybrid between the two, known as Instantaneous Round Trip Engineering, that allows models and code to be maintained in sync in real-time. It remains to be seen which method will ultimately provide the best solution. -- DionHinchcliffe
