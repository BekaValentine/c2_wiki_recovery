A paradigm shift in MusicalSequencer''''''s. It has two basic views, the mixer and the arranger. The arranger view is similar to traditional sequencers. The mixer view is the special one.

Each channel strip in the mixer can also be seen as a MonophonicSampler. The material is contained in slots above the conventional channel strip and can be manipulated by selecting them using the mouse etc. The interesting thing is that the mixer is wired into the arranger view. There is a one to one relationship between a line in the arranger and the channel strip in the mixer.

I find it a very interesting implementation of the ideas behind the ModelViewController
