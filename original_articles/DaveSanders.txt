Short Bio

Extreme interest in Wikis, OpenSource, and new computing technologies. I've been working to define my own style of Wiki that is geared more towards Corporate use. Think combination wiki, portal, with enough openness to be useful to the workers, and enough practical lock-downs to be accepted by the "suits". Collaborative Openness is a wonderful paradigm, but some folks have to be eased into it, and a tough "well, that's the way it is" stance only gets you so far.
