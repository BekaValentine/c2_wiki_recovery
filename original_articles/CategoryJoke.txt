A mathematician, a physicist, an engineer, and a computer programmer were each asked to "prove" that all odd numbers are prime.

The mathematician says, "The principle of mathematical induction says that if something is true for the first n, and if being true for n makes that thing true for the next n, then that thing is true for all n. Three is a prime, and that's n. 5 is a prime, and that's the next n, so therefore, by induction, all odd numbers are prime."

The physicist says, "Three's a prime, five's a prime, seven's a prime, nine - let's just throw that one out as experimental error - eleven's a prime, and thirteen's a prime, so empirical evidence suggests that all odd numbers are prime."

The engineer says, "Three's a prime, five's a prime, seven's a prime, nine's a prime, eleven's a prime, thirteen's a prime, fifteen's a prime..." He goes on for a while until the other three shut him up.

That leaves the computer programmer, who says: 
 Three's a prime.
 Five's a prime.
 Seven's a prime.
 Seven's a prime.
 Seven's a prime...
