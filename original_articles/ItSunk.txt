ItSunk was the answer of Russian 2nd presidend Vladimir Putin to the question on Kursk disaster in 2000:

- What was the matter with the submarine, Mr.Putin?

- It sunk.

This is an approach to treat problems, thinkink just of their objective reasons but not of their social, psychological or ontological roots (hence evading possible provocations, in this case too).
