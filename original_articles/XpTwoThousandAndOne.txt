''Keynotes''

* KentBeck's closing keynote compared last year with this. He said that this year, fewer people were asking absolution for doing "not quite XP" and he was hearing more stories of people's experiences, more mentions of confidence and understanding, but also more frustration at others in their environment who don't understand.

* MartinFowler in closing spoke of ExtremeProgramming as a methodology for the minority among the newly-fashionable "agile methodologies". Due to the discipline required to learn (and possibly practice, if there's opposition in the organization), plenty of people will SAY they're doing XP while only halfheartedly doing a few practices. He said he was happy that XP not grow ''too'' fast, so ThoughtWorks would continue to have an advantage. MF recommended that anyone who hadn't had the chance should make sure they work in a team doing "full-bore" XP, emphasizing all the practices. Since the practices work well together, if you haven't seen the benefit of all the practices together, you won't be sufficiently motivated to make sure they all really happen for your next project. He mentioned excellence and attitude as qualities he'd like to see in XP teams, like the rowdy, bawdy, highly-skilled Border Morris dancers he saw perform in England. He advised flexibility of methods and inflexibility of purpose with an eye to the goal of real XP. His promised "inflammatory statement": 80% of companies trying XP will fail. Most companies don't understand how to be people-oriented enough to delegate decisions to implementors; that's perhaps XP's hardest hurdle to clear in many organizations. XP is about ''playing to win'', not mere survival, and requires greater commitment, passion, and determination from the team and the customer than other approaches.

(Some of the participants in the Experience Exchange post-conference workshop gave their attempts to do XP at a certain Fortune 25 company as an example of saying 'XP' without being even close to doing it.)
