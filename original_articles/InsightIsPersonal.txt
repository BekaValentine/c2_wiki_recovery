Insight
* is a P''''''ersonalProcess of perceiving. In that process one relates what is  being encountered or discovered in relation to what one has already encountered. 
* is not a completed work, it is more like the discovery of a path. One might imagine where it will lead, but until one begins exploring and a traversal begins, the destination remains imaginary and will remain so until journey's end. 
* is such that two people walking the same path together will see different things

In the book ''StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms'' is found:

"What you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more."''
