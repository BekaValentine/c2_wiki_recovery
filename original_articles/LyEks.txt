''From LaTex:'' [LyX] is best described as ''What You See is What You Mean''

''From EmacsVsVi:''

It is really "LaTeX for the rest of us".  It's so much more simple and so much more concentration can go to the content, than to looking for that f....ing parenthesis. Use it and love it!

''From WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouGet:''

* LyX is a LaTeX editor with near WYSIWYG capability. The point is, however, that users are not encouraged to change the underlying stylesheet.  Therefore writing and layouting concerns continue to be separated.

* LyX saves documents in plain LaTeX, so tools that can handle the markup can handle LyX documents just like any other document.

* The concept behind LyX is named WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean)
