Adobe is currently fighting a multi-front war. On the one hand, they are preoccupied with countering the impact of XaMl (the XmlPaperSpecification part of it); hopefully the ExtensibleMarkupLanguage based MARS project will be a credible response. On the other, they need to make amends with the alienated OpenSource community, fuming over the Adobe decision regarding ScalableVectorGraphics.
