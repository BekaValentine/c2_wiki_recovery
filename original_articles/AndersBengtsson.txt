Anders Bengtsson lives in Stockholm, Sweden.

The last few years, I've mostly been building things in Java, among those an e-Learning platform in J2EE and a retail business system. Inbetween, I've also taken the time to study the History of Ideas and some Japanese.

Some of my spare time is spent on a RubyLanguage PrevalenceLayer called Madeleine <http://madeleine.sourceforge.net/>. I have also contributed to JRuby, a Java-based version of the RubyLanguage.
