Is this to be considered a virtue?  I sign my major refactorings, not out of ego, but because I am making myself accountable if I have mistakenly caused someone's viewpoint to be misrepresented, or worse, made a falsehood out of a truth.  That way, the offended party can SynchronizeIntents with me, and we can work together on a refactoring that will convey truth and opinion to a wider audience.  --DavidSaff
