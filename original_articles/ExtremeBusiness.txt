New kinds of software business you can enter because you have an ExtremeTeam. For instance:
	* FractionalTeams
	* PublicTesting

When I hit this page coming from ExtremeMarketing I expected something different:

Business done the ExtremeWay (please don't follow this link - you'll find something different), based on the values communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage.

To tell the truth: I expected to invent (discover?) this page myself, but somebody has been here before ;-)

I just duplicated Helmut's experience, after some idle musings on applying the ExtremeWay to BusinessPlan''''''s.

It all starts with a one-page business plan.

Business maps to Investment, Development to Business.

Investment writes InvestorStories. Business estimates and implements them. 

The enterprise has a three-month iteration "heartbeat".

Stories have tests. "Sign contract with one of the Top 5 companies in sector X. Success criteria are as follows..."

There is a chart on the wall telling everyone how we're faring with each of the quantities the business wants to control : Getting Along, Money In, Money Out, Business Tests Passed, Business Tests Failed, Velocity, Burn Rate.

Tell your customers you have no product (or an incomplete product, or one that sucks), but you think your ideas are worth a shot. If you rely on hype, you can't reliably expect to succeed and will most likely fail anyway; so you '''actually''' have compelling reasons to believe you'll succeed. Just tell people about those.

Pretty silly, now that I see it written. But it's interesting that I left a startup dot-com I cofounded mostly for what I perceived as failure on the part of my ex-partner to do any of the above, though I didn't think of the above in these exact terms.

An interesting concept that has infested my brain like a virus. I would suggest replacing the 'Investor' with the 'Customer'; I use CustomerStories rather than (or as well as) InvestorStories. I'm trying this out for a new eBusiness; the CustomerStories describe the experiences of a typical customer interacting with the business.

This same concept has done more than infest our brains - two of us from I.S.  have convinced the company we work for to use Extreme Practices to run the company.  We are calling it ExtremeOrchestration!

I'm curious to know how this concept differs from OpenBookManagement.  Thanks.
