The product of LiterateProgramming. A literate program combines code and documentation; the important things are (1) to think of the documentation as central, not as a tacked-on addendum, and (2) to write the code for the benefit of the human reader, not the compiler.

The best known LiterateProgram is probably TexTheProgram, written by DonaldKnuth. Knuth invented LiterateProgramming. Another major one is "lcc", a small ANSI C compiler.

Another good example is DocTest''''''s for the PythonLanguage.

Much discussion is on the LiterateProgramming page. It should probably stay there.
