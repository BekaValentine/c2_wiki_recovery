Yet another C++ test framework.
http://www.cxxtest.com/

An Eclipse plugin is available on http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/WCWiki/EclipsePlugins/CxxTestPlugin however this plugin only works for so-called "C++ Managed Make" projects.

The CxxTest testing framework is different.  CxxTest does not require fancy C++ features (RTTI, exceptions,...). It uses a Python script, cxxtestgen, to parse C++ header files to perform test discovery, after which it generates a test runner.  CxxTest can be used so that each test class generates a file and then you compile and link them all together, then only changed files are regenerated.
