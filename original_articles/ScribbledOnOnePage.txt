When something new in the system of great business value can be fully communicated between customers and developers in a few minutes this way ... then delivered in short order we know we're ''really'' on track. 

We need to quit apologising for this kind of low cost DocumentToDeliver but celebrate it together, just as journalists, editors and newspaper owners would celebrate an exclusive "Scoop".
