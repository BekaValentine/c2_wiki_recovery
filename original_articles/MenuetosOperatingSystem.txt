	* ''pre-emptive multitasking, multithreading, ipc''
	* ''graphical UI with 16 M colours up to 1280x1024''
	* ''ide: editor/compiler for applications and kernel''
	* ''kernel and application sources included (GPL)''

	* ''http/mp3 servers, 3D maze''
	* ''free-form, skinnable application windows''
	* ''hard real-time data fetch''
