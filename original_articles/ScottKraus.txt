A fan of the C2 wiki for almost 7 years now and a software developer for almost two decades.

I have built many applications over the years primarily using the following language(s):

* CsharpLanguage
* VisualBasic
* JavaScript
* VbScript
* JavaLanguage


Most recently however, I have landed a role within the practice of EnterpriseArchitecture.  All I can say for the moment is that I am certainly enjoying a brand new set of opportunities and challenges associated with taking a holistic approach to strategy development spanning the business, information, application and technical architectures of an organization.  It also a very interesting role considering I am a consultant on an assignment that is filling a variable resource position as guess what, a consultant (to my client's enterprise)!  Good stuff so far...

Like my friend RamonLeon, I like the WikiWay and often post anonymously.
