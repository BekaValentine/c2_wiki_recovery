The first time I heard of XP was in September 1999, when KentBeck gave a lecture about it at Philips Research in Eindhoven (The Netherlands). I knew him from CrcCard''''''s, but at that time he talked about ExtremeProgramming and RefactorMercilessly (never heard of at that time) and referenced the book of MartinFowler. I like especially the articles in the book. The Refactoring itself is more like a dictionary. A Refactor browser for C++ (as discussed in the book and as shown for Smalltalk at the XP2000 conference) would be really handy but will probably only partially materialize because of the complexity of the language :-(.

After the lecture, I found out that the XP2000 was organized in Sardinia, Italy. Met two of TheThreeExtremos there. I also visited XP2002, XP2007 (Como) and XP2011 (Madrid).

In February 2001, I gave my XP presentation (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xp-nl/files) at the Philips Software Conference and organized the XPGame (http://www.xp.be) of VeraPeeters and PascalVanCauwenberghe. 

I wrote a paper for the XP/Agile 2004 conference in Calgary [ISBN: 3-540-22839-X], "An Agile CMM", describing how we managed to become CMM level 2 certified, while retaining our Agile way of working.
