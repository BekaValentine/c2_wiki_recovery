Scrum knows four Meetings:

 * The SprintPlanning Meeting
 * The DailyScrum
 * The SprintReview Meeting
 * The SprintRetrospective Meeting

A Scrum meeting (also called the DailyScrum) lasts 15 min. by definition, and each team members answers these three questions:

	* What did you do since the last Scrum Meeting?
	* What are your blocks? (or What is getting in your way?)
	* What will you be doing until the next Scrum Meeting?

This sounds a lot like the typical StandUpMeeting in ExtremeProgramming.

''They are very similar. Daily Scrums are somewhat more well-defined, but they serve the same purpose, daily feed-back.''

How many people hold the meetings? If there are 15 developers and 1 manager, each would be allowed to talk less than 1 minute?

''Scrum teams should never get that big - a team should be focussed around a specific deliverable for that months sprint. I forget what the recommendation is - but I think it's somewhere around 5-7 developers. This gives 2-3 minutes each, which is actually plenty of time. Note also that the developers answer the questions - anyone else has a non-speaking role. -- BevanArps''

What happens if the blocks last for several weeks? You need to repeat them over and over?

''The job of the ScrumMaster is to remove the blocks. Given that a sprint only lasts for a calendar month, any block not removed within a few days is going to cause significant problems in meeting the sprint goals and supplying deliverables. If a block does last that long, you'll probably need to abandon the sprint and start over. Remember that Sprint Goals are supposed to be the top priorities for the business (with some allowance for technical realities) so any block that isn't removed should be a big issue for the business. That said, I've worked under scrum for around 9 months and never had a block last more than 2 days. -- BevanArps''
