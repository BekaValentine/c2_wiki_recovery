Programmer guy. Jack of all trades in the computer field. Started the page on RurisLaw.

My current interests are language, compiler, and VM design; text processing; and artificial intelligence.

My current pet project is a virtual machine based on the concepts of ForthLanguage called Imari (http://i-0-i.com/parodycheck/software/imari/) and a simple Forth compiler for same.

I also like games. Designing, programming, and playing them. These days, I find that a couple of rounds through RezGame gives me a mood and creativity boost conducive to better hacking.
