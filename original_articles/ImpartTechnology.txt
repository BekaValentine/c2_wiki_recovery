Impart Technology developed software for mobile embedded device communication using ExtremeProgramming. The development team peaked at 4 developers doing ExtremeProgramming in Java. The implementation targeted small environments ranging as large as J2SE, but primarily running on various versions of J2ME and PersonalJava. The team was faced with retargeting to run in Windows CE using a C++ implementation and reproduced a binary compatible (accepted the same binary configuration files as the Java version) version of the software in 10 weeks, including learning Win CE, writing an infrared driver, getting a version of the C++ STL running on WinCE, and porting our customer tests to C++ so we could do system verification of the final result. The customer test loaded and tested configurations using the same binary data set as the Java version of the tests.

Impart Technology filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the summer of 2001.

RobSartin was the lead developer until the whole thing began to collapse. To hear the story, you will need to speak to Rob one on one. The other developers were BradBanister, DeborahCobb, and EricStewart.
