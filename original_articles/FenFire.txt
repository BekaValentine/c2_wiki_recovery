A group spun off of the XanaduProject to develop OpenSource implementations ZigZag-based data representation systems. It's primary products, FenMM and FenPDF, are successors to the earlier Gzz (http://www.nongnu.org/gzz/). Instead of the now patented ZigZag structure used in Gzz, Fenfire uses the RDF (ResourceDescriptionFramework) standard.

There is now (in 2007) a new version of Fenfire re-written in HaskellLanguage (instead of JavaLanguage used earlier), presented as a modest rdf based note taking tool (using GTK), instead of the grand p2p web integrating opengl accelerated desktop environment toolset worked on earlier.
