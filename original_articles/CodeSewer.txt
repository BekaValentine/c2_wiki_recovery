Ew the icky CodeSmell! Look at that poorly factored OO. Ew! Better get ReFactoring right now!

Um, okay dainty-boots, now you come down here to the CodeSewer where I live. I've got 3 million lines of VB3/VB6. Half a million lines of 1980s C. Another half of '''old school''' java. Old Iron databases. Millions of flat files used as SourceOfTruth. None a that InversionOfControl down here. It's plumbing, sister, miles and miles of stinking, steaming, dirty, greasy plumbing. And you can just forget about ReFactoring it sweetie-pie - 'cause you're PolishingaTurd!.

''Just one moment there bud. ReFactoring isn't nail-files and cuticle repair, but no one said it's the only trick in the book. When you find yourself in a CodeSewer what you want is heavy duty hydrochloric TestInjection. Like a white tornado! If you don't like that then I guess you're an OldGuardDeveloper - and I'm injecting around, over, or right through you. Look out!''
