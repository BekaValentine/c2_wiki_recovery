Rust is a low level programming language started by Graydon Hoare in 2006, and developed by Mozilla since 2009. Rust is designed for SystemProgramming or ApplicationProgramming, to replace CeePlusPlus for browser development. The motivation is to develop low-level, fast software with strong type safety. Rust therefore incorporates ConstCorrectness (everything is immutable by default) and innovative pointer types which allow the compiler to do detailed StaticCodeAnalysis to track memory. Therefore typical code needs neither garbage collection nor manual memory management.
