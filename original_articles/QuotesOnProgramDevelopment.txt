	?:	''"Given ten days for a project, a good engineer spends nine days figuring out how to finish it in one day."'' (this isn't much like ExtremeProgramming)

''Whether you think it's Extreme depends rather on how you think the "figuring out" works, doesn't it?

	NiklausWirth:	"The woes of Software Engineering are not due to lack of tools, nor of proper management, but largely due to lack of sufficient technical competence. A good designer needs to rely on experience, on precise, logical thinking, on pedantic exactness. No magic will do."

	CarHoare:	"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies." (See TwoWaysToDesign.)

	SteveJobs:	"To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it's all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don't take the time to do that."

MichaelJackson:

	The First Rule of Program Optimization:	Don't do it.

	The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only):	Don't do it yet.

See RulesOfOptimization.

"Until we have a working piece of code, we don't always know where it spends its time. And until we know that, talk of changing it 'for efficiency' is foolish."

-- BrianKernighan and PjPlauger, from a paper in ''ClassicsInSoftwareEngineering''. 

BurtLeavenworth used to have a very succinct version of this: ''More sins are committed by premature optimization than all the rest of programming motives put together.'' (JerryArchibald)

DonKnuth also said that "PrematureOptimization is the root of all evil."

also "belated pessimization is the leaf of no good." from len lattanzi

	unknown:	"I can ALWAYS build faster code if it doesn't have to work."

	Somewhere in QualitySoftwareManagement, JerryWeinberg asserts this rule::	"If a system doesn't have to actually ''work'' it can meet any other criteria."

One of Tom's quotes above sounded familiar, and triggered some digging.
GeraldWeinberg uses a similar line in ThePsychologyOfComputerProgramming (p. 18).
The setup is that a sticky problem has just led to a project being canceled. Our hero has devised a solution that may save the day, and is presenting it to the members of the project team. We enter as they react:

	 :	"And how long does ''your'' program take?" he asked - emphasizing the possessive.

	 :	"That varies with the input," was the reply, "but on average, about ten seconds per card."

	 :	"Aha," was the triumphant reply. "But ''my'' program takes only one second per card."

The members of the audience - who had, after all, all contributed to the one-second version - seemed relieved. But our hero, who was rather young and naive, was not put down by this remark. Instead, he calmly observed, "But your program doesn't work. If the program doesn't have to work, I can write one that takes one millisecond per card - and that's faster than our card reader."

"By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of the race. Before the introduction of the Arabic notation, multiplication was difficult, and the division even of integers called into play the highest mathematical faculties. Probably nothing in the modern world would have more astonished a Greek mathematician than to learn that...a large proportion of the population of Western Europe could perform the operation of division for the largest numbers. This fact would have seemed to him a sheer impossibility... Our modern power of easy reckoning with decimal fractions is the almost miraculous result of the gradual discovery of a perfect notation."

I couldn't find the right Java page but...

Quote of the Day:

"Java's primary roots are out of the C++ world. From that standpoint, Java is a big step up. It's a cleaner, object-oriented language. And the benefits of a Virtual Machine on every platform are obvious.

"But I came to Java from a different world of programming, the Smalltalk world. For people who program in Smalltalk, Java is a 30-year step back. Smalltalk is what made object-oriented programming real. It had a mature class library and culture from the day it was released, whereas the C++ world just kind of happened. Its class library still isn't stable. The result for me is that Java is an absolute requirement in today's software world, but sometimes it hurts me to use it."

"We trained hard, but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams, we would be reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralization." -- PetroniusArbiter, 210 B.C.

"Claiming Java is easier than C++ is like saying that K2 is shorter than Everest." -- Larry O'Brien (editor, ''Software Development'')

''Students usually demand to be taught the language that they are most likely to use in the world outside (FORTRAN or C). This is a mistake. A well taught student (viz. one who has been taught a clean language) can easily pick up the languages of the world, and he [or she] will be in a far better position to recognize their bad features as he [or she] encounters them.'' 

-- C. H. Lindsey, History of Algol 68. ACM SIGPLAN Notices, 28(3):126, March 1993. 

Students should be taught a clean language, one which will allow them to recognize the good and bad features of languages used in the world outside. Schools in their invention of curricula should be in a position to know what that language is, and require it. -- anon

** This wiki's own data suggests that some 62% of respondants first started out with BasicLanguage, according to FirstLanguageLearned page.  These same people are now those who advocate against using BasicLanguage.  Ironically, I find those who started with BasicLanguage ''and'' who have since moved to another language to be ''vastly'' superior programmers to those who start out with Java.  Those with even a moderate level of AssemblyLanguage experience is better still.  All of this just proves further that DijkstraIsntGod.

Nonsense. I care about the differences inside my files. I don't care about the differences inside my 10,000 cattle. -- PeteHardie

I actually gave this one a little thought.
	1. It would become very tedious very fast to manually name 10,000 things.
	1. It might not matter a lot, but each head _is_ a little different. At least you would want to know how old each (or each lot) is. As for files, it's easy to see how their distinction is crucial.
	1. You probably don't really care about the specific name given to your file, or care to refer to a cow by a number or another id.
	1. You want to recognize the individuality of each thing, at least for some aspects.
	1. You don't care for the actual names/ids given to each thing.
	1. The quotation makes a lot of sense in light of all this.
-- RobinMillette

For some file types (particularly pictures, video, drawings, and correspondence), thumbnail icons, summaries, keyword lists, and creation or last-modified-time are a lot more useful than names.

''Summaries and keyword lists are names - or at least take as much time as names; timestamps are provided by the OS (hopefully); thumbnails are hard to search by (as of 2008).  Quite often, those who claims names are obsolete are coming from a Windows background, where each file type has a "default" or "preferred" application associated with it, and things like tax returns would be associated with that program (Quicken, TurboTax, etc), and the program would only show related files.  In a more open system, with options for many programs to use data, you need a way to get the specific file to an arbitrary program, hence the names'' --petehardie
