Hi,

I'm Senior Agile Coach at Zenika(France) and very interested in what happens with pattern. I presented a paper at EuroPLOP'98, the Transfer Pattern, and another at PLOP'99, the User Information Feedback Pattern Language ! Curiously, it's only the second time that I went here. I apology, the first time, I didn't sign up!
