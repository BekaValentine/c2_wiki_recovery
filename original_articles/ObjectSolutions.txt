CategoryBook: ''Object Solutions: Managing the Object Oriented Project'' by GradyBooch, ISBN 0-8053-0594-7.

A book by Grady Booch about, well, managing object-oriented projects. Published in 1996, it pre-dates the RationalUnifiedProcess and even the joining of forces of the ThreeAmigos. Of course it is written in the typical GradyBooch tone, but it does contain some nuggets.
