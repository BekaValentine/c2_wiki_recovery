Tuxedo is the name of a TransactionProcessingMonitor found on the Unix Environment. It was marketed by BEA, who has a JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition product called WebLogic.

TuxedoMonitor was acquired by BEA from NovellCorporation in the mid 90s, and is said to be diffrentiated from the much larger MiddleWare competitor by its capabilities in the DistributedComputing arena.

Anybody knows whether Tuxedo is used much in a DotNet shop (i.e. no significant JavaPlatform presence) for transaction management purposes? And what advantages one can get over the "free" MS equivalent?

Tuxedo is now an OracleCorporation product since BEA was bought by Oracle.
