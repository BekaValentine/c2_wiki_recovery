Essayist and novelist. One of the "CyberPunk" group of 1980s ScienceFiction authors, along with WilliamGibson, JohnShirley and others.

Bruce Sterling's novels focus on the effect of technology and change on individuals and societies, and are closer in feel to mainstream "literature" novels than the gun-fights and pyrotechnics common in ScienceFiction.

BruceSterling has just created what many feel is one of his best books, and one of the top ten of the SF year, with ''Zeitgeist.'' (The word 'Zeitgeist' means "the spirit of the age".)
