''From IsGlobalismThreateningTechCareers''

One career path for IT workers is to become  or more of a middleman between US based customers and offshore based implementation teams. This is not necessarily a managerial path, but can also be technical, i.e. moving up into architecture, design, requirements gathering, etc... Beyond the technical skills, I recommend learning impeccable communication between teams, because communicating with a team thousands of miles away, in different time zones and cultures, and possibly speaking a different language places completely different demands on the middle person than talking to his co-worker at the water cooler. 

''As the ratio of project managers and/or architects to programmers is often about 3/1 to 8/1, there will be a lot of programmers fighting to move into the managerial or social aspect of software development. There will be a glut there too. It won't be an easy ticket out of the offshoring rut even if you do possess good social skills. -- 66.218.62.204''
