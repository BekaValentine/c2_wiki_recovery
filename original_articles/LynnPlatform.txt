The LynnPlatform is a platform for implementing programming languages, licensed under the BSDLicense. It is designed to be universal enough to implement all types of programming languages within it. It consists of several ProgrammingLanguages, a unified ClassLibrary, and both a LowLevel IntermediateLanguage and a HighLevel Lisp like IntermediateLanguage which is compiled into the former. It is still largely under development.
