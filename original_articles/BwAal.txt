The use of a wiki page as a pointer (link or directive) is a potentially powerful and concise use of the WikiNameSpace

* Here is the link for BwAal
** Books within an arms length
***http://don.fed.wiki.org/view/bookswithinanarmslength

It can serve the same purpose as a button like this
 +------+
 |  Bw  |
 |  Aal |
 +------+
for ease of navigation, the advantage being that descriptive text and perhaps even additional links can appear as in:

* Here is a Topic Tag which serves through the BackLinks mechanism to group all such links or controls
** Grouping WikiName
