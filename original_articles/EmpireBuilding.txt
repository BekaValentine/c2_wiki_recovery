An AntiPattern. When politicos take working teams and try to make them larger or ~steal~ individuals for their own teams.

This AntiPattern can be found in all big software companies. This is a quite puzzling AntiPattern because the reason to steal individuals from another development team to your department is often based on the kind of thinking you can find in start-ups where a particular individual could make the difference in a team. And, as this pattern is often used inside the same big IT corporation, at the end, it is not so sure that the individual will make the difference, whereas the full process is based on number and "scalability" of teams.
