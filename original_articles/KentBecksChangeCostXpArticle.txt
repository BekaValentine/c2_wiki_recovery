''So true, they can't. Consider two new airframes. The one on the left has flown 10,000 hours of tests. At the beginning, it crashed a lot. Lately, it hasn't crashed at all. The one on the right hasn't been tested. You need to get home from this desert island. Which one will you ride in? Justify your answer. -- RonJeffries''

Congratulations, KentBeck and the XP team, on the article in CppReport. I was impressed by RobertMartin's editorial comments: "...it may represent one of the most unique contributions to software development since DesignPatterns". I hope this leads to a new wave of pragmatic methodologies, and a return to the source. -- ScottJohnston
