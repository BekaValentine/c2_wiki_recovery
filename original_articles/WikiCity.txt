'''WikiCity''' is the name of a project at MIT.

''WikiCity can be considered a new platform for storing, exchanging and processing data which are location and time-sensitive, in the line of ongoing deployment of Web 2.0. As such, it would be a significant leap forward towards a pervasive 'internet of things' to support human action and interaction.''

It's a poor use of the word "wiki" because it doesn't allow quick changes to public Web pages in the common understanding of the model.

It has much more to do with feedback systems involving ubiquitous sensors and human agents.
