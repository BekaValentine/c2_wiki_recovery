Courage, Aggressiveness and Fearlessness are all the same - or are they?  ''Of course not --- why would you ever think they were?''

'''Aggressiveness:'''
	 :	You are waiting in line, and I push in front of you.

'''Courage:'''
	 :	You stand up to me by pointing out my rudeness.

'''Fearlessness:'''
	 :	You point out my rudeness by comparing me unfavorably to slime mold, even though I outweigh you by 50 pounds.

'''Courage:'''
	 :	I agree that you have a valid grievance, and I apologize and go to the end of the line.

'''Aggressiveness:'''
	 :	You persist in your slime mold analogy.

'''Courage:'''
	 :	The person behind you in line suggests that the incident is over, and that we all need to go on from here.

'''Fearlessness:'''
	 :	The person behind you in line is a child.

I have goosebumps just from reading this (seriously).

Courage and fearlessness are incompatible -- you can not have both at the same time.  Fearlessness is a common state, where one feels that there is truly little or nothing to fear.  A tightrope walker practicing above a net can afford to be fearless: a fall is merely an inconvenience.  Courage is a resolution to do something in spite of fear, so it cannot be coupled with fearlessness.  The same tightrope walker performing without a net is displaying courage: knowing that a fall could be fatal, the walker goes out anyways.

There are different forms of fearlessness:
	1. Where you are oblivious to the risks
	1. Where you are aware of the risks but simply ignore them. (is this fearlessness or unfounded courage?)
	1. Where you are aware of the risks, but have controlled them.
	1. Where there are no risks
The 3rd and 4th (if it ever happens) situations are good places to be - e.g. Being fearless in your refactoring because you know that the tests will catch any mistakes.

The first 2 seem reminiscent of CowboyCoding.

It is hard to talk about courage without internally invoking images of Superman, the Lone Ranger, John Wayne, etc. This is because we associate courage with the positive characteristics of such heroic figures. The word "courage" brings some baggage along with it.

In much the same way the word "aggressiveness" carries certain negative connotations in most circumstances. In approaching solutions, however, sometimes this aggression is exactly what is called for to break over the barrier of fear to use a new technology or whatever.

"Fearlessness" has no such vibe attached to it because it is not a word we use very much. However, I would like to see the idea of fearlessness promoted in development circles because it would stimulate free thinking and more radical solutions. How can we expand the discussion of fearlessness in design and development? Tests can only be one small aspect of this. Should we start a new page?
