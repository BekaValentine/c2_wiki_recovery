I am currently a university researcher in Heilbronn, Germany (near Stuttgart) working for the [http://www.i3g.hs-heilbronn.de Hochschule Heilbronn <http://www.i3g.hs-heilbronn.de/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiWizardProjekt> where I am developing the WikiWizard Java applet <http://www.i3g.hs-heilbronn.de/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiWizardProjekt> full-time for the JSP Wiki.

I didn't feel like making a webpage with my most frequently visited sites, so I figured I'll just do it on this Wiki.

Hi Chuck - thanks for letting me know about your project. Shame it didn't work - any real conclusions drawn from what happened? Why didn't it work? What did you do wrong? What did you do right?

	 :	Well, the problem was that the project was done for a grade.  Once we got the grade, the inspiration for the project pretty much sizzled out.  The biggest problem was simply that my partner and I had very little experience working with Linux and we couldn't learn it fast enough to make the website work like we wanted.  -- ChuckSmith

Well, I hope you found it interesting and learned a lot from it, even if it wasn't a success in the traditional sense. Best of luck for your future.
