A WikiSubSpace is a group of Wiki pages that all link to each other directly.  

Most Wiki implementations do not implement multiple WikiSubSpace''''''s.  Many Wiki users consider this a DeliberateNonFeature, because part of the beauty of the Wiki is that it forces you to see new connections.  

When you start running a PersonalWiki, though, for mundane things like tracking status of projects, you quickly want to partition your Wiki pages.  

For example, you might have these categories of pages in your PersonalWiki:

	* general brainstorming
	* vacation planning
	* training manual for software you've written
	* current software development project

Each WikiSubSpace could have potentially different requirements.  For example, you might want to back up info on your current work project more frequently than other Wikis.  You might need to do frequent read-only mirrors of the training manual.  Clearly, it benefits you to partition the Wiki.

On the other hand, since all of these Wikis belong to you, you want strong integration between them.  For example, you might get a brainstorm that on your next vacation, you should bring your laptop to work on your training manual and current software development project.  You want to link between your Wikis more directly than by referring to SisterSites.  There needs to be some sort of package/import mechanism to automatically link to WikiNames in another subspace.  Furthermore, a good Wiki engine should recover gracefully when the other WikiSubSpace is not there.
