I am a long-time O-O developer and crusader.  I seem to have a habit of picking underdogs: Amiga, Objective-C, NextStep, Linux, Delphi, Java (well, it was an underdog when I started, anyway).  Some of them hit, some haven't.

As of December 2004, I've joined Advanced Technologies Integration (ATI) in the Twin Cities area to take on an agile project along with KyleLarson, DaleSchumacher, and DionStewart.

In January 2006, I joined Verizon Business, in the IT Solutions group.  (Yep, even the phone company now does IT consulting.)

March 2007: I've just published my book ''Release It'', from the Pragmatic Programmers.  It's all about writing software that will survive the real world, not just pass QA.  I talk about patterns and antipatterns related to the stability, capacity, and operations of systems---especially web sites.
