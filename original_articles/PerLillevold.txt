Hi, my name is ''Per Lillevold''. I am trying to learn something about Wiki. I only know the name from the net like WikiPedia, etc.
----
I am using UbuntuLinux, on my Netbook, and I have just upgraded from 4.10 to 10.10, the netbook version (remix), and I have problems with the new look. It may be efficient, but it is not intuitiv, so I have trouble finding the best way to use it.

But one thing I have found that is useful, is the TomBoy Notes ( http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/ ), the system which creates notes with links, and the webpage tells me that this is linking in a WikiWiki way, so I had to try out what a WikiWiki way is like. TomBoy is also referred to in GettingThingsDone.
----
I know that the man that followed me as an IT administrator in my job (I am retired), did set up a page system for members of the staff to report problems and suggest solutions, he called it som kind of Wiki---. So I guess that one can buy/download the principles of Wiki to one's own server, to make some kind of WikiPages on the internal homesite.
----
Notice: The next sentence was written in my first attempt to write a WikiPage, and in the WikiWay it learned me how to create links: I don't know any links to put here, but maybe the AddingNewPages could work? I know that my page must be quiet for 10 hours, not to be considered as spam. I really hope that I can learn something of this, this is not spam.

I will afterwards try to learn MoreAboutCodes, and if I am guessing right, the WikiWord MoreAboutCodes will appear as a link when this page is saved and reloaded.

Please excuse my writing in English, I am a Norwegian computer user, and in an age of 72 I still try to learn new areas in the use of computers.

I will try to put in the name of my son, a Software Specialist in Seattle, to see if he has a home page in Wiki, his WikiName should be like KarlOlavLillevold. (Note that if there is a blue questionmark at the end of a WikiWord, the word is not detected as a link in WikiWiki, and a WikiWord is written with at least two regular words without spaces and with each word written with capital letters).

I know that this is not a home page like a personal page on the web, but some kind of page that should be useful for the community. I will try to expand it to tell you about my learning prosess in studying WikiWiki. I feel that I have already learned a lot of the Page System, but it is much more to learn here, please read WelcomeVisitors, and StartingPoints will be useful too!

Now I will read TaoOfLinux.
