This project is late. 

We're off schedule. It's three and a half years past the deadline.

You've shown me nothing useful yet. What's the plan,  Johnny?

''I dunno.''

Plan can be a BadWord when a project is late and off schedule. 

The boss wonders what the heck is going on. We have to finally decide on TheCompromise and make ThePlan a go (''even if'' we do not have one).

Sometimes we JustDoIt. Other times ThePlan is stuck in neutral gear. Other times ThePlan is clear and defined.

Plan is a good word when we have one (or at least ''think'' we do).

ThePlan is a GoodThing when it is made by those who have made plans in the past about which it can be said "ItWorks". -- DonaldNoyes.20080329.1340.m05
