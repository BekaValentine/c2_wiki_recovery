A conceptual or common metaphor is one that we use
with little notice.  In fact, some metaphor is so 
pervasive that we must struggle to avoid falling
prey to its subtle suggestion.  Consider ...

	* Good is Up
		* My feelings soared.
		* I look up to him.

	* Thinking is Seeing
		* Let me make that clear.
		* I'm a little foggy about that.

Contrast with the figurative metaphor ...

	* Love me like a Rock

Conceptual metaphors assemble into self consistent
systems that are propagated across languages and over
generations.  

LakoffAndJohnson's MetaphorsWeLiveBy, and also GeorgeLakoff's WomenFireAndDangerousThings, introduce the
theory, philosophy and politics of conceptual metaphor.  Or, perhaps even better, Janet Martin Soskice's "Metaphor And Religious Language" (ISBN 0198249829).
