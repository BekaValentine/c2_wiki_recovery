Probably best to look at WikiHistory before going further.

ItsWardsWiki:

WardCunningham invented the wiki concept, wrote the implementation, invited the first round of authors and hosts this wiki (c2 = Cunningham and Cunningham). That's why this particular wiki instance here is sometimes called WardsWiki (I hope I got all of that correct).

''that's certainly the dogma... are you speaking from factual knowledge, or just repeating what you've heard/read?''

No, it's all just a big scam. Martians passed wiki technology down to us, and they are using Ward as a cover (see WikiHistory for the gory details). What else did you think?!?

Also notice that he thanks you for every edit with his signature.

'''Paragon of Wiki''''''Humility'''

Notice that on Ward's HomePage (at least as of this writing), there is no explicit claim of creation or ownership of the Wiki or of Wiki in general. But there are clear indications that he is at least the Maintainer of the Grail''''''Ware.
