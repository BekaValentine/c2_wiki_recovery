''Hail Eris!''

One of the 20th century's foremost ''fnord'' ratbags. A great fool and indifferent judge of character (see http://www.rawilson.com/who.html).

I just found out about him and thought he was right on. Maybe I am a RatBag too. -- SamShard

Personally, I can't abide by any page regarding R.A.W. that doesn't mention the TheIlluminatusTrilogy.  Oh wait, now it does... ;) 

Always makes me think of GravitysRainbow by ThomasPynchon. Same fractured plot, overloaded ''fnord'' zoo of characters, cryptic references to mysticism, recent or ancient history, and sated buzz when you finally put the 700+ page opuses down.

Classic stuff.
