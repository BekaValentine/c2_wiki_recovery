I came across this book at a computer show or flea market.  I found the book in the bargain bin.  And, it was a bargain at $10 or less.  I had not read Sun Tzu's Classic Work, but I eventually picked up a copy after reading through The Art of 'Ware.  I especially liked the part:
	 :	Hire the best developers - better yet, hire the best developers from your competition.

''Doesn't hiring developers from your competition conflict with the notion of not trusting "traitors"?''
