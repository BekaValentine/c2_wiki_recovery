Hello Wiki!

Time has passed.  I was a WikiExPatriot for a bit but now I'm back.  For a visit or for a long stay?  Time will tell.

Though I'm a Portuguese South African, I discovered WardsWiki while living in the States.  I am now in Ireland and gainfully employed at a company that has been treating me well.  I'm coding mainly in my first love: CeePlusPlus but I hope to pick up some PythonLanguage on my own time.  I'm also curious to try the Lisp-dialect, ArcLanguage, that PaulGraham is working on.

I run GentooLinux on my home computer and WindowsXp on my work computer (sprinkled with the many OpenSource programs that I like and have grown accustomed to using).  I am currently looking forward to Enlightenment 17 (see the movie to see what I mean: http://www.enlightenment.org/data/vid/e17_video.avi)

I think that I'm less of a WikiPuppy now, but I still hope to be of some benefit to WardsWiki and the WikiCommunity at large.

It's good to "re-discover" WardsWiki again.

'''Original Enthusiastic Post'''

Hello Wiki!

I think that Wiki is a great idea and tons better than UseNet. Thank you, Ward.

Within the WikiCommunity, I aspire to be a WikiCitizen with ambitions to be a WikiMaster. Are there any WikiRitesOfPassage that I should know about? ;) Right now though, I'll work my way up from VolunteerHousekeeper and ShyContributor.

I'm currently an unemployed software developer. :( So it goes. (This is a KurtVonnegut''''''ism, found in his SlaughterhouseFive novel) *shrug* It's one of those intermediary stages.

Right now, I live in the United States of America, but I was born and raised in the Republic of South Africa and I have a Portuguese heritage. So I'm a closet sympathizer of Wiki's E.U. ontributors, while having an acquired fondness for my American friends and hosts.

I have an adventurous and carefree spirit, so I am hoping that my skills and career will lead me all around the world. I am trying to realize this be applying for work throughout the U.S., the U.K, Australia, and in Ireland.

A partial list of my interests are OpenSource, DesignPatterns, SoftwareDevelopment, ClassicalLiterature, and FineArt.

I have been a *nix enthusiast for a long time, but I have only recently jumped in with both feet. (The last straw was WindowsXp -- which I feel is an insult to all NT Administrators everywhere.) I am currently whetting my teeth on MandrakeLinux and LinuxFromScratch. I am also looking for an OpenSourceProject to which to contribute. Any one have any suggestions? The MonoProject has lately started to appeal to me.

('''To Elaborate''':  switching from Windows2000 to W''''''indowsXP, I dis-liked the even more impoverished command-line shell in W''''''indowsXP and the bubble pop-ups were driving me CRAZY!  Add to that the "Reporting Back to Mother Microsoft" feature and the fact that I had to re-install three-times in the first month, I then revolted.  From then on I used W''''''indows2000 for gaming and Linux for everything else.  What I especially like about Linux are the plethora of easily available developer tools and the range of different window-managers (desktop/explorer in WindowsSpeak) & virtual desktops (emulated by the Multiple Desktop Power Toy).  Once I finally had an operating system with abundant software and that offered me unbounded control of what was installed and what wasn't, I couldn't go back.)

I have removed a discussion about how the grammar rule "do not end sentences with a preposition" is out-dated.  The discussion itself was interesting but it cluttered up the page.  If  I thought that there was more of an interest in it, I would've re-factored then re-posted it as a new WikiLink.  If I get three votes to do it I will.

(That grammar rule) is not as fashionable nowadays as it used to be. See http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19991013. -- JohnKugelman

Actually (as I just learned in Linguistics this week), that's a particle at the end. A preposition has to come before a noun phrase (this is definitional, not prescriptive - linguists tend to frown on prescriptive grammar anyway). Don't have my notes with me, but if you catch me tomorrow I can go over all the "constituency tests" that let us determine where the constituent boundaries are, and hence the parts of speech. -- JonathanTang ''(you're taking notes, right?)''

THIS is what I like about Wiki. I would never have come across this information before, except by accident. -- Carlos

* American versus Australian usage of prepositions:  ''(Not directly part of the Preposition Rule discussion, but interesting none the less.)''
** ''Good for you!'' (American)
** ''Good on you!'' (Australian)
