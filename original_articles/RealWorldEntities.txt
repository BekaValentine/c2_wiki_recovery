Entities that exist in the RealWorld (or computer models/analogs for the same); also abstract concepts that are not easily defined - what, precisely, is "communism?" '''Don't answer that on this page please; it's a FlameWar that's wholly irrelevant here.''' As opposed to mathematical constructs (such as "integers" and "sets") that can be precisely defined.

Examples of RealWorldEntities

* Man-made objects (cars, chairs, guns, butter)
* Computer objects describing elements of business processes (Invoice, Account, Customer) - whether or not there is a physical entity that the object represents.
* Plants/animals/microbes, other biological phenomena
* Other naturally occurring things
* Ideologies
* Roles that people may take on (what is a "doctor"? Someone with a medical degree? Someone who actively practices medicine? etc.)

RealWorldEntities can be notoriously difficult to model. See ClassificationProblem
