I am a software developer working mainly in the .NET environment.

Besides that, I am still maintaining projects in Microsoft Access.

In combining these two ages of software development I am trying to port good (XP) practices to VBA/Access. As a consequence, I am contributing to AccUnit (http://accunit.access-codelib.net), a unit testing tool written in .NET for Access/VBA.

I live in Vienna, Austria.
