 restricted write access is at the top of each page, allowing text to 
migrate to the top as it becomes progressively refactored

using a soundex phonetic search algorithm
	*rapid-step navigation to previously viewed pages via title bar menu
	*no RecentChanges (RecentChangesConsideredHarmful), no backlinks
