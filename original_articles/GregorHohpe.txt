I lead the Enterprise Integration practice for ThoughtWorks. Contact me at gregor(at)hohpe.com (I hope this keeps the crawlers from sending me spam).

My focus area is enterprise integration. I have spent a few years architecting and implementing integration solutions with EAI packages like TIBCO and Vitria. More recently I started working on JMS and Web-services based integration solutions.

MartinFowler and KyleBrown got me thinking about documenting some of my experiences in the form of patterns.  Since then I have been harvesting patterns from my integration work. I workshopped my paper on Enterprise Integration Patterns at PLoP 2002 (http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2002). 

I posted most of my patterns material on http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com. I am trying to enhance the site continuously as this will ultimately evolve into a book on integration patterns.
