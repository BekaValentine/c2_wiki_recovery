'''UsefulUsableUsed'''

It has its beginnings with an experiment in 2011 which investigated the possibility of and then the implementation of a trial version showing its '''"Useful'''ness".

It then morphed into a demonstration, complete with a series of videos showing how '''Usable"''' and varied it can be.

Now it has passed into the '''"Used"''' phase via a full-fledged Project of multiple topical refactorings, as well as a complete Wiki refactoring.
