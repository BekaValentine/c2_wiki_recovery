Okay, so EllenVanderslice is one of those people who inadvertently clobbered the recent visitors list, being new to an interactive Web site.  I hope I have more or less restored it...

I am currently managing the Pedestrian Master Plan project for the City of Portland, Oregon, Office of Transportation.  Why am I here?  We are interested in interactive Web sites and would like to use this kind of technology for public outreach.

The Pedestrian Transportation Program will soon have a Web page as part of the Office of Transportation Web site [http://www.trans.ci.portland.or.us/]. In the meantime, I can be reached by email:  mailto:ellen@syseng.ci.portland.or.us
