''from the site ...''

Eric Weisstein's World of Mathematics (MathWorld TM) is the web's most complete mathematics resource, assembled over more than a decade by internet encyclopedist Eric W. Weisstein with assistance from the mathematics and internet communities.  

MathWorld is a comprehensive and interactive mathematics encyclopedia intended for students, educators, math enthusiasts, and researchers. Like the vibrant and constantly evolving discipline of mathematics, this site is continuously updated to include new material and incorporate new discoveries. 

CRC Press, who published a snapshot of the site in bookform, sued the site over a copyright dispute, which led to the sight being offline for about a year. More about this can be found at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/docs/.

At 9743 entries, MathWorld approaches the size of this site and is certainly more focused and carefully edited. Except the deal WolframResearch had to strike with CRC makes contributing to MathWorld not in your best interests, unlike the Wiki. (See <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/about/terms.html>.)

''Neither WikiPedia nor PlanetMath have that problem, and they seem to be aiming for a similar degree of math coverage to MathWorld.''
