''Less is more when Wiki creeps into modalities it shouldn't.''

I would think that WikiNameCreep is more a problem than WikiCreep.  Wiki is a reflection of the collective interests of its community.  RecentChanges is a reflection of the collective interests of its current community.  WikiNameCreep seems to occur because of gaps in the collective memory. -- JasonYip

Some aspects of this problem are discussed in RavioliWiki and WikiSuccessCanInhibitNewWriters.
