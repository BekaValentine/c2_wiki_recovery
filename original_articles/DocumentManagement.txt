Document Management is often considered a subset of ContentManagement. In a Document Management system, the number of features is usually reduced compared to a Content Management system, providing less flexibility but less complexity.

You can distinguish two types of document management:
   - the management of electronic documents (Microsoft Word documents for example)
   - the management of paper documents (any printed document for example)

Both can be implemented with an electronic system of records. Paper documents can be scanned. 

Indexing is an important part of document management, some systems go as far as indexing the content of documents.
