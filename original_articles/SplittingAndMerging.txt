'''Techniques for manipulating and pointing to documents:'''

Splitting
* ''one document splits into two and the handle should point to both (listing both or pointing to the first and providing ways to find the alternatives)''
* Example: SplittingAndMerging gets split into DocumentSplitting and DocumentMerging. Then SplittingAndMerging should automatically live on and point to ''both'' (however that is done).
* Complications: If a part of a page is extracted then this is no split but an ExtractionOrRefactoring. This might be handled by listing all extracts on the origin.
Merging
* ''multiple documents are merged into one aggregate and both old names point to the new one (and maybe indicating which part derived from which origin)''
Views
* ''A simple web component for splitting a page into two frames with a movable separator.''
