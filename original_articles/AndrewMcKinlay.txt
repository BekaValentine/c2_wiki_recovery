I've been programming for 25 years so I've seen a lot of changes in the software business.

I'm a fan of OpenSource software.

I'm a fan of ExtremeProgramming, especially automated tests and refactoring.

In my spare time, I like to climb mountains.  I've been on two trips to Denali in Alaska, five expeditions to the Himalaya, four of them to 8000m peaks (Broad Peak, Cho Oyu, Manaslu, Shishapangma), the last three my wife and I have organized and led ourselves.
