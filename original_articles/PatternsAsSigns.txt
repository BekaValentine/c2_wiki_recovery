Hey, did anyone go to ECOOP? There was this really ''naff'' talk, PatternsAsSigns, by some Australian, that 
claimed to be about patterns, but he just whinged about ChristopherAlexander
and how he was evil. What do you think?

I've read the paper and it's pretty lacking in substance - a little interesting stuff, but most of it is waffle.
