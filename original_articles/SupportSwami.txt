Some issues, such as meetings, defects, and emergencies, require a programmer to be present.  However, continual interruptions make it difficult for programmers to work.  Therefore, create a role, filled on a rotating basis by the programming team, that's dedicated to these issues.

'''Resulting Context:''' 
	* The team is interrupted less often and works much more efficiently.
	* The SupportSwami becomes overloaded with work that should have been planned.
	* The role rotates and problems raised during the previous swami's tenure tend to stagnate.

''(Note: The name "support swami" was a fun title that the DenaliProject team came up with.  We even had a cheesy JohnnyCarson swami hat made from a bicycle helmet.  No offense is intended to people who deal with real swamis on a regular basis.  If we had thought of ProblemPontiff or SalvageSaint, we might have used one of those with a different funny hat instead.  We're just that annoying.  Have a nice day!  --JimLittle.)''
