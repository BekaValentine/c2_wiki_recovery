Behavior provided by a manager to protect the staff under him/her from
interference by those outside that branch of the organization.

Examples:
	* a developer taking a managerial position to prevent a more useful staffer from being placed as manager, diluting their effect on the code.
	* requiring all contact with the group to be coordinated with the manager.
	* personally accepting full responsibility for the performance of the team. ''See KentOnWardOnSustainablePace.''
	* taking care of administrative matters.

''Sure, my manager covered me with fire on a regular basis.  We spent at lot of time FireFighting.  Mostly I ignore him how.''

''Being the GoalDonor '''does not''' make you a manager.  They are (should be) separate roles.  Are they compatible?'''
