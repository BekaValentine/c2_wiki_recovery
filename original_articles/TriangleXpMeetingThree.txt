	* (D) Hybrid teams
	* (E) Algorithm for introducing XP
	* (F) Untestable frameworks
	* (G) Automated deployment

At the end of the meeting we also discussed the number of folks showing up, possible conflicts with other user groups, whether we should hold speaker meetings, perhaps hold/announce sessions on specific topics, perhaps try an XP Fest --AlexChapman

We spoke about (B) and the discussion bled into (C) a little bit. Points require far less effort to expend and don't tend toward infinite recursion in the analysis process. The XP Cards Retrospective Roulette game seemed a good vehicle to spur discussion. Trying to think of a way to adapt that to another user group... - MitchAmiano
