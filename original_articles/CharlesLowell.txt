When not pioneering new fields of InterpretiveDance, I write code on many OpenSource projects, and serve as a primary contributor and project admin on one in Particular: MarathonMan.

Now that JeremyStellSmith has gone back to America, I am a much lonelier convenor of GeekNight, hosted by my employer, ThoughtWorks.
