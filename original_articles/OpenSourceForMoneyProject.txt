Describes an open source project which is sponsored financially, directly 
or indirectly, through a company/person/corporation interested in the solution.

Sites like http://www.sourcexchange.com and http://www.sourceforge.com
encourage the connection between OpenSource and sponsors.

The problem is that it risks building a culture that is ever more 
reliant on money and less driven by the spirit of the GiftGivingCulture.

On the other hand, it provides the OpenSourceCommunity with badly
needed financial support and supports the spreading of the OpenSource
ideas.

In the end, as with everything, a balance is required.
