JScript.NET is Microsoft's implementation of EcmaScript ('''not''' JavaScript) for the DotNet platform.

The language has been updated to support .NET features, but it also provides backward compatibility to allow 'classic' JScript scripts to be run under .NET.  This is primarily intended to make it easy to migrate JScript-based ASP pages to AspDotNet.

JScript.NET source files must be compiled into .NET assemblies before they can be run.  Some scripting environments provide for runtime compilation.
