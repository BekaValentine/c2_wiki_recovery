Not sure where this phrase comes from. This is a TriteExpression.

Here's one example:
If you are an elephant, stand in a herd of elephants. You'll be safer. Especially if someone or some thing is out hunting elephants.

Here's another:
''Think of it this way:  You are all alone in a city you don't know and you find yourself in the proverbial darkened alleyway with a number of unsavoury looking characters.  Feel safe?  Now, how about this --- same city, same alley, but you are with 10 friends....''

Please note: No elephants were hurt during the composing of this WikiPage. See NoAnimalsWereHarmed.
