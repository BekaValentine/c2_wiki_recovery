Sharp's entry into the PersonalDigitalAssistant field is a solid little machine that boasts Linux, Personal Java, a slide-out keyboard, two expansion slots (1 CF, 1 SD, yes wireless works sweet), and a nice color screen.

I received my SharpZaurus last week and have found it a real pleasure to work on. Its nice to have a true multitasking OS on a handheld ... I've been listening to MP3s while coding in one window while in another terminal session, a GCC compile is being run. The machine is solid as a rock and fast too! - BillZimmerly
