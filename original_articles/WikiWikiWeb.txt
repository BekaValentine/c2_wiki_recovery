This website and the software it runs on were created by WardCunningham for the PortlandPatternRepository. It is home to an InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas as well as a large volume of material recording related discourses and collaboration between its readers.

The content is written by the users -- people like you and me. Anyone can change any page or create new pages. Read the TextFormattingRules to find out how, and then go to the WikiWikiSandbox to try it yourself. Please use the WikiWikiSandbox if you want to experiment with how editing works. If you make a page you don't want to keep, just replace its text with the word "delete".

This website is the first ever "wiki", where content can be edited by any person. All other wikis, including Wikipedia and Wikiquote and Wiktionary, are descended from it. Wikipedia is now the fifth most visited website according to Alexa (Rank).
