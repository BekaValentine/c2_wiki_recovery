The "typical American diet" actually is not low carbohydrate.  Remember that potatoes, rice, bread, muffins, sugar, beverages containing sugar, sauces containing sugar, rolls, burger buns, etc. are all primarily carbohydrates.  Yes, there is a lot of meat involved, but the crucial points of a high protein diet include a low percentage of total calories from carbohydrates, high proportion of complex (low glycemic index) carbs rather than simple sugars, high fiber, frequent small meals throughout the day, etc., none of which are typical for "the western diet".

The granddaddy of the high protein diet is the AtkinsDiet, which was developed by an MD who started by experimenting on himself after reading medical research reports about the effects of various macronutrient combinations on volunteers in short term experiments.

Dr. D''''''aDamo's "4 your type" series posits (based on analysis of research, not on taking a guess for the hell of it) that people with blood type O especially thrive on a high protein diet, as this blood type is correlated with a high level of stomach acidity and a high degree of muscle efficiency in a low pH environment.  I am finding this to be true for myself. -- ChrisBaugh
