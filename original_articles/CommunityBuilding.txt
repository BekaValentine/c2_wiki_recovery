CollaborationStartsWithaQuestion. The first question above can be traced back to the previous century, when WardsWiki was still young.

I started LarrySangerAndLessonsInCollaboration when the "memoirs" came out earlier in 2005. I did not really have time to write a proper summary, but made some notes about what he said there. Hopefully people will get sufficiently interested to read, and reflect, on his words.

See BarnRaising for a vision and WikiCommunityBuilding for a protocol advocated for CommunityBuilding for WikiCommunity. Both are on the MeatBall wiki.
