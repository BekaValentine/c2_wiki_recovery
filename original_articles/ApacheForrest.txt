The marketing says... 

''Forrest is an XML/XSLT-based, skinnable project documentation and website development system. Content can be written in presentation-neutral XML, and then converted to HTML/PDF by Forrest. As Forrest is based on Cocoon, sites can scale seamlessly from simple static affairs to full-blown dynamic webapps. Forrest is the system used to generate this site (http://xml.apache.org/).'' http://xml.apache.org/forrest/


Forrest 0.6 is available, and quickly progressing towards 1.0. No backward compatibility is promised yet, but some people already using it.
