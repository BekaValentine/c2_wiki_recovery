Since there is already a MetaWiki page, I'll use this page to describe the MetaWiki search engine.

It is an inter-wiki title search ''with sauce''. More information can be found on http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MetaWiki. If you'd like your clone to be listed, follow the instructions on MeatballWiki. I have scripts to process many of the popular engines already.

Naturally, WikiWiki is indexed. -- SunirShah

FractalWiki isn't. Sorry, it is like it's a subwiki of Meatball. But what's the delay between page existence and findability in this search engine? -- PieterJansegers

I have recently (Apr05) requested Sunir to update his reference and he responded on MeatBall he was interested in another person taking over the facility, as he has not got time.
