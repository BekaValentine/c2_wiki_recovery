GolfRun is an esoteric programming language derived from GolfScript. GolfRun is almost compatible with GolfScript, except for few details and new features. GolfRun loses some of GolfScript's golfing nuances (though it is still useful to win CodeGolf) and has as aim to gain "power" and to be more useful as generic programming language. As of April 2012, the language is still under the formal definition process; a reference interpreter written in C exists.
