Some corporations maintain a position titled Business Systems Analyst.  More than serving as the liaison between Operations and Programmers (the role of a SystemAnalyst), a Business Systems Analyst is concerned that corporate StrategicPlanning is expressed in programming projects.  Or, to state it differently, he or she assures that there is no ImpedanceMismatch between the strategy of the company and the development efforts of the programming staff.
