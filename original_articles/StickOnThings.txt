''Have you ever stuck a note on something, Why? '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20140821

Could it be that what you stick-on really doesn't belong, but that it's a close as it gets to belonging, and if it ever becomes something else on its own, that you will forget about its being stuck somewhere, and you won't bother to remove it! 

Or, Could it be that you need to remember to do something about what it's stuck to? If so, where will you put them so that the reminder will work?

Or, Could it be that what it is stuck to what needs to be changed, or re-written, and you do not have the time or inclination to do it now, or that the one who will do it, is busy and can't do it now?

I have come to the conclusion, that for whatever reason one sticks notes on things, that the reason is motivated by procrastination or lack-of-commitment.

In a way, To-Do-Lists fall in this same category, but they usually contain things you may never tackle with serious dedicated effort.

Could part of the reason we use StickOnThings is because we don't know enough to do what the note is about? Is a Stick on thing really a disquised excuse?

Think about it!
