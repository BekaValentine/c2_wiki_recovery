Each line is a number of how many times repeat, and the stuff on that line. For example:
 000 ;This example program #1
 000     .INPUT        .OUTPUT
 001     @
 007     ++
 003      **
will be the space:
 .     @
 .     ++
 .     ++
 .     ++
 .     ++
 .     ++
 .     ++
 .     ++
 .      **
 .      **
It starts from the top-left corner going south-east. Commands:

* + increase current memory by 1, mod 256
* * move memory pointer in direction of program direction
* ? turn 45 degrees counter-clockwise if value at current memory is non-zero
* ! turn 45 degrees counter-clockwise if value at current memory is zero
* @ save position and then go north. If there is already a position saved, then go back to saved position and direction and delete the saved position. If it is already going north (whether it is saved or not) it turns 45 degrees clockwise (whether or not the value is zero)
* . does nothing

That's all

Stuff such as input/output/stop would be commands more north than the north side of the program, in certain position there would be a sub-routine that does that. For example:

 000 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
 000        .INPUT          .OUTPUT          .STOP
 001 .      .               .                .
 001  .?......!!................?            .
 001  ?.    .!  !           .    ?           .
 001  ? .   .!  !           .    ?           .
 001   ?.!..@..!............@...?            .
 001           !.............................@

Standard subroutines:
* 8 = Input
* 24 = Output
* 41 = Stop
