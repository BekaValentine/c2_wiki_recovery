''From AlphaMale:''

Designation for the male at the top of the male dominance hierarchy in a group of social animals. In some groups this is the only male that gets a chance to reproduce. In some groups this is the male that eats first. 

Determined by displays or contests of strength, endurance, loudness, etc.

''...number of gadgets attached to belt, etc.''


''Alpha male defines the leader of the pack.  Geeks travel in their own packs, hence the gadget-factor definition.  Also, when PDAs and cellphones first arrived, the cost was such that having one was a status symbol.''

Truly, a geek wouldn't call himself an Alpha male, or even a Beta male. A true geek would be a "release version" ''non PointOhVersion, please''

[Alpha geek is an old term.]
