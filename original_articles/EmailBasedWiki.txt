Pushing EmailIntegration to its extreme, the author asks for a WikiEngine with the following additional features:

	* ''posting''  via (WysiWyg-) emails
	* ''getting'' daily the RecentChanges and a digest of the changed pages
	* ''setting'' filters for the digest
	* ''converting'' WysiWyg Html to the respective WikiMarkup 
	* ''feeding'' the incoming digest into a Local User Wiki

'''Benefits:'''
	* ''saving time'' for the Wikizens
	* ''reducing the workload'' of the Source Wiki
	* ''automatic backup'' on the local target Wiki
	* ''universal UI'' for easier InterWiki''''ing

Many wiki (see WikiPageAsEmail) allow people to subscribe to changes to particular pages.
MoinMoin (and perhaps others) allow a person to subscribe to "*", so they get email when any page gets created or modified.

TikiWiki (and perhaps others) allow people to post to the wiki by sending a specially formatted email to a special address.
