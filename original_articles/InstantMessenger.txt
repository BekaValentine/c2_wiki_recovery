Would it be correct to say that the Unix "talk" facility - which (at least in later versions?) could be used across the Internet between compatible Unixen) - was an early form of instant messaging? -- ApoorvaMuralidhara

I think that's close to correct.  Of course ''talk'' was only for the wimps who could not cope with a real Unix tool such as ''write''.  -- DavidVincent
