The Pattern Languages of Programs (PLoP) 2002 Call for Papers is now up at hillside.net.  You can find the PLoP CFP at: http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2002/

Also, we are looking for PlopTestimonials to add some "marketing spice" to this year's conference announcement.  Please contribute on that page if you've attended PLoP previously and have something to share.

Also, we've set up a special place on wiki for people interested in submitting papers on this year's PlopFocusTopics to search for collaborators and discuss ideas.  The full list of accepted focus topics with abstracts and contact information for topic organizers can be found at the PloP web site here (http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2002/topics.html).

The focus topics accepted for this year are:

	* PatternsAndPatternLanguagesForDistributedRealTimeAndEmbeddedSystemsFocusTopic
	* DesignPatternsForTestingConcurrentApplicationsFocusTopic
	* PatternsForSecuringEnterpriseApplicationsFocusTopic
	* PatternsOfMessagingAndWebServicesFocusTopic

If you are interested patterns in one of these areas, please click on the above link.  You may wish to leave a note to find a collaborator in this area, or you may wish to post your "preliminary" patterns here on wiki or elsewhere to receive feedback prior to the conference submission deadline.  If you want further help, please contact the focus topic organizer for each topic (listed on the link above, or on the page).  


It is now time for all good wikizens to come to the aid of their conference by submitting papers.
