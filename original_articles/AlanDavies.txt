I became interested in wikis a few years ago after seeing this wiki. I'm not a fan of CamelCase WikiLink''''''s - they seem just like a workaround to simplify parser implementation. I written my own wiki-like script called InterFlow which aims to overcome all the little things that bug me about other wikis (like the lack of a 'preview' button on this one! :). It's here if you want to give it a try: http://www.goatpunch.com/ (my personal page is at http://www.goatpunch.com/view?Alan+Davies or http://goatpunch.com:8080/view?Alan+Davies).

	 :	An AnonymousUser or two helpfully pointed out that the comments box on my page was too small for browsers which don't recognize "style:width...". I added wrap="soft" and cols=80 to hopefully fix the problem.

Alan, Thanks for the comment. I checked the site using IE and it's definitely broken. I'll consider tweaking the stylesheet someday but I'm loath to change it since w3.org says it's valid CSS and XHTML. I'm not a CSS expert and I'm not interested in becoming one in order to help MicroSoft. :-) -- SeanOleary

	 :	It may be valid, but I don't know enough about CSS to decide which browser is rendering your page 'correctly'. I wouldn't put my money on InternetExplorer though.
