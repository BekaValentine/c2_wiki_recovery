** There are three versions: A free BrowserAddon, a standard- (~ 500 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬) and an Enterprise- (~1.000 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬) Edition (2014) http://imacros.net/store/compare-versions Naturally I'm using the free one ;-)
** General information about iMacros can be found here: http://imacros.net/
** They provide the manual in form of a wiki: http://wiki.imacros.net/Main_Page

The free version of iMacros is available for FireFox, GoogleChrome and InternetExplorer but not for the OperaBrowser by now (2014). 

For FireFox it is available as extension: http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imacros-for-firefox and works fine in Linux, Windows or MacOsx environment.

Support and manual are realised as wiki :-) http://wiki.imacros.net/Main_Page

Also You can find a number of videos made by iOpus and others on YouTube like: 

* '''Recording Your First Macro''' 1:39 Uploaded on 20 Dec 2011 by 'iMacrosVideo' channel. "This demo shows how to record and replay a macro (narrated)."

Some hints for the first time user:
* There are variables besides the 10 built-in ones !VAR0 to !VAR9. You can create them by using the SET command:
 SET WhatEverIwantToCallIt 666

* There is rudimentary calculation by using ADD to increment or decrement integers or concatenate strings:
 ADD WhatEverIwantToCallIt -666
 ADD WhateverMightHaveBeenANumberWillBeAStringNow Hello

* Variables must be SET inside the macro and do not __undefined__ their content beyond it unless it is a system-variable:
 'Setting this variable fills the ClipBoard and as such the content survives the RunTime of the macro.
 SET !CLIPBOARD 2014.12.26 23:49
 SET IneedDataFromTheOutside DolphinScriptRevealsFlawsInWardsWiki

* There is very limited structure inside iMacros but a loop-function around it that can be set to 99.999 loops. The current run can be read out by 210. One should consider that this could lead to an unusual speed and number of page calls for the browser. It may help to stabilize the run by erasing the cache and cookies from time to time by:
 CLEAR

* To prevent the script from exiting on unexpected events:
 SET !ERRORIGNORE YES

* '''Speed control''' is of two kinds, by SETting the SystemVariable !REPLAYSPEED to FAST, MEDIUM or SLOW, resulting in a pause of zero, 1 or 2 seconds per step. Or you use the WAIT command for longer delays at specific places:
 WAIT SECONDS=MyWaitingTimeIntegerInSeconds

* In case of an unattended script who will see the pictures on the pages? Nobody! So, why would You want to load them?
