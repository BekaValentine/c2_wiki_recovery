Probably the coolest IDE for beginners out there.  An object oriented sprite model, icon-based as well as text-based scripting language, lots of facilities for manipulating sprites and images, all available for free.

While GameMaker might not be suited for application development per se, neither is MicrosoftExcel.  I think this points to a genre of software development tools that is ignored by developers who are big on TuringComplete systems:  ArtWare.  Applications and utilities like PhotoShop, PowerPoint, Excel, etc which let you generate creative and original content rapidly.

(Excel is Turing-complete.)

So is GameMaker, even without using the built-in scripting language.

I suggest use GameMaker4.3 as it is the best version. Don't use 5.0 or newer.
