I'm in the process of developing a PQA for the PalmPilot VII to access Wiki using the device's low speed radio modem.  A PQA is essentially just a little local HTML document, usally containing one or more forms.  The submit button sends the data off to a remote CGI, and displays the result. If you'd like to alpha test it, send me an email. --JohnBrewer

Using Wiki on my PalmVII with DPWeb (http://www.digitalpaths.com/) turns up some interesting aspects.  For the most part Wiki is great on the Palm because it is just text, uses no fancy HTML features, and the pages tend to be just a few K.

However, there are some frustrating aspects.  The search boxes on FindPage depend on the browser being able to accept an enter key because the forms do not have explicit Submit buttons.  The LikePages feature at the bottom does not work. It returns the error message "No page name given".  I'm guess perhaps it uses the Referrer field and DPWeb doesn't transmit that?

Finally, do not try EditPage on your Palm.  It doesn't work anyway. -- StevenNewton

On the other hand, it does seem to work quite nicely on my HandspringVisor (with "Thin Modem" card and Browse-it web browser). Although entering text is still rather laborious, and the interface doesn't fit on that little screen as neatly as it might. -- MossCollum
