I offer the sample article http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100102.htm so you can see structure of the SummaWay.

The sample treats whether or not sacred doctrine (theology) is a science, a question not unrelated to IsComputerScience.

Aquinas uses the term Science in the old broader classical sense of ''any branch of knowledge rationally falsifiable''. Thus, mathematics was considered a science then but not today, for today science has narrowed to mean that which is empirically falsifiable.
