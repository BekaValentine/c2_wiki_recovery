You are paid according to someone else's perception of what your performance should be.

---- Discussion

Performance based pay is always difficult. In my opinion, performance based pay is always based on, at least here in Europe, the certificates you achieved by whatever means, or by ways of meanly tricking the other person into believing that your are more competent in whatever field of competence required.

This basically means that although your are incompetent, you trick the other person(s), who are equally incompetent, into believing that you are more competent than others, who are actually more competent than yourself. And they, that is the incompetent people, will most likely take for granted that you are competent unless you do not question their overall incompetence.

Not considering the really capable person(s) here as they are beyond the scope of that overall scheme, and as they do not fit well right into the self preservation plan of the incompetent majority of the people.

This also means that you, as the competent person that you are, need to dig deep right into the arse of your assigned incompetent superiors in order to get a higher "performance based pay" while neglecting to prevail yourselves.

As such, performance based pay, and perception based pay, and manipulating that perception based on mutually agreed incompetence leaves the really capable people out of place and out of scope as they will detect such corrupt behaviour and will thus respond to it by rejecting it.

Subsequently, same incorruptable persons will be expelled from such corrupted systems.

My personal observation is that those who are most incompetent are the most superior. And in that, they are also the most militaristic as they actually stem from the military. 

Who made our community a military reigned society, I ask.

I reject the military. And I reckon that most of you will, also.

My only hope is that such corruptible systems will likely wear off and be no more. -- CarstenKlein
