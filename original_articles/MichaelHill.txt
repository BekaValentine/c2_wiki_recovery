If you need a real response from me, use the e-mail.  I don't get to Wiki nearly as often as I used to:

I'm Mike Hill, generally known simply as Hill.  I've been a programmer for about 20 years.

Recent work:  I've begun working on a manuscript about testing in the extreme programming context.  I have been doing lots of lurking on the XpMailingList and the occasional posting.  (I just noticed that someone has put a quote of mine onto the XpMailingListQuotes page.  Cool.)
