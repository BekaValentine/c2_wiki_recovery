In the ScrumProcess, the ProductOwner prioritizes the ProductBacklog.
----
The ProductOwner of Scrum is somewhat analogous to ExtremeProgramming's OnsiteCustomer. One obvious difference: The ProductOwner is usually part of the development organization and has a customer of his/her own. The product owner solely controls the ProductBacklog.

The ProductOwner also federates the interests of all business stakeholders, users, etc., so should be empowered to make final arbitrary decisions with respect to priority.  This is especially important if there are many customers.  If the "true Product Owner" of a project has delegated the OnsiteCustomer aspect of the role, that person must be able to make decisions with quick turnaround time.  

A well-trained ProductOwner is a key to success in a ScrumProcess project.
