Category Compression is for pages about data compression methods such as those used for building packages of computer programs.

A lot of information on this can be found on WikiPedia at the following location: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_data_compression_software

It saves having to make pages for all these here. -- JohnFletcher
