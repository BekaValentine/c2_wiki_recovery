ToGaf is an EnterpriseArchitecture framework that steps away from the traditional Zachmann/CMMI/FEAF classification frameworks by defining architecture as an iterative process, rather than a hierarchy of categories. TogaFit (ToGaf via Integrated Testing) adapts ToGaf to agile development by emphasizing TDD in every phase.

Crucially, TogaFit implements the central requirements/rules repository by FitLibrary style FunctionalTests. [more to come]

TogaFit is a wild hair PeterMerel woke up with this morning. But it sounds like a nice idea.
