Somebody is removing the commas from between links, such as category names. I am not sure I agree with this. Commas make it easier to visually separate the items (at least to my eyes), and fits proper English better if I am not mistaken. If wiki starts to look too nerdy, such as like EssExpressions, it would scare people away.

''I agree to the extent that removing the commas as the only change is not a good idea, although I suspect most category lists are currently without commas. Perhaps 70.132.16.158 could explain their motives... then we could vote on the style issue, and on whether to change lists already in place.''

I don't think it is worth the bother of changing existing lists. However, I do think a vote would be a good idea with regard to future convention.

I agree. Let's WikiSingleVote on the following lists:

Category lists at the bottom:
* Commas or slashes between categories, depending on context (1)
* Commas between categories (0)
* Only space between categories (1)

Other lists, especially within text:
* Commas between WikiWord''''''s (2)
* Only space between WikiWord''''''s (0)
