I have been following patterns for a while. I graduated from Caltech in Computer Science (BS '95), with particular interests in concurrency, software architecture, and user interface. To duck the decision of industry vs. grad school (with Ralph Johnson), I joined the World Wide Web Consortium [1] at MIT as a security protocol designer.

I have written a fairly discursive essay on Alexander [2] as a term paper for a "real" architecture class, for Vincent Scully.

You can reach me at mailto:rohit@khare.org or at my home page [3].

Also, take a reading on FoRK, "Friends of Rohit Khare" [4].  Unfortunately, AdamRifkin is one of them, but don't let that stop you from subscribing.
