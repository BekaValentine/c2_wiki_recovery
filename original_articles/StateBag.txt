Every AspDotNet form has a hidden field that stores all the view state of the form.

<input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE"   value="dDwtMTE1MTIwMDUz" />


''Actually, it is much much longer''

This view is represented by StateBag object.

--

The ViewState variable is a Base64 representation of a serialization of the StateBag, so the larger the page's objects, the longer the ViewState. --AllanBaruz
