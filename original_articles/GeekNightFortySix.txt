Greetings all, tonight is the night is the night of love. Together forever is never enough...

It's GeekNight!

Tonight, it seems that our schedule is jam packed. When OwenRogers and I were at XP2003 in Genoa, 
we met RickMugridge from New Zealand. He has quite a bit of experience with NakedObjects 
(both the idea, and the implementation), and has authored some extensions. He'll be along to 
discuss it and show how NakedObjects allow for emergent UI design and different viewers. Like them or hate them, you have to admit, it's an exciting idea.

Also, DanGoodwin, the loveable ThoughtWorks attorney, may drop in to discuss various OpenSource
licences. If you've got questions about this (and I know you do), come on by to get them 
answered.

As usual, the fun starts at 7pm, so be there sharp. Please sign up for pizza, and topping 
preference *beforehand* so that I can have the pizzas there at the stroke of 7
