SorceryNet is a great InternetRelayChat Network.

It was originally started around the end of 1996, as a splinter off of DalNet.  In that time, however, it's grown to become it's own network, including full featured IRC Services.

It usually has well over 2000 users online at any one time, boasts a great staff, and lots of interesting people.
