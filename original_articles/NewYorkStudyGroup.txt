JoshuaKerievsky founded this group many months ago.  We currently meet Mondays at 7pm in Soho at Space Untitled just
below Houston on Green St.  Check http://www.industriallogic.com/patterns/ for what we're up to.

Over the past few months the NewYorkStudyGroup has split into three groups.  There are two groups going through DesignPatterns. One formed months ago called the GoF group and one formed more recently called the Four Gangsters Group. The third group, called the Pattern Languages Group (PLG), finished DesignPatterns quite a while ago and since then has been reading papers and book chapters from several sources. Recently the PLG has been thinking about what it is trying to accomplish.  In an effort to work that out a discussion needs to take place amongst its members and perhaps others in the patterns community.  The discussion will take place here at the NewYorkPlgAgenda.
