A "process engineering framework" from the EclipseFoundation, based in part on a donation part of the RationalUnifiedProcess by IBM. The project currently provides a software component for process engineering and a minimal methodology, OpenUP.

So far as I can tell, the part of RUP exposed includes the process ''framework'', but not the RUP roles, work products, et cetera.  Manifest products of the projects are the EPF Composer, which is an EclipseIde based tool for using the framework to create a process; and OpenUP (WikiWord?) a very slim variant of the UnifiedSoftwareDevelopmentProcess, provided partly as a library for the composer. "Process libraries" for other methodologies are provided, including descriptions of ExtremeProgramming, ScrumMethodology, and soon OpenUP/Basic (WikiWord?).

OpenUP and OpenUP/Basic are quite svelte considering the reference to RUP. OpenUP has 6 roles and 17 work products. OpenUP/Basic is under preparation but interests me more than OpenUP because the architect has explicit coding duties (see ArchitectsDontCode). ''Whoops - that must only be an old version of OpenUP/Basic. The current version has just the "Architect Handbook" work product.''
