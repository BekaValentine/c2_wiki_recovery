Maybe CausalChainCrossings can explain the seemingly unscientific occurrences of the LatticeOfCoincidence.

I once heard it said (sorry, no references), that coincidences were nothing else but crossings over of causal chains.

E.g.

A => B => C

A' => B' => C'

where A and A' are not related and neither are C and C', but B and B' are.

Independently, these chains are quite normal. But the huge number of dependencies in everyday life will probably inevitably lead to quite a lot of these crossovers, which we regard as 'coincidences'.
