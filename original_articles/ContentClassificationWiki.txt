WikiPedia, SenseisLibrary, BookShelved and most of the wikis dedicated to particular programming topics are ContentClassificationWiki''''''s. These tend to be larger than ContentCreationWiki''''''s, and serve very different audiences and purposes.

There is nothing inherently superior about contributions to one or the other kind of wiki. But where ContentClassificationWiki''''''s are and should be ruthlessly edited, with all noise relegated to the dustbin as soon as it occurs, the process of collaborative invention calls for the gentler touch described on the ContentCreationWiki page.

WikiWikiWeb is a ContentCreationWiki, and has been since it was created. See also ContentCreation.
