Famous organization in which alcoholics achieve sobriety by undergoing group therapy and following a TwelveStepProgram.  Participants must be WillingToChange.

Slogans:

	* One Day At A Time - achieve sobriety in small iterations

Participants often invoke the SerenityPrayer. (I have a booklet which explains how, on at least one occasion, the program was adapted slightly to suit an atheist.)
