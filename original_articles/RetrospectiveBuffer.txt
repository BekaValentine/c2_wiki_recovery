The name of a mythical data structure that buffers bits from the future.

''You have to buffer information from the future for later processing to avoid violating the "Temporal Prime Directive" of Star Trek. Otherwise you might suffer from time loops and paradoxes. And we all know that a time loop can be just as bad as an infinite loop.  ;->''

Like a calendar, or todo list? Ooops, that'd be bits '''about''' the future.

Example This Page
* Line One inserted
* Line Three Inserted
* Line Two Inserted between Line One and Line Three (already existing)
* This stuff inserted about the stuff (already done)

The Buffer is the Page and WikiNow does away with time and order (and perhaps sensibility).
