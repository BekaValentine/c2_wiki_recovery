The privates and corporals in an ArmyOfProgrammers; what the vast majority of programmers start out as, and what many remain throughout their careers. 

The typical enlistee coder knows a single programming language (historically, this was most often COBOL or some Basic dialect; more recently, VisualBasic and JavaLanguage are common), has little or no formal training and limited experience, and is unfamiliar with even the most basic existing algorithms or idioms. While some EnlisteeCoders are quite talented, most are LessAbleProgrammer''''''s who have no interest in programming beyond their next paycheck. Even the best generally start out as semi-skilled labor, and are treated as such by management.
