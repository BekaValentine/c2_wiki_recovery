Please help out and sign up. Thanks!

Agenda:
 * Hack : http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/ + Jedit for an JApplet way to edit WebDav pages.
 * NMock : Preperation for 1.0 release.

Attendees:

 * PaulHammant 
 * JoeWalnes 
 * JimArnold
 * MartinFowler

What we did:

Not many people showed up this week, but nonetheless we had fun. 

Our coding attention turned to NMock <http://nmock.sourceforge.net/>. JeremyStellSmith (absent) had written some failing tests for last minutes enhancements earlier in the week and we went about implementing them (successfully). We also experimented with IL bytecode to see if we could work around mocking up non virtual methods (unsuccessfully). All we need now is some documentation and a 1.0 release will be ready.

Oh, and it's always interesting when MartinFowler turns up!
