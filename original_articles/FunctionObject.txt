Moved to FunctorObject

FunctionObject is positively a better name for this concept, but STL documentation traditionally defines it as ''Object that implements operator()''. This definition is useless without the STL context though.

See also: StlFunctionObjects.

FunctoidsInCpp has another system which uses the definition of ''operator()'' in CeePlusPlus.
