Strangely enough, "''the''" Cube has been a sobriquet of several products in the past:
	* RubiksCube
	* the Next computer
	* lately, one PowerMac model
	* Nintendo's GameCube

Movies:
	* the "Cube" (1998) 4.2 stars out of five at http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&cf=info&id=1800021096
	* Not to mention "Rubik, the Amazing Cube" (1983) -- http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&cf=info&id=1800113259 http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&cf=info&id=1800113261 http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&cf=info&id=1800113263

I saw the movie the "Cube:"
Very dark and disturbing.
Kinda' like a really nasty Twilight Zone episode.

Lesson from the movie: When you drop a psycho down a hole, don't just assume that he's out of the picture. Go down there and make sure he doesn't get back up...

I'll be sure to add that to my list of LessonsLearnedFromHorrorFlicks
