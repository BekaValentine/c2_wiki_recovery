''[Editing note: Should this category be combined with others such as CategoryWhimsy and CategoryJoke? Should they be kept separate?]''

I was not aware of CategoryWhimsy. Some might fit into CategoryWhimsy, but probably don't quite fit into CategoryJoke. Others probably best fit CategoryJoke. I think the combination of the two, however, would be sufficient. I'm starting to change a few of them. -- JasonNocks

A SenseOfHumor is necessary for those who believe they are sane to cling to that belief. Especially when dealing with boring, technical matters all day. So AlmostNeverDeleteHumor.
