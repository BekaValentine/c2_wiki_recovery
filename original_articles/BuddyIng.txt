BuddyIng is an approach to programming that has components of PeerReview and PairProgramming or ContinuousReview. PhranRyder first used BuddyIng in about 1990.

In short...

Buddies are assigned or agree on the task (or tasks) they are to work on. For each task they agree on what to do to complete it. If there is any complexity they then work together until the complexity is removed. The buddies also have to produce the UnitTest''''''s. During development regular check points are used to show progress and PeerReview the solution. 

... I have many more thoughts but that is for another time.
