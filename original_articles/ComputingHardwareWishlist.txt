Not the dumb stuff like more CPU or RAM. Rather, the more esoteric stuff nobody thinks about. So lesse,

input:
* KinesisKeyboard, or
* LightGlove, or
* a keyboard that comes in 2 or 3 pieces, that I can arrange at any angle or position I find reasonable
* a 3D ringmouse for each hand (for those crucial 4th and 5th degrees of freedom)
* keyboard ''no wider than your shoulders'' (essential for a happy upper back. You guys with wider shoulders can't imagine what trouble just about every keyboard causes.)
** You're right; I just tried to imagine it and utterly failed. I've never seen that, I don't think.
** Yep, that's why it belongs on an esoteric wish list. If only...
* I would like to be able to just visualize an object in virtual space and grab it.. or leading up to that I would be ok with an input device that tracks my eye movements and perhaps a blink could launch an object-file-app-whatever when I'm focused on the 3-d icon representing it.  ''What about simply having the mouse cursor follow your eye movements, and mouse buttons under your thumbs, like the scratch pads on most laptops?.'' Wouldn't that lead to the mouse cursor always blocking what I'm trying to read?

output:
* 4+ large monitors, or
* video projector
* DeskSizedDesktop
* BlueTooth headphones that completely replace wired headphones and are as simple to use - charges on one of those new InductiveMats so you can just plop them down without fiddling with more wires for charging, plays mp3s from all devices (HandHelds, mp3-players, game consoles as well as Phones), stereo somehow (two pieces that clip together for easy transport but detach to put in ears), perhaps the 2nd one smaller. 
* full 3-d virtual space projection, hopefully from a projector similar to a nice pair of sunglasses.

storage:
* 10+ HDs in a 2D RAID (to bring the mean time to failure to a more reasonable million years)
* non-mechanical, eon durable, multiple of human knowledge sized.

computation:
* FPGAs (come on, you know you want 'em)

networking:
* multi-megabit/sec ''upload'' (for everyone else)

miscellaneous:
* noise suppression for hard drives, quiet fans and power supply
* Wireless noise-cancellation headphones and 3D projection glasses in one unit, combined with 3D mouse-cursor-follows-eyes input device.

Rugged hot-swappable ram in various/variable granularities?
