The foundation of all ObjectOriented SoftwareDesign, including AgileMethodology such as ExtremeProgramming, is object thinking. 

''It is? Many of these ideas are orthogonal to OO.''

But many developers have not mastered its underlying concepts and principles relying on methodology and process instead of fully exploiting the power of object thinking in software design.
