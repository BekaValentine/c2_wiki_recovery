Fungible - being of such a nature that one part or quantity may be replaced by another equal part or quantity in the satisfaction of an obligation.

Hence, you should put in place a FungibleProjectManager approach when you are working in conflict mode with a hard customer. After a big crisis and escalation, after useless task forces, you can dispose of your project manager as a sign of your will to go on with the project... and get a clone from your warehouse. Your customer will be happy and nothing will change because your project manager is a FungibleProjectManager.

I wish you were right. Well, the thing is some service company use it as a way to satisfy the customer while changing nothing to their method. Seen from the job that is to be done, it is definitely a BadThing, so a ManagementAntiPattern, but I saw companies using it as a ManagementPattern. -- OlivierRey

Well, we can wander if this is really an AntiPattern. Some companies are using this trick to fool customers, especially in the IT world and it seems quite successful.
