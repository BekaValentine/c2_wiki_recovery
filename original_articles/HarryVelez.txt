''Harry, AreYouThere? Two BackLink''''''s, last edit 2000-12-18''

Harry is a friend of KaiCarver (the person who started this page).

Like me he seems interested in the topic of VirtualCommunity.
He's not a programmer though, so he might not be interested in a lot of stuff in this community.

He's a Spanish professor and a poet, and a web guy.
Here's very elegant proof of all three: http://www.ups.edu/community/mellon/velez/Orfeo/home.htm

We met at Harvard University a long time ago.

Now he lives in Seattle which is a long way away.

This is what he looks like: http://www.ups.edu/faculty/velez/mug.jpg (slightly scary photo, but cool).

Harry -who now presents himself by way of a different narrator, himself,- is pretty amused by this Tiki-Tiki-Ding-A-Ling.  It is a yummy thing and it makes him want to be a Borg or at least a bitchin' programmer like his friend Kai.  Kai, if you do not know it by now, is dope!

Harry invites you to visit him soon @ http://www.ups.edu/faculty/velez/
