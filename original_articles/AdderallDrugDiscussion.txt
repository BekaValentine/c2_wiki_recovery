This is a new wiki page for information about Adderall, which is prescribed for AttentionDeficitDisorder and narcolepsy, since wiki has RitalinDrug. Feel free to add and edit to improve it.

Courtesy of the US Government, here is a little information on Adderall:
* http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a601234.html

Believe what the US Government says at your own risk.

Courtesy of the manufacturer, here is the full sheet on Adderall, the one doctors receive and patients seldom see (check all the tabs across the top):

Here is a separate sheet for Adderall XR (extended release):

On February 9, 2005, Health Canada instructed the manufacturer (Shire) to withdraw Adderall XR from the Canadian market:

The US FDA then issued a public health advisory:

I took ADDerall for a few months when I lived in Seattle. I liked the longer-lasting effect, but I didn't like some of the side-effects, dry mouth, minor muscle spasms. On the other hand, I would sometimes forget to take Ritalin, so ADDerall definitely had benefits. Given the choice between the two right now, I'd take ADDerall if I don't have a 'coach' around to remind me when I forget, and Ritalin if I did have a coach. -- ShaeErisson

A large number of computer programmers have AttentionDeficitDisorder and use, or have used, RitalinDrug and AdderallDrug.

''This is probably a better place to discuss Adderall than the AdderallDrug page because some number of people seem to be restoring the AdderallDrug page from their own personal copies whenever it gets spammed. So therefore, I'd expect any new content posted there would probably get lost. (And the "Viagra/Levitra/Cialis spammers" don't seem to be able to figure out how Wikis really work, so this page seems to be safe - at least for now! ;-)''
