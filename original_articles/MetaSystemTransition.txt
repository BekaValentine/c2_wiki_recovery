A theory about evolution by Valentin Turchin that can be applied to WikiEngines and WikiCulture''''''s.

If I remember it well, the initiator of the page quoted from: http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MST.html

"Consider a system S of any kind. Suppose that there is a way to make some number of copies from it, possibly with variations. Suppose that these systems are united into a new system S' which has the systems of the S type as its subsystems, and includes also an additional mechanism which controls the behavior and production of the S-subsystems. Then we call S' a metasystem with respect to S, and the creation of S' a metasystem transition."

S=TheOriginalWiki: "The way to make a number of copies of it" is given by (free) download links as e.g.
in WikiEngines.

What will be S', a WikiFarm, a WikiPortal engine, a DistributedWiki, an InterWiki?

If this is not on topic in WardsWiki, please relocate it to MeatballWiki, for which the
author makes a stub.
