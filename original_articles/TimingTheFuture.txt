By macro, what is meant is that the gross features or existence of something is being developed, for example
larger brains. By micro what is meant is that the subtle architecture of something is being developed
for example how the brain is organized in a human alive today.

''StarTrek'' is an alternate universe rather than a possible future of ours. The genetic wars of the 1990's clearly disrupt civilization so badly that we decline into another material age where fossil fuels are used up and Warp Drive is invented. Civilization then declines once again as interaction with other intelligent species is too much to handle for our political systems and we need to have another organizational age to rebuild our political structures. The first series takes place during this period. The next generation series takes place during the following advancement period. None of them experiences an age like we are going through now.

''My extrapolation above assumes the essence of StarTrek, StarWars etc, not an exact duplication. Jules Verne imagined ''A Trip  to the Moon'' - we went there, but not fired from a cannon. Circumnavigation of the globe was achieved by aircraft first, not balloons like ''Around the World in Eighty Days'' although Bertrand Piccard finally did it the Orbiter III in just 19 days. Someone said "ScienceFiction is the first draft of the future" we can imagine possible worlds long before we have the ability to participate in them. Obviously there were no genetic wars in the 90s so it won't happen exactly the same but it is likely if human civilization survives to expand beyond the solar system they will encounter LifeOnOtherPlanets, a quasi-federation will be formed if one does not exist out there like in StarTrek, and as more civilizations are encountered conflict, power struggles and their resolution will dominate as in StarWars not unlike WWI and II when technology allowed many nations to simultaneously move men and materials and communicate rapidly on a global basis. Other possible futures are: an asteroid takes us out or (god forbid) we take ourselves out by nuclear holocast; Also a OneWorldGovernment (1984/BraveNewWorld) could emerge and stifle progress, or machines take over like in TheMatrix but being an optimist the projection above is hopefully a best case scenario. If such a thing as a GalacticWiki does evolve, that would be amazing for millions of civilizations to share and argue ideas in real 'time' (whatever that is since physicists say simultaneity does not exist), and discuss how this galaxy will reach out to Andromeda (which by the way will collide with us in a few billion years according to a display at the Haydn Planetarium), the Local Supercluster and the billions of galaxies beyond. For serious analysis of galactic colonization possibilities see "Interstellar Strategies for Interstellar Colonization" http://hanson.gmu.edu/filluniv.pdf and "The ETH and the likelihood of Interstellar Travel" http://www.nicap.dabsol.co.uk/eth.htm. By the way, happy 100th anniversary of the Wright's first flight (Dec 17, 2003)''

Some (absurdly) think the Brazilian Santos-Dumont beat the Wrights to it in (see http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/12/10/brazil.santosdumont.reut/index.html) the late 1800s. "He would keep his dirigible tied to a gas lamp post in front of his Paris apartment at the Champs-Elysees and every night he would fly to Maxim's for dinner. During the day he'd fly to go shopping, he'd fly to visit friends."

''It would be interesting to compare the number of Homo Sapiens that have ever lived with the number alive today 1B was reached only in 1800, in the 60s population was only 3B now it is over 6B projected to be 8B by 2025. Does that mean more significant historical events are happening now based on events/humans living? At what point did (will) number of humans alive exceed previous cumulative amount (not including ones living)? See http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/wp98001.html. 'Ages' also are not usually recognized by people in them - the 'Art Deco' movement was not labelled as such till the 60s even though it flourished in the 20s-30s. World War 1 was known as "the Great War" while it was happening. Da Vinci probably had no idea he was living in "The Renaissance"''

The Renaissance was generally recognized by people living at the time, though I don't know about Leo. Indeed, the discontinuity with the Middle Ages wasn't nearly as significant as they thought, and were it not for them we might not ascribe so much significance to the period.

What name would our age now have?
----
'''An age of Organization by Invention and Centralization'''
* Beginning in 1929
* Perhaps ending around between 2033 and 2059
----
''Perhaps CentralizationByMerging''
* Merging by Gathering
** Merging DataCommunications - CloudComputing
** Merging Socialization - Wiki, Facebook, Twitter
** Merging Aural Communications - CellPhones, InstantMessaging , Skype
** Merging Standardizations - WikiPedia, ISO. other International Standards
** Merging Transportation - WebbingTraffic - Freeways, Tollroads, Periodic Mainstreets
* Merging by Owning
** Merging Corporations
** Merging Curerencies - Euro Etc
** Merging Localities
*** United States
*** European Union
** Global Unions
*** UnitedNations
** Merging By Conquest
*** Surrendering Autonomy
**** Allied Nations
*** Surrender of what we now call Freedom for convenience and comfort 
**** However supplied)

''Followed by an interim Reactionary Division and Destruction and then a New Age?''

I would suggest that ages are composed of multi-generational social developments which begin in crisis and end in crisis, only to provide opportunities for a new beginning in which the old way of doing things is scraped and the wheel is reinvented.
