Got this from a wiki user:

	 :	There's a ton of information here. Is there any way the pages can be ranked, say by number of views?  ''see http://c2.com/cgi/topten?do=counts&do=wiki''  Perhaps also a user rank. For example, http://vim.sf.net/ has a bunch of scripts that can be downloaded. It tracks them by number of downloads and a "karma" factor - users are allowed to rate them on a scale of quality as being -1, 0 or 1. So this works like good user feedback on the quality of a given script.

Any thoughts?
