I have a passion for good software and good software design.
Ruby, is very quicky becoming my language of choice. I'm still learning, so,
given time........
Anyone reading read Why's Guide to Ruby. Gripping stuff :-) Its the first progamming language
guide I've read that makes me laugh !! I suggest you take a look.
