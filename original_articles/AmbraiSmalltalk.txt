Beautiful SmallTalk system for MacOsX.  Originally beta released in April 2004, as of October 2006 it is in its 8th beta release; when released, will probably have a free version and a commercial version.

Unfortunately the site has been quiet for more than a year, and the beta release crashes when run on current versions of OS X. It's a shame, it was a really great start and just what I was looking for. The problem is that developers are not interested in an open-source model and apparently do not have time to finish and maintain the product themselves. -- JonathanASmith
