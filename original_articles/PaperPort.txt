''ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20100811''

The name of some excellent software which I have used for years since it was furnished with a sheet fed scanner I purchased in 1995 or so. It is a good tool for gathering and storing M''''''emoryArtifacts in Digital Format. PaperPorting can be utilized as an A''''''nchorPoint in ones own PersonalInformationSystem.  It can be a means of Enhancing and Complimenting H''''''umanThought, by utilizing its strength as an A''''''rtifactRetentionAndRecovery method and means. It can be made a part of the ThinkingMachine. We can expect other such software products to be developed which will even more closely match memory and thought.
