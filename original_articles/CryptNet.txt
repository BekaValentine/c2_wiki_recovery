It's just a tuple-processing collective. Honest.

A real-world implementation of the CryptNet is the bramble of Mixmaster nodes... but the messages going through Mixmaster are just chit-chat about inconsequential things, honest.

Those of you who are knowledgeable about conspiracy theories would have immediately seen the parallels between CryptNet and the FreeMasons. To the public, those belonging to CryptNet claimed that there were only 10 levels of rank in their society. However, it was rumoured that there were actually 33 levels of CryptNet. The secretive FreeMason society also has 33 levels that one can ascend to (although they do not hide the fact that there are 33 levels).
