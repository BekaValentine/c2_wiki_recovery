CVS is a freeware SoftwareConfigurationManagement that uses merging rather than locking and manages projects rather than files. CVS is available for all popular platforms under a GPL from http://www.cyclic.com , who sell commercial support for it.

'''Q:''' Is "CyclicCvs" the same thing as plain old "CVS" or is "Cyclic" some particular flavor?

'''A:''' As far as I can tell CyclicCvs is the same, at least the above website redirects you to http://www.cvshome.org.
It is simply the continuation of the old "plain" CVS.

There is no such thing as CyclicCvs.  Cyclic is the company that supports CVS development.
