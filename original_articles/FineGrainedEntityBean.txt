From UrbanCode website: 

"The Fine Grained Entity Bean idiom is perhaps the most simple one for beginners to grasp. That's because this idiom presents a pattern of usage that is most similar to the one found in standard object oriented applications. When developing an application using the Fine Grained Entity Bean idiom the developer obtains reference to the entity bean and makes method calls to the individual accessor and mutator methods. This idiom is fine grained because every data [attribute] is accessed individually via an accessor method."
