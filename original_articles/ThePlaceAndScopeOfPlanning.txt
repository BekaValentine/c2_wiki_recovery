Two extremes in the pursuit of goals: 
* All planning and no work
* No planning and all work. 
It is more probable that a strategy somewhere in the middle will yield the best results.  

Planning consists of just enough system, structure, and resources to get started. While things develop, one may add iterations of additional planning. This is especially true if the project or goal has little or no definition. It is often necessary to begin work before one has complete plans. This is is necessary to conserve or to employ valuable resources efficiently, and to meet a multiplicity of scheduled targets.

Planning can consist of one or a mix of several of the following:
* BigPlanning 
* CapacityPlanning
* CategoryPlanning
* ContingencyPlanning
* EnterpriseResourcePlanning
* ExtremePlanning
* IterationPlanning
* PairPlanning
* ReleasePlanning
* ScenarioPlanning
* SprintPlanning
* StrategicPlanning
* SuccessionPlanning
* ThereHaveBeenAlready

Perhaps a clear definition of planning (the links listed above do not provide this) and a discussion of how and whether "planning" should be a separate activity from "working."  This separation appears to be a very Taylorist approach.
