I've found the Ergomatic (R) keyboard.  This seems to be the same design as the MaltronKeyboard but at the much more accessible price of US$ 175.

Also quite similar to the KinesisKeyboard.

Unfortunately, it looks like this keyboard is not being sold at this time.  January 8th, 2010.

The price on this seemed like a really good deal, so I purchased one of these last week, and am currently typing on it.
Compared to the KinesisKeyboard, I much prefer the layout, real function keys, and center keypad.

But I'm unhappy with the quality compared to the Kinesis. The keys feel is sloppy, requiring more pressure and further key travel before contact is made. It *is* the same design as the MaltronKeyboard, as they licensed the layout from Maltron for independent manufacture.

I will likely be returning the Ergomatic for a Maltron, but the Ergomatic may be a good buy if you aren't fussy, or are on a tight budget.

''I don't know of anyone who has tried both an Ergomatic and a genuine Maltron so I don't know how they compare head-to-head, but I have a Maltron and it feels pretty cheap too. If I had it to do over again, I would probably buy an Ergomatic before buying a Maltron.'' -- RobertChurch
