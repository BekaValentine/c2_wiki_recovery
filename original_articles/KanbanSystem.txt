A Kanban is a card containing all the information required to be done on a product at each stage along its path to completion and which parts are needed at subsequent processes. These cards are used to control work-in-progress (W.I.P.), production, and inventory flow. A KanbanSystem allows a company to use JustInTime (J.I.T) production and ordering systems which allow them to minimize their inventories while still satisfying customer demands.

A KanbanSystem consists of a set of these cards, with one being allocated for each part being manufactured, that travel between preceding and subsequent processes. The KanbanSystem was developed more than 20 years ago, by Mr. Taiichi Ohno, a vice president of Toyota, along with ShigeoShingo, to achieve objectives that include:

	* reducing costs by eliminating waste/scrap
	* try to create work sites that can respond to changes quickly
	* facilitate the methods of achieving and assuring quality control
	* design work sites according to human dignity, mutual trust and support, and allowing workers to reach their maximum potential.

A KanbanSystem has the following characteristics:

	1 A simple and understandable process
	1 Provides quick and precise information
	1 Low costs associated with the transfer of information
	1 Provides quick response to changes
	1 Limit of over-capacity in processes
	1 Avoids overproduction
	1 Minimizes waste
	1 Control can be maintained
	1 Delegates responsibility to line workers
