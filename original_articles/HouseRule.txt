A HouseRule is a change to the rules of a game, specific to a certain group of players.

Some HouseRule''''''s become so popular that they become acknowledged as game variants.

HouseRule''''''s can occur in all games - once, before a chess game, I was asked if we played with EnPassant. -- OleAndersen

''Example: When rolling a d20 to hit, on a natural 1 you "fumble your weapon", lose combat advantage, and grant combat advantage to your adversary. That's not in the D&D book(s), but it's a very common HouseRule''

It is a useful HouseRule on this wiki not to assume knowledge on the part of the reader by making a reference which is only meaningful to those in the know.
