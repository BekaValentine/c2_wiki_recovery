UserCenteredDesign means making things so that they are maximally usable.  User interface which doesn't get in your face.

A good, fast read is:

''TheDesignOfEverydayThings'' by Don Norman.

http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0465067107.01._PE_PI_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg
[ISBN: 0465067107] from Los Angeles Times: "...makes a strong case for the needlessness of badly conceived and badly designed everyday objects...[T]his book may herald the beginning of a change in user habits and expectations, a change that manufacturers would be obliged to respond to. Button pushers of the world, unite."
