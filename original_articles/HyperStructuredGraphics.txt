HyperStructuredGraphics are vector-graphics hierarchically composed of remote hyper-linked (URLs) sub-graphics.   The location, size, and orientation of the remote graphic can be be locally altered, as well as the graphic-state (fill-pattern, brush, foreground/background colors, fonts, etc..). 

Tgif (http://bourbon.cs.umd.edu:8001/tgif/) and IvTools are two examples of vector-graphic drawing editors that support HyperStructuredGraphics.
