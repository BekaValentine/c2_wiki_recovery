Scott Kalter is a free-lance software contractor.  He has worked as an MTS, General Manager, Vice President, and even a cofounder of an Internet startup.


He stumbled into ExtremeProgramming while perusing Object Oriented Tips [http://www.kinetica.com/ootips/ - ''BrokenLink as of 2004-02-22''].  

His gratification at seeing PairProgramming was extreme as he did research in the early '90s working on real-time collaborative tools to support just such activity (he and his partners were tired of time-sharing the keyboard).  

The policies towards ContinuousIntegrationRelentlessTesting, XpDesign, ModelFirst, BusinessValueFirst and WorstThingsFirst are extremely refreshing and reminiscent of discussions with his friend MartyHeyman.
