Based on the JavaVoxelApplet, a DataMusicVoxelApplet is suggested as an OpenSource project.

DataMusic representations are now as follows:

	* A path through a 3D voxel (http://www.google.com/search?q=voxel) landscape is identified with a single
		* stock-chart or 
		* melody line
	* Several paths can simultaneously be 
		* watched as portfolio
		* listened as polyphony
	* Different colors differentiate
		* stocks charts
		* sounds
	* A path bifurcation can be interpreted as	
		* another stock-estimate, as estimated by some algorithm (or neuronal network)
		* another musical composition option 
	* Different light radiosity on the paths represent different volumes
		* of the stock market 
		* of the sounds 

For better orientations, put in some lines in true perspective, representing the centerlines of the black keys of a piano-keyboard, like this:

  || ||| ||
 C	 

The current trace point of a path can be represented by a beam originated in the fly-by camera and targeted at the current frequency/sound. The varying intensity of the light beam detects/reflects the radiosity of the current trace point.

This orientation scheme allows correctly mapped microtones, pitch-bends and true 3D spacial sound. The different colors are mapped to different sounds.

Note that you can control the flight by mouse inputs in the linked JavaVoxelApplet : http://anfyteam.com/anj/voxel/anvoxel.html.

Who would like to program this? (My activities are focussed on developing music, based on such imaginations, not yet realized as software.)

When you additionally download the ThirdVoice annotation system, you get some more (automatically generated) links to this text. 

A 2D cut of a 3D voxel landscape, viewing a single path segment with scalable piano keyboard coordinate-lines for frequency (not necessarily in Well Tempered Scale) and volume as a chart would look like this:

For a Midi Sequencer/Composer module the conventional volume representation is quite handy. For voxel-rendering, the olume bars are replaced by intensities of the minipath segments between two adjacent pitch points.

An excellent '''Midi Sequencer With Audio Integration''' 
	* for Windows / Linux 
	* given as OpenSource
	* to be ported to or integrated in a Java3D application

I doubt you are going to have much luck getting someone else to write the OpenSource software that ''you'' want.  Successful OpenSource projects are always started by someone writing software that they themsleves need.  There is not enough momentum to keep the project going, otherwise.

If this is mere vapour-ware and you're not going to write it yourself, why are you writing about it it here? Instead post a request on CoSource http://www.cosource.com/

''ThankYou for this very valuable hint. Do you have experience with this system? I studied the website and I am reminded to the WikiStoneSociety. Is there some relation? It could be one step towards a WikiWayOfLife. -- FridemarPache''

You should take a look at Cthuga (http://www.afn.org/~cthugha/ ). Theres a GL 3D Cthuga which looks like what you want and a 2D Java Cthuga. Its not quite what you're after but seems like it might interest you.
