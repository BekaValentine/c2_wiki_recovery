Vincent Kong is a student at the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada, studying Mathematics and Chartered Accountancy. He came upon this wiki after researching emergence, in his current quest to understand the global credit crisis.

He is developing his idea that perhaps the global credit crisis is actually an emergent phenomena, that could not have been predicted or stopped. Perhaps there is nobody to blame, no one to crucify. Perhaps it was something that ''had'' to happen, based on all the parameters that were set by the global financial system.
