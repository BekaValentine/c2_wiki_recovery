E.g., if a function contains a binary test in the inner loop, split it into two functions which are almost identical (opposes good design practice - see the second rule of optimization RulesOfOptimization).  Also include such stuff as FunctionInlining.  CeePlusPlus relies heavily on automatic FunctionInlining ... which gives us the principle: if optimization is bad, let the machine do it from clean code.  This principle, obvious here, applies to all OptimizationPattern''''''s. -- EddieEdwards
