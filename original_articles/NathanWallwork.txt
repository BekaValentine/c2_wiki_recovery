I'm a programmer and Open-Source advocate, with a habit of fixing broken things when I become aware of them. I carry many tools with me all the time.

I'm working on something I plan to release under the GPL, but it's not ready yet.

I've just found this wiki thing and I thought I'd check it out. I found something I wanted to comment on, but I figured I should have a page to link to, and that this would give me a chance to verify I know what I'm doing before I start messing with an existing page.

Welcome, I hope you find this wiki interesting. It is a good idea to have a home page here and link contributions from it. I am someone who is around here quite often. -- JohnFletcher
