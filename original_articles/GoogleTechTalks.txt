Technical talks given at Google (by Googlers or invited speakers) and made available to the public on video. Many of them are not strongly related to computing, and some are in fact not very technical. Talks at Google which aren't classified as Tech Talks appear as TalksAtGoogle (or AtGoogleTalks ) on http://www.youtube.com/user/AtGoogleTalks and the appropriate sections of http://video.google.com/googleplex.html . The talks appeared first on Google Video, then also on YouTube after Google bought it up. http://groups.google.com/group/google-friends/browse_thread/thread/2711ef5fe7d25570 appears to be the original Tech Talks announcement.

The quality of the talks varies widely, and for many of the better ones the same talk (or something very similar by the same author) has also been recorded and publicly released by others. But that's fair enough for what is basically an omnibus or fire-hydrant of many or most of the general talks given at Google.
