I was previously (2002-2009) the manager of a fledgling, programmer friendly XP TDD shop developing electronic toll collection systems in New York, USA.

In 2009 I joined ACS Transportation Solutions's toll collection systems practice as a vice president.

My public e-mail is CFMITCHELLatAOLdotCOM. I check it occasionally. If you put Wiki in the subject line it improves the chances of me seeing it.
