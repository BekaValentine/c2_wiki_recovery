Also known as Jeanine Levy.

A Smalltalker since 1992, Jeanine has experience in Object Analysis and 
Object Design on numerous projects in multiple problem domains.  In addition
to being a senior Smalltalk developer on the VcapsProject, Jeanine has
instructed, mentored, and led Smalltalk development teams.  She recently 
received her MBA (1998) with the hope of now being a ''schooled'', as well as
qualified leader of Object development efforts.  

The VcapsProject has affirmed her belief in CrcCard''''''s, the importance of analyzing Object Behavior (not just State) and building UseCases.  These practices provide a seamless way of documenting analysis and design decisions throughout the entire project, a practice where deliverables are incrementally updated with integral technical details as the team progresses through the project life cycle.

Personal sticking point:  why do managers insist on using traditional project
management/planning skills, when the skills that really work are those utilized 
in ExtremeScheduleNegotiation???  After all, the way an engineer designs a 
particular component part (EngineeringTask) is planned and managed differently 
than is a project for building a sub-assembly which may contain the engineer's 
component part (CommitmentSchedule)??  This is the same concept in software 
development projects.  The two perspectives (project deliverable versus 
engineering task) contain real differences.  Because these differences are just 
that, ''real'', why do managers typically spend so much time ignoring them??
