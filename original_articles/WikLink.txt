What is WikLink?

WikLink is a small web application for a community of users who want to share their bookmarks online. Anyone can freely edit or modify the links.

This may sound rather simplistic, but a WikLink is a nice way to collaborate on the Web. It is also inspired by WikiWikiWeb for its philosophy and TeleFerique for the Default aesthetic. 

A lot a nice features: 
	*import/export bookmarks
	*RssFeeds
	*most popular, most active ...
	*XHTMLValid
	*...
