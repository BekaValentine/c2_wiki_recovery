One of LeadershipPatterns

A good leader eventually will need to lead many teams

'''therefore'''

forge your team into leaders for future teams and sub-teams.

A great idea; however I've seen attempts to forge leaders go awry.

A couple thoughts of what to do:
	* Let your people actually lead.  Give them something to lead that will allow them to learn, make mistakes, and grow as a leader.
	* Don't interfere with thier leadership unless absolutely necessary.  Nothing destroys morale and confidence more than stepping in and taking over.
	* Help foster the ideas of your new leaders.  Take their ideas seriously; help them to reach correct decisions.
	* Show confidence in them.  Let them see the 'bigger picture' of the project, team, et. al. every now and then.  Let them see some of the decisions you have to make.  Suddenly, you might find you have allies when you need to move the team in various directions.

What not to do:
	* Give your new leader a bogus 'title', then leave them in the dark about the project or the rest of the team.
	* Don't involve your new leaders in decision making processes.
	* Don't give your new leader people to actually ''lead''.
	* Get upset, replace your new leader, and follow the first three bullet points again.

The odd thing I've learned about leadership:  there are no hard and fast answers.  Leaders have to be students as well as teachers; something that a lot of people lose sight of.
