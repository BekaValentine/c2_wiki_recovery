
Complex systems and methodologies should always be road-tested before they dethrone the current set, barring special circumstances. It amazes me the number of tech fads that take off without sufficient road-testing being done on them. If maintenance is a main factor in the domain, then something should be tested for at least 5 years, if not longer before being declared a victor.
