Also currently involved with TogetherSoft, I believe

'' A recent announcement from him suggested he is now spending full time as President of TogetherSoft, and leaving his training and consulting duties to other associates at Object International.''

Peter started Object International long ago, developing several modeling tools, culminating in the Together products.  OI then morphed into TogetherSoft with Peter are the CEO & President.  He is no longer CEO, instead he is Chief Strategy Officer.  Object International has resurfaced since that change, and is the sponsor behind TheCoadLetter online newsletter.

''Merged from M''''''ostSeriousMistakes''

Just found this nice quote from PeterCoad!

"JDH: What are the three most serious mistakes you find clients making? 

PC: Three people mistakes:
	* not working with domain experts, 
	* not having a ChiefArchitect, and 
	* not working with a core design team.
And four process mistakes:
	* not using a feature-driven process;
	* not delivering frequent, tangible, working results;
	* not budgeting for improving some; and 
	* not budgeting for throwing some away.
"

''Verrrry Interesting!'' XP has features to avoid all of these "mistakes" except the ChiefArchitect one. Of course, at any moment, someone may be leading the design, but an XP [core design] team definitely has no chief. I'd like to interrogate Peter on that one.  --RonJeffries
