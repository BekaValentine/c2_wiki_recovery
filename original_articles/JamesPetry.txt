I'm a developer in the Midlands of England.

I have programmed in XsltLanguage and
object-oriented PerlLanguage, using ExtensibleMarkupLanguage to create JavaLanguage programs
and JavaServerPages, as well as CsharpLanguage and ASP.NET.

Increasingly I am using ApacheAnt to replace glue programs previously written in PerlLanguage.
And sometimes ApacheMaven too.

Increasingly using ScalaLanguage and ClojureLanguage.

Interests:
WhatIsRefactoring, FunctionalProgramming
