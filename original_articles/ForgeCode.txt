Code is malleable like steel. Ancient sword makers
knew that simply making the shape of a sword was not enough. The internal structure of the steel had to be 
changed. By flattening and folding a steel block hundreds of times the internal structure of the steel is 
changed to become stronger, 
more rust resistant, and holds its edge better 
than just cast steel swords. Code is the same way. The initial writing of code is ok, but by rewriting it many times and changing it repeatedly makes the code become much stronger. But you must have the courage to break what is not
broken: to forge code. Forging is breaking and repairing, breaking and repairing, breaking and repairing. 
Forging code is a process that combines refactoring, testing, and time. Good code comes from these three elements.
