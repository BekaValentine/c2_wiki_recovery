'''The C2 needs a dead link sweeper.'''

I get a little tired of plowing through all the old links and cleaning up. There are lots of other WikiGnome''''''s out there adding [dead link] annotations to stuff, but the real effort is in then editing the content to either remove all references to stuff that's ''really'' dead, or rewording or massaging the content to show the current state of affairs.

Still, a little automated help in getting rid of the link rot would be a wonderful thing. Eh, Ward?

I make it a habit to try to reconnect to the information the dead link seemingly references, and find that many times the information is alive, it was relocated/renamed, now living in a different location (which link is replaced). No simple automatic process can be made to substitute for thinking, searching, relating and modifying the dead links existing in this wiki. Deletion, the simplest of automatic processes, in not a good option, because it removes the reason or idea for which the link stands. I volunteer to become one of the ''DeadLinkSweepers''-- DonaldNoyes.20110610

''Isn't being 'dead' a prerequisite for being a 'dead link-sweeper'? Why would you volunteer for that. ;-)''

We'll all get there much to soon. You know I meant to ''sweep'' BrokenLink''''''s. I don't intend to be a dead link-sweeper until I reach 106! Then someone else can sweep them, I'll be dust :(

'''Yeah.''' I wasn't trying to suggest that Ward change the C2 to just ashcan dead links, Donald. I meant that this Wiki needs a means of marking them so that the WikiGnomes can then track down and correct these deficiencies. I said as much, up above. -- MartySchrader

First Go Round 20111001 - How to Do It 
* Large Task - over 16150 pages have ExternalWikiLink''''''s
* Identify Pages with unidentified BrokenLink''''''s
** identify via the BrokenLink tag
*** http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?search=BrokenLink
** fix or remove the link ( as a SecondEffort )

History (number of pages includes only those tagged, not those having links that are dead, and have not been detected as no longer containing the material being referenced via the link)
* 20111002 - 482 pages
* 20140908 - 573 pages - additional - 91 pages
