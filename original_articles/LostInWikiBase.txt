I just noticed that there are people actually going into WikiBase and making edits to pages like http://c2.com/cgi/wikibase?ExtremeProgramming. Some of them seem to be under the impression that WikiBase ''is'' WikiWiki. I'd hate to think people are getting a first impression of WikiWiki from a relatively unmaintained older copy of itself. It's like going on a first date with week-old stubble and BO. Is there any way we can remedy this? Ward?
