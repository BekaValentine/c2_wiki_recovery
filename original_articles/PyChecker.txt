PyChecker is a StaticCodeAnalysis tool for finding bugs in PythonLanguage source code. It finds problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic languages, like C and C++. It is similar to lint. Because of the dynamic nature of Python, some warnings may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be fairly infrequent.

PyUnitTestBrowser integrates with this. This means PUB is now a complete IDE that tests your code with PythonUnit, lints your code with PyChecker, and edits your code with P''''''yShell.

OK, fine. Where's the DeBugger? (and versioning support?)

The PythonDebugger is here:

I'm not sure what you mean by versioning support... in a lint-like utility.

''What happened to '''P''''''yLint'''?
