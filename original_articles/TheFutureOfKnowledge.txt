	 :	"In today's crowded marketplace of business publications, it takes something that bit special to stand out and be noticed. A decade ago, PeterSenge''''''s TheFifthDiscipline was widely regarded as one of the seminal business books of the 1990's, introducing to an appreciative and expanding audience the integrated concepts of systems thinking and the "learning organisation". This new book by fellow American author VernaAllee carries the potential to compete for similar accolades in this current decade." -- Amazon review
