This is another name for ResourceContention.

The important aspect here is not that there is a share resource that acts as a ResourceContention, but that there is a convoy of processes or threads waiting to execute. ConvoyContention''''''s may form even if there are no ResourceFormation''''''s. The reason is simple: If there are several resources and there is risk for DeadLock, one common way to avoid it is to get the locks in an specific order. Of course that order means that there are always big ConvoyFormation''''''s, because processes or threads are always waiting for almost the same resources.

So you see, avoiding DeadLocks is an easy way to get into ConvoyFormation''''''s. One way to get out of all this is to use LockFreeSynchronization instead of LockBasedSynchronization.
