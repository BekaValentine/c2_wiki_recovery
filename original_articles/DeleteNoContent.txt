Hi there!

You've probably come here from a page whose text has been deleted and has been replaced with this message.

Please understand that we mean no harm in deleting your page. In fact, we're delighted to have you, but the page you created seemed to contain no content worth saving. If this page was intended as a test, congratulations -- you succeeded in creating a page. Please use the WikiWikiSandbox for testing, or if you like, you can create a page with your RealName and add a little info about yourself. Such a HomePage normally won't be deleted.

If we misunderstood, feel free to go back and fill in your old content (it should be in the EditCopy), perhaps accompanied by a bit more explanation so nobody else will mistake it for a page with no content. In any case, if you'd like to learn more about WikiWiki you can visit the NewUserPages where we officially WelcomeVisitors and explain some of the conventions of Wiki.

On the other hand, if it really was just a test, you can complete the deletion by replacing the text ''D''''''eleteNoContent'' with the text ''delete'' on your test page.

If you're not the person who created the page, please wait a day before seconding this deletion, so that the original poster will have time to see this message. Also consider using DeleteNoContent yourself when deleting pages you feel are lacking in content; it keeps Wiki a welcoming environment for newcomers, while still taking care of sandbox cruft.

''How is this different from DeletedButWelcomeToWiki?''

DeletedButWelcomeToWiki 
* is for pages with content like "Hooray! it worked!" or "Did this work?" or something like that.  
* Such pages are often created by newcomers to Wiki who are simply trying to convince themselves that they can, indeed, create pages.
* "WelcomeT''''''oWiki" acknowledges this, and offsets what would otherwise seem to be an unfriendly and unwelcoming act: deleting someone's first contribution. 
* Pages marked DeletedButWelcomeToWiki are often deleted within 48 hours of their creation 
DeleteNoContent 
* is similar, but the "WelcomeT''''''oWiki" doesn't necessarily apply.  
* DeleteNoContent may hang around for years before being axed  
* Content (or lack thereof) is in the eye of the beholder, and so explanatory text (above) explicitly makes room for the possibility that the deleted page might have meant something to its original author.  

Granted, these W''''''ikiTags seem similar, but the context and the connotations are slightly different.

''DeleteNoContent also seems to be often used on WikiSpam and various types of offensive material (someone has been posting naughty pictures on the Wiki recently).''

'''Important! '''

Please recall that MySignalIsYourNoise. Don't make summary judgements concerning the ''value'' of a page's contents. This particular label should only be applied to pages that clearly have '''no''' content, not those that have '''poor''' content.
