Ignorance is often taken to mean not knowing something. More precisely, it is the process of willfully ignoring things. This can save time and turmoil. But beware: '''Ignorance looks like stupidity'''.

''Ignorant about ignorance, I had thought it was willfulness-neutral. A couple of local dictionaries seem to agree that one can be ignorant through accident or design.''

And I was certain ignorance was willfulness-neutral, and that stupidity was willful ignorance. Perhaps the text is an example of what it describes? Though that would depend on whether it's ignorant or stupid.

[''Ignorant'' refers to a lack of knowledge or awareness. (http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ignorant) ''Stupid'' indicates a lack of intelligence or an inability to learn, to overcome ignorance. (http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=stupid) Sometimes, our ignorance itself can make us stupid. (UnskilledAndUnawareOfIt.) But neither term in itself implies will or intent. Moreover, in actual use, ''stupid'' frequently implies an ''innate'' inability to learn; therefore, the term should be used with utmost care in order to ward off misunderstandings.]
