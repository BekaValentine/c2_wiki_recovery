Martin Fowler is still a bit anti-RDBMS for my tastes. He still proposes using OO-built navigational structures in place of or in addition to (OnceAndOnlyOnce violation) the database. He also tends to "see" things as subtypes, which I tend not to find a safe long-term design decision choice (ThereAreNoTypes). -- top  ''OnceAndOnlyOnceDoesNotImplyGoldenHammer''
