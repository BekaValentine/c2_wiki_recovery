I own a small consulting and training firm in Texas.  We specialize in C++, .Net, and Java based applications.  Note that I don't specialize in accounting or telecom.  Our clients bring the domain expertise and we design and build the application.

Currently, we are working on several Telecom applications and an application for online learning.
