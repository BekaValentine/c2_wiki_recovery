A Relation on domains D1 x D2 x D3 x ... x Dn:
     is potentially infinite so long as at least one domain is infinite 
     is potentially uncountable so long as at least one domain is uncountable

(see RelationalModel).

A FiniteRelation is a Relation possessing the quality of being finite.  FiniteRelations have nice qualities for use in DataBase''''''s.  In particular, it is possible to compute a list of all things in a finite relation, and it is possible to represent the relation as a simple list (aka. a 'table').  RelationalAlgebra operations over FiniteRelations, excepting Inverse, are closed.

All FiniteRelation''''''s are also CountableRelation''''''s.
