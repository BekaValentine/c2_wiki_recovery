I'm a founding partner with DaveAstels at AdaptionSoftware, a fledgling agile software studio based in Nova Scotia, Canada. 

My main focus at Adaption is on "everything else": administration, marketing, sales, yadda, yadda. I'm responsible for the company name, the logo, the website, and much of our current marketing strategy and tactics. As a programmer I am apprenticed to Dave. 

Before Adaption I kicked around the software development world for 20+ years in various capacities, working as a programmer, technical writer, marketing person, user interface designer, multimedia producer, and manager. OK.
