To move from the AbsoluteBestPlan (ABP)to the actual plan you must incorporate your actual resources and develop the implications to the plan -- actual people working actual workdays with actual equipment etc. etc. -- this will lead to resource conflicts and other things which cause the program to be delayed from the ABP.  

A "rule of thumb" type figure for the ratio between ABP and the actual plan (i.e. the time required for each) is probably in the range of 0.5 to 0.8 with typical numbers being in the .5-.65 range -- I spent a year one time trying to estimate how much time was being lost to various logistic delays -- waiting for parts, waiting for people resources, waiting for this and that ... and concluded that we were losing as much as half the work day to such things -- whence comes the 50% number.  Good luck on doing better.  To do better however, you need to know where the bar is -- hence estimate the ABP and then do the actual plan.
