''From BrianMarick's email to the XpMailingList:''

At this PLoP, there will be a heavy emphasis on focus groups devoted
to particular domains. "Test-first acceptance testing patterns" would
be one example. I'm sure someone scouring the archive for [the
XpMailingList] could come up with more.

PLoP will also have my pet project: afternoon and evening activities
in which people learn by doing. I really want to see sparks generated
by people working together, sparks that help unformed ideas snap into
place. For example, what could we do with pair programming?
''PairProgrammingExplored'' [''PairProgrammingIlluminated''?] isn't
the last word on the subject. What pair activities - doing, then
reflecting - might help the community clarify its ideas about how to
make pairing work?

And so forth.

Here's the call for papers:

Thanks.
