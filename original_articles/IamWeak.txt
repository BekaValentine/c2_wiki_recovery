I was just working on a bug, and I could see the problem: someone had hacked some code into a function where it didn't belong.  I tried to fix it by putting the code where it did belong, but it just kept spiraling out of control and I ran out of stamina.  In the end, I just worked around the problem.  I admit it.

Unfortunately, this is a poorly factored, no unit test having BigBallOfMud.  Trying to do anything is RefactoringHell.

I've been there too. This usually happens when you are working late to fix a problem. Every change seems to introduce more bugs than if fixes. The best thing to do is to come back to it fresh the next day. 

I think that your concentration reduces with fatigue, so you only see the immediate problem in a few lines of code and fail to see the BiggerPicture. -- ChrisBrooking

The irony here, of course, is that the person who put that code where it was could easily have spent hours trying to put it into a better home. In addition to that, someone else will come tomorrow and spend hours trying to put it into a better home. Hopefully, someone will put a comment on this tricky bit saying "This is hard to move", and save the next person some time (or at least let them enter battle forewarned).

''Interesting point.  I never thought of it that way.  Maybe I'll at least go back and put a "This really shouldn't be here, but..." comment on it. -- EddieDeyo''
