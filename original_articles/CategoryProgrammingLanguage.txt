Pages to do with ProgrammingLanguage''''''s (contrast CategoryNaturalLanguage).
----
The convention is to append 'Language' for the WikiName and to expand single letters according to the WikiAlphabet.
However, sometimes that doesn't work and you have to improvise. Some less obvious or WikiUnFriendlyName''''''s are listed here ''(seems to me that '''all''' are listed here; should we clean this up?)'' (indeed: surely the only ones that need to be listed here are those that are neither of the form Onewordname''''''Language nor Multi''''''Word''''''Name?):

'''Other ProgrammingLanguage discussion'''

One may define a LanguageSubset, as an aid to teaching. 
Or talk about LittleLanguage. ''(...really a discussion of Unix tools)'' Or you may need help ChoosingTheRightLanguage to solve your problem.

On the other hand, some people regret starting a LanguagePissingMatch... (btw, CobolIsDead!)

Or, to address ProgrammingLanguage''''''s at a higher level. Is it a real ProgrammingLanguage, even if it's not TuringComplete? 
How might one go about MeasuringLanguageComplexity?

Or the performance of particular ProgrammingLanguage implementations - ComputerLanguageBenchmarksGame.

And discussions of LanguageAsInterface, LanguageUsability, EnglishLikeFeatures and such focus on the intersection between HumanBeing''''''s and the languages they use to communicate with each other and with compilers and interpreters.

ProgrammingParadigm shows some typical ProgrammingLanguage''''''s for each paradigm.

See ProgrammingLanguageNamingPatterns for information on the names of ProgrammingLanguages.
