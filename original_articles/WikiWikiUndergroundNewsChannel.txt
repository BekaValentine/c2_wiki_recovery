''A WikiWikiUndergroundNewsChannel is a WikiWiki intranet that is used to communicate the information (the same information to everyone) without the knowledge of the management.''

We got permission to set up a WikiWiki intranet where I work. At the beginning, it was used to record and communicate the development on our projects. But it has evolved into an underground news channel because the management has been in FireFighting mode for 6 months now. The management doesn't listen to what the employees say and  don't want to see the situation we are in. We do ManagementByCrisis.

This is a funny use of a WikiWiki intranet and very effective to keep each employee up-to-date with the latest crisis details. KnowledgeIsPower.
