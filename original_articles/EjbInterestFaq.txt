FAQ for the SunsEjbInterestList mailing list.

Also, there is a monitored discussion group pertaining to future versions of EJB, check out http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ejb-future

Someone on the list asked for a FAQ & I created this here - anyone can
add Q & A's so have at it!

Q1)  Should I post vendor specific questions on this mailing list?

A1)  Nope - go to their website and use their support forums/consultants etc...
     For BEA they seem pretty responsive at http://newsgroups.bea.com.
