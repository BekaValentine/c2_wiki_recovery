Debt is neither good or bad.  It allows you to get something you want earlier, but you have to pay interest until the debt is repaid.

CodeDebt is similar.  When you take short cuts you get the current job finished faster but your code becomes harder to work with until you spend the effort to clean up the code.  That is, you pay interest until you repay the original debt.

The best time to repay the debt is right before you would otherwise have to pay interest.
