A SunMicrosystems-led charitable effort to provide free, OpenContent educational material on the Web. Seems to be at least partly a deliberate alternative to WikimediaFoundation projects such as WikiBooks, WikiVersity and of course WikiPedia. The basic model appears to be that new or already-existing course material is uploaded, often in PortableDocumentFormat or similar files, for site members to comment on and chain together into courses. The uploads are supposed to be subject to review and approval by recognised experts appointed by the project leadership. Indeed, for better or worse, there seems to be not much of an actual wiki element to Curriki at present (2007).
