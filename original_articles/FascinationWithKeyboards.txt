Everyone wants to build a better input device.

Here are some things people are trying or talking about:

'''The variants:'''
	* DvorakKeyboard (not new hardware, just a different way of arranging the keys)
	* Concave: KinesisKeyboard, MaltronKeyboard, ErgomaticKeyboard
	* Heat-sensitive: FingerBoard
	* OneFingerKeyboard
'''The deviants:'''
	* DataHand
	* One Hand: HandyKey, InfoGrip
	* ShoeKeyboard
	* PianoKeyboard
	* Using plants that sense human emotions as input devices.  Believe it or not this is technically feasible.
	* The Mouse -- Though it's unbeatable in certain tasks and has a smaller barrier-to-entry, is just too limited to oust our polybuttonic friend.
	* BioFeedback
