For WikiGnome''''''s:

Recently, someone created a page filled with over a megabyte of "deleted" (maybe more; I stopped the page load in its tracks).

To get rid of such a monstrosity (without having to load the whole thing), use the EditCopy feature. Type the following URL in:

	 :	h''''''ttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?copy=Page''''''To''''''Delete

and replace Page''''''To''''''Delete with the name of the offending page. You'll get the old copy in the upper pane; you can abort the loading of the differences and still have the edit controls available.
