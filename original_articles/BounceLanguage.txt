JaronLanier's virtual reality company was called VPL, which stood for "VisualProgrammingLanguage". Chuck Blanchard developed the VisualProgrammingLanguage that he used called "Body Electric", and David Levitt later developed that into the BounceLanguage, by integrating the MacromediaDirector ShockWave library as a multimedia display engine.
