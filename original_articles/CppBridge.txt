A Java library and code generator that allows you to run your CppUnit tests as if they were written in JavaLanguage for JavaUnit. The code generator produces both CeePlusPlus code and Java code. The C++ code can be compiled with your CppUnit tests to produce a shared library which the generated Java code uses to implement the Test interface. You can treat the Java class just like any other Test. It can be run on its own or combined with other Tests to form a suite. 

CppBridge is the name of a package that is added to the junit package. There is a subdirectory for CppUnit named JavaUi that is also included in the CppBridge distribution. It contains some utility classes that are used by the generated C++ code.
