proofread for mistakes before posting your message (it helps eliminate embarrassing typographical, grammatical, and formatting errors). A spell-checker

I recommend proofing the content as well as just the appearance.  Compile and test code examples, check your facts, make sure you are referring to the same event, item or person.  It's dangerously easy to post information which is inappropriate or simply incorrect.  At least here on Wiki you can go back and cover up the occasional slip.  Email and News are not so forgiving.
