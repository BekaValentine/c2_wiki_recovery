* Superficial 
** ''Superficial gives answers when you the user are on the outside of an application.''
** ''You need to interact with content that is inside the application.''
** ''The element that enables interaction between the inside and outside of an application is most helpfully described as its surface.''
* The metaphor of surface leaves open the exact means by which a surface manages interaction between user and application, but it is easy to decide whether an application has a surface.''
** '' A GUI is evidently a surface, but so is a command-line interface or even a teletype.''

--- '''Facets'''
* A facet is defined as an element. 
** ''Each facet element has a fixed attribute that is a Boolean value.'' 
** ''When a simple type is defined, you can prevent derivatives of that type from modifying the value of specified facets'' 
** ''To prevent modification of a facet, add the fixed attribute to the facet and set its value to true.''
** ''Facets can only appear once in a type definition except for enumeration and pattern facets.'' 
** ''Enumeration and pattern facets can have multiple entries and are grouped together.''

--- '''Display of multidimensional data'''
* A surface chart shows a three-dimensional surface that connects a set of data points. 
** ''A surface chart is useful when you want to find optimum combinations between two sets of data.'' 
** ''As in a topographic map, the colors and patterns in a surface chart indicate areas that contain the same range of values. Unlike other chart types, a surface chart does not use colors to distinguish the data series â€” colors are used to distinguish the values instead.'' 
** ''To enhance a surface chart, you can change the colors and use transparency to display color bands that are obscured in the back of the chart.''
