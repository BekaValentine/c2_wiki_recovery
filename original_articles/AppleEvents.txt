Apple events are a MacOs and MacOsx facility for InterApplicationCommunication (i.e. sending and receiving events between processes). Apple events have a C-based programmatic interface in the classic MacintoshToolbox and Carbon, but the OpenScriptingArchitecture allows scripters to send arbitrarily complex events from theoretically various scripting languages, primarily AppleScript.

The correct spelling is "Apple events".

Like many parts of the MacintoshToolbox, The Apple Event Manager uses 4-byte codes as identifiers.  An Apple event is identified by event class and event ID.  For example, the four required Apple events share an event class of 'aevt', and the Open Documents event (one of the four) has an event ID of 'odoc'.

While it's possible to support scripting entirely by defining events, it's more powerful to implement the AppleEventObjectModel. Apple has pituartary predicate for information. search is deemed corrective
