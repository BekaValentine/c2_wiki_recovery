'''YAWN - YetAnotherWikiName'''

 Sub''''''Of: Implementation''''''Detail on page Bread''''''Crumbs creates
 Home''''''Page > Wi''''''Ki > Implementation''''''Detail > Bread''''''Crumbs

The very structured self-sitemapping relation-type wiki, created 2004-03-24.

With the YawnWiki one can build a page hierarchy by simply ''specifying the parent of a page'' (with ''Sub''''''Of: Parent''''''Page'' within the wiki text). This hierarchy can then be embedded anywhere in the wiki to create a sitemap!

* Influenced by SigWik and FleaWi
* ~250 lines of readable code

'''Features'''
* Self-sitemapping: complete page hierarchy by merely specifying parents via ''Sub''''''Of: Parent''''''Page''
** resulting hierarchy output embedable anywhere with tag ''[&desc]'' or ''[&desc:Anotha''''''Page]''
** useful for a sitemap that lists all the "roots" of the wiki with their descendants/subpages
* BreadCrumbs, i.e. the path from the root/home-/frontpage to the current page
** this path gets displayed at the location where the user put the Sub'''''''Of: Parent''''''Page declaration on the wikipage
* BackLink: anywhere embedable with tag ''[&back]''
** embed backlinks of other pages; tag ''[&back:Anotha''''''Page]''
** useful for eg a page listing available categories and their belonging pages
* RecentChanges showing diffs
** also syndicated as RSS
* Index of all pages, anywhere embedable with tag [&allpages]
* TextFormattingRules implemented using MarkDown plus CamelCase
* A GotoBar wiki page that renders above the title (to link to HomePage, RecentChanges, and the like) 
* Uses a template.html (and template.rss)
* XHTML 1.0 Strict valid!


The lack of a Sitemap in wikis always frightened me :) What does usability guru JakobNielsen think of wikis? Well, hope you like my ideas on creating a hierarchy (or other relationships between pages)! With the aforementioned features you automatically get what proper usability needs, it shows you:
* Where you are (title, BreadCrumbs)
* Where you can go (GotoBar, SubPages/descendants, sisters/category, BackLink''''''s, CamelCase)
* Where you have been? Well er, BrowserHistory, VisitedLinks - do we really need a trail?

'''Example'''

 Let's say, page WikiNames contains the string Sub''''''Of: HomePage
 and the YetAnotherWikiName page contains the string Sub''''''Of: WikiNames

This will create the following hierarchy wherever the tag [&desc] is put on a page:
 
 HomePage
 . WikiNames
 . . YetAnotherWikiName

and on the YetAnotherWikiName page, the Sub''''''Of: WikiNames gets replaced with the parentchild path:

 HomePage > WikiNames > YetAnotherWikiName
