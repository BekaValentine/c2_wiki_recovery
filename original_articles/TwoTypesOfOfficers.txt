This may also apply to programmers... an old joke which has made the rounds of the Internet, and probably did get started somewhere in the military:

''I know... this page lists '''four''' types of officers; however the joke is called TwoTypesOfOfficers.  I didn't make it up.''

---- 

All officers can be categorized by 2 paired attributes: energetic/lazy and smart/stupid.

* The energetic/smart officer is often referred to as "high speed, low drag". They are the hard chargers who will either go far or screw up spectacularly. A commander is lucky to have such an officer as long as they can control them just enough to keep them from crashing and burning.

* The lazy/smart officer is a pearl of great price. They will never try to make anything happen that is not already on their plate ''unless'' they spot a problem that might make their life more difficult. They will nip such problems in the bud. Every job they have will be easier when they leave than it was when they arrived.

* The lazy/stupid officer can be useful for the routine jobs that aren't very demanding but still need to be done. Put them under the supervision of an experienced and competent sergeant.

* The energetic/stupid officer is a viper at the breast of any command. They mean well. Catastrophe follows in their wake. They will volunteer for a suicide mission. Find one for them.
