I am starting a billion dollar software project called ISSU and am looking for talented staff for many different positions.

I have just published a free eBook called Beyond the Information Age at: www.vias.org that will give you the knowledge you need to consider working on this project.

Let me know what you think at: beyondinformation [at] gmail [dot] com.

Thanks,

I am VERY interested in getting into another Extreme Programming project.  I ran the XP team for Sage Systems (company went under due to lack of funding of Energy startups), and participated as both the manager and as a developer.  We didn't implement everything (no pair-programming for example), but did use most of the methodology.  It was GREAT!  The business partners LOVED it.

So.  I'm looking for another one.  I am interested in either full-time in the San Francisco, East Bay area, or contracting anywhere (on-site or remote). 

Contact me for more info.  Thanks,

Mike Anderson

ExtremeProgramming sounds intriguing and wonderful. But if it's not going to happen in my company (for whatever reason), how I am going to find a job one day in a company where it is happening already, or where it might be expected to happen? My particular area is the UnitedKingdom, and it looks like at least a couple of projects are giving it a go - XpEdinburgh and XpLondon for example.

I am hungry to find or help start an XP project in Manhattan!  See my wiki page  for a short discussion of my last project and links to my resume. -- RodneyRyan

I, too, am looking for a position on an ExtremeProgramming project in NewYorkCity!  Most of my experience is with WebObjects, Java, and related technologies.--ApoorvaMuralidhara  Update:  I am now coding (both Web applications and command-line tools) in C#/.NET, PHP, and Ruby.  I am doing test-first development with merciless refactoring, but would like to work at an XP shop with the PlanningGame and PairProgramming and so on.  I have experience working on a real ExtremeProgramming team, developing custom applications in WebObjects.  If you're looking for someone who is enthusiastic about writing code test first, refactoring, ExtremeVersionControl, PairProgramming, and the PlanningGame, and who genuinely enjoys collaborating with others to create clear, high-quality code quickly, and if you happen to be in NewYorkCity, please contact me!  My E-mail address is on my home page ApoorvaMuralidhara.

I'm a programmer who lives near Waltham, Massachusetts.  I want to find an XP job in a Java environment near here.  I've been a programmer for decades and when I read Kent Beck's book "eXtreme Programming eXplained - EMBRACE CHANGE" it gave me hope that there might be a shop where productivity is valued over ego.

When I got my first job as a programmer, I was thrilled that someone would actually pay me to do something I loved to do.  However, time has taught me that I get paid for all the non-programming stuff:
	* Generating schedules which only work because you KNOW the dependent project won't be done when they say.
	* Office politics.
	* Helping a new person get up to speed only to have them 1) leave or 2) publish your ideas as theirs.
	* Explaining to the clueless boss why his "great" idea is stupid.
	* Writing specifications which are rarely read and which are NEVER updated to reflect the final version.
	* Being forced to maintain code which should have been tossed years ago.
	* ...

I'd program even if I didn't get paid for it (However, I do have a family so I need to get paid.).
