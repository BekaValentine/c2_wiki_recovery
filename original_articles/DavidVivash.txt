I'm a Computer Science and Maths graduate from the UniversityOfSheffield, with experience in programming C/C++, Java, Lisp (Allegro), PHP, Prolog, and er VB...  Some better than others. Mostly use PHP and Java now anyway since I used them most at University. For my third year dissertation I looked at the possibility of FormalizingExtremeProgramming.

http://fuzzies.4mg.com is a game I wrote in Java, nice applet.

Also, you could see http://space.monopoly.iwarp.com for a game I wrote in C++ (for a PC).
