To create a Wiki page that consists primarily of a link to an external Web site.  For examples, see the RecordSet and PatternsDiscussionFaq pages.

Similar to links to SisterSites, except that the links are inline rather than at the bottom of the page.

Are such pages good, or bad?

'''Pros'''
	* Supports automatic linking with other Wiki pages that reference the subject.
	* Provides a space within Wiki to discuss an external Web page, or a place to hang related Wiki pages.
	* If people mention it a lot in discussions, they don't have to remember the external link each time. Book titles and ISBNs are good examples of this use (e.g. AdvancedPerlProgramming).
	* It OnceAndOnlyOnce''''''s an external URL. If the URL breaks or changes, there's only place that needs fixing.


'''Cons'''
	* Creates a content-free page if there is no discussion
	* Wiki discussion is separated from the actual subject
	* The subject of discourse cannot be edited by wikizens

If the page isn't pulling its weight, consider inlining the page to a logical parent and adjusting backlinks to that page. 

For example: ''... see Daniel Quinn's MyIshmael...'' to ''... see DanielQuinn's My Ishmael''
