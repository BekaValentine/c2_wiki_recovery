From a Warner Bros cartoon where Daffy duck claims to be the goose that laid the golden egg. Unfortunately for the duck, he gets kidnapped by mobsters. 

After putting the duck up in a mansion and waiting for the golden egg, the mobsters finally decide to "force the issue". The duck is, of course, kinda getting worried 'cos he ain't the goose!

Anyway, the duck is as surprised as anyone when, with a gun held to his head, he produces a golden egg.....

This kinda reminds me of commercial software development ....
