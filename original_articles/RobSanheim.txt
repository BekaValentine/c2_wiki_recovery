I'm a software developer by trade and by choice.  Currently working for a consulting firm in Madison, Wisconsin doing java web development.  I also strive to be a PragmaticProgrammer and keep things agile as much as possible.  This year I've been slowly learning RubyLanguage lately along with RubyOnRails.  I've also had a chance to do quite a bit with AjaxWebApplications using DirectWebRemoting in Java.  Check my blog below for speaking schedule on ajax in the Wisconsin area.  Recently (as of 11/16/05) became co-editor of http://www.ajaxian.com.

I sign my entries because I like to know who I'm talking with, but please don't let that stop you from editing/revising/whatever.

Currently reading:
* The Pragmatic Programmer India book with the really long title
* TheCathedralAndTheBazaar
* ObjectDesign

Read this year:
* HowToBeAlone
* HeadFirstDesignPatterns
* J2eeDevelopmentWithoutEjb
* HibernateInAction
* too many others to mention...
