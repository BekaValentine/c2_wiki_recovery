The CvsTutorial covers a lot of material which is great.  However there are RedHatLinux differences which should be noted.

''Note that RedHat has a different meaning on this wiki, see SixThinkingHats.''

For example, when you get to the inetd part of pserver in RedHatLinux 7.2 try these commands:

	* cd /etc/xinetd.d 
	* make a cvspserver file
	* make content of cvspserver the following:

# description: cvspserver.

service cvspserver
{
	socket_type	= stream
	protocol	= tcp
	wait		= no
	user		= root
	passenv	        = PATH
	server	        = /usr/bin/cvs
	server_args	= -f --allow-root=/usr/cvsroot pserver
	disable	        = no
}										

make sure /etc/services has this line in there: 

cvspserver	2401/tcp

Next:

	* /etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd stop
	* /etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd start
		''you can also do /sbin/service xinetd restart''
	* cat /var/log/messages and make sure "xinitd startup succeeded" appears. 
	* netstat -nlpd | grep 2401	and make sure you are root when you do that command. See if LISTEN is in there.

As mentioned in CvsTutorial, Karl Fogel's book 
http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html covers a lot
