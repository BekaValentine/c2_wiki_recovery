'''Top Five Visitor Pages'''

WikiWord''''''s that should be included on WikiPage''''''s within TheFirstFiveClicks in order to help WikiPuppy''''''s tour WardsWiki in a systematic pattern.

Rather than try to change everything at once, I'd like to prepend ''Cleaning'' to any new pages in the works. In the spirit of wiki, we can move them over to live or give up and delete them. Its just some suggestions to give the the WelcomeVisitors tour a facelift and hopefully start a productive campaign of CleaningWardsWiki. Thank you -- tr
