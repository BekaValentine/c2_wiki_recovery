From the FraudulentMindset page, someone who is StuckInFirstPersonView sees every problem from a first person view rather than stepping outside and considering third person view. 

This idea is also promoted in Buddhism, where one is supposed to view oneself in another person's shoes.

One may go so deep inside his GoldenHammer (and become nearly romantically involved with it) that he almost becomes the GoldenHammer himself. Advertising it as if he is the GoldenHammer ''advisor'', he who sees all through the GoldenHammer. The first person view of the GoldenHammer becomes that person's life.

One should step outside of first person view and become a third person - looking in virtual mirrors, checking to see if he is being a hypocrite, if he is solving problems only from one view point, etc. 

'''Examples'''

* Every problem can be solved with Lisp. All programming languages just reinvent Lisp (StuckInFirstPersonView seeing everything as Lisp).
* That person over there is very critical (hey, so are ''you'' for saying such - critical of criticism)
* My running shoes are the best. No other shoes would work (try stepping into someone else's shoes, you might like them)
