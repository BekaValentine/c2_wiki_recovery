This movie depicts the last days of Adolf Hitler, seen through the eyes of his secretary, fraulein Traudl. Saw it recently (in TheNetherlands, don't know about any US release scedules). Really impressive. Doesn't dehumanize Hitler as some devil incarnate, but rather shows the evil that men is capable of. brings home the horrors of war, and puts yor life in perspective. At least, that's the effect it had on me. A colleague of mine who's a historian confirmed the historical accuracy of it. It is based on the real memoires of secretary, who is briefly heard at the beginning of the movie, and seen once again at the very end, when she says that even when during the Nurnberg Trials she heard of the atrocious crimes committed by the Nazi's, she didn't feel responsible. But one day, she saw the monument for Sophie Scholl, a German girl who was executed because of her work in the resistance, and noted that she was executed at the same age that she herself started working for Hitler. Only then she realized that she should have known and that she should have found out.

All in all, a very impressive movie.  --AalbertTorsius.
