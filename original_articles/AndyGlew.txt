''[Note: a "helpful" WikiGnome moved the contents of the A''''''ndyGlewWikiExperience here. I guess that's alright, but it sure stifles ongoing discussion in a big way. Andy, feel free to reverse this refactoring into a form you and the discussion participants are more comfortable with.]''

'''Webpages, Wikis, etc.'''

Most of the links below are obsolete.

My most recent net.presence is at
* Google Docs: http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcxddbtr_6dvpxg2cj
* The comp-arch.net wiki, where I am trying to write a book on computer architecture: http://semipublic.comp-arch.net/wiki

''''Old Stuff''''


Obsolete, non-editable, university web pages: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~glew/glew.html.

For several years, I kept my CV and resume at Geocities, http://www.geocities.com/andrew_f_glew/.  That was closed down n, what, 2009?  Google docs and my own websites are now my web.homes, along with linkedin and facebook.

A public wiki, on a server that a friend has lent me space on: http://glew.dyndns.org (BrokenLink 2004-11-11).

I ran several inside-AMD wikis - and, a few wikis at Intel, for that matter.

A novice wiki user... since, what, 1996?  
I guess that means that I am not really a novice any more. See AndyGlewWikiExperience.

''Some software relevant links:''

* Rants about Software Technology 
	 :	http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~glew/sw-rants.html
* Programming Languages

* High-level editing

* Andy's "private wiki" on Wayne Scott's System
	 :	http://glew.dyndns.org contains stuff on interests such as programming languages and coding standards.

The UWisc web pages are now orphaned. One day I hope to have broadband and a WebServer at home, so that I am no longer at the mercy of companies, organizations, and institutions.  (2009: rented cloud server space for http://glew.ca, http://andy.glew.ca,  and http://semipublic.comp-arch.net.  Only the last was properly set up as of March 2010. 


'''Identity'''

''Software:''
A slow but sure programmer. A poor typist with carpal tunnel.
Interested in the meta-processes of programming, as a way to make up for my poor physical skills.
Interested in XP and lightweight methodologies.

''Hardware:''
A computer architect. I.e. designs microprocessors, not buildings.
Worked on the Intel P6 and MMX. Interested in XP for hardware design.
Now at AMD!!



'''Connections:'''

I used to work at "The Little Software House on the Prairie", Gould CSD/Motorola MCG with ScottPreece and BrianMarick, although not in the same group. BrianMarick made fun of my aspirations to design hardware - actually, he made fun of me in all ways, that just being one particular way.

''It's because I was intimidated by you. That used to be my way of being tongue-tied. I'm better now.''

No worries, Brian. I have, of late, realized just how advanced "The Little Software House on the Prairie" was. I don't think it's accidental that so many of us have had careers heavily influenced by software quality (you) or hardware quality (me).

You asked a question on WikiFarms. It was moved to ComparisonShoppingWiki. Then an answer appeared.

''Interested in XP for hardware design.''

Yes, I would also find that interesting.

''...no longer at the mercy of...''

Yes, I feel the same way -- I want to set up my own web server.
I'm finding it hard to articulate why I spend so much time diddling with this stubborn box, trying to coax it into serving web pages, when I can (and have) put web pages on distant servers in a tiny fraction of the time. See ProgramComputersYouCanUnplug.

Came across your home page, and realized we had communicated in the past.  I found some nice words you had written about FlowBasedProgramming while at UWisc.  How have your ideas evolved since?  --PaulMorrison
