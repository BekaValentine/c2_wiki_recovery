	* PatternsForTeaching
		* Expositional patterns (patterns ''of'' teaching)
		* Read the project's book of relevant domain patterns before starting work on the project
		* Patterns as a means to understanding paradigms (e.g. the GangOfFour patterns)
	* PatternsForReference
		* Documentation on how to extend frameworks
		* Documentation for specific problems
			* Process problems
			* "Design" problems
			* Idioms
		* To provide analogies from other domains
		* To document code ("this code is the Z component of the Y pattern")
