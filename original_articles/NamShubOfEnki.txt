The original NamShubOfEnki, popularized by Stephenson's SnowCrash, was the word "I".

''That doesnt explain much to me. Is Enki referring to the Sumerian god who supposedly created the Tigris with his penis? And what is ''nam shub''?''

''Nam shub'' is NealStephenson's mangling of the Sumerian ''me'' (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_%28mythology%29 for details). Stephenson's SnowCrash defines ''nam shub'' as a ProgrammingLanguage for the human subconscious.

It's also related to the Leibnizian idea of a language of nature in which any distinction can be modelled purely as a number. Rather than look a word up in a dictionary, as you must with any human language, in the Leibnizian vision you'd know what the word meant just by parsing it lexically - as you understand any arithmetic number. Cf. LeibnizianDefinitionOfConsciousness.
