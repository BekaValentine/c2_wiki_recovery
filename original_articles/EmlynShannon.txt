Emlyn was indeed a good friend, and a soul probably not designed for our time. He will be sorely missed by those who took the time to understand this often misunderstood creature. - 

Take care buddy. I know that you're watching.

Nick.

In the (atypical) event that I sign a paragraph as -- EmlynShannon, this should be considered as shorthand for "-- OpenAuthor, EmlynShannon". Most of my contributions are unsigned, but I may write my name to distinguish between one voice and another in an ongoing discussion. If you are engaging me in discussion, bear in mind that I ''will'' refactor.
