The topic first brought to mind an English-teaching program I was recently asked to install.  The program used very few words in its main interface, relying on large colorful icons that often had no obvious meaning.  It didn't help that the question mark didn't do anything when clicked.  The program was a huge pain to install, and a few weeks later the user called me again to ask what was going wrong with it. 

Just griping about an experience in which an interface without words was excessively difficult to use, probably because it was poorly designed.
