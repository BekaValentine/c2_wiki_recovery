ChristopherAlexander describes ConstructiveProcesses in NatureOfOrder. These are processes where the design is constructed (typically at a drawing board) rather than emerging from a process. Alexander contrasts ConstructiveProcesses with GenerativeProcesses. Our current culture reflects a strong bias towards ConstructiveProcesses, especially in architecture (as in buildings) and SoftwareDevelopment.
