Dennis Gore recently returned to the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation team as "team leader" (as if anyone could hope to lead this band of non-conformists) They are an awesome team who deserve all the accolades that can be heaped upon them.  For two years I served the team as Envy specialist and Library manager.  (You might say I "Envyed" them for the whole time I was there and it would be true).  As RonJeffries would say '...I'm glad to be here'

Denny probably thought some of us would see this.  But we never come here.

Actually we do.
