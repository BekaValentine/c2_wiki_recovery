In early years of this new century there have been some people focussed on the convergence of Business and Technology. The two areas seem to be at odds with each other, Technology want innovation and business wants BusinessValue.

Yet the accountants need to coexist with technologists and vice versa. If done well, there can be great possibilities (e.g. SupplyChainManagement).
