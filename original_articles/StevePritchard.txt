Has almost 40 years experience in software programming. Specializes in migrating existing (legacy) application programs to alternate (newer) platforms. Began with doing IBM 1401 conversions to /360. Presently, has developed a technology that allows for the migration of COBOL programs onto a Java based platform. Refer to http://www.altcode.com for more details.

Hmmm... non-COBOL routines assumed to be in C... how do you test the migrated code and prove it's functionality is not damaged?

''We run the COBOL code in native format. Refer to http://www.altcode.com for more details''
