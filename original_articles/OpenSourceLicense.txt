I'm interested in releasing some of my work under an open source license. 
The problem is that I want a UK-based software license. All the license agreements
I've seen are written for the US legal system. Does anybody know of English law-based
licenses? I don't think agreements founded on US law are going to be of much use, but
on the other hand I don't want to be hung upside down and shaken by a lawyer ;-(
-- (who rather worries that giving it away might actually cost him a lot)

I am not a lawyer, but I am not aware that OpenSource licenses are particularly problematic for use in countries other than the US. (There isn't much case law applicable even in the US anyway.) The relevant laws, copyright laws, have a background of international agreements. For details you might want to contact UK-based or European associations promoting OpenSource :
