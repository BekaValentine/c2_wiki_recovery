Compare and contrast WikiWikiWeb with HumanBrain.

* Both contain huge databases of knowledge.
* Both have elaborate inter-linking between pieces of knowledge.
* Both have "streams of consciousness".  In Wiki, these take the form of RecentEdits, RecentChanges, and QuickChanges.

The "streams of consciousness" is an especially interesting similarity.  Here are some characteristics of "streams of consciousness":
* There are one or more streams at a given time.
* A stream traverses the interlinked database of knowledge by following existing links.
* Each stream keeps a history of where it has been recently.
* If new similarities are discovered between the "current page", and one in the recent history, then a new link may be formed.
* Knowledge may be modified as it is being traversed.
* External actions may be taken based on the knowledge as it is traversed.
* External experience may create new knowledge, which becomes the "current page" for a new stream.
* Multiple simultaneous streams may interact and cross-link, or may proceed completely independent of each other.

This is based on introspection of personal thought patterns, and observations of the aggregate behavior of Wiki.
