DynamoHttpServletResponse is a subclass of javax.servlet.HttpServletResponse.  It has been enhanced for a number of features, the best one IMNSHO being the ability to set parameters as well as get them, and be able to do servlet chaining through parameters (i.e. servlets can be parameters themselves). 

Some of the things you can do...

 Object o = pRequest.getObjectParameter("myObject");

 pRequest.setLocalRedirect("../index.jhtml");

 String[] hobbies = new String[] { "golf", "fishing", "hunting" };

 pRequest.setParameter("hobbies", myHobbies);

 // output is a servlet which prints HTML
 pRequest.serviceLocalParameter("output", pRequest, pResponse);
