Same as WikiMultipleVote, except the only permissible votes are single digit numbers (0-9).

Whether the "result" for each box should be a total or an average (which requires keeping the number of votes cast) should preferably be stated clearly beforehand by the organizers of the vote. If it is isn't stated clearly beforehand, WikiBallotBox emptiers are expected to extrapolate wildly.

TwoTouchVoting includes a spoof WikiWeightedVote for you to practice on.
