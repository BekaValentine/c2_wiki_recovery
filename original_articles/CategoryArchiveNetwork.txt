There are a number of programming languages or resources for which there have been developed one or more Archive Network for the distribution of modules.

It looks as though the first one was for TexLanguage, followed by PerlLanguage, PhpLanguage, CommonLisp, R (ArrLanguage) and ErlangLanguage.

They exist also for RubyLanguage and PythonLanguage but are not yet collected here.

There is a useful discussion on PythonVsPerl.
