OcUnit is a port of KentBeck's TestingFramework for ObjectiveCee in the MacOsx, Mac OS X Server, YellowBox/Cocoa and WebObjects environments.

It is available from http://www.sente.ch/software/ocunit .
See the article "Unit Testing for Objective-C using ProjectBuilder and OCUnit" on: http://www.stepwise.com/Articles/Technical/2002-06-17.01.html

For those of us who would like to use this on a NON Yellowbox environment, is there some way to build a subset 
of this for a command line based environment? Thanks... --RyanDavis

Which environment? What class library do you have? I've heard yesterday (March 26, 2000) that a port to GnuStep is in the work. --MarcoScheurer

ANY environment that can compile objective C should be able to run OcUnit.
Currently I am running it on FreeBSD w/ gcc. Tomorrow I may try it on DEC
UNIX with poc. --RyanDavis

See also ObjcUnit which is also for Objective C. It is distributed as a Mac OS X project but there isn't anything "magic" about the code that should make a port difficult. --PeterLindberg
