Three ways one can validate explanation and classification artifacts:
* Rather than becoming a parrot, mindlessly repeating mantras, established by others as substitutes for critical thinking, one should InspectStudyAndTest.
* Inspect
** Determine
*** if the name used is adequate, if not exact in its representation of the artifact
*** unique as well common attributes of the artifact
* Study
** relationships existing between it and other artifacts
* Test
** operational and procedural aspects of the artifact using specific and reasonable test methods
