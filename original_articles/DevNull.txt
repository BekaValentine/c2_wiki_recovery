'''What to do with a Full BitBucket'''

[The techniques in this article should be performed carefully, and only by a fully qualified and inexperienced system administrator. --JP] 

'''Q:''' Our SPARCstation 1+ 4.1 OW2 started running very slowly. When I logged out, I got the message "/dev/null full: empty bit bucket." 

'''A:''' The problem is that null is full. Your void space is no longer void; it's full up. 
The top ways to empty an overflowing bit bucket: 

1. Open the computer. Look for the bit bucket, find the red stopper at the bottom of it and open it over a large wastebasket.

2. [deprecated for the sake of environmental sustainability:] Take the ethernet terminator off. Type the command:
       % cat /dev/null > le0
This spits the bits into the ether.

3. When you write to /dev/null, the 0's (zeros) don't take up any space, but the 1's (ones) do. Try writing a file full of 0's to /dev/null. Use binary 0, not ASCII 0; ASCII 0 will start overfilling the partition.

4. This is a common problem only if you use the computer. If you stop using it, it won't have many problems at all. Kick the other users off, too.

5. Run lots of C programs. They have null-terminated strings that will use up the extra bits in /dev/null.

6. Consider upgrading to a byte bucket or even a word bucket.

7. Bring the computer to Mr. Goodwrench. He will drain the bit bucket, change the oil, and add windshield fluid, all in 29 minutes or less. Now that's a deal.

 The problem is that null is full.  Your void space is no longer void, it's
 full up.
 
 THE TOP TEN WAYS TO EMPTY AN OVERFLOWING BIT BUCKET:
 
 10) Open the computer up. Look for the bit bucket, find the RED stopper
     at the bottom of it and open it up OVER a LARGE trashcan.
 9) Stop using the computer for 6 months, let the bits compost and
    continue.
 8) Take the ethernet terminator off, and "cat /dev/null > le0".  This
    spits the bits into the ether.
 7) When you write to /dev/null, the 0's don't take up any space, but
    the one's do.  Try writing a file full of 0's to /dev/null
    (binary 0, NOT ASCII 0 - ASCII 0 will start overfilling the partition).
 6) This is a common problem _only_ if you use the computer.  If you stop
    using it, it won't have many problems as all.  Kick the other users off
    too.
 5) If you use lots of C programs, they have Null terminated strings that
    use up the bits in /dev/null.
 4) Bring the computer to Mr. Goodwrench, he will drain the bit bucket,
    change the oil and add windshield fluid, all in less than 29 minutes.
    Now that's a deal.
 3) Consider upgrading to a byte bucket or even a word bucket.
 2) Since your already using Open Windows, open a window and toss the 
    useless bits out the open window.
 1) Stop using the game "fortune" in your .logout script, Mr "Hacker".


 good luck
