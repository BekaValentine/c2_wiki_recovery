Hi folks:
I work in the wireless broadband seamless mobility division (WiBB) at Motorola Inc.

I develop client and infrastructure emulation and modeling software tools in C++ for call processing and supplementary service handling using standardized VoIP protocols (SIP, RTP, etc). The software projects I work on are huge, and I use a lot of design patterns as well as OO frameworks (ACE, Boost, etc.) and a lot of external software libraries to keep my code scalable as well as portable across platforms. Certain parts of the code are procedural (make it work sort of) and I am cleaning up those parts by making use of standard and well-defined design patterns to break down some complexity in the code and make it scalable to future additions/modifications.

My main interests are in the reuse of knowledge and capturing of design knowledge for reuse.
