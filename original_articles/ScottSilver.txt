The goal of this project is to take control of the A4 Audi Navigation System screen of a 2001 A4 Avant. (aka Hacking the Audi Navigation System)

Two Navigation Systems for Audis:

	* http://forums.audiworld.com/a4/msgs/107294.phtml
	* The little one is called Navigation System
	* The big one is called Navigation System Plus

More Info on Audio Navigation System:

	* This PDF seems to refer to something called MCNet and has picture of the TravelPilot: http://www.datamicro.ru/can/standards/pdf/CANappl.pdf
	* Based on Blaupunkt TravelPilot
	* Perhaps it uses the MCNet OSEK protocol
		* it was verified by: http://spinroot.com/spin/Workshops/ws97/ruys.pdf
	* MCNet seems to have been part of OSEK (a time triggered RTOS, perhaps used in this system?)
	* validation paper above seems to indicate that this system is CAN 2.0a
	* Hmm, is this the communication protocol -- from OSEK: http://www.osek-vdx.org/mirror/OSEK%20COM%20V3_0.pdf

The Audi bus is CAN-bus.
