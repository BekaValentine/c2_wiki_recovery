Some definition is required in order for one to understand queries:

Queries are made of various sources of information in an attempt to extract filtered information required to complete some task or fulfill some need:

Most often a query is made in recognition that needed information is organized and reachable, and that processes have been designed in such a manner as to respond to inquiries made in certain pre-designed ways. 

Databases often are queried through the use of Q''''''ueryLanguages such as SQL. A query not only can specify the nature of the information desired, but also the form and destination of the results. 

The data in a database is organized (normalized) in such a manner as to allow for fairly direct and easily formed queries.

Possible definitions:

* A non-TuringComplete expression that returns data.
** Why do you believe queries can't be TuringComplete?  And do not Prolog and related queries constitute a sufficient counter-example?

A query is just an inquiry for information (says dictionary). An SQL query or TutorialD query is just that.. inquiring for information on a database.
