If you type a WikiWord, it becomes a clickable link. If the link has a single trailing question mark "?", the link is to a page that doesn't yet exist.

To create a page, click a ? link. If a link is your name (mine is RalphMellor), the corresponding new page will be your own WikiHomePage. To try this out, visit the WikiWikiSandbox, type your name in WikiWord form, and save and redisplay the sandbox page.
