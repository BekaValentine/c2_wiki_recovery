Why is it that all GraphicalUserInterface''''''s seem to be based on idea that software should resemble paper?

Pro:

	* It gives you a lower LearningCurve, at least at first.

Con:

	* Functionality that is not part of paper injures the metaphor severely, and it usually shows.

TedNelson often rails against the WorldWideWeb just being a bad simulation of paper, when he feels his XanaduProject had much more to offer.
