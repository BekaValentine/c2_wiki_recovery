Unfortunately the OntoWorld site is working only intermittently at the moment. I have reported it to the maintainer who says the problem is with the DNS and the site is there. Contact went down recently when I was actually using it. I will amend this entry when it becomes reliable again as I am committed to using it. -- JohnFletcher 25th February 2008

''I am back onto OntoWorld today. I have not heard whether the problem has been completely fixed.'' -- JohnFletcher 26th February 2008

Since the entry I have not had problems linking to OntoWorld. -- JohnFletcher 5th April 2008
