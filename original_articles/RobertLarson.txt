Way back when, I used to work at HP in a group that was really keen on Distributed Object Computing. We did some cool stuff (Distributed Smalltalk) but were kind of ahead of the curve.

I got frustrated, left and joined two HP colleagues JeffEastman and IanFuller at Windward Solutions. We were a Smalltalk Software and consulting company that specialized in distributed (CORBA based) computing. At Windward, we did the initial development of SmalltalkBroker and the Gemstone GemORB. As a consultant, I used to spend a lot of time with Sprint in Kansas City, which is where I met Ward.

At Sprint, we were trying to encourage the adoption of a wiki-wiki based system as a way to describe the artifacts of the system we are building there. I really don't know if it ever took hold however. I got run out of town. And I'm such a nice guy, go figure.

That was all so many years ago now...
