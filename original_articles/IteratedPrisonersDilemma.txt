I looked up MeatBall on this. Sounded deep to me. Will someone explain how larger communities can turn to the positive and not '''DescendIntoMadness''' as predicted in PrisonersDilemma  -- dl

You need to start small communities of cooperating people.
These groups attract individuals and become larger even
within the non-cooperating group. The problem
is you may not agree with the agenda of the cooperating 
group.
