It's possible that CategoryHardware would be better placed here, unless its creator also intended to provide a category broad enough to discuss peripheral and communications hardware, too.

For discussion of computer ''software'' architecture "and the many squabbles involved" (so wrote the category's creator), see the broadly named CategoryArchitecture. Its creator might wish to ponder whether CategorySoftwareArchitecture would be a less ambiguous and more appropriate name.
