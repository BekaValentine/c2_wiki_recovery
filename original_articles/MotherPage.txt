A MotherPage is a page located one link away from another page on the way to the FrontPage. It is exactly one link nearer to the FrontPage in terms of number of links needed to get there.

Therefore, a MotherPage lies one level higher than its daughter page.

A MotherPage can have more than one daughter page and vice versa.
