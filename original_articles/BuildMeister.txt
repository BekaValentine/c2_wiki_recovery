From somewhere on the net: "the person ultimately 'in charge of' getting things building and built.
Someone who maintains the spec files, and makes sure everything keeps
building."

Shops with something to build, but without DailyBuild''''''s, need a BM to operate a build environment. This creates a system bottleneck.

Shops afflicted with an IDE-first toy like VisualBasic, if they did not grow their project at the same time as they grew console build scripts, may need to pay their BM, every few hours, to clickety-click click all over the VB IDE to produce their SporadicIntegration.

Shops without tests may appoint the BM role to perform CodeReview''''''s, to delay integration of bugs.

The correct pattern grows a CommonBuildEnvironment on every desktop, so that everyone can test & build anything or everything at whim, and so anyone can upgrade the build scripts.
