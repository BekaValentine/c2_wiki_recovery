CustomerInformationControlSystem (CICS) is the IBM TransactionProcessing system underpinning many of the world's major businesses. The latest release supports EnterpriseJavaBeans as described in an IBM Systems Journal article at http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/401/bainbridge.html.
See also http://www.ibm.com/software/ts/cics/v2/ for information about the CustomerInformationControlSystem Transaction Service v2 product.

This has been a long time coming.  I wonder what impact it will have on the non-CustomerInformationControlSystem community?  It would be nice to get some legendary CustomerInformationControlSystem performance/reliability into the existing EJB world, which seems to be plagued by naivety.  --StuCharlton

The design point for CustomerInformationControlSystem EJB was to run enterprise beans with the CiCs quality of service.  So we made a point of properly integrating the various java services with the CustomerInformationControlSystem runtime. For example, our Transaction Service is a thin layer of java that supports the necessary external interfaces and interoperates with other Transaction Services via OTS protocols but which is then implemented on top of the CustomerInformationControlSystem recovery manager (the 2PC engine) so we get the usual benefits such as log optimisations and shunting. Another important feature is the use of the PersistentReusableJvm (see e.g. http://www.ibmlink.ibm.com/usalets&parms=H_200-143) that executes java applications independently of each other but which can be serially reused for good performance.

* http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=5093 mentioned that Entity bean support was disabled. Is it still true in 2004?

''Entity bean support in CICS TS is not merely disabled, it is non-existent, still, as of January 2006. Session beans are there, but not entity beans.''
