A FastStringBuffer can be implemented using lazy-evaluated streams.

How LazyEvaluation helps:

Make your string be like a linked list, except the "next" field does not contain a pointer, but some unevaluated code, or a function. You run that code or call that function to retrieve the rest of the list. This way, complex manipulations on strings are possible, ''a la'' HaskellLanguage.

Or you could just duplicate the functionality of the built-in StringBuffer class but without the pointless synchronisation of methods.
