CodeBlocks (http://www.codeblocks.org/) is an IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment which includes ways of maintaining projects which compile on a range of different compilers. It is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. The windows version works easily with MinimalistGnuForWindows (MinGW) and GnuCpp.

This can be integrated with TwilightDragon to provide versions of GnuCpp on windows.
