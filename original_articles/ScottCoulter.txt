I have been developing software (OO whenever possible) for the past 8.5 years at NCR, first in the delightful Human Interface Technology Center, and more recently in the Retail Systems Group.

I became quite fascinated with ExtremeProgramming last year after reading KentBeck's book. This summer, I had the excellent fortune to be "reduced in force" at NCR and have landed at Retek (thanks to former NCR colleague WesHunter) in a software development group which is preparing to go "Extreme".

I am deeply grateful to all the XP pioneers for making programming fun again.

Just stumbled across this page while googling myself (come on, you know you do it too).
Thought I should update with the fact that Retek has been bought out by Oracle.
I'm still hacking away here, working with smart and hard-working folks.
We're no longer officially doing ExtremeProgramming, but have, at least,
kept some of the good habits, particularly CodeUnitTestFirst.
