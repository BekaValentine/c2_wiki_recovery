KyleBrown and BruceWhitenack: CrossingChasms

ScottAmbler: Mapping Objects to Relational Databases http://www.ambysoft.com/mappingObjects.pdf. This paper is a little old and rusty and suffer from obvious flaws. A more elaborate essay you can download from http://www.theserverside.com, see the book in progress there, complex persistence chapter.
