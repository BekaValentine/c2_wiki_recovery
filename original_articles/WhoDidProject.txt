The WhoDidProject is the project that we're working on at XpNewYorkCity. Our in-a-nutshell description is that it's "The IMDB of web sites". Users eventually should be able to enter a website URL, find out who worked on it at what time intervals and doing what kind of work. Then you could click on someone's name and find out what other sites that person worked on.

Since starting in April 2001, XpNewYorkCity has implemented the core functionality: An internal set of Java objects -- Credit, Person, Website -- that represent the problem domain. As of this writing (Sep 2001) we're just now implementing persistence and a basic web interface into the system, working up to an alpha release.
