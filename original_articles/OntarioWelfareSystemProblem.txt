From the Toronto Star:

(2004-07-07)
$20M to fix welfare pay delay
 
It could cost another $20 million to fix the Queen's Park computer problem that means more than 670,000 people on welfare and disability assistance will have to wait weeks for a 3 per cent increase because the government's $500 million computer system cannot calculate the increase. 

(2004-07-06)
670,000 welfare, disability recipients can't get 3% hike
Might take until next March before computer system fixed


Does anyone know the background behind this problem?  The system was developed by Arthur Andersen, now Accenture.   Another quote was that "the system is so convoluted, it's almost impossible to make changes"

''Popular opinion would connect the fact of ''developed by Arthur Andersen Consulting/Accenture'' and ''""the system is so convoluted, it's almost impossible to make changes"'', since AA has a bad reputation of sending underqualified contractors and trying to extend contract times even if the project doesn't need more work''

I am wondering what technology they used - anyone out there know?
