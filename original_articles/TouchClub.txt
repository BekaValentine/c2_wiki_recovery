This club is comprised of persons who regularly use touch as the primary method for communication with others. This is because members don't want to confine listening and expression to just the voice, ears and eyes. It is not limited to just human interaction as it commonly includes dogs, cats and horses. TouchClub was first suggested in OufshaHome.

Be natural (don't pretend to be something that you are not). -- BrentBingham

How can touch be a primary mode of communication when it is so imprecise?  How does one express a future tense via touch?

''It isn't the primary mode, but regularly used as such in a bodywork session. Imprecise is an assumption. TouchClub is a group that explores how to make touch more precise than normally thought. The body and mind are not separate.''

''Visiting a place on the body reveals much about the body-mind past and present. Future tense is expressed via intent and "heard" when one has visited a place long enough.'' -- BrentBingham

I'm still unclear about how touch alone can be precise enough for detailed communication - how does one express something like "Tomorrow I will drive downtown and buy groceries" ??

At the very simplest analogue to verbal communication, you can spell into someone's hand, HelenKeller-style.  That's a proof-of-concept, but this would be like the way hearing people can use ASL letter or word signs to create an English sentence.  It's really confined to the limitations of written or spoken communication, and adding the limitations of tactile or visual perception, without embracing the advantages of same.  AmericanSignLanguage uses facial expressions and spatial relationships in ways that written languages can't, and that spoken languages often don't.  However, a tactile language sounds a little implausible for communication between strangers, at least in the cultures I've been in contact with.  --NickBensema

I'd say TouchClub is a non-verbal language for human interaction. A single touch can easily transfer more information(of a certain type) than an hour long conversation. Touch is ill-suited for transferring logic/scientific information. That's not a problem anymore than that using a RegularExpression is an ill-suited application for transferring musical information. Touch is unparalleled for transferring emotion or imperative information. Skeptical of how much information touch can transfer? Remember that's what sex is, and if having sex with someone doesn't tell you a great deal, then maybe you should RefactorYourTouch. Touch is much more honest than speech. It's not hard to lie, but it's hard for someone with bad intentions to touch someone and have it feel the same as a touch from someone who cares about them.
