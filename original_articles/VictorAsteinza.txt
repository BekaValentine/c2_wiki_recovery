I just came back from my first PLUG (well actually from the LuckyLab) meeting where WardCunningham gave a great presentation on WikiWiki. So I came here to check it out and add a page like he suggested.

I have recently moved here from NewYorkCity, two months ago to be precise, and I love it here. My girl friend and I just needed a change of scenery and I think we have made a good choice. 

Its a little late. I'll add more here later.
