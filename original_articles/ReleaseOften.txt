Release means sharing your work with everyone else.  

See ContinuousIntegration

Contrast IntegrateOften.  

See also SingleReleasePoint.

''The longer you wait between integrations/releases, the more integration you have to do, especially with CollectiveCodeOwnership (another rule).  So don't wait.''

The thing though about Free software projects is that sometimes they ''don't'' release often. I get irritated when I see ''version 0.0.7pre48. Last Updated 12 May 1997'' because the programmers want 0.0.8 to have every feature any piece of software could possibly have. -- GavinVanLelyveld
