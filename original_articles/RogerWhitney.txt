

I teach computer science at San Diego State University (SDSU). I teach object-oriented design, design patterns and client-server programming. I spent the 1999-2000 academic year on sabbatical leave at University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana (UIUC) as part of Ralph Johnson's Software Architecture Group (http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/SAG). I attended the first Camp Smalltalk (http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/CampSmalltalk). I am currently on sabbatical from SDSU visiting UIUC.

One can only teach what one knows. One learns from doing. So to teach programming one has to program. Now if I can only convince my employer to reward faculty that produce code.

My web site http://www.eli.sdsu.edu/ contains all my lecture notes for my courses for the last 10 years.
