Just an ordinary average guy.

I've been hacking in one way or another since the mid/late '70s.
Over the years I've dabbled with many different types of system, and (literally) dozens of languages.
I'm fairly fluent in CeeLanguage, CeePlusPlus and a few others. I also rather like the elegance of LispLanguage, although I've yet to use it to to develop a production system.
