* SearchOnSave capability - Takes group of one to three consecutive words on a page when it is saved, make them into a wiki name if that name exists. Presented for author to accept / reject. Example: occurrences of 'wiki name' in this paragraph would become WikiName. -- MichaelFeathers
** Cool idea. -- WardCunningham
* ''... more difficult, but related: search for 3 word sequences that are used "frequently" on many different pages, but don't yet have a page with that title yet ... -- DavidCary''
* For what it's worth, '''grep -i "wiki  *name[s]* "''' gets 34 hits on 29 pages. I could run more searches to see if this idea has merit. I note that people when editing by hand tend to use '''UnitTest''' once and then '''unit test''' for the remainder of the page. It might get annoying if ''every'' possible link were made. Also, what about '''wiki name space''' - do we link '''WikiName''' or '''NameSpace'''? I know, you suggested it be offered to the author, but it could be a burden. Oh, and I agree that it's a cool idea - it's what I do on my personal wiki.
* Convert Wiki db into StructuredQueryLanguage(SQL)
* there should be button that when you press it it finds all the page or pages that do not link directly/indirectly to the FrontPage 
* Scatter / Gather for Wiki Pages. I.e. Edit Window can show a gather of say 5 pages concatenated together in a single edit window, with a delimiter say xxxxxxxx between pages. Save then scatters the updated pages back. Would make the editing in refactoring easier, with fewer editor windows open (WikiScatterGatherDiscussion). -- JeanJordaan 
* Find that works like grep. (WikiGrepDiscussion could assist refactoring).
* WikiNameModifiers e.g. Wiki''''''Name.Last''''''Edit gives latest edit date, Wiki''''''Name.Creation''''''Date, Wiki''''''Name.Edit''''''Count, Wiki''''''Name.Page''''''Size, Wiki''''''Name.Hit''''''Count
* Edit Count, show it on page 'MinorEdit' -- PhilGoodwin
* WikiPreDoubleBlankFix, a fix that avoids double blank lines for each blank line in a <PRE> block, e.g. for code listings. -- DaveSmith
* Should I SpellCheckTheDiff ''i.e. just the new part of a page''? -- WardCunningham No, it's a nag to the most recent editor to fix problems others have left behind
* Shows larger edits (page size more than doubled or halved or more than 20 lines changed) in RecentChanges and QuickChanges.
* Case Sensitive Option on FindPage. (Find FpVsOo and GodVsStalin, but not CyclicCvs). -- HelmutLeitner
* Option to exclude pages containing ''xxx'' from a ''fullSearch''.
* Automatic message when "This page crossed the 30K limit and needs refactoring." (TooBigToEdit) -- HelmutLeitner
* Fix mildly broken HTML emitted for preformatted text - Wiki produces stuff like <p><pre>blah<p>blah</pre>, which is incorrectly nested: <p> is a ''container'', not a ''separator''. More Piki Wiki Html.. for KonquerorBrowser: list items currently begin with a space. They shouldn't.
* As a RecentChangesJunkie, I would like a complement to the WikiStatistics that tells me which entries have been accessed most often in the last week or month. This probably requires a weekly / monthly batch script that processes the web server access log file and dumps the results to a file (StatisticsForWeekThree, just like ChangesInWeekThree), as on-demand processing (current WikiStatistics style) would be too slow. The benefit with such statistics is that we could learn which types of pages, categories, and searches succeed to attract readers. This might stop the current guessing about their usefulness. -- LarsAronsson (19 May 2001)
* Author's original intent could be preserved if we ValidateChangesByVoting -- MichaelRoss (8/13/01)
* For those uncertain about their UserName (i.e. browser cookie contents), how about showing it on the edit page, perhaps with a link to the page to use to set it. -- DaveParker
* Or as above, but make the username (blank if unknown) editable on the edit page, which would work even if cookies are disabled.
* Add a text field to EditPage and EditCopy where poster can summarize their change. This would support the failed ChangeSummary functionality on the RecentChanges page. Some other wikis have successfully implemented this kind of functionality.
* Automate the RecentChanges to ChangesIn<Month> and RecentEdits to EditsIn<Month> maintenance. ''< I suppose I should stop complaining and start implementing. -- JeffGrigg  ;->''
* On a page's QuickDiff, highlight the exact text changed within modified paragraphs. WikiPedia does this using a red font color.  ''Requested again in UnethicalEditing.''
* VolumeLimitedEdits
* WikiRedirect
* Have the CGI scripts cope with clicks on pages like '''h''''''ttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki''' (note no page name).  The HTTP server can handle the URL, which to me implies a promise that links will work.  Just declaring that the CGI scripts need not cope with the links ignores the fact that the promise has already been made before the scripts run.  -- DerekPeschel
