Jon, I can't contribute to PythonVsRuby because of lack of experience. So I prefer to put this little note regarding "... Python *does* have GC
(rather than reference counting)..." here:  AFAIK there are different types of GC (basically three) and reference counting is one of them. -- HelmutLeitner
