In order to promote CriticalSpirit, CriticsShouldBeInformed. A critic who is ignorant is not a real critic, he's just in the all too common business of TitillatingEgo. 

As opposed to CriticizeFromIgnorance.

And articulate... If you are going to be blunt and pushy, you better be able to make clear concise counter-points. Don't shoot at armies for being dirty unless your own guns are shiny.

''Both sides should be "good and concise and informed and polite", etc. Unfortunately, we don't always get ideal participants. In fact, I'd suggest that nearly all contributors have at least one weak area. Traits include but are not limited to:''

* Informed about topic at hand
* Articulate
* Concise
* Logical
* Good reader (can extract intended meaning from difficult writing)
* Polite, or at least diplomatic

''I'm sure people will rank each of these traits very different, based on past attempts at finding common behavioral rules.''

* This is right on!!!  The goal of all should be in finding the truth, or what is best, but not simply trying to win a discussion by any means (such as shouting the loudest, being the rudest, making the other not want to communicate, etc.).
