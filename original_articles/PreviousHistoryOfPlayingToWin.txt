Extreme Programming: Playing to Win

To be published later this year by Addison-Wesley.

A practically oriented presentation of the XP practices for project planning and testing.

How's this coming?

A lesson we learned is that Wiki is a great tool for collaborating on a book when you're all in the same room, but we weren't able to make it work for collaborating remotely. We are currently looking at how to make progress, both technologically and by further focusing the book on planning. Turns out we didn't know as much about testing as we thought. --KentBeck

'''[KB:]''' Anyway, the second book is called Playing to Win, and we quickly
realized we had to cut down its scope---we couldn't talk about all the
practice of XP. So we thought up the worst situation we could be in
before adopting XP: The project is already late, morale is dropping,
management and the customers are getting nervous. Then we asked what
XP book we'd write for someone in that situation.

Well, the two things you've got to do to get things under control are
planning and testing.  You've got to be able to measure where you are
today---that's the testing part. And you've got to be able to present
alternatives for tomorrow, so the business can start steering
projects---and that's the Planning Game stuff. So the second book is
going to cover those two topics in depth.

How's it coming? (Jan 24, 2000)

KenAuer has taken the lead on this. Various subgroups are off working on other projects in between supporting Ken. KentBeck and MartinFowler are writing a ProjectPlanning book "SteeringAndPlanningExtremeProgramming". RonJeffries is writing an installation guide for XP "ExtremeProgrammingInstalled".

(May 1, 2000)
The book has evolved to become advice to those who want to start on the XP adventure from those who are already on it.  In addition to the meat of the project contributed by KenAuer and WardCunningham, along with contributions from the other three named authors, there are snippets of advice/experiences from others who have been there and done that.
