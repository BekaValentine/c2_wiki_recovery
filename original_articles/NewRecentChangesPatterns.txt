Number-patterns in NewRecentChanges, that indicate different kinds of activity:

WikiSpam:
* "..., ''x'', ''-x'', ..." indicates a reversion to the EditCopy (e.g. if x spam was added).
* "..., ''x'', ''-x'', 0, ..." indicates a reversion to the EditCopy followed by a touch to remove the material from the quickDiff.
* a list consisting only of "1" sometimes indicates a completed deletion. (???)
* several pages with the same (large) positive delta => spam.

WikiVandal:
* "..., ''-x'', ''x'', ..." indicates a reversion to the EditCopy (e.g. if the page was deleted).

WikiGnome at work:
* several pages with deltas that are multiples of 6 may indicate someone adding SixSingleQuotes to convert WikiWord''''''s to singular form (in these cases QuickDiff seems to show nothing).
* several pages with the same small deltas (15<d<30) may indicate someone adding a category or other WikiBadge to matching pages.
* a (reverse) alphabetical sequence of pages edited in quick succession having small or zero diffs: a gnome searched for a misspelling or BrokenLink and methodically corrected it on all the found pages.

EditWar:
* sequences of +x, -x, +x, -x
* repeated occurrences of del and new
