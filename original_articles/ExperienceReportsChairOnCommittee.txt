(''OopslaProgramCommitteeMembershipPatterns'')

Most plenary sessions present ideas new to the whole
industry.  These ideas must be experientially or
theoretically verified, but need not pass the test
of broad applicability.

Ideas mature over the years through practice, and the
first large-scale application of an idea is as significant
as the first presentation of the idea itself.
Practitioners often have trouble distinguishing the
value and phenomena of new ideas from those of first
adoption, or they misunderstand the intent of plenary
sessions.  This means the program committee often receives
experience reports that are outside the intent of the
program committee.  The program committee could send these
to the ExperienceReportsCommittee, but that puts the
ExperienceReportsChair at a time disadvantage relative to
the program schedule.

'''Therefore''', invite the ExperienceReportsChair to
sit on the ProgramCommittee.
This allows free flow between these two committees,
exchanging papers that authors have sent to the
inappropriate forum.
You might consider doing the same for the PosterChair
and DemosChair.
