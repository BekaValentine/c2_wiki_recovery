Anyone interested in the CapabilityMaturityModel should take a look at the 'new' CMMI (Capability Maturity Model - Integration). The SW-CMM is being "sunsetted" by the SoftwareEngineeringInstitute and superseded by the CMMI. 

The CMMI is the Software CapabilityMaturityModel extended in several ways:
	* to include SE-CMM (systems, not just software); 
	* to include SA-CMM (acquisition and use of COTS products); 
	* to fold in the IPD-CMM (Integrated Product Development)
	* to reduce the effects of the 'frameworks quagmire' (see http://www.software.org/quagmire)
	* other structural changes, such as an overall Measurement and Analysis process area. Agilists in particular may want to check out some of the new PA's (no longer called KPA's) such as Integrated Teaming. 

The CMMI also offers two "representations":
	* "staged": maturity levels 1-5 similar to the SW-CMM
	* "continuous": capability levels which better support independent evaluation of individual process areas

Any software engineer and wiki lurker believes in CMMi? Anybody have positive experiences to report about a CMMi based "process improvement" initiative?
