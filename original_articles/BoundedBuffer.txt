BoundedBuffer is not a standard Java class, but there is a class of that name in DougLea's influential book ConcurrentProgrammingInJava (CPJ), and there are many copies of that class around.

It is basically a threadsafe queue implemented on top of an array.

More generally, it is a FIFO queue with a fixed capacity.  It therefore can be empty, full or some state in between.  When shared by 2 or more threads, it must be threadsafe.

See also FlowBasedProgramming (FBP), where BoundedBuffer''''''s are used for communication between FBP asynchronous components (processes).
