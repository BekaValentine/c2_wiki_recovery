A feature in http://rubyforge.org/projects/minirubywiki/

Some Wikis have only primitive markup, like ' ' for italics.

Some have too much markup.

MRW passes this question thru to its users:

http://flea.sourceforge.net/mrwStyle.png

Edit that page to add any kind of tag your situation needs. New style tags "engage" in clear text, not inside the < > HTML markers. Tags may replace text, and may bracket either or both ends of a text extent, which may contain < > HTML tags.

Note that clever WikiZen''''''s use the page to test each of its own tags.

Another sick ability - turning processed text >'''back'''< into simple HTML tags:

[/&lt;br&gt;/, '<br>']

-- PhlIp

Every line in the WikiStyleSheet (see example above) which begins with ==> [ is a search-replace pair. The Wiki will execute the expression on each line (in order), and pass the result thru to HTML unprocessed.
