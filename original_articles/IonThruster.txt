A XIPS (''xenon ion propulsion system'') IonThruster is a highly-efficient (but low-thrust) rocket. It is basically a cross between a TravellingWaveTube and a xenon light bulb. Used primarily for positioning orbiting spacecraft. IonThruster''''''s of all types (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster#Types_of_ion_thruster) will become increasingly necessary when humans EscapeToSpace, likely WithinTwentyYears from October 2055, OctoberZeroFiveFive
