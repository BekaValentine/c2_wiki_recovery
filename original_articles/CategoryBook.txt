'''I often find WikiPage''''''s on books to have very little information aside from ISBN, and have repeatedly suppressed my urge to delete these useless entries.'''

''Example of a useful book listing: See link at GenerationsAtWork. Book listings should have material stimulating to a casual reader as well.''

Here are some pages which contain CategoryBook, but do not have an ISBN. WikiGnome''''''s are hereby notified

	*	HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy: ''Wasn't sure, if the other ''''''ISBNs'''''' of the trilogy should have been listed as well. So I kept it in this list.''
	*	ThinkingInPatterns: ''Not published as of December 2004.''
