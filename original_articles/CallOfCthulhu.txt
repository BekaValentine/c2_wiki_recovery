One of the best RolePlayingGame''''''s of all time, CallOfCthulhu, was based on the writings of HpLovecraft. Its rule system did as much as any to embody the gameworld's ideology. You had a Cthulhu Mythos knowledge skill, ranging from 0% to 100%, and your maximum Sanity was 100-Cthulhu Mythos. So as you learned more, you became more deranged, and a character with full understanding of the Mythos had exactly a 0% chance of being sane.

(Non-RPG-players and non-anime-fans, you may skip this paragraph.)  So there's this doujinshi RPG, based on dating sims.  It incorporates the Call of Cthulhu insanity rules.  Yes - high-school romance can drive you literally insane.  (You may now cackle evilly.)

WizardsOfTheCoast have recently re-released CallOfCthulhu. WOTC is famous for MagicTheGathering and bought out DungeonsAndDragons. Also, there's a long history of id Software cherrypicking talent from WOTC. Paul Jaquays also went to id from RolePlayingGame''''''s.

That is to say that WOTC have published the D20 version of Call Of Cthulhu - Chaosium is still the license holder.
