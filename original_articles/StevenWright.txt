	Steven Wright Biography:	I was born. When I was 23 I started telling jokes. Then I started going on television and doing films. That's still what I am doing. The end.
----
Delivers with a deadpan, lots of short one liners, like:
	* I was once walking through the forest alone and a tree fell right in front of me and I didn't hear it.
	* For my birthday I got a humidifier and a de-humidifier...I put them in the same room and let them fight it out...
	* I went to a general store.  They wouldn't let me buy anything specifically
	* I put instant coffee in my microwave oven and almost went back in time.
	* I went to a restaurant that serves "breakfast at any time."  So I ordered French Toast during the Renaissance.
	* Why is the alphabet in that order? Is it because of that song?
	* It's a small world - but I wouldn't want to paint it.
	* You can't have everything...Where would you put it?
	* I like to fill my tub up with water, then turn the shower on and act like I'm in a submarine that's been hit ...
	* When I die, I'm leaving my body to science fiction.
	* One time I went to a museum where all the work in the museum had been done by children.  They had all the paintings up on refrigerators.
	* There's a fine line between fishing and standing on the shore looking like an idiot.
	* OK, so what's the speed of dark?
	* What does "definition" mean?
