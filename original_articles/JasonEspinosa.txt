As Of 2010:

In college, getting a math degree. will be done with that by the end of 2010. 

Experience in: 
Java
Javascript/CSS/HTML 
C89 (vendor lock-in fun!) 


Languages I'm considering: 
Haskell
Common Lisp (Any version that's really consistent and easy to set up across OSes would be nice)
Python

Number of Linux Laptops that have died on me so far: 
2

Languages I've written trivial code in:

I've been getting more into programming as a hobby, lately. There was a 2 year break from the time I learned Java in high school to when I taught myself C and Fortran where I did no coding at all. I have to make up for lost time.
