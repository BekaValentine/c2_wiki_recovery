We aren't limited by the physical limits of our head or brain, but by the limits of our consciousness. These limits are not intrinsic, but made by ourselves. All knowledge in the universe is accessible by everyone - in principle.

If you are a ''really'' conscious person and it is a ''necessity'' for you to know this, then you will know it. (This is not rational. Consciousness can achieve more than rationality.)

''You will also know it if you are a '''really''' self-deluded person. Now a better question is, how can you know whether you are '''really''' conscious, or '''really''' self-deluded?''

If you don't know about the solution, this doesn't necessarily mean the solution doesn't exist. Discussion cannot resolve it, but can help.

Off-topic? Also for software development consciousness is more important than mere rationality.
