TTTO Subterranean Homesick Blues by BobDylan

 my topic's in the basement
 hiding from delete men
 I'm on the pavement
 thinkin' what the rave meant
 the man in the trench coat
 opens his kimono
 we're all in the same boat
 and the same feather boa
 look out kid
 it's something you writ
 Lawd knows when
 you gotta writ it up agin
 think about what to say
 no one reads it any way
 thread a flame to de-bunk
 talk trash run junk
 seven years OnTopic and they
 move you to TheAdjunct

 oh get warm surf porn
 roam ants break dance
 wrist bands free Lance
 Cyrus Vance
 take a chance
 fear another's freedom
 wastes a little of our own
 cell-phone
 sell your soul
 pay the toll
 restore his dole
 and mind my own
 look out kid
 keep the top-ick hid
 comprehend
 contraband
 comparahend
 anything worth doing
 must be worth doing a-gain
 everything's programming
 from the BigBang to Bag End

 oh software's phat or lean
 slows mean grows clean
 migrating to a new scene
 re-train re-frain
 re-tread re-thread
 levee break
 water's gate
 inc-omnivorous rates
 success tempts fates
 WikiZen brothers
 save our sons
 and our daughters
 re-verse re-curse
 per-verse Free Source
 don't want to be a squatter
 you cyber-spotter
 your same sane twain train
 will not elude my re-enplotter

--Rob Dylan
