I am a Senior Software Developer in FairIsaac & Co.'s Corporate R&D department.  Since we focus on creating reusable software components, patterns present both 

	* an elegant "verbal shorthand" for discussions of component interaction and design, and
	* a natural delineation of component boundaries.

I was introduced to the patterns movement in the fall of 1995, where I took a course at CalBerkeley taught by ChristineBouamalay.  Christine is an amazing and energetic teacher, and instilled in me a great excitement about the patterns movement at large.

It seems clear to me that software development will not be truly pattern-based until we have pattern-aware development environments.  I am currently reviewing an IDE called CodeNavigator.  If you are interested, try http://www.quintessoft.com for more information.

I am impressed by the effort put into this site by WardCunningham and all of the people who have left their mark.  Here's to an excellent community!
