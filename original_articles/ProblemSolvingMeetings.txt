ProblemSolvingMeetings...
	* are only scheduled on an as needed basis -- ad hoc.  Never regularly scheduled.
	* Only those contributing to the solution of the problem are invited -- uninvite interested onlookers.  Problem solving is not a spectator sport.
	* Facilitator must have no skin in the game.  Technical expertise is not always required to effectively facilitate.
