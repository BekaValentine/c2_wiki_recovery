Although this is OffTopic there are lessons to be learned from ContactJuggling. Like ordinary juggling the system is only stable when in motion - you can't do ContactJuggling in slow motion. This is an excellent metaphor for some aspects of computing, and even more aspects of life. Let's leave this page a little and see if any connections can be made.

edit: ContactJuggling CAN be done in slow motion. In fact, a very large part of modern ContactJuggling is based on a form called Isolations, where the ball is kept as near to still as possible, while the body moves under it. The metaphor for computing, in this case, may be that in order to leave one aspect of a system as it is, without changing it at all (the ball), while completely re-writing the rest of the system (moving the body in various ways), it is very important to be in perfect control of all aspects of the system, and to understand how they integrate. kverens@contactjuggling.org
