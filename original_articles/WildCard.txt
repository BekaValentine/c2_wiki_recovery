WildCard was what would become HyperCard.

Interesting little historical bit here.

Ward claims he saw HyperCard/WildCard after KentBeck showed it to him; Beck was working at Apple with AlanKay on Playground, part of the VivariumProject. Playground was an ecological sims environment aimed at allowing kids to design the interactions between fish (er, "agents") and things like that. Atkinson's WildCard had been developed at around the same time, and was also being used in the Vivarium project. Apparently, there wasn't any direct Smalltalk influence in HyperCard (despite TedKaehler's later involvement in the HyperCard project), but you have to admit that this was a pretty small world.
