An EnDeme set is a list of concepts that can be combined in any order. The order is important. Order indicates priority, priority indicates importance, importance implies meaningfulness. When meaning is applied to something that is a form of information. Therefore an endeme set is a schema for an endeme, and an endeme is an atomic unit of information.

An endeme set is what I call a ConceptPermutationEmergentPropertyStructure. Essentially, it is a limited list of concepts which may be placed in any order and when placed in an order constitute an endeme. Endemes each have 22 different EndemeCharacteristic''''''s and when they are permuted/combined together produce an EmergentProperty which is an atomic unit of information.

An EndemeSet is made up of a list of (nominally) 22 EndemeCharacteristic s. The EndemeSet can also be thought of a sort of a schema or class for an Endeme which an instance of an EndemeSet.

The EndemeSet may be a native data structure for storing RealInformation. Alternatively endeme sets may be the glue that allows the data world to be connected to the information world. The SemanticWeb and ComputerOntologies are based on relationships of entities. Endeme sets can provide the descriptions of those entities that become related. As such endemes can ground the semantic web to all of the data in the world and lead to a new level of information technology development.

Endeme Sets are one of the foundations of InformationProgramming.
Endemes are also good for ArtificialCreativity. ArtificialCreativity and ArtificialIntelligence really operate off of information rather than data. EnDemes provide the glue that attaches them to data then thence the 'real' world.
