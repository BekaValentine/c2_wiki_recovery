OpenAir - aka MakeRoomForAllViewpoints - A collaboration pattern.

OpenAir also makes it easier to KeepAnOpenMind, due to more Oxygen flowing around.

OpenAir does require more FixBrokenWindows, that is a suitable price to pay.

Can someone advice whether there is a ChristopherAlexander terminology, and equivalent pattern number?
* I did a web search on Christopher Alexander and "Open Air" "Open Space", etc. Unfortunately did not have suitable results. Was looking for a suitable page name that will equally applicable to MakeRoomForAllViewpoints and ArchitecturalDesignPatterns. -- dl
