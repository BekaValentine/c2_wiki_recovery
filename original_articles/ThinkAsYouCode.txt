The act of incrementally authoring, compiling, and testing code as a stimulant
for thinking about larger design issues (DesignAndTheScientificMethod).  Works as well or better than diagrams and pseudo-code for some people.  Especially useful when leveraging third-party libraries or frameworks, as it integrates the necessary discovery process to help prune the design search space as early as possible.  Also gives a head start on building the eventual system, if there is a willingness to refactor the initial efforts as the design evolves.
