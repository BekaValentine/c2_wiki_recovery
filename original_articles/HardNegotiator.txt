An AntiPattern.

A negotiator must understand what are the trade-offs and not always "fornicate" the other party. Initially, a HardNegotiator may think he has won, but when the other party is unable to deliver what is promised, the result may be worse. A WinWin situation best describes a good negotiation.

Managers tend to think they are good negotiators. See NegotiatingWithManagers.

One particular mistake HardNegotiator''''''s make is to HireOnlyBeginners.
