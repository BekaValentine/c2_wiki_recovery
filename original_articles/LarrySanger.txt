Formerly editor-in-chief of NuPedia and a main participant of WikiPedia. See http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Larry_Sanger

Larry has attracted a lot of attention in 2005, because of his SlashDot memoir http://features.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/18/164213&from=rss and because of his KuroShin article 
http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/30/142458/25
His critical views of WikiTechnology based WikiPedia have not earned him many friends within the WikiMedia community, and one example can be found at http://www.br1an.net/2005/04/larry-sanger-is-not-co-founder-of.html (BrokenLink)

OTOH, we all have to be mindful of the fact that HumansAreLousyAtSelfEvaluation. And therefore should pay extra attention to criticisms from people such as LarrySanger.
