Story boards are a method of depicting a film through a sequence of scenes with accompanying text.  Usually there is a figure or scene on one page and text on the facing page.  An alternative is to have the story board in landscape format with picture and text arranged either vertically or horizontally -- it is very effective, especially for executive summaries. --RaySchneider
