Alternative viewpoint to TopVsOthers

I do NOT believe it's about personal preferences. Instead, I believe the heated debates are usually about math versus people (WetWare). You guys habitually think to '''optimize''' software from a math-like perspective (parsimony, provability etc.) while I habitually optimize for WetWare issues. Now the tricky part is figuring out WHY we do this. It seems I think much more about the issues of business, economics, and staffing than my usual detractors when balancing trade-offs. I consider, "what is the manager or owner thinking, and what do they want me to optimize the software for."
