Daniel Barlow, SexpFiend.  Interests include CommonLisp, PerlLanguage, Unix and LinuxOperatingSystem development.  AlternateHardAndSoftLayers is a start, but I still dream of SoftLayersAllTheWayDown.

I implemented CLiki (see CommonLispWiki) back in the days when the Ward's Wiki code was still a sensible choice for a new wiki installation.  In 2004 I am (a) working for clara.net, (b) hacking AMD64 support for SBCL, (c) plotting to build a Lisp-based scriptable platform that doesn't completely revile Unix, and (d) suffering regular soft tissue damage inflicted by inline skating accidents.  More (mostly about b-d) at http://ww.telent.net/diary/

I am attempting to do my bit for wiki as "an informal history of programming", mostly by seeking out high quality "on topic" pages and garnishing them with subtle(ish) refactoring and relevant cross-links.  I hope that this will have a net positive effect on Recent Changes and hence on "wiki's mind"; I fear that it will expose perfectly good "hidden treasure" pages to the sight of morons.  If I see that latter effect, I'll have to think of something else.
