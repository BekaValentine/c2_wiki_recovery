RequisitePro has a very full featured COM (ComponentObjectModel) interface.
So far, it seems that if it can be done in RequisitePro, it can be done through the COM interface.  Considering how hideous RequisitePro is, it is nice to be able to write helper tools and scripts to make life a bit more livable.

I'll just throw out that for VisualBasic programmers, you need to add RequisitePro 4.5 RPX (SRVC REL v4.500.0028.r1) to your reference list, and the base class is ReqPro40.

Start with looking through:
	* ReqPro40.Application
	* ReqPro40.Project
