An Entity-Relationship modeling diagram with the older-style chicken feet line notation (before 1:m came into vogue), and with just about everything else removed - no dashed lines, no double-border boxes, also no inheritance.  We found them useful for finding our way through about 200 types.

We used to make no pretense about using a "standard" notation, and called them ChickenFeetDiagram''''''s to reflect this.

I know this notation as a BachmannDiagram. I never did understand why it fell into disuse, as it's so much more visually intuitive than 1:m etc.
