JFDI is the abbreviation for '''Just F***ing Do It''', and a phrase that people are liable to yell when they find their co-workers trapping them in AnalysisParalysis. It can be used as a verb, as in: "Why don't you stop spouting hot air and JFDI?" or a noun, as in "I think I'm going to apply some JFDI with this one."

''I first came across this phrase from the LondonPerlMongers, where it is beloved in the vocabulary. -- EarleMartin''
