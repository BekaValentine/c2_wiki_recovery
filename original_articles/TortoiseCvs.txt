TortoiseCvs is a plug-in for Windows Explorer written by Francis Irving. 

From the web site [http://www.tortoisecvs.org/]

''Tortoise lets you work with files under CVS version control directly from Windows Explorer. It's freely available under the GPL. ''

''With TortoiseCVS you can directly check out modules, update, commit and see differences by right clicking on files and folders within Explorer. You can see the state of a file with overlays on top of the normal icons within Explorer. It even works from within the file open dialog. ''

It's brilliant.  --AnAspirant.  (Oh, but get TweakUi too so that you can repair your icons occasionally)

Suberb. --An user

Fantastic and....
Version 1.45 includes a 'rebuild icons' option on the context menu :)  --An Ant.

CVS is a mediocre revision control system at best.  It doesn't version directories or renames, branching is baroque, and it's not ACID.  But TortoiseCvs is an amazing front end.  Absolutely fabulous.  With TortoiseCvs, using CVS is a pleasure, and I can overlook CVS's deficiencies.  No other revision control system I've seen comes close to the combination of Tortoise and CVS.  --JimLittle

I totally agree.  By the way, you might want to try SubVersion -- it is supposed to address some of those limitations in CVS, and handily enough there's a TortoiseSvn project so you get to keep the nice front end. -- KevinMcConnell
