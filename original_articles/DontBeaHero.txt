Resist the temptation to ride in on a white charger and slay the
dragons.  If you find yourself beset by dragons, change habitat --
either yours or theirs.

Working in crisis-driven mode can be lots of fun.
You get to be a hero, you get the adrenaline rush of skirting the
edge of disaster, you ''know'' you're indispensable.
However, it's probably not the best thing for the business.
In the aftermath of a crisis, you should probably ask process 
and strategy questions
to figure out where you made the mistake that eventually led to the crisis.

Be a farmer, not a hero. However, your peers might DontBeaNero.

If you ask the questions and find that the problems are insoluble, and that
there nothing you can do that has a reasonable chance of reducing the
probability of crisis (''changing the dragon's habitat''), consider moving on
(''changing your own habitat'').

BeaHero:
Slay the dragons.  Clear the fields.
Invite the farmers to return, and then leave -- to find and slay other dragons.
