(Probably should be renamed ProjectTerminationJunctures)

The wise software development manager plans for failure.

Cancellation Junctures are explicit points in a project where no-go or stop options are executed in planned, orderly, and deliberate manner.

There are arguably several types of cancellation junctures:
 - Project cancellation junctures
 - Project element cancellation junctures
 - People termination junctures
''Is this a way of saying that each "juncture" is a go/no-go decision point in the life of the project? How is that different from, say, a milestone-based delivery contract with functionality/fee milestones? That's the way I do all of my contracts these days. Each milestone comes at a certain date and promises delivery of tested, known good functionality. The client can then proceed with the project or stop development at that point. Isn't that the same thing?''
