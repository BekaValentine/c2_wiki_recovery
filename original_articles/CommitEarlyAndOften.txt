"Commit early and often" is a mantra of VersionControl, especially in the OpenSource community.

Really, it is codified CommonSense that everyone should have learned after losing their last big edit in their editor of choice.

This was also good advice when using a centralized repository like CVS, because frequent commits (and frequent updates) lessen the chance that you run into merge problems with the other developers.
