Alas, I did not know someone else was writing something called MiniWiki when I decided to write mine, and now there are two of them! I have no idea which came first at the time of this writing. If you know who owns miniwiki other, have them contact me at deliberatus AT verizon DOT net and we will figure out which one has prior art, and the other can gracefully change the name of their invention.

Well shucks... looking at the project webpage for miniwiki, I see it was registered before I began this project.

Shucks.

OK, next edition will be named WindowsWiki. Initials will be WW. I lose. -- KirkBailey

MW is written in Python, it is modular, and is optimized to operate in a windows environment. It is shipped with a SIX LINE SERVER SCRIPT so you can have a CGI-capable server living in your PC - THANK YOU Mr Steve Holden! I also now include a server written in delphi which is very robust indeed, and lower in system impact than running the python script is. 

MW is quite similar in its features to wikiNehesa for some funny reason (I wrote WikiNehesa) and makes a nice little offline desktop wiki for a personal notebook. In fact, the latest version was developed in my laptop, and is now working there as my wiki hyper notebook. Handy thing this.

If you are running a Windows server, you COULD run this and offer it to all the world to play with. HOWEVER, I strongly advise against it, as there are no security precautions; it was written with the intent of being your desktop wiki, not open to ALL THE WORLD, and noting Windows' promiscuous security, anything is possible. If you do so, it is at your own risk.

MW is $FREE$ and is licensed under the GnuGeneralPublicLicense.

OK, WindowsWiki is coming along nicely, and 1.4.0 is working well. It comes with Tinyweb, a nice mini server written in Delphi, and more robust than the python scripted server, which tended to sneeze if a program burped strangeness due to coding errors - far too common during testing and developing a project. The new edition will offer some new features, improved implementing of existing features, and is all around creamy tasty goodness.

It will also be shareware. For this much work, read warriors can reward me a tad bit.

WindowsWiki is now a reality, and it is shareware. It comes with the server (Tinyweb now) and is in a self-installer executable file (thank you, Inno) and requires python to be made available for it to work - and python also comes (separately) as a self-installing executable.

The website for the completed task is http://www.freeholdmarketing.com/WW/, where you can download the shareware version for evaluation.
