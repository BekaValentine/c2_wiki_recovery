JesseBlomberg is a software engineer.

He worked for BlizzardEntertainment but may have moved on given recent events at that company.

I certainly didn't move on.  Still here, still working like crazy.  Recent events affected me not in the least.

Jesse has adopted some XP working practices.
This is true.  I have.

I'm a recent college graduate, and after entering the work force, I realized how piteous my education really was. After talking and working with several other recent grads, I've realized that college barely teaches you the basics. Sure, I learned the syntax of several languages, and how operating systems work, etc.  But they failed to teach good programming. This backwards approach is a serious problem, as it it produces a lot of people that are sort of programmers, but not really.  Everything that I really use day to day is stuff I've taught myself or learned from sources outside of school.

''Jesse, AreYouThere?''
I'm not here anymore.  The signal to noise ratio got too low, so I left for greener pastures.  Would you like me to delete myself?

''Not at all, if you show up rarely rather than never -- which you must, else you wouldn't have left that note. :-)''

I certainly do show up from time to time.  I don't think I'll ever leave, because there are some pages here that hold precious knowledge that I like to keep my eye on.
