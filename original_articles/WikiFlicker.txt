No, this is not a serious page.

WikiFlicker is a phenomenon brought on by browsing to a page that's continually deleted (or changed) and restored.

It's a little like trying to read under a fluorescent light that's losing its ballast unit.

The good news is it doesn't hurt the eyes as much.

The bad news is it hurts the mind (in a surreal not-quite-a-headache way) even more.

Now, if we could please have an electrician in to repair that bloody fixture ...

Perhaps a surreal electrician.

I still think this is a DeletionCandidate as it is an OrphanPage, and therefore unlikely to be widely read, and was last edited December 10, 2004 (other than discussion on its deletion).

But it is referenced on FunnyWikiProcesses. Isn't this a funny wiki pattern?
