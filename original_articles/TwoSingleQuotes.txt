You can moderately emphasize text by placing TwoSingleQuotes on either side of the text to emphasize. On most systems, this will result in ''italicizing'' the enclosed text.

''This is an example of using TwoSingleQuotes on either end of an entire sentence.''

This is an example of using TwoSingleQuotes on either end of just ''this''.

Note that if you use ''this over
multiple lines'' (in the source), it will not work right.  So make sure
that you only have one line you put the quotes around.
