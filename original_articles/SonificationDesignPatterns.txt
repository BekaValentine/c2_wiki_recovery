These prototype Sonification Design Patterns were written from papers in the proceedings of ICAD'02 that had clear statements of hypotheses, results to support them, and repeated examples elsewhere in the proceedings.
The lively development of SonificationDesignPatterns may help build 
sonification-specific vocabulary, identify hypotheses, and allow product 
designers to pick up and apply our research.
Please add to and improve on these first learning exercises! -- Stephen Barrass, May 2003
