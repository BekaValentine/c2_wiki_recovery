A tool for VisualAge Java that automatically creates JavaUnit test case templates. No more will you have an excuse not to write JUnit tests, nor the frustration of writing/copying the correct methods or forgetting to register a test class in your master test class.

JUnitCreator has the following features:
	* Create standard JUnit tests with configurable templates (for in-house variations)
	* Create and register test classes with an AllTests master class
	* Mock infrastructure for testing VisualAge tools
	* Expectation counter objects that you can use in your tests
	* Free

Very nice tool.  Thanks.  It is better to use this than the JUnit automatic run tool since with this you don't have to add every project under the sun to your VisualAge Workspace class path.

It would be nice to be able to have different .cfg files on a project or package basis, rather than one set system wide.
