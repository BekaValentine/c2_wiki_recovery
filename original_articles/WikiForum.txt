A name for a set of Web pages served by a WikiEngine (or a WikiClone). The server on which the software runs could be a WikiFarm. You are currently reading one page of a WikiForum, the WikiWikiWeb.

"WikiForum" solves the WikiSingleWordProblem, turning a particular meaning of "wiki" into a WikiWord. (See WikiHasManyMeanings.)

For a list, see WikiForums (and PublicWikiForums and NonPublicWikiForums).

''Isn't the WikiSingleWordProblem addressed already by using the term WikiWiki?''

''And doesn't WikiForum refer more to a wiki that operates in ThreadMode like a forum, as opposed to a DocumentMode reference wiki such as WikiPedia?''
