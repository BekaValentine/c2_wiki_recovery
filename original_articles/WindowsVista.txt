''Someone asked a forum how to run X on Vista. A couple months after MicrosoftCorporation's rollout.''

''Someone answered "X on what??"''

"Vista" is Microsoft's latest desktop OS. It features lots of "JigglingBaloney", such as translucent window frames, and "customize" renamed to "personalize". 

I have heard it will refuse to play music if it suspects you could possibly have "borrowed"* it. 

In some circles, it's considered the greatest thing that ever happened 
to UbuntuLinux. Due to customer reaction, Dell started shipping U as an 
alternative OS.

I have since switched my notebook from Ubuntu to its original Vista installation, because I like trivial details like Midi, Sleep mode, and VPN at least working, albeit slowly.

If there is a hell, eternity will be spent by...

* BillGates browsing MS's tech support system (without dropping his name)
* SteveBalmer running Vista on commercial grade hardware.

A few months ago, we purchased a new Dell laptop with Vista Home Premium for my daughter who is in medical school, because her old Gateway XP Pro machine was plain worn out.  I spent a bunch of time tweaking it, and I must say that I am very pleased with the outcome.  I really like it, and am looking for a good deal on one to purchase for myself.  Hers is running on 3 gigs of ram and performs very nicely, and of course it works well "it's a Dell"!  I have a 7 year old Dell laptop that runs XP Home (max hacked) like a dream, and it is older then the hills.  Anyway, she has found very few problems with music (she is a music copy queen) and with other applications.  Mainly the problems we have encountered are do to software developers ignoring Vista issues and wanting to keep their heads buried in the sand.  I have helped some authors diagnose and fix their products with good results.  I figured out in a hurry, before we ever purchased that laptop, that you need at least 3 gigs for good performance, and a bit of good tweaking too.  So far, I prefer Vista over, 98, ME, and XP.  I'm hoping that one day, Linux will come out with something that will win me over, they are coming close, but not quite there yet...

''Conversely, I've been using almost exclusively Linux on the desktop (including various notebooks) since 2000.  This includes using it for music composition, editing movies, etc., for the past few years.  There have been issues with hardware compatibilities, software infrastructure changes, etc., but almost all of them were quickly resolved and the power of free software like Ardour is worth the occasional hassle.''

WindowsVista, formerly named WindowsLonghorn, is the next milestone after WindowsXp in the series of MicroSoft WindowsOperatingSystems. It will have a new Plex theme along with the Luna Theme from XP, and sexy "Glass effects" to entice user upgrades. It has an additional sidebar added onto its task bar; the sidebar can easily be removed. The sidebar can hold numerous components, including custom ones. It's currently on Build 4029 Milestone 5. It is scheduled to be released in 2006.

For TabletPc''''''s, Windows magazine has provided a list of tentative upgrades in conjunction with WindowsVista. See http://www.winnetmag.com/windowspaulthurrott/Article/ArticleID/42587/windowspaulthurrott_42587.html

WindowsVista name was officiated in mid 05 and dissenters come out with this derogatory expansion''(Viruses, Infections, Spyware, Trojans, Adware.)'' See http://news.com.com/Windows+Vista/2100-1016_3-5801300.html
* Apparently, an InformationSecurity alert was raised at SansInstitute regarding IP exposure via the "Advance Networking Pack" peer to peer server that was first introduced in WindowsXp SP1. In it, the PNRP-identifier (or user name) is associated with the user's IP address. See http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2141188/windows-vista-puts-tester

What happened to IFS?

'''MicrosoftWindowsServer version of WindowsVista'''

Note: ''WindowsBlackcomb/WindowsVienna is the NextBigThing after WindowsVista.''

The server version of this OS is expected to be released around two years after the desktop version. The company still admits only to a one year lag as recent as May2004. Additional inclusions would parallel what WindowsServerTwoThousandThree had added to WindowsXp, like MicrosoftSmallBusinessServer, specialized processor support, specialized device support, etc.

'''MicrosoftSecurity aspects'''

Apr05 MS confirmed withdrawal of most of its Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB) security plan. As originally conceived, it has DigitalRightsManagement provisions that had unresolved issues. See http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,101332,00.html

Has integrated NetworkAccessProtection. And if the built-in IPV6 is used exclusively, additional security provisions will be available through IpSec.
* (update Jun05) TechEd has more on IPV6 (longterm transition) role in security enhancements. See http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/story/0,10801,102386,00.html
* additional exposures exist as well. See http://www.dslreports.com/faq/9464

"User account control" features, formerly known as UAP (User Access Protection) in WindowsVista triggered some debate in mid06 and big names like Paul Thurott got entangled. See more details at http://blogs.zdnet.com/Ou/?p=209 

A late 2006 overview of security changes can be found at http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/silverman/4425731.html
