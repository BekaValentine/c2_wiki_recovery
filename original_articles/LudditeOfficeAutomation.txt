Back in the mists of ancient time, say thirty years ago, when "IT" was "DP", people doing "systems analysis" (so the sagas call it) would follow folks around their office and record what they did with their various bits of paper. This information would be captured in the "current physical model". This would then be transformed into the "current logical model". From this would arise the "new logical model", and from that the "new physical model", and from ''that'' "structure diagrams" from which code could be written. At least, that's what the books they wrote say they did. 

After a while, we are told, these pioneering systems analysts fell in love with their so eloquent bubbles and arrows, and felt that they were able to construct the "new logical model" immediately, by the direct exercise of intellectual prowess. And so sin entered the world.
