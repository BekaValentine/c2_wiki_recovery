An interactive wizard to narrow down the choice of Wikis is available at http://www.wikimatrix.org/wizard.php - it asks you a few questions about your needs, then will present you with a list of matching Wikis which can then be compared in a side-by-side table.

Pages on '''this''' wiki related to choosing and running wiki software include, but are certainly not limited to:
* ChoosingaWiki
* StartingaWiki
* TopTenWikiEngines
* WikiChoicetree
* WikiChoosingStories
* WikiEngines
* WikiEngineReview
* WikiEnginesComparingWikis
* WikiFeaturesWiki
