I attended the SIGS conference last year. I'll be attending OOPSLA this year. I wasn't all that impressed by the SIGS conference. It has something to offer beginner and intermediate Java developers, but it doesn't go much into advanced topics (as I anticipate OOPSLA will). SIGS also has a noticeable leaning toward vendor demos and tutorials. If you are needing to evaluate or work within a particular commercial app server, and they will be in attendance, then it's probably worth your while to go. If you interested in what I term more ''intellectual'' aspects of Java development, you'll be disappointed by SIGS.
