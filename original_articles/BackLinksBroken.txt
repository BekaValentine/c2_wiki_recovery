Name: BackLinksBroken

Context: When clicking on a title of a page to view the BackLink''''''s the following comes up:

        The wiki server cannot process your request.
        The following error has been detected. 
        No search word given (or HTTP_REFERER blocked).
Forces:

	* Firewall
	* Filtering proxy
	* Local caching
	* Anti-virus software that mangles HTTP_REFERER into HTTP_WEFERER

Solution:

	* Turn off caching
	* Set the filtering proxy to not filter c2.com
	* Turn off the referrer blocking feature in your anti-virus software.

Note: to check whether HTTP_REFERER is blocked, follow the instructions in HttpReferer.

Sometimes your browser may cache the previous search, and attempting to force a reload fails because of the referer problem. In that case you can fill in the required search term explicitly in the URL of your browser by appending "?search=XXXX".

----

See as an alternative for the HttpReferer/spider issue the suggestion on CategoriesAsInterWiki: GoogleScript the FullSearch. 

At the very least the wiki error message should link to the HttpReferer page as explanation.
