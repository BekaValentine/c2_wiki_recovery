That which is too often missing from online discourse: a source citation when a claim is made about what someone else says or believes. The idea is that the reader can then verify whether or not the claim is actually true. It does not have to be a formal bibliographic citation, but just stating the person's name is not enough.

Studies show this is a very widespread problem.
