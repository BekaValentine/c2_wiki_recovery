John Lakos Chief Software Architect with Bloomberg LP; previously he was with Bear Stearns and MentorGraphics.  While at MentorGraphics, he wrote the book "Large-Scale C++ Software Design" (LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign) from the Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series.  It quickly became a widely touted and respected treatise on solving many of the problems of physical software design that arise when developing large C++ software projects. This book (and others) are mentioned in the GreatBooksList elsewhere on this site.

He is reportedly working on a second book, titled ''Scalable C++: Component-based Development.''
