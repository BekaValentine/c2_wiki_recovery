Formerly a mainframe software company that grew by acquiring many other companies with somewhat failed products, and others that were simply fat and happy.  It suffered from indigestion after merging with Platinum right before the peak of the dotcom frenzy, but is on the road to recovery and is now focusing on software for managing infrastructural aspects of IT.

Software being purchased by CA is (or at least was) considered a sure LegacyStamp. They would milk companies that relied on the software but charge too much to gain new customers, ensuring the product's gradual demise.
