The program is in a text file, and input is in the form of if there is more then 1 choice we're to move the draw card, and output is in the form of lists of cards. If you cannot move the draw card anywhere, you discard it. The deck is a 52-card standard playing-cards deck. You may add more then 1 deck if you need to later.

Sines:
 A23456789TJQK = the numbers of the cards
 CHDS = the suits of cards
 # = the number of ___
 % = the suit of ___
 : = if ___
 &| = and,or can be used as :
 ! = not
 $ = ___ is emty pile
 = = ___ is ___
 lowercaseleters = name of piles
 ^ = current card
 } = top card of pile ___
 . = beginning of name of pile to mark foundation piles
 * = you can move the current card to the pile ___
 / = you must move the top card of ___ to ___ (the first pile must not have a . and the second pile must have a .)
 + = number 1 more than ___
 - = number 1 less than ___
 ? = draw pile is empty
 @ = you make a new draw pile (only if draw pile is empty)
 ( = output the card ___
 ) = output the pile ___
 \ = clear the pile ___
 " = stop the program
 } = move the top card of pile ___ to the bottom of the pile
 , = set the pile ___ to select a different pile of the same name of: if right ___ has a number, select that number down from top, in that space in grid. If right ___ has suit, then D=down,H=up,S=left,C=right in grid. For example: grid,3H would move up on the grid (for the pile calld "grid"), and then choose pile 3 in that space in the grid.

Examples:

To put cards in piles of suits, output those piles, and then stop (it will separate the cards into suits)
 :^=S*spades :^=C*clubs :^=H*hearts :^=D*diamonds :? )spades)clubs)hearts)diamonds"

To find the 3 of clubs and all cards it found after it found the 3 of clubs:
 :$pile!|^=3C*pile:?)pile"
