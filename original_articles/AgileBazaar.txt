The (newish) name for the BostonAreaXpUsersGroup. The AgileBazaar has a Wiki up at http://stambaugh-inc.com/cgi-bin/AgileBazaarWeb, although it hasn't been updated much lately. KenSchwaber started a Yahoo! mailing list for us at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AgileBazaar - this will hopefully be a bit longer lasting.
