''Designing Visual Interfaces: Communication Oriented Techniques'' by Kevin Mullet, Darrell Sano [ISBN 0133033899]

If you are involved with designing or coding a user interface, you must read this book.  This book addresses the ''visual'' issues of interface design in more detail than I have seen elsewhere.

Keep this book handy and your users interfaces will improve vastly.
