''Cannot find a job? Why not work as a call girl...''

* Because I don't look good in a bra

Sourced from an article in 2003 titled "Staying On the Job" (ref: http://www.cio.com.au/pp.php?id=695348215&amp;taxid=11)

It was stated as an example of a teething problem after implementation of a jobsearch application in Australia. It is worth reading for other information , such as those on management of large scale system projects.
