Certain personalities in the field of ComputerScience are known for rather StrongOpinions.  In some cases, "strong" refers to the strength, soundness, and logic of their arguments.  In other cases, "strong" refers to the abrupt, confrontational, and (to some people) ill-mannered way that those opinions are delivered.

And in some cases (the subject of this page), it means both.  The following folks are both a) recognized experts in a particular field, and b) given to making public statements/pronouncements that rub others the wrong way (even if the statement is correct, or at least reasonable).
