WikiTags are tags which are created for use in indexing and collection of associated items and are activated in a WikiWithMoreThanPages by a process which indexes and/or collects the PageName''''''s in a page by the same name.

The indexing and collection might be extended with the addition of an Associative Tag in the page.
