I'm an AI software engineer at http://www.shai.com. At work, I'm mostly interested in datamining. In my own time, I'm interested in soccer, math, volunteer work and daydreaming about remodeling my house.

Oops, not anymore, you can't. My boyfriend, who was hosting my site, has moved and doesn't have DSL anymore :-( 
Hopefully, it'll be back again soon!
