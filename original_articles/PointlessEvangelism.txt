One of the basic strategies used to implement WorryDrivenDevelopment.

''Let the following illustrate by example:''

If you have no point, why not let everyone know about it?

If someone looks confused in response to your diatribe, speak louder! Don't be afraid to SHOUT!

If they start to argue, great. One point for you.

If they run away, chase them...

Try to poke holes in anything they have to say. If they ask for supporting evidence, insult them. Then, pretend that you are the one who is offended.

''This page is so lame. Doesn't everyone else agree? There is no reason for this page. I'm offended that you wasted my time''

I won't even waste my time responding to you. The reason for this page is because you don't get it. You obviously don't get the point because you are lame. This page is clearly superior to your lame attempt to refute it. Why should anyone listen to what you have to say?

Note: feel free to claim one thing and proceed to do another (claim to not respond, then go ahead and respond).

''This page was sincerely not meant to offend anyone. Cheers. -- JasonNocks'' [He was offering humor, not being offended.] ''Indeed. I take offense to the idea that I'm easily offended''

I'm offended by your non-offense. It is my right to be offended and offend others! . . . Wait. . . Who is the one that gets to PlayHurt?? -- LayneThomas

This pointlessness is not BuzzwordCompliant.  
Evangelism requires proper reverence for BuzzWord''''''s.
You need a MissionStatement and a StatementOfQualifications.

CoreCompetencies need to be assessed.  Paradigms need to be
examined and properly framed.  ISO-modeled methodologies
must be adopted.  Aggressive MarketDriven innovation is a
necessity.  Spread the word.

Oh, and by the way, some of the above commentary and argument
violates my RightToNotBeOffended. ''you terrorist''
