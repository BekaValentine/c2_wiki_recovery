Shamrock Trails Ranch is the site of McStylesSoftware, which is being designed and build as a living, working, and teaching space for software developers and others who wish to learn and grow as humans for the forseeable future. The anticipated completion date is Q2 2007. We broke ground in July 2006. This is a project by KristyneMcDaniel.
