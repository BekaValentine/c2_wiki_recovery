KmWiki is also a pywiki implementation. http://www.voght.com/cgi-bin/pywiki?KmWiki [redirects to: http://kmwiki.wikispaces.com/]

KmWiki is yet another WikiWikiClone.

Initially designed for "capturing organizational memory", after a while becomes a 
"memory" of just our development department.

In short, this is a ''Wiki + Knowledge Base Engine + few additional tricks'':

''Wiki''

	* Original look and feel.
	* Most of the original text formatting rules.

''Knowledge Base Engine''

	* Any Wiki page could be indexed by some knowledge assertion (expressed as ConceptualGraph). Assertion could be stored in the knowledge base.
	* Wiki page could contain embedded queries to the knowledge base. The result of a query could be a links to other pages or just a static text.
	* Maintained an ''Ontology'' - hierarchy of domain concept types and relations.

''Additional tricks''

	* In-place drawings editor: the viewer and the editor applets. Simple figures and simple UML-like diagrams.
	* C++ code is recognized and displayed with "colored syntax". 

Most of the interesting stuff are on our intranet KmWiki server - we are trying to put all
together the information about our development environment (C++ class libraries and frameworks).

Here are some details:
	* Server was implemented as a Java servlet. 
	* All parsers where written with aid of Sun JavaCC compiler. 
	* Notio Package was used as a kernel for Knowledge Base Engine.
	* Drawings Editor was implemented on a top of Java HotDraw framework.
	* Tested on Linux+Apache, WindowsNT+Apache, WindowsNT+IIS (ASP+JScript).
