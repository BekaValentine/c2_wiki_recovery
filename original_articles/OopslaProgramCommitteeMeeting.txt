(''OopslaProgramChairPatterns'')

The purpose of the OopslaProgramCommitteeMeeting is to choose
the papers to be published in the proceedings and presented
at the conference. The major constraints on the meeting are
that it can only take a day or two, and that preparation
time is limited.

I used the following patterns in 1989 and really liked
them, but I haven't been emulated, near as I can tell:
	* AcceptRejectRecommendation
	* SortedPaperList
	* PaperChampion
