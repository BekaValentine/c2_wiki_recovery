Physicists in their attempt to unify and simplify are on the verge of discovering a TheoryOfEverything. How they will do this is explained below:

First assume that it is possible to construct such a theory if enough background assumptions are not introduced.

Second assume that some undiscovered force is responsible for gravity, light, matter, and energy. 

Third assign this force to be the work of very small particles of great mass.

Fourth gather several of these particles and demonstrate that the force relates gravity, light matter and energy with a single equation. 

Then explain why.
