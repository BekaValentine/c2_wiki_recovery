I am not a physicist, but get the impression that string theory is so complex that it essentially can explain just about anything by having tons of indirection built in to it. It may be the modern version of AddingEpicycles. Instead of circles (and bars), it adds dimensions and other doo-dads. StringTheory may be essentially be a TuringMachine which can match just about any model with enough "programming" (or math layers).

[[If it can explain just about anything, then it is not a theory of everything, but a theory of "anything". Important distinction.]]

It violates OccamsRazor the same way using a creator does: It can have just about any behavior because it is defined as being so complex as to having the ability to supply anything actually observed.
