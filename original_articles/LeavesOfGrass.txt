''Describe LeavesOfGrass here.''

Let Walt do it:

'''NO labor-saving machine'''   


 NO labor-saving machine,   
 Nor discovery have I made;   
 Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to found a hospital or library,   
 Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage, for America,   
 Nor literary success, nor intellectï¿½ nor book for the book-shelf;          5 
 Only a few carols, vibrating through the air, I leave,   
 For comrades and lovers.
