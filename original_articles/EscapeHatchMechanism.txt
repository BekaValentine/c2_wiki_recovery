An example of an EscapeHatchMechanism is the exec function offered in some languages.  Rexx for example has the ability to have a program automatically generate a program and then load and run it.  This is a general capability of interpreted languages.  The ability to both create and launch an arbitrary program in the context of an already developed system is a very powerful albeit dangerous capability.

I used to criticize C on the grounds that it gave the programmer too much freedom to muck with the internals.  But it is dirty work and someone has to do it.  This came from EscapeHatch''''''es and I'd appreciate it if others would elaborate on the EscapeMechanisms they are familiar with and use. --RaySchneider

The escape hatch out of a framework or object hierarchy are virtual functions. This is why almost everything should be made virtual unless you have a very good reason not to make it virtual.
