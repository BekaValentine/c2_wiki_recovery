For some people (I was one) it can be tough to see your contributions cut up, attacked, criticized, misinterpreted, reorganized, etc. Relax, take a deep breath, and just give up your concerns. Trust that wiki will take care of it. This can be a leap of faith. Don't stop contributing though, because in the end, you are part of the solution. You will learn a lot, and the odds are very good that the end result will be better than you could have imagined.
