I am a software developer working for SmartLogik in Cambridge, UK.

I have been developing professionally (i.e., getting paid) for 12 years. I have developed in C and C++ for Windows in the past. More recently, I am programming in Perl and C++ under Unix.  

I had RSI in the past, but am now largely recovered.

I am an enthusiastic lurker on the wiki.
