Lucid Inc provided CommonLisp systems (Lucid Common Lisp) to essentially all the computer manufacturers from 1984 until 1994. That software is still sold by Xanalys under the absurd name "Liquid Common Lisp." http://www.lispworks.com/products/lcl.html. Lucid also designed and implemented the Energize C++ programming environment (code named "Cadillac").
