ExeRb generates native windows executable files from RubyLanguage scripts.

http://exerb.sourceforge.jp/index.en.html

It's currently at version 3.2.0.

References to this package seem to be fairly scarce among english language pages. Does anybody here have much experience with it? How well does it go with using the various ruby graphical toolkits? If somebody wants me to throw together an application, is writing it in ruby and providing them with an ExeRb executable a recommended course to follow?

An alternative project is rbwrap (http://freepan.org/ruby/by-dist/rbwrap/), but that declares itself to be pre-alpha and requires cygwin (I'm not sure if that's a runtime or a compile time requirement).
