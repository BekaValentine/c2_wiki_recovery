Are you changing the subject?

Has the subject been changed?

Why would you think that it had?

''Looks like we need some context here. Would this page make a good entry point ???'' -- ''Why not?''

Aren't things like why not - rhetoric, and such - explicitly forbidden by the rules?

Isn't the question that makes "Why not?" a rhetorical answer rhetorical itself?

How else can one point such things out?

(You mean, suggestions about entry points?) But if they have no drawbacks, why ask?

Well, is a task being harmless enough to make it worthwhile?

What makes you think this is harmless?

''Is it GoodStyle to ask so many questions?''

''Is this a ValuablePage, can we mention some pages here so that it would make for a GoodEntryPoint?''

''Do you really suppose it would be worthwhile to do so?''

''Don't you think that ItDepends?''
