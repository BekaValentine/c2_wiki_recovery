The Cheetah template software is a PythonLanguage code-generating library. Of things I've seen, CheetahTemplate is most similar to WebMacro (which uses Java). CheetahTemplate and WebMacro have a more readable syntax than ASP, JSP, and PSP. The link below gives an excellent example of this. -- SteveHowell (WebMacro and CheetahTemplate user)
