A simulation of XP iterations, developed by VeraPeeters and PascalVanCauwenberghe

In three fun iterations, you learn about and use: UserStories, AcceptanceTest''''''s, estimating, the PlanningGame, Velocity.

The stories to implement are simple games - inflating balloons, building a house of cards, rolling dice for particular numbers - so that both developers and business people can join in the fun.

The whole game (including discussions and debriefings) lasts between 90 and 120 minutes.

BobPayne ran this game for the WashingtonDcAreaXpUsersGroup at our February 2002 meeting - it went over really well. If you think you really know XP well, you might be surprised by what you learn playing the customer role, or trying to estimate tasks with a large random component, or facing a task where you really just do need the specialist to work on it alone (we had a house-of-cards ringer).

By the way, to distinguish it from the other XP games out there, Bob called it "the BalloonGame". -- GeorgePaci
