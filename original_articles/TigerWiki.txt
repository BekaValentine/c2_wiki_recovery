TigerWiki was a wiki based on the last version roWiki of Marc Rohlfing. 

TigerWiki is written in PHP and it's very light weight (principal code less than 13 KB). It aims to be a minimalist, functional and simple to use system based on roWiki (Which begin to be a ghost on the web). 

Here's somes functionalities of TigerWiki :
* Standard compliant : XHTML (partialy true) and CSS Compliant.
* Automatic backup : Don't lost any important data due to bad handling. All pages, after modifications, are classed in a easy to access history.
* Password protection : Allow modifications to pages only if a password is given.
* Simple : You will be impressed by the simplicity!
* Free (and open-source) : Not question to take-out some dollars from user wallet. TigerWiki system is completely free, modifiable and reusable (by quoting sources). Even the technical support is free, with a smile!
