MacPersonalWiki ( http://www.scheirich.info/PersonalWiki/wiki/HomePage ) is a desktop version of a Wiki . It is written for Mac OS X and only available there.

Right now, as it is still in very heavy development it is still free. Some of the hopefully coming features will be so great and phenomenal that you will probably want to buy it for a small fee.
