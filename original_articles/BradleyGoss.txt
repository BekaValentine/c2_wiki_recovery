''Hi there. Perhaps you'd like to read NewUserPages and follow the links there to help you get a better idea of what this wiki is all about. In general this is a collaborative space, not simply a personal note pad. We'd love to have you join in, so read a bit, then find some positive contribution to make. Perhaps you'd care to tell us a little about yourself and your connection with people, patterns and programming.''
