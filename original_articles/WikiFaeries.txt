WikiFaeries work behind the scenes to make things beautiful. They add pictures of books that people mention (cf LexAndYacc), add color, and style, and, when appropriate, make ordinary words into WordsSmashedTogetherLikeSo.

(''As the supplier of the picture, and the crack about the pigeons' headdresses, on LexAndYacc, I'm flattered to be accidentally included with the WikiFaeries. I'm sure it was only by accident!'' --PhlIp)
