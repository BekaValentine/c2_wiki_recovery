        '''retread BBS and on-line service buff'''

My email jdebruyn@debruyn.com

My on-line interests go back to the days that the Bit Net and its DOD buddy, whose name fails me this
morning, when incubating the Internet.  I cruised the
on-line BBS circuit and developed some strong ideas on
the organization and integration of the components of a
site that best serve interaction between (and among) the software programs and the users.  I also got into the
BBS software, about five different packages, enough to run a board, and got a real feel
for how difficult all of that is to optimize as a systems
operator.

I am excited about the potential of patterns concepts for optimizing interactive communication and also with the potential of Wiki Wiki itself, the chosen means of
communication here, by adding collaborative,
hyperlinked, hypertext Web pages like those being generated here to a Web site.   

The closest messaging application from my old BBS/on-line 
service days would be the message base program, Participate,
which permitted a almost WWW threading and indexing of
messages on a open ended message tree.  Some of you
may recall this program on the Source which was some years ago absorbed by Compuserve.  After they captured the users
of the Participation program it was dropped by them and it
faded from memory.

	'''A couple of Internet/WWW projects'''
I am now working
to integrate email-based discussion groups, one a publishing project and the other an educational program, with Web resources.  The two most recent projects are:

1.  An on-line symposium with law professors and expert
law practitioners on the future of the limited liability
company and other unincorporated business entities.  This
symposium had two dozen panelists who were joined by 60 other law professors and practitioners
who took an active in the proceedings.  The symposium was presented over an email-based discussion group with about 650 subscribers.  And to other, uncounted, participants who followed the proceedings with
their Web browsers a Web-based message area that was
tied in to the email group.  The proceedings are being
published (February, 1997) in the journal of the
ABA Business Law Section, the Business Lawyer, which is
the second most cited law journal in the world (after
Harvard :)  You can drop into the symposium Web pages at

http://web.archive.org/web/20020115145649/http://www.abanet.org/rppt/lnet-llc.html

2.  The more recent project is an inter-campus law student
seminar group with the same email, Web-message base and
Web page support.  The first inter-active lecture discussion in this group was lead by Tax Court Judge Stephen Swift who was assisted by a panel of law professors and practitioners.  (A
footnote: The Judge's lecture, on Tax Litigation in the Tax Court, was picked up by a USAID
contractor/consultant in Moscow who invited the Judge
to Russia for a week next month (March) to help the Russian government establish corresponding procedures for the administration of their tax system.)  The home page for
this discussion group is

	 '''Project to adapt patterns concepts'''
I will be working on a project to redesign and integrate the email and Web based discussion groups to Wiki Wiki Web and vice versa.  This will eventually involve the on-line publishing and
educational programs just mentioned.  We plan to start this integration 
with a couple of on-line drafting projects to which Wiki
Wiki is particularly adaptable. ''Go to'' FrontPage for
the starting point for the Portland Pattern Repository 
which is hosted by WardCunningham who authored WikiWiki
the program that suports these read and write web pages.

	'''My Wiki.Wiki.Sand.Box, home page and email'''

My WikiWikiSandbox is open for you to see how Wiki works. ''Quote from
the Box:
A place to say hello, talk to yourself, experiment with the edit window.  Go for it-- '''at the foot of this page''' click EditText. Once the
editor window is up click on GoodStyle if you need some hints.  JohnDeBruyn (September 16, 2000) ''PS'' My first visit here to set this page up was circa February or March, 1997 when I was inviting some lawyer and accountant techies over to give  WikiWiki a test drive. 

My WikiBridge unveils a reencarnation of Wiki Wiki Web as a site for lawyers, CPAs and allied professionals.  You can go directly to this new Wiki Wiki Web at:

http://c2.com/w2/bridges/

looks likely bridge/ will be moving to http://network-lawyers.org/bridges or something like that which will be a subwiki off of http://network-lawyers.org  I will be posting more about the move and such at http://c2.com/w2/bridges/NetworkLawyers
