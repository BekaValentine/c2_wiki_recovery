Capabilities are a way of expressing security, which are claimed to work better than the ubiquitous AccessControlList''''''s (ACLs). The basic idea is reminiscent of the LawOfDemeter: you can speak only to objects you have created, or objects that you were created holding, or objects which have been passed to you.
