''Anyone know whether there are still reasons to use DublinCore, without the use of ExtensibleMarkupLanguage?''

* As far as I can see, the DublinCore defines a set of terms which can be used with any representation of the ResourceDescriptionFramework, for example ExtensibleMarkupLanguage. 
* DublinCore can also be used directly with ExtensibleMarkupLanguage without RDF.
** See http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines/ for this.
* The advantage of using the DublinCore is that using those terms means that the meanings are understood by other users of it as well. It defines well used things like ''title'', ''author'', ''date'' etc. 
** See PracticalRdf for some examples of this, also the DcDotExample (below). 
* This analysis is in line with material in the ExplorersGuide (to the semantic web), which says (p.39) 
** ''DublinCore can be expressed in several different ways of which RDF is one.'' 
* See also the SemanticWebLayerCake.

DcDot (http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcdot/) provides an online program to extract information from an existing web page and put into the DublinCore categories.

DcDotExample shows this applied to a (short) page from this wiki.
