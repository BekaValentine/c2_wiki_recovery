Xen or X# is a new .NET language coming out of Microsoft and  University of Cambridge, and can be summed up as CsharpLanguage with the ability to embed ExtensibleMarkupLanguage & relational data directly, using SemanticSubtyping. This provides for some type safety and ease of use. [see http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1491790,00.asp]

Has now been merged with PolyphonicCeeSharp and renamed Cw [CeeOmega].

Not to be confused with XenVirtualMachineMonitor.
