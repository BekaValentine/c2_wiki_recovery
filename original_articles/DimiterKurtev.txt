DimiterKurtev has been using emacs for over 15 years.  He still doesn't get it.

He speaks fluent Smalltalk, C, C++ and Java. He has also been known to code PL/I, amongst others.

Dimiter is currently having difficulty convincing his colleagues to use a Wiki.  He has hacked AwkiAwki quite a bit.  He started off with the BruceHenderson''''''s version from http://81.86.193.194/cgi-bin/awki.cgi/CurrentDevelopment as of beginning of February 2003.  His changes include:
	* no need for tabs for creating lists (MSIE6 can't do tabs in forms)
	* # instead of 1 for numbered lists
	* list levels are defined by the number of *s or #s
	* possibility to name external links, syntax is [WikiName]url
	* bold text is declared with underscores, i.e. __this is bold__
	* checksum checks of edited text to avoid concurrent editing
	* WikiName''''''s are only links when in square brackets [] - very useful if trying to document code which uses a lot of CamelCase
	* number of rows in the form is configurable
	* edit form uses the whole width of the browser
	* possibility to edit previous versions (i think this is possible in OliverTonnhofer''''''s code, but not in BruceHenderson''''''s version)
	* ability to delete pages by changing the text to "delete" - does not delete the file in RCS (i.e. old revisions remain in the archive and may be resurrected by an admin)
	* changes the RCS checkin user to the logged-in user on windows machines (by using nmblookup) - this info is also displayed on the info page

He has also written a simple script to generate a site map for TouchGraph on-the-fly (the output gets cached as well).

'''AwkiAwki rocks!'''
