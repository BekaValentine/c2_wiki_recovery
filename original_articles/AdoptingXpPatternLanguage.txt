Patterns for groups TransitioningToExtremeProgramming. You've bought into the concept of ExtremeProgramming. You know what all the main practices are (if not, go to ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices), but you're having trouble getting your organization to adopt certain of the practices, or you're just not sure where to start in the first place. This page is for you.

This page lists patterns and ProtoPattern''''''s for AdoptingXp. It does not list patterns for adopting practices that are AlmostExtremeProgramming, although these may or may not be worthwhile practices (e.g. CustomerShadowing).
