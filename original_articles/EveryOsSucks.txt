From the song of the same title by ThreeDeadTrollsInaBaggie:

 ''Every OS wastes your time''
 ''from the desktop to the lap,''
 ''everything since the abacus ''
 ''is just a bunch of crap!''
 ''From MicroSoft to Macintosh''
 ''to Lin-Line-Lin-Line-ux''
 ''every computer crashes''
 '''cause every OS sucks.''
