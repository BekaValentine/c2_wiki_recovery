I'm excited by these kinds of ideas:
* DoItYourself, rather than DoItWithOthers -- I'm happy to work with others, but programming is a fad culture.  On the other end, far from the fad culture, programming is an alien culture:  I speak with deep thinking programmers, and I find an extraordinary diversity, not any kind of unity.  DIY seems to make more sense than DIWO, here.  I love to share ideas though.
* Exterminate the Complexity -- ChuckMoore's way of thinking excites me, and I've been imbibing it for a couple years now, to astonishing effect in my projects.  Eliminate the requirements, eliminate the abstractions, start thinking from machine codes and global spaces, if you can.  Get rid of objects, get rid of parameters, just get rid of everything.  Think about the very specific and narrowly defined objectives, and race towards them with a 100% design that has the fewest number of branches possible.  Eliminate, Eliminate, Eliminate.  Exterminate.
* Interesting Ways of Eliminating -- I find myself a collector of ways, small hacks, small techniques, that eliminate needs.  My ideal is now the Victrola player.  Have you seen one?  Beautiful record player.  Handsome.  Stores your records inside it.  Has a rich, warm sound.  Holds a social space in the room.  Loud!, a big tube speaker, that somehow doesn't require any volume adjustment.  And here's the most amazing thing:  It doesn't even require electricity.  Now, when I think about computer programs, I ask myself:  "Can I make this program run, without even using electricity?"  Obviously, 9 times out of 10, I can't.  But I find that it's a fruitful question to ask -- in so many ways.
* Information Visualization, Idea Communication, Powerful Interaction -- Minimialism doesn't mean, "Don't do anything."  There's lots worth doing, especially in the realms of visualization, communication, and interaction.  I have created a lot of programs stretching the boundaries here.  I'm still frustrated that we can't easily plug in two computers or two mice into one computer, and get workable results.

I've been around here on C2 for about a decade.  I post very infrequently.
