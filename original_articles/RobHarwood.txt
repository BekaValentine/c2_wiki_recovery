I'm a relatively long-time wiki contributor (since 1999), and quickly became a RecentChangesJunkie. I used to sign most/all of my contributions, but have since decided to stay mostly anonymous. I like to remain a humble WikiGnome. I've learned a heck of a lot from Wiki; thanks, Ward.

My austere homepage is at http://www.rapid-programming.com/. Email rharwood at (make a wild guess based on the website, and you've probably got it).

If you'd like to learn more about WikiWiki, go to NewUserPages (which I helped write).

I'm a software engineer, currently in Toronto, currently working with Java. I'm a big fan of ExtremeProgramming, ScrumProcess, IntellijIdea, JavaUnit, and ReFactoring. I've signed the AgileManifesto (see the website and you can sign too).

When JavaUnit first came out I wasn't yet working in Java, so I translated JavaUnit into VbaUnit and LingoUnit.

I recently visited Prague, which is a beautiful city.

I follow a PhilosophyOfPragmatism based on the ScientificMethod and OccamsRazor. I've always been fascinated by EvolutionByNaturalSelection and GeneticAlgorithm''''''s. I coined the term NaturalSearch to help focus my thoughts on this subject.

I like reading books on software development. The ones that had the most influence on my understanding of software development are (in order):
	1. RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode by MartinFowler
	1. AgileSoftwareDevelopmentEcosystems by JimHighsmith
	1. ExtremeProgrammingExplained by KentBeck
	1. ScrumBook by KenSchwaber and MikeBeedle
	1. DesignPatterns by the GangOfFour
Other software development books I would recommend are (not in order, and not complete):
	1. CodeComplete by SteveMcConnell
	1. AnalysisPatterns
	1. UmlDistilled
	1. SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns
	1. TheMythicalManMonth
	1. ThePragmaticProgrammer by AndrewHunt and DavidThomas
The following books have a common thread, and seem to predict the coming of the AgileRevolution.
	1. TheStructureOfScientificRevolutions by ThomasKuhn
	1. CrossingTheChasm and InsideTheTornado by GeoffreyMoore
	1. The InnovatorsDilemma by ClaytonChristensen

Thanks for keeping a copy of the WikiGnomePoem, I've been watching and restoring the page myself too. Note that the original author wanted his name removed though. -- JohannesGijsbers

Wasn't aware of that.
