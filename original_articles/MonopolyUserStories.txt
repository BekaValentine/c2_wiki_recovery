Players get can get out of jail by throwing doubles on any of the next three turns, using the "Get out of Jail Free" card if they have it, purchasing the "Get out of Jail Free" card from another player, or paying the $50 fine on either of the next 2 turns. If, on the third turn, the player doesn't roll doubles, she pays the $50 fine and moves forward the number of spaces rolled.

''I have a question for the customer: User Story #11 says something about drawing a "Go to Jail" card ... What do you want us to do if Story #11 is scheduled before Story #19? Should we Split out some of Story 11 into its own Story #20?''

I don't know if these stories were arranged with dependencies in mind. It seems that the "Go to Jail" story #11 cannot function without the concept of a card pile in story #20. The developer player would most likely have to move #20 into pile 1 and #11 into pile 2 -or- ask for a split, as you propose, if both are planned for the same iteration --MichaelLeach
