I am just starting to find my way around on the WikiWikiWeb. It seems like a very nice place to hang out and observe people.

I enjoy playing the FrenchHorn (which really isn't French) and many outdoor activities.
:) The FrenchHorn makes cool music. One of this days I'm going to make a site on FrenchHorn''''''s; till then I will stick to my nature site http://www.cat1234.com/.
