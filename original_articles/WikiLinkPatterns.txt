CamelCase is the classical LinkPattern for Wikis, which still has lovers (e.g. as the author of this page) due to its simplicity.

What about other regular patterns?

WikiWord

 There are four options for the  UserScript s WikiFy  to realize a
 WikiWord, also called WikiLink  in Debategraph.

* C_Link  (takes CamelCase  as favored by SmallTalkers  and WardCunningham ° the inventor of Wikis)

* D_Link  (takes double brackets as favored by Wikipedians)

* U_Link  (takes underscores which are favored by C, C++ people)

* M-Link  (takes "-" instead of "_ ", as preferred by Lisp-people ° )

See more on this in http://debategraph.org/WikiWord . Let's WikiFy.  

I wrote the UserScript with incorporating a second link, marked by a circle, to point to a GoogleSearch for the linked WikiWord.
