UncategorizedPages created today - suggested by ChrisGarrod 20141123 at PleaseStopWithTheCategoryNone - listed groups of pages A-Z (total 15695) and added Opinion Survey section to determine how much real interest exist in making the lists. 
* 20141128 - Opinions to date: four, none preferring the creation of the lists.
* 20141201 - Not much activity going on the past few days with the holidays in the US. Some activity seems centered on editing conflicts. Expect activity to increase for the next couple of weeks and then enter a inactive period between the Christmas and New Years holidays.
