My interests are sort of being compiled/collected on my del.icio.us pages and on stumbleupon. Otherwise, theres an almost functioning weblog at http://blog.jaysenn.com. and a public wiki at http://jaysen.wikispaces.com/

Currently working as a software developer for a small company in Johannesburg, South Africa. I prefer working in Python, C# and Java.

'''Current Projects'''

Leave a note here if you want to say something to me...

Jaysen, have you had more progress in a PocketPc version of OpenSource FreeSoftware PersonalWiki that is better than WikidPad? Please respond in WikiOnPda page if you have more info. -- David 20Apr05

Not yet, unfortunately. WikidPad is OpenSource now tho... so maybe it's time to start trying bits of wiki Python code on PythonCE -- JN
-- i'm not really looking for anything quite as feature rich (or as good:) as wikidpad. --JN
