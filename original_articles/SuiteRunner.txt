"Artima SuiteRunner is a free open source testing toolkit for Java released under the Open Software License. You can use this tool with JUnit to run existing JUnit test suites, or standalone to create unit and conformance tests for Java APIs. The three main advantages Artima SuiteRunner offers to JUnit users are reporters, runpaths, and recipe files. Existing JUnit users can use SuiteRunner to run their JUnit tests, which allows them to gain the benefits of reporters, runpaths, and recipe files while continuing to use their JUnit test cases." - http://www.artima.com/suiterunner/
