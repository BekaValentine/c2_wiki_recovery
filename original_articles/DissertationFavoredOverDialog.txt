	 :	''I occasionally suggest how this site should be used. My GoodStyle suggestions have been here since the beginning and are linked from the edit page should anyone forget. I have done my best to discourage dialog in favor of dissertation which offers a better fit to this medium. I've been overruled. I have always and will continue to make small edits to any page for the sake of brevity, clarity or decorum. I encourage others to do likewise. -- WardCunningham.''

As it turns out, that hasn't occurred for many years.

'''Discussion:'''

''How can we support this style recommendation of Ward for WardsWiki?''

See WikiAuthor.

If MrPlato lived today, he might be the first one to create a state-of-the-art dissertation based on an online dialogue, or better, multilogue. -- FridemarPache

Note that Plato's Dialogues were authored and were not ad hoc discussions or debates, i.e. dialogue was used as a literary and philosophical device. Some are more like screenplays and soliloquies.

''What is an example of a dialog vs. a dissertation?''

This page is an example of a dialog.  How would you turn it into a dissertation form that still works?  I don't know. 

''Are dialectic and dialogue the same thing?''

''Can a Wiki dialogue be a transient state on the way to a collaborative Wiki dissertation? (transient implies the initial dialogue ''not dialectic'' disappears)''

''It's not a Platonian Dialogue yet. Let's get inspired by him. -- fp''

One reason that we don't see dissertations on a WikiForum yet has an economical background, that can be verified on http://www.dissertation.com/. But that doesn't exclude that on a special purpose EcommerceWiki such a dream can be realized, even in combination with ongoing dialogs. -- fp
