In the process of collecting artifacts, it is noted that there are occasions when a process which extends their usefulness might be employed. One such process is call WikiBatics. 
----
It originated in a desire to collect time sampled collections (snapshots) of a number of related pages as data, first within a collection of RecentChanges pages separated as a collection per day. This includes a single days worth (daily list) of pages as found in RecentChanges (collection list) as well as the individual pages as of that day within a portable format document (pdf).

We need examples, one wikizen said to me several years ago
* so here it can be found: WikiBatics

It is but one possible use of an ArtifactoryProcess. 

Others (let your imagination roam) exist which operate in other ways on collections. 
* this processing leaves the original to reflect subsequent changes and to develop independently of the time sampled collection

One might use the wooden-language word "ArtifactoryProcess" to classify WikiBatics
