AppleComputer's first GraphicalUserInterface machine, released in 1983 as the culmination of a project started in 1978 to make a GUI machine. SteveJobs worked on the project but was kicked out, only to join the AppleMacintosh project instead. The machine was a commercial failure, and in 1989, Apple buried about 2,700 unsold Lisas at a landfill in Utah.
