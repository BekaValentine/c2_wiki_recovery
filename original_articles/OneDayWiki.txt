* What exactly it is?

Been here a little while?
* Create your own page (e.g., CaseyHelbling)
* Set up a UserName that will then show up in RecentChanges
* Vote on your favorite tip page on the TipsForBeginners page
* Correct a typo, improve some layout, do your first housekeeping
* Look for a discussion that interests you, participate
* Ask your first question, answer a question
* Welcome a newcomer, offer your help
* Make some coffee
* Hmmm.
