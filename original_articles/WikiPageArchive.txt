A place to save WikiPage''''''s in order to protect them from vandals, terrorists, and overzealous VolunteerHousekeeper''''''s.

Every once in awhile someone gets it in their head to make drastic edits to a page -- such as replacing its entire contents with a witty one line joke. Some pages are more vulnerable to this than others through being both valuable and controversial. If you value such a page you may choose to place it in a WikiPageArchive so that you can replace it or view it privately in the event that it becomes damaged or destroyed.

Here's how to do it:

Create a directory on your local machine to hold the archive. Click EditText on any page that you wish to archive. Select everything within the edit window, copy it, and paste it into a text document that carries the same name as the page that you are saving. Finally, save the text document in the directory that you created. 

Restoring from a WikiPageArchive can be difficult because there may be new material on the page that you want to preserve. If you have access to a three way file merging tool that is probably the easiest route to go. If not, having three open windows in a normal text editor can help to ease the pain of merging the new with the old to produce an effective composite.
