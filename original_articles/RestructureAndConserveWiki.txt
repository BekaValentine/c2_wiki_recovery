Let me conserve the original formulation of an opinion, found in PushWikisEdges and modify this marked text by a slightly different opinion:

 In my opinion, this wiki should respect continuity and change. Adding new  
 structure, content, doing garbage collection and restructuring is typical
 for all EvolvingSystem''''''s.

Just like all things natural, if you're ''trying'' to be natural, you're not. Trying implies some sort of artifice. People on Wiki (myself included, obviously) talk about Wiki a lot because it's interesting, but then you lose focus. What's more important? Wiki or the content therein? Content, content, content. The structure comes from making the content more approachable and extensible in the natural flow of the discussion. "There is no try. Only do." -- Yoda

Thanks to your message, I deleted the 'try' in my formulation and pointed to more interesting content :fp
