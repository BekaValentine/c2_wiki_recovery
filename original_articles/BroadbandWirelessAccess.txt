BroadbandWirelessAccess (BWA) is the NextBigThing in MobileCommerce. 

Unlike WiFi which is not scalable, this technology is designed for high throughput over long distances.

There are two prominent protocols emerging, both based on IEEE 802.16 standardization efforts. See http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/16/.

The technology is a radio wave based point to multipoints system. 

''BroadbandWirelessAccess (BWA) has become the best way to meet escalating business demand for rapid Internet connection and integrated data, voice and video services. BWA can extend fiber optic networks and provide more capacity than cable networks or digital subscriber lines (DSL). One of the most compelling aspects of BWA technology is that networks can be created in just weeks by deploying a small number of base stations on buildings or poles to create high-capacity wireless access systems.'' (from http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/16/pub/backgrounder.html)

The more "mature" protocol is American Intel's WiMax, "Rosedale" support chipset in production early 2005, and has connectivity up to 75MB/sec.

''Mobile WiMax is the real game''

The IEEE802.16e mobility enhancement spec on IEEE802.16 support connection at vehicular speed of up to 93mph. It also provides means for a fixed IP (IPV4 and/or IPV6) even though the terminal device  change connection location.

The challenger is the mobile Korean Wi''''''Bro scheme from Sam''''''Sung, which grabbed headlines in late 2004 and is being supported by the government.
* Is there an EU branded BWA offering of significance?

The potential rift is being addressed, and it is one of the bilateral trade talk items between the respective countries. There are efforts to bridge the two mechanisms through work at the Korean company of LG.

'''News and Developments'''

Aug05 QualcommInc, of CodeDivisionMultipleAccess fame, has acquired a company that allow it to develop and market a BWA product that preempts WiMax. It is not going to be WiMax compatible. See http://www.itworldcanada.com/a/News/fc43f725-7a87-492a-a9bc-2ad22a2a24dd.html

'''Next wave already in the works MobileFI '''

A followup technology being developed is IEEE 802.20 based Mobile''''''BroadbandWirelessAccess, but it is not compatible with IEEE 802.16. Whereas the former operates in the 2-11Ghz range, the 802.20 spec operates in the licensed band below 3.5GHz. The 802.20 spec supports speeds of 155 mph.
