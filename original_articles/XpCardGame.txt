Playing Industrial Logic's XP card game at a SF BayAreaXpUsersGroup meeting was a very good
experience. It helped break the ice and it was the source of a lot of really
good XP discussion. It's more of a conversation facilitator than a game. The
rules are a bit tricky/different, so I'd suggest that someone tries it out at
home first alone.

You can download it for free or buy it for about $40 from
http://www.industriallogic.com/games/eppc.html .

Anyone else have any experience with this game?  How does it compare
to the BalloonGame?
