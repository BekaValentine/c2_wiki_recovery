'''Standard Features of a Wiki'''

There is a core set of features that I think all wikis have.  

This is not the same as a core set of features that characterize a wiki -- see Wiki<something>, this is just the core set that I found in the wikis I have tried so far.  (Based on some comments (deletions) that I think SunirShah made, some people would consider only the first three of these as features that characterize a wiki.)

These will be mentioned in a review only by exception:

	* Wiki pages can be created or edited by a significant portion of the user audience (often the entire audience).
	* Typing a WikiName on a page creates an automatic hypertext link to the wiki page with that name.
	* Most pages are named with a distinctive WikiName that is typically several capitalized words "scrunched" together (like WikiName).
	* There is a means to list all the wiki pages.
	* There is a list of the wiki pages which have recently been changed (RecentChanges)
	* There is a  means to find all the pages that link to a wiki page (so you can backtrack).
	* There is a simple text formatting language that is not HTML or any other standard markup language.  It is designed to be easy to use and readable in spite of the markups.
