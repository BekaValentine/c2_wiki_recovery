Before the IBM PC, 8-bit computers were called microcomputers. After the introduction of the IBM PC, the term fell into disuse. '''No it didn't. -- JasonGrossman'''

The term applies to any computer that doesn't take up a whole room. 

''Really? I thought it was pretty well limited to all computers built around a CPU that is implemented using MicroProcessors, usually no more than two (a main CPU and a floating-point coprocessor). Recall that the PdpEight, always held up as an example in these discussions, could fit on a desktop, although extras like DiskDrives and RAM (I think) were separate components and a whole kit might do a good job of filling a small room.''

This was an unusual thing when the first microcomputers, the AltairComputer, ImsaiComputer, and Apple's AppleOne and AppleTwo were sold.

The Commodore 64 (CommodoreSixtyFour) was the best selling microcomputer, with over 6 million sold in the US and twice that worldwide.

Other computers of that era include the AtariComputer, the RadioShack TrashEighty (TRS-80), the low-end CommodoreVicTwenty, and the even lower-end SinclairZxEightyOne.

Once computers like the IBM PeeCee, the AmigaComputer, and the AppleMacintosh came out, people started calling them HomeComputer''''''s and PersonalComputer''''''s.
