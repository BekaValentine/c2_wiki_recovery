A good plan requires clearly defined network dependencies.  These dependencies need to be determined by their LogicalNecessity and not by the whim of the program manager.  Failure to properly network a plan leads to serious planning errors which create more than the minimum necessary delay.  LogisticDelay is the most common result, also SerialSequencing when the tasks could be executed in parallel with good planning is an example of LogisticDelay.
