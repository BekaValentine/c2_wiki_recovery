A painting package, funnily enough. It really does paint, though, as oppose to simply laying down flat areas of colour: It models the interaction of various kinds of ink, paint, chalk and such with assorted papers of varying grains and other properties. In combination with a pressure-sensitive pen pad, it's actually rather amazing. Plus it comes in a large round metal paint can. Which is nice.
