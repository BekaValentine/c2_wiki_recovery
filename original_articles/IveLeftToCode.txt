IveLeftToCode is when one decides that a lot of yapping is occurring but not much coding.

Time to put your code where your mouth is. take a break from talking.. for a few days, hours, or even months, years.. and write some code. 

Talk is cheap.

''Gone?  But this person was hilarious.  When he was talking in QompItself about how he didn't want to do QoMp, The long-standing page UgLy was pointed out to discuss that very topic, but he took it personally and created the UgLyPeople page.  That's epic lulz amirite?  Incidentally, I code most of the day and wiki to take breaks from it.''
* Hey I didn't take insult to it. In fact I thought the UgLy page was hilarious and created a sister page that was equally or lesser hilarious.. As for being gone.. I take long breaks to code.. but this person is never "gone gone".  Code and articles live on for at least 100 years past death anyway.
