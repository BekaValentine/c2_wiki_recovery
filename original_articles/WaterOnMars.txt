NASA announces that the Opportunity rover has found clear evidence that there was once liquid water on Mars. Since this is basically what the entire mission was about it's the ideal science result.

Now this contentious issue has finally been resolved. 

''Of course there is water on mars.  Otherwise, how would the StarBucks that the rover found make its coffee?''

From SlashDot:

''If these rocks are sedimentary, then, as Squyres said, that has to be our main target for a sample return mission. Because sedimentary rocks are going to have fossils.''

if there was life to swim in those seas.

''Very true. If there was life in this 'ocean', then it's very likely fossils are in sedimentary rocks in that region. If there are no fossils? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but it'll be a really curious coincidence.''

sedimentary rocks are going to have fossils. ... and fossils means fuel, which in turn means they must have WMDs!
