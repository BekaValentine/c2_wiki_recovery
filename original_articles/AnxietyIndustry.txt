What a great name!  Wish I'd thought of it!

In a world where "news" is whatever will rivet the attention, the more anxiety you can generate, the more people will watch/listen, hoping there will be some kind of resolution ... which never comes.

And, in the time-honored tradition of the SoapOpera, you ''don't ever end the story'', you just fade into the next Anxiety Scenario.

This is the vehicle for "terrorism" -- without the cooperation of a media desperate for ratings it couldn't work.  Terrorism is really anxiety-ism.  Keep people anxious, worried, looking over their shoulders.  Sure, there's a moment of terror for the luckless up-close witnesses to the explosion, but the ''real'' payoff is the persistent anxiety that follows.  With a little help from media and government, you can parlay this into compromised liberties and a whole host of DegenerativeFeedback situations, progressively crippling the object of your "terror" tactics.

Fabulous.  Without mass media, especially TV, you couldn't scare whole populations at once.  "Stay tuned, we have a News Alert for you, after these important messages!"

Episode 5 the US MaxHeadroom series (titled "War") showed a TV network cut out the middle-man and started hiring terrorists directly.  They got exclusive footage of bombings and such.  Very funny stuff. -- EH
