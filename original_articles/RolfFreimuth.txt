I am new to Wiki but what I have seen so far is very intriguing.

I am a software developer and I am looking for a good WikiWikiClone to use as a ProjectWiki.  I think my group could really benefit from our own Wiki.  I am also interested in using Wiki to keep my own notes on my project.

I primarily develop with Microsoft ASP so I tried AspWiki.  I was impressed with how easily I got it going, but I think it is missing features.  It looks like it does not do the question mark next to a WikiName that has no document.  Instead, it creates a document for each WikiName when the document is saved.  Ugh.

I am keen on the PythonLanguage so I am also looking into PikiPiki and MoinMoin.
