Some time ago I read in a IT marketing magazine, that there are ca. 1.3 million highly qualified Indian programmers.

I guess that quite a lot of them know or '''practise Yoga'''. From the Patanjali aphorisms and other sources I know that the Yoga adepts are admonished not to share their knowledge with third parties.

As the Yoga literature is freely available now, I see no reason to hide these experiences.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able '''mentally to'''
	* '''edit whole pages''' and rush them in the computer in one flow, or 
	* '''simulate/debug routines'''?

''It is said, that the composer '''W.A.Mozart generated whole music pieces mentally''' on a walk and put them down mechanically afterwards.''

While browsing the Web I came across a homepage, where the concept of
'''CyberYoga''' is developed. This Yoga is a challenging '''synthesis of classical Yoga, Autogenous Training and Computer Science'''. I just drop the German author an email with a link to this page. Perhaps he might be interested to present some of his ideas.

The exact opposite of ExtremeProgramming. XP is about doing, not imagining. XP is about sensing the ''real'' program, not dreaming about an imaginary one. For me, it's what a man ''does'' with his head that counts.  --RonJeffries

A good imagination goes well together with 'doing'. -- fp

The operative word being ''together'', perhaps.
