''Dilbert's Salary Theorem'' states that '''Engineers and scientists can never earn as much as business executives and sales people.'''

This theorem can now be supported by proof based on the following two postulates:

	* Postulate 1: '''Knowledge is Power.'''
	* Postulate 2: '''Time is Money.'''

As every engineer knows: Power = Work / Time.

Since Knowledge = Power, then Knowledge = Work/Time.

Since Time = Money, then Knowledge = Work/Money.

Solving for Money, we get Money = Work / Knowledge.

Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity,
regardless of the amount of work done.

Conclusion: ... left to the reader.
