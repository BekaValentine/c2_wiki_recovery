 For RFC see: http://deesse.univ-lemans.fr:8003/Connected/RFC/1122/71.html

[Just by the way, this should more properly be titled, N''''''etworkTransportProtocols, since it deals specifically with IP network protocols. There are lots of transports for data that aren't network specific, like XML, SOAP, etc.

Perhaps this page can be left as is for a while, then moved over to N''''''etworkTransportProtocols with a forwarding note?]
