Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898), an obscure Oxford mathematician. Author of "Symbolic Logic", "Memoria Technica", "The condensation (factoring) of determinants" and "A discussion of the various methods of procedure in conducting elections".

Oh, and a couple of strange books for children called "AlicesAdventuresInWonderland" and "ThroughTheLookingGlass, and what Alice found there", which for some reason have outlasted his mathematical works. They're certainly more amusing.

One or the other of these two personalities also had a deep fondness for both hashish and very young pouty girls. Hardly the kind of thing you could base a Disney movie on...

Dodgson was also a talented, and progressive, photographer (often of those self-same pouty girls, and especially AliceLiddell); see http://www.lewiscarroll.org/photo.html.
