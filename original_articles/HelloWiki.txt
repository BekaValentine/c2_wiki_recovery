This is a simple spin-off from the HelloWorld and AddingNewPages page. When I first arrived at WikiWeb, I was excited by the ability to write directly onto a web page that is not owned by me. That is really cool and I am amazed by the wonderful things that go on here!  

Back to the HelloWorld thingy. To create a WikiWeb equivalent of HelloWorld, simply write the text MyNewPageTitle using capitalized words without spaces on any page. After saving the changes and reloading the same page, you will see MyNewPageTitle followed by a ? (question mark) which is also a hyperlink. Click on the question mark and Wiki will pop up a page for you to define the contents of MyNewPageTitle.

To wrap things up, if you put a capitalized multi-word without spaces that is also a WikiWeb page name, for example HelloWorld, you have added a link to the page titled HelloWorld.

Hope all this helps :) & comments are always welcomed.

On a slightly different note, I've noticed a tendency amongst, er, ok a tendency of mine to want to write a Wiki server in new tools/languages that I come across. I think of this as "HelloWiki". For example, I'm doing a mini Wiki in an EJB environment right now. Overkill, I know - but it's just for the purposes of learning the tool/language, just like HelloWorld exists as a first, most basic step.

In most tools or languages, a simple Wiki server is likely to expose you to some sort of disk or database storage, a bit of networking maybe, some string mangling, and generally give you a helpful first wander around the libraries and whathaveyou. And a simple Wiki is a nice bite-sized chunk of work that won't take you too long, and that you can safely throw away afterwards (or give to others) once you've found your feet.

Does anyone else HaveThisPattern? Do you think it's useful? ''-- RichardEmerson''

I'm beginning to HaveThisPattern. It used to be that the first program I wrote in any given language was a program to identify radars (basically a radar database). Since identifying radars isn't a problem I have now, I haven't done that for a few years. But I'm about to implement a Wiki as my first servlet project. I think having a problem to solve helps direct learning (and make it more enjoyable). ''-- JonStrayer''

I also HaveThisPattern. Writing a wiki is quite a good way to get used to a new language, IMO. -- RogerLipscombe

How to write a wiki server (and what you will learn) ...

	* write HelloWorld (development environment)
	* make it into cgi script (server environment)
	* read and display the HelloWorld page from a subdirectory (file i/o)
	* display any page in the subdirectory (http parameters)
	* translate ---- to <hr> (regular expressions)
	* translate \n\n to <br> (newline conventions)
	* add date of last edit to page (file modification date)
	* add edit button (or link) to page (form creation)
	* add save button to edit page ('post' handling)
	* translate WikiNames to <a> tags (file exists)
	* add search field to page (directory scanning)
	* add changes page (sorting)

''Good howto to write a wiki. I also HaveThisPattern, and every time I try to find out better ways to get the final result, faster and more reliably, but your decomposition is much more didactical than mine, thanks for the tip! -- DavidDeLis''
