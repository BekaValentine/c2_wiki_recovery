I found this poetry in WikiWikiSandbox after somebody "munched" it and thought it might live for a while.

	Putting in my $.02 on this cold December Day
	Getting $1.00 out in a most unusual way.
	Should be working but would rather play,
	Dear layoff, don't touch me I pray.

	Where have I come from?
	Where did I go?
	What have I done wrong this time?
	Ahhh, who cares.

	Yesterday upon the stair
	I saw a man who wasn't there
	He wasn't there again today
	How I wish he'd go away!

        I came in
           for a visit
              and       a         smoke
        and left
         with
           contrails behind
        spinning blue
           and fading
          white.

        I am thinking a thought about thinking
        In thinking a thought about thinking
        I thought I ought think
        Not a think nor a thought
        But think naught
        About thinking a thought about thinking.

  i took her for curry my speech was a little slurry
  and they fried the lil fellow!

 the narrative thread, or whatever
 moves back and forth
 the soft shiny pink manufacured string
 is folding, weaving, gaining momentum
 turning into a superball
 bouncing between expectations
 investing in a culture of forgetting

 The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
 Went envying her and me:--
 Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,
 In this kingdom by the sea)
 That the wind came out of a cloud, chilling
 And killing my Annabel Lee.

 But our love it was stronger by far than the love
 Of those who were older than we--
 Of many far wiser than we-
 And neither the angels in Heaven above,
 Nor the demons down under the sea,
 Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
 Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:--

 For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
 Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
 And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
 Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
 And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
 Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
 In her sepulchre there by the sea--
 In her tomb by the side of the sea. 

 In her tomb by the side of the sea.

 Stupid thought!

 There was a young man with a hernia
 Who said to his doctor: "Gol-dern ya'
   When you're carving my middle
   Be sure you don't fiddle
 With matters that do not concern ya'."

 Try, try, why not try.
 My fingers fly, fly,
 Low to the key board
 High to the sky.
