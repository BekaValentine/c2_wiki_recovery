TotalText is an application for storing documents, calendars and other information. See http://mtirnanic.googlepages.com/ (dead link as of 2014-20-03)

It is somewhat similar to KeyNote with inferior tree editing.

It does have a preconfigured calendar and a useful facility for storing sourcecode from a variety of languages which can be exported to html very easily.
