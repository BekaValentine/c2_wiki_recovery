	 :	'''There can be only one!'''

A great movie (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0091203). 

There were two sequels, which are MoviesToAvoidAtAllCosts: "Highlander II: The Quickening" (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0102034) and "Highlander III: The Sorcerer" (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0110027). There's even a DirectorsCut of "Highlander 2". Some people should know not to push their luck.  ''The producers of these two sequels failed to observe the HighlanderPrinciple''

There is also a TV series and another movie which brings the series together with previous movies: "Highlander: Endgame" (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0144964)

I heard "Highlander 2" is awful before I watched it; it was even worse. I didn't dare to watch "Highlander 3" yet. --MarkoSchulz

The director's cut of the first movie makes a lot more sense then the general release.  I attended a convention where one of the producers of the TV series was commenting on their "gothic action-adventure Talmudic discussion".  I thought that was a great summary of the show! -- ChrisBaugh
