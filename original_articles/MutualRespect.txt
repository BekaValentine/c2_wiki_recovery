	* Don't call others names

	* Don't accuse others of ill-conceived plans or motivations

	* Don't delete other's content except to clean out name-calling or to move off-topic content to another spot (unless not computer-related, then deletion is okay).

	* Don't accuse one of "you keep doing/saying X" without providing at least 3 specific instances.

	* Not liking somebody is no reason to ignore these rules toward them. Be nice to even Hitler, at least on this Wiki. 

	* Don't use Wiki as a revenge or punishment tool.

	* Apologize if you slip rather than just ignore it.

	* Complain about specific content, not the personality(s) behind it.
