WitoldRybczynski is an architectural critic (the final step in the career path for some architects), an excellent writer who has produced popular books such as Home: A ShortHistoryOfAnIdea, TheMostBeautifulHouseInTheWorld, and LookingAround. Several (maybe all) of these have made the New York Times bestsellers list.

Rybczynski is a second cousin of JanNorton, a department head at BellLabs, who works in the software architecture area and has occasion to bump into JimCoplien now and then.
