A device designed to prohibit unauthorized access to a network or machine via the network connection.  This device acts as a gateway between the unprotected network and the protected machine or network.

There is also a concept of a Personal FireWall, which is program that monitors the network usage on a machine.  While this cannot provide the same level of security as a separate FireWall appliance, it may be sufficient for the typical home user.
