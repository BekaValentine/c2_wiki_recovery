HumanResources departments often have clauses about number of years of experience with certain technology.

These clauses are sometimes added for everything needed for a particular job search or independent contract opportunity without considering how long a technology has actually been available.

The result is somewhat humorous, but can be annoying when stated as the reason for not being considered for an interview.

This might go something like:

		HR::	"We're sorry, you need to have 5 years of experience with WhizBangTechnology."

		Candidate::	"But, WhizBangTechnology has only been out for 2 years."

		HR::	"Sorry, but that's our policy. Please feel free to resubmit your resume in a few years."

		Candidate::	"No thanks, you guys are clueless."
