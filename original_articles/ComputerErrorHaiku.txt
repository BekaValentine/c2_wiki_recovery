THE ZEN OF COMPUTERS, THE ART OF ERROR--

In Japan, they have replaced the impersonal and unhelpful Microsoft Error
messages with Haiku poetry messages. Haiku poetry has strict construction
rules. Each poem has only three lines, 17 syllables: five syllables in the
first line, seven in the second, five in the third.

Haiku is used to communicate a timeless message, often achieving a wistful,
yearning and powerful insight through extreme brevity -- the essence of Zen.

''All but one of these are submissions for the Salon contest, but whoever put them here didn't put the author's names. BTW if someone knows the last haiku's author please fill it in.''
