You know a lie is being told when you hear some (unsubstantiated) numbers.

These are numbers people just make up because they don't know the real numbers. Often there is no choice but to use such numbers, but when you hear them, understand that they represent uncertainty and risk.

''Dates are often the most realistic numbers provided, as there is often an underlying reason for the date.  It is usually "done" that is the variable and one must be willing to define (and redefine) done to meet the date.''

17 is the least random number. Really. Try it.

''Do you mean:''

Of all fractions, phi (or tau) is the least random: (sqrt(5)+1)/2. Next time you drop a frame onto the screen, instead of centering it vertically, move it up towards the top by this ratio:

 frame.setTop((screen.height-frame.height) * 381 / 1000);

  Of a world that doesn't care"
