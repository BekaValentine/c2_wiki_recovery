This exotic drink can only be found at Sun-nova Beach, an extremely exclusive speakeasy on Cygnus-5. Also available at the time of purchase is literature informing the customer of financing options, and a list of organizations that can help the customer rehabilitate afterwards. 

The recipe for the PanGalacticGargleBlaster has been passed down for years at the 'Beach from one bartender to the next. The legend goes something like: 

First pour in the juice of a bottle of the Ol' Janx Spirit, then add a measure of water from the Seas of Santraal V (Oh, that Santraal seawater! Oh, those Santraal fish!). Allow 3 cubes of Mantovin Mega-Gin to melt into the mixture (make sure it's properly iced, or the benzine will be lost!). Allow 2 1/2 liters of swamp gas to filter through, and, over the back of a spoon, float a measure of Algorian Mega-Mint, reminiscent of the Algor Regions... sweet, subtle and mystic. Finally, add the tooth of a Rakasta, watching it dissolve, spreading the red flames of the Second Sun deep into the heart of the concoction. Add an olive. Drink... but... veeerrrryyy carefully.....

It's from the first book/chapter 2/page 17.  It's pretty much the first half of the whole chapter which is maybe five pages long.

Specifically created by Zaphod to create the following effect:  When drunk, it feels exactly like having your brain slammed by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.
