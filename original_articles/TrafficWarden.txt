A TrafficWarden is someone who issues a ParkingTicket and walks away.

In the wiki context, I have named this as someone who contributes an anonymous disparaging comment about someone else's work and then does not engage in discussion about it. This person has made a judgement and there is no appeal.

I hope that within the WikiCommunity there can be a way to ask for a justification of the position taken, so that we can learn from each other. -- JohnFletcher
