As opposed to the SevenDeadlySins:
	1. faith (or trust),
	2. justice,
	3. prudence,
	4. hope,
	5. temperance (which means avoiding excess in all things, rather than the more recent meaning of abstinence from liquor),
	6. fortitude, and
	7. charity.

The seven deadly sins are hell and the seven virtues = heaven.

There is no one-to-one correspondence with the sins.

I leave it to the interested reader to fill in the appropriate castaways or Peanuts characters (though Linus gets my vote for hope). ''Should be Charlie Brown, since he's always hoping that they'll win the baseball game or that Lucy won't pull away the ball, making him land flat on his back.''
