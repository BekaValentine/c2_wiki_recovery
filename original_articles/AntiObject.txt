The notion of antiobjects is a computational metaphor useful to conceptualize and solve hard problems by swapping computational foreground and background. Similar to optical illusions based on potential confusion of background versus foreground perceptions, antiobjects are the inverse of what we perceive to be the computational objects.

I wonder... are database Delphi TTables the anti-objects of the typical ObjectRelationalMapping classes?

In Delphi there is a single TTable class and one instance (an object) of the TTable class is created for each database table, but in tradional ORMs like HiberNate, each table is mapped to a different class...

Or JDBC vs JPA... are this two different approaches examples of AntiObject images?
