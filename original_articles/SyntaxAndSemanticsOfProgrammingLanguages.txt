''Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages'', by Ken Slonneger and Barry Kurtz.  Another OnlineBook on programming language design; this one has lots of material on semantics, moreso than many other programming language texts.  Many semantic models are covered, including AxiomaticSemantics, DenotationalSemantics, OperationalSemantics, ActionSemantics, etc.
