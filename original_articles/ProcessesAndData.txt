Except for the very first thing, whatever that was, all things are the result of a process.

 Actions are processes.
 Things are data.
 Processes act on things.

Existence of any data implies that there has been a process which created it. The first thing created may have been a process but before the instant that the process became active, it existed as data. The process which created that data is a mystery.

This is why I like the simplistic view of this form as a contemplative view of all data processing programs -
  Result = Process(Data)
