Often MicrosoftWay is to build, modify and hopefully improve on what is there. Some examples of their advice taken from their articles are listed here.

* For Business Strategies MicrosoftWay advocate
** don't "BoilTheOcean" - allow architecture to flex and accommodate needs to harness investment requirements and opportunities. (same article above)
** ''"encourage" customers to buy new software by letting them sway in the breeze for a while when the older software needs fixing''. Reference at http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1771541,00.asp

* For PeopleManagement
** They must subscribe to BrainsAsaCheapCommodity theory, they are rounding up talents in mid 2004.  see http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1495527,00.asp
* Microsoft views on their primary business focus, compared to BigBlue
** ...A software company first, (compared) ...IBM first and foremost a consulting company...Our focus is how to provide more out-of-the-box solutions that don't require those consulting services....IBM is our single biggest competitor. See http://www.builderau.com.au/program/windows/print.htm?TYPE=story&AT=39129181-39024644t-20000994c
* For RelationshipManagement 
** Microsoft is expected to have a make-over, during their next round (Feb05) of meeting with DOJ on anti-trust matters. See http://www.cio-today.com/story.xhtml?story_title=Microsoft-s-Longhorn-OS-Faces-Scrutiny&story_id=30039
* On UtilityComputing
** In Nov05, months after RayOzzie joined MS, the firm is looking seriously into the BusinessModel of UtilityComputing via MicrosoftLive. An example of a "free service" can be seen at http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/PrintDoc/DD4E68940A7BB8A1CC2570C1000A49E1

See MiddleWare ("Battleground..." section) where MicrosoftWay is attempting to drill into the BigBlue money tree, and the response.

'''Comments on Microsoft's view of ServiceOrientedArchitecture'''

* Sep05 blog by an analyst who had Yankee Group / Aberdeen group experiences, after MS PDC 2005, at http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1879 made comments to these effects:
** MS focus on the term "ConnectedSystems" (and its lack of commitment to the general EnterpriseServiceBus and opting for WindowsCommunicationFoundation) actually meant the firm is tightening up available interfaces into the Windows platform and locking in customers
** MS clients with "deep commitments" will have to pay separately for enterprise wide SOA capabilities

* For ServiceOrientedArchitecture (SOA) discussions refer http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/srorientwp.asp
** SOA is the art of modeling .. business processes. Went on to say "Business ... processes are .. volatile, ... subject to the judgment and whims of the human actors ..."
*** My interpretation is that they are arguing for an adaptive (evolving architecture), whereas commonly people equate architecture with blueprint, and one does not generally change blueprint once construction starts. CommentsPlease
** Interoperability between services guided by the implementation of WS-* protocols
*** Sends WebServices implemented before DotNet 1.1 to scrapheap??
