The notion that only the winner succeeds, and all others (including the runner-up) are failures.

An attribute commonly attributed to Americans (AmericanCulturalAssumption).  In US politics (with a FirstPastThePost system, rather than ProportionalRepresentation), 'tis true.

A recent controverial Nike advert, aired during a recent Olympic Games (cannot remember which one) summed it up with the following slogan:  ''You don't win the silver.  You lose the gold.''

Another slogan: Second place is just the first loser.

In American business culture, one finds this as well, with the concept of being PassedOverForaPromotion.  If this happens to you (meaning that someone else got the promotion you are wanted); it is often considered a MAJOR slight and a stain on the resume (even if both candidates are qualified, and it is highly likely you will receive the NEXT promotion that comes around).  Persons who are PassedOverForaPromotion often feel the need to leave the company and try ClimbingTheCorporateLadder somewhere else.

In the UnitedStatesMilitary, being PassedOverForaPromotion usually ends your career.  (Note though, that "end your career" means end your opportunities for further advancement; if someone doesn't want to climb the ladder, they can remain at their current rank until retirement--or until they screw up).

Why is this criticism aimed specifically at Americans?  Second Place in the original Olympics didn't get you watered-down honors.  It got you exiled or killed.

''You mean Saddam's sons' athlete torture techniques were closer to the original than what most nations do now? Hmmm. They perhaps would have been better off if they marketed it as such. "Extreme sports the way it was meant by the ancient Greeks! Live at nine on the Kusey Broadcasting Network."''
