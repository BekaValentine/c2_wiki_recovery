There are to opposing ways to name the primary key of any table.

1) Use "ID" as primary key name and table + "_ID" as foreign keys

+ Is easier to use.

2) Use table+"_ID" both in primary keys and foreign keys

+ Is easier to find the field names in code.

3) Use only table name as primary key name

- I don't think this is a good idea!

Maybe two patterns NoTableNameInPrimaryKeyNamePattern and TableNameInPrimaryKeyNamePattern should be
added and discussed..
