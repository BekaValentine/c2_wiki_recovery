''...to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.''

Just some interesting (or not) facts:

I discovered the above quote in the salad days of my youth (spent in San Francisco and Santa Cruz).

I withdrew from my first programming class (Fortran) because I couldn't figure out how to take a requirements statement and turn it into one of those funny pictures with boxes and arrows. Eleven years later, I got my first software development job and now I've spent 25 years doin' this. Go figure.

I stumbled onto this new-fangled object-oriented technology in 1987, when WardCunningham invited me across the hall to see the ToothpasteGraphics Smalltalk demo. Hey, cool stuff! (I'm still a SmalltalkLanguage bigot - what do you mean you can't overload an operator in JavaLanguage?). My particular specialization has been OODBs.

I made my way to Boulder via Dallas, TX (TexasInstruments) and Long Island, NY (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). I was one of six people who moved from LI to Boulder with Genomica Corporation. We took a research project funded by NIH and DOE and turned it into a commercially successful product used to support the drug discovery process.

I am now at AnswerOn doing data mining. http://www.answeron.com

In my free time, I enjoy running and swimming, and doing fiber art.
