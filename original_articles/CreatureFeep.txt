A Spoonerism on FeatureCreep, CreatureFeep is also referred to as "Feeping Creaturism." 

See http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/feeping-creaturism.html

A creature feep, or generally a "feep", is the opposite of a "creature comfort".  It is something painful in your environment that could be ignored but isn't.  Examples include the small tinny noise coming from the headphones of the person working across the desk from you, which unaccountably prevents you from working at anywhere near top efficiency; or the occasional 'beep' coming from your own computer (Hence the term Beep Feep).
