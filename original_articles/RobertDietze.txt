Hi, I live in Dresden (Saxony, Germany) - http://www.dresden-tourist.de/eng/homepage.html .

Currently I am employed as consultant at Synspace (http://www.synspace.com). Our company offers SoftwareAssessments according to SPiCE (ISO15504), CMM and BOOTSTRAP methods. We also provide engineering support with RequirementsManagement, ConfigurationManagement, Testing and QualityManagement.

I studied computer science at Dresden University of Technology. Later I joined a local software company. There I worked as software developer and later team leader in a SW-project for the Saxon Government.
We mainly programmed client/server applications using Sybase PowerBuilder, VisualC++ and OracleDeveloper based on Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle RDBMS.

My primary professional interests cover:
	* SoftwareDevelopment (including AgileSoftwareDevelopment like XP, Crystal; Testing Issues)
	* SoftwareQuality (ISO9000, SPiCE, CMM)
	* AnalysisPatterns and DesignPatterns
	* Cryptography and Cryptanalysis
	* SoftwareReliabilty
	
My favorite spare time activities are:
	* fiction (CordwainerSmith - http://www.cordwainer-smith.com/, NeilGaiman, NealStephenson, TerryPratchett and other SF&Fantasy authors)
	* software literature (GunterDueck, AlistairCockburn, MartinFowler, JimHighsmith)
	* Roleplaying games (Dragonlance, Greyhawk, FengShui)
	* excessive Videogaming (mostly RPGs and TurnBasedStrategy) on lots of more or less old videoconsoles
	* playing with or getting convinced to play with our two big, nasty, yet unbelievable cuddly MaineCoonCats Desdemona and Diabolo (sic!)
