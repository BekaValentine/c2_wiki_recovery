... a set of well-meaning, qualified people
(WorkshopComprisesAuthors) have
gathered with an author to review a work such as
a pattern or pattern language.

'''*  *  *'''

'''A group of diverse people make progress only'''
'''clumsily unless there is some guidance, and'''
'''an authority who (even arbitrarily) decides'''
'''on the format, the duration of phases of the'''
'''workshop, etc.'''

'''Therefore:'''

'''Each session should be led by an experienced'''
'''moderator, who guides (not directs) the discussion.'''

The moderator is responsible to see that all runs smoothly.
Done well, moderation is a background task:  the
WritersWorkshop tradition alone is usually enough
to guide the main flow of the activities.

'''*  *  *'''

The moderator has many tasks and needs many skills.
There are many different moderation styles, including
ActiveListeningModeration, where the moderator affirms
(feeds back) everything that is said.  There are more
passive styles of moderation.

Some moderators will call on reticent participants
to speak;  most moderators are more hands-off.

Moderators teach the remaining patterns to the group
(by example and light turning) and guide their use,
subject to the moderator's style.
Depending on the setting, the moderator may be responsible
for securing copies of the work for the reviewers.
The moderator
initially welcomes the author and invites the author
to read a selection from the work.  The moderator then
thanks the author and invites him or her to become a
fly on the wall.  The moderator invites a volunteer
to summarize the pattern.
The moderator makes sure that no
negative criticism leaks into PositiveFeedbackFirst.
The moderator decides when the PositiveFeedback has
reached diminishing returns, and segues into
SuggestionsForImprovement.  The moderator brings that
session to a close, and welcomes the author back into
the inner circle, encouraging them to ask questions
of clarification.
The moderator leads the ThankTheAuthor ceremony,
and invites a ClearingThePalate speaker.

The moderator may also arrange for a scribe to help
the author record major discussion points.

There should be a separate PatternLanguage for
WorkshopSessionModeration.
