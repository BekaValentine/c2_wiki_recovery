The Charon WebBrowser provided to the InfernoDevelopers in release 2.3 from Lucent doesn't know how to break lines in the EditText window.  Scroll forever, it's all one paragraph.  I probably used it on 20000324 to mess up the RecentVisitors page.  There is no REVERT button in this browser.  Tabs go nowhere.  Return, ^M ^J et al. do nothing.  Just one long scrolling line. -- ChrisGarrod

The newest version of the browser, in release 3 of Inferno, behaves much better.  Get it yourself at http://www.vitanuova.com/

Release 4 came out 20060303, everything is much improved, I am using the Charon browser to edit this page.  I also use this browser to visit pages that I am not sure I can trust. -- ChrisGarrod
