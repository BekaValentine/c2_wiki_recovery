You've probably just come from a page marked with this tag. The tag would have been applied because sometimes a page is almost an OrphanPage, but not quite. This can be because it's referred to in lists of other pages - for example, suggestions of WikiPage''''''s that need ReFactor''''''ing - but not actually used in the context of ThreadMode or DocumentMode.

If you agree with the tagging of the page (be sure to check its BackLink''''''s first), you can complete the deletion by replacing the text ''D''''''eleteNoContextLinks'' with the text ''delete''. If not, you can restore it from the EditCopy. It's good form to leave a note explaining why you think it was worth keeping.

For more on deletion, see DeletionConventions.
