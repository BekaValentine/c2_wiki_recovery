I am John Dowd.  I am a relative newbie here, having only spent about 20 hours reading material at this site...but we have our own wiki at my workplace, a speech technology company, and I find it useful to make references to material here on all things wiki.  Thanks for the wonderful concept and wonderful website.  I've made a few suggestions here from time to time.  My company has a website--it is http://www.dictaphone.com  and I'm at that company of course, if you want to reach john.dowd at that location.  

First contribution I made was to point out that a topic seemed to be a TarBaby.  Was amazed to see that topic come to life and acquire some contributions and attain a little life of its own here...it was like a world that I could only have dreamed existed, was in fact quite real and thriving.  Thanks again for all of this.
