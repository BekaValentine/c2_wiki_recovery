The book also contains:
	* A chapter on going from requirements to patterns-driven design
	* A Chapter on Build-system and Junit testing strategies (contributed by RandyStafford)
	* A chapter on how to use JavaDataObjects with EJB as a best practice

This isn't so much a book of DesignPatterns as idioms and best practices. Much of the material is concerned with architectural principles and workarounds to bugs rather than describing patterns. The RuleOfThree isn't really adhered to, largely because it's hard to find examples of enterprise applications with available source code, which makes the entire book seem very theoretical. Fowler's PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture suffers from the same problem.
