I am R.R. Naraendira Kumar & go by Naraen.

I have been a software developer for the past 7 years.

In college I learned all my languages on UNIX systems.  But my first job was creating a GIS Win32 application.  Since then I have been a Windows developer.

Now - I think - I have reached a stage where, I have a faint whiff of the OS abstraction(s), sufficient to make me compare & contrast UNIX & Windows.

At present, I'm educating myself on XP & Scrum, thanks to my manager who believes in Scrum & has - I think - fostered an environment where we can experiment with it.
