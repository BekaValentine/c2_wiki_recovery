Discussion about unidentified BrokenLink''''''s

I am wondering if the task to IdentifyPagesWithUnidentifiedBrokenLinks is either feasible or worthwhile. There are about 36000 pages on this wiki and although not all will have links a lot will. The links will be going out of date at some unknown rate and I don't think there are many WikiGnome''''''s around these days to keep things uptodate.

Example: I have today edited both LowLevelVirtualMachine and CeeLanguageFamilyFrontEnd to provide information about a new release of the Clang compiler, which has a very active developers list. No-one else has edited those pages for several years, which can be seen by inspection of my edit today. I have identified that the new release uses a different compression technique (*.xz instead of *.gz). I have not traced any documentation for this in the release notes. I have been able to find out about it by searching and found what I needed on WikiPedia. I am now making some links here, but there is not very much on this topic.

Conclusion: The number of regular participants here does not include many interested in CeePlusPlus, although there were in the past. This is no longer a place where a lot of people are contributing and sharing ideas.

I am continuing to do what I can to keep things here up to date, but I am not sure if anyone else will follow me when I give up.

Broken links do not add content to Wiki pages; instead, they add noise. It is best to increase the s/n ratio of the C2 by removing broken links whenever they are encountered. If the good WikiGnome finds a newer reference or follows the original link to a place where the content has been relocated then the link can simply be updated. But plain broken links are no goodnik, comrade.

And let's not forget that Google knows everything. If a link stops working and the subject material is publicly visible anywhere on the web Google will find it. If the broken link points to a white paper or some other material that simply isn't available any more then there really is no point in even mentioning it, eh?
