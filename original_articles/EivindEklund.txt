I'm not quite sure how to describe myself here - the main reason why I normally do not have a home page.  I can throw in a few facts (I'm a FreeBsd developer, with the influences that imply, I'm a RubyLanguage fan and part of that community, I'm interested in just about everything, ...), or I could add a poem, or something.

Mainly, I just wanted to create the page so I could use it to search up my comments elsewhere.
