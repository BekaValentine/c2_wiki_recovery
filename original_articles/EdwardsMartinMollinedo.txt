Describe EdwardsMartinMollinedo here.

We have agreed to work with university level beginners with good language skills but beginner interpreters.

Students will work in pairs (one A language and one C language).

We could combine consecutive and simultaneous interpretation.

We have not yet agreed on the subject (the person who chooses the subject could also prepare the vocab).

The report will be written in English.

(I hope I got it right). I'm not sure if we are located in the right website. Maybe we should move to homepage, where we were yesterday.

I have just opened a wiki page in the certificate homepage
