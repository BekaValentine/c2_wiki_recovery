I think XP should be instructed in academia, from its practical and educational value. Particularly, PairProgramming and CodeUnitTestFirst must be learned by any CS students who do coding at all.
Is it taught in any universities, at least in SoftwareEngineering courses or heavy project lab courses?  -- JuneKim

I would certainly add refactoring to the list.  Students need to be exposed to coding style guidelines.

LaurieWilliams has taught PairProgramming in some courses, but that's all I know about.

Thank you. Her papers on PairProgramming were quite interesting. I think her SoftwareEngineering class is comparatively far better than those in Korea, which are mostly speculative and theoretical, usually with old SE tomes.
