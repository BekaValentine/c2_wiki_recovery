"Programming Stress" is a term coined by FrankCarver in 1998 (although it may also have been used before or after, of course) to describe some particular kinds of problems which limit the enjoyment, productivity and just plain fun of software development.

A possible, but very rough, solution to this is contained in the "Golden Rules of Stress Free Programming" (http://www.efsol.com/golden.html), which FrankCarver evangelizes whenever he can. The fascinating thing about this is how much overlap there is between StressFreeProgramming and ExtremeProgramming, even though they were developed completely independently.
