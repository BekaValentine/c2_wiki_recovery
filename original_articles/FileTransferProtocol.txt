File Transfer Protocol see RFC (RequestForComments) 959 at: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc959/Overview.html.

The short description for those who do not wish to peruse the entire RequestForComments.

FileTransferProtocol (FTP) was created before the WorldWideWeb, and involves the transfer of files through the internet. It could be considered the precursor to HyperTextTransferProtocol (HTTP) and WorldWideWeb, as FTP can be used to convey HyperTextMarkupLanguage (HTML) files. The difference between HTTP and FTP is that FTP...

	1. Requires a login phase to access the server
	2. Takes more time to initiate a connection
	3. Is not stateless

Although the RequestForComments is the "official" FileTransferProtocol specification, there exist countless other implementations.
