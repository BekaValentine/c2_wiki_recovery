BackPack seems to be a NextGenerationWiki. It brings unique take on a wiki, using several datatypes and freeform entry. While it has social aspects (page sharing and publishing), it is optimized for personal information management. Backpack supports todo lists, raw content (marked up with the wiki-like Textile markup), remote and local images, and reminders that are actually sent to your phone and email. It can also receive and store emails for pages, and allows blog-like "notes" to be added with a date and timestamp.

It's a very interesting concept and the signup is free for the basic account.
