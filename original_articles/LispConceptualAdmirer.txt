A LispConceptualAdmirer is someone who admires one or more aspects of Lisp, or as MentalMasturbation, but do not necessarily recommend or promote Lisp as a production language (as it currently is).

I count myself as one and often wish to praise aspects of Lisp without being counted as a direct LispWeenie. See MaspBrainstorming for an example of partial Lisp appreciation.
