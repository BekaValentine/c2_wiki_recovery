Colin Curtin currently works for Verba Software, making education more affordable.

I program mostly in Ruby + JavaScript.

I've made:
* a precursor to WebSockets, called Turtle Chat, which used Java for a persistent TCP connection to push chat updates. (code lost)
* a framework for the game of Go. It had a lightweight interface to program a player to, and allows for playing over GTP. (code lost)
* an HTTP Client for Squeak (also lost the original code, but it lives on in Pharo)
* a LiveJournal archiver (code lost)
* port of Gullery to Rails 2 (on github)
* a commit to Rails
* a partial HTML5 port of Subspace (on github)
* a Ruby-Mongrel2-Rack adapter
* a Ruby-Gearman implementation
* a Ruby MicroServicesArchitecture/Rack/RPC PoC
