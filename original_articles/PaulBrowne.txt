I've been interested in Software and Computers since the age of 11 when I was bought a CP/M home computer and an Oric Atmos. Both companies went bankrupt shortly afterwards and I had to learn both Z80 and 6502 machine code programming. I did make an effort to get out more after that, before finding both ObjectOriented programming and DesignPatterns.

I work for a Dublin (Ireland) based Enterprise Java consultancy, http://www.FirstPartners.net, who kindly allow me to blog at http://www.FirstPartners.net/blog.

I'm involved with several OpenSource projects, including NoUnit, an extension to JUnit, available on http://nounit.sourceforge.net. I'm also involved with RedPiranha, which was to be an OpenSource version of Google Desktop, but which is morphing more into a Spring based Enterprise Java Framework for Knowledge Management. RedPiranha is available at http://red-piranha.sourceforge.net.

I've written several online articles for O'Reilly (summary at http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2366) and also some Ajax and Struts stuff for Java.net (http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/10/27/sprinkle-ajax-magic-into-struts-webapp.html).
