A SoftwareUsability metric--how much is it InMyWay, as opposed to OnMySide? 

Software that is hard to use, for one of the following reasons:

	* Too many features(CreepingFeaturitis).
	* Incoherent feature set(a program that lets you read your e-mail, provides a shell buffer, acts as an image editor, and sports system-wide speech recognition, for instance).
	* Flashy/Useless user interface elements.  Splash screens get in my way, button images that don't make sense are misleading, and dancing paperclips are right out.  Filling up a screen is likewise kiboshed.
	* Gross lack of speed.
	* Instability.

Software that gets InMyWay includes MicrosoftOffice, MicrosoftWindows, and the MozillaBrowser.

Any program that works more slowly than I do is InMyWay.  If it takes more time to figure out how to do something than to do it, I don't want anything to do with it.

This page also works nicely if you replace "Software" with "Programming Language" throughout. -- FalkBruegmann

Amen to that. --JoeOsborn

So which ProgrammingLanguage has none of the above? i.e.:

	* Just the right number of features
	* Coherent feature set
	* Nothing flashy or gratuitous
	* Performance
	* Stability

Not starting a LanguageWar, just asking!
