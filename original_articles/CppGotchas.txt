Part of the AddisonWesley Professional Computing Series.

It explains 99 ways that C++ programmers can write bugs, including the problems with CeePreprocessorStatements.  It makes several controversial suggestions.  

Unfortunately, some of its throw-away comments are flat-out wrong.  For example, the author would have been well served to have read "A HistoryOfPi" before commenting on legislating the value of pi.
