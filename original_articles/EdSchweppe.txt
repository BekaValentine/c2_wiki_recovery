Oh, that's me!

I've been programming in VisualBasic since version 3 (back in 1995), along with excursions into CeePlusPlus, JavaLanguage, ActiveServerPages and other sundry languages. I've been interested in the whole ExtremeProgramming thing for a couple of years, now.

I probably spend too much time on the Yahoo! mailing lists for ExtremeProgramming and TestDrivenDevelopment.

Some of my favorite techie books:
	*CodeComplete
	*ExtremeProgrammingExplained
	*ExtremeProgrammingInstalled
	*RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode
	*AgileSoftwareDevelopment

Other Wiki pages of self-interest:
	*ThePrincessBride
	*BostonAreaXpUsersGroup (also known now as the AgileBazaar); note that I've got a page on their Wiki at http://www.stambaugh-inc.com/cgi-bin/AgileBazaarWeb?EdSchweppe

mailto:schweppe@ieee.org or mailto:edschweppe@hotmail.com; a recently refactored 
home page now lives at http://schweppe.home.tiac.net.
