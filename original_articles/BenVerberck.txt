Ben Verberck is one of many Belgians, starting to discover the Wiki World 
and he likes what he discovers page by page, day by day, more and more.

The goal of the quest is to introduce corporate, enterprise Wikis as a much more convenient way
to share information, documentation with a broad, more involved community of ITC experts.  
In a world, where MS Office Word and Adobe PDF documents are the dominating document types, it is wonderful 
to see that the Wiki technology can take the documentation process not steps, but leaps further.  
A small comparison in chemistry terms might visualize it better, where PDF and DOC documents provide for
the molecules, Wiki pages could provide the neutrons,  protons and WikiLinks could provide the electrons.  
It allows shaping a universe of words, 'documents' from a totally different perspective.  

I just hope a lot of ITC experts join me on this quest ... wait and see.
