Born 196x, I attended Warwick University where I somehow attained a degree in
Maths (and pinball). I then entered the computing industry where I spent over 20 years.

Early in the 21st century I abandoned the industry and am now working as a tutor specialising in maths. I have
started putting together some pages of maths tips for students at http://tutor.trevor-mendham.com/mathstips/index.html

My personal home page is at http://www.trevor-mendham.com One of my big interests is the nature on consciousness,
especially phenomenal consciousness, and I have started to put together some thoughts at http://www.trevor-mendham.com/consciousness/
