Markus Werle is a mechanical engineer trying to 
finish his doctoral thesis in ComputationalFluidDynamics 
at RWTH Aachen (University of Technology Aachen, Germany).

You can reach him via mail (numerical.simulation@web.de).

Markus has developed a new method which allows
to apply C++ ExpressionTemplate technique to any 
set of classes without modification of their code
just by using a header library and writing additional code.
