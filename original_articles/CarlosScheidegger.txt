Currently JustaStudent (the optimistic definition, I hope :), 22, Compsci undergrad. I'll graduate in less than 2 weeks, and I'll be spending this summer as a research assistant in computer graphics at the USA. Not sure what to do next.

Loves SchemeLanguage and HaskellLanguage, hates CeePlusPlus, JavaLanguage.

Give me anything with closures, and I'm happy (JavaScript, SmalltalkLanguage, MlLanguage, ...)

Interests (computer-wise): functional programming, computer graphics, end-user programming (you'll hear me say this, something like twice a day: "There's no program that couldn't be made ten times better if it were scriptable").

I'm pretty new to this Wiki thing, but the potential seems amazing. I'm currently implementing a ProjectWiki for a soon-to-be startup (''update: project post-poned indefinitely''), and, so far, things are looking quite good. (I'm using MoshiMoshi, of course.) I'm currently patching MoshiMoshi quite a bit. One of my goals is to have the parser be configurable, and to respond to a simple transformation language whose rules will be stored in a text file. This will allow to dynamically extend the Wiki syntax.

I also develop SchemeCheck: http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~carlossch/scheme-check/ (The uni server is a bit flaky, so check back later if you have problems.).
