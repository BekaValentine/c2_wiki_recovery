Agile Software Development is an emerging discipline, where there is plenty to teach, exchange and research. The objective of the AgileDevelopmentConference is increase the amount of experiential data being presented, the cross-over communication between researchers and practitioners, and between different specialists.  

The conference is designed to fit people with different experience levels and objectives: tutorials for those investigating a new area of practice, technical exchange workshops for experienced people to trade notes, experience reports, research papers, and an executive track for those reporting to upper management.

The AgileDevelopmentConference is to be methodology-neutral, so non-XPers and XPers alike should find discussion, and it aims for both research and practice to be discussed, as well as both social and technical issues.

''ADC 2003: There are positive testimonials on the conference site.  I went and my impressions are similar to the testimonials -- good mix of people, not just XP developers, but testers, PMs, execs, designers/requirements people, other agile-flavored development advocates.  Lots of authors and "thought leaders", everyone very approachable, lots of good conversations.  -- JeffreyMiller''
