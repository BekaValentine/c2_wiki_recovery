'''Peer to peer sharing is the best cost-effective distribution mechanism'''
* '''Why the classical model isn't so good'''

The classical top-down model has been created so someone can keep control over who has the information, and who hasn't. However as the information becomes more popular it becomes increasingly more difficult to keep control and increasingly expensive. For example a company would set up a server for all downloads around the globe.

Compare this model with this mathematical model:
time 0	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	...
1 user	2 users	3 users	4 users	5 users	6 users	7 users	8 users	9 users	10 users...

Spreading the information occurs incredibly slow (whether they can serve 25 people every 5 minutes, 2500 people, the basic formulae remains the same).

'''Why peer to peer (P2P) sharing is better'''

The peer to peer sharing model on the other hand has a much more natural way of spreading information and it doesn't need police or law to safeguard it. All companies have to de is produce the information, without the cost of distributing it.

Suppose everyone share his information with 2 other persons. We get a different kind of model:
time 0	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	+5 min	...
1 user	2 users	4 users	8 users	16	32	64 	128 	256	512	...

Information distribution occurs increasingly fast and is very CostEffective.

''Unfortunately, this actually just moves the "servers" to the ISP's instead of the corporations. I don't have any information as to how this scales, but it does not scale as per your model.''

'''There are more advantages for P2P sharing'''

More control over InformationDevices.
It helps to create a OpenSoftwareCommunity.
