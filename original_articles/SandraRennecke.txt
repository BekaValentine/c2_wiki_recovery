Hmmm, I am the one complaining about "Yet another stupid Markup Language" in the sandbox, in case that is still there. Heard about this place from a friend and wanted to check it out; it seems like a very neat idea to me. Still experimenting :)

edit: found this on google and seems I gave up experimenting with this wiki back in 2001. Gonna experiment some more though and add a poem-like thing I wrote to this.

The Apeshit Robot

  Original by Sandra Rennecke in German from 09-Nov-2004, 
  Translated to English by Sandra Rennecke on 03-June-2008

Once upon a time there was an Inventor
who built a beautiful robot.
This robot could cook and clean
as well a get drunk
work as a doorman as well as a maid.

But alas the robot was so beautiful,
that all who saw it envied the Inventor,
and soon the Inventor lost all his friends.

Thus he turned of the robot
and put it in the garden as a fountain ornament.

But the small and cute
robins and sparrows perched on it
and drank from the fountain
and now the Inventor himself became jealous.

So he put the robot into a big
sunny attic, where he hid old memories.
But cobwebs threatened to cover it
and mice came out, munching on the colourful cables.

The Inventor did not know anmore where to put this thing
he had created
and finally decided to limit it's functionality
and gave it to a zoo.

There the robot now sits in a cage
and the robot becomes friends with the apes.
