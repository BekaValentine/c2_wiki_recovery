Handel-C is an extension to CeeLanguage that adds parallel constructs (inspired by OccamLanguage). The language is designed for compilation to hardware, e.g. to compile to FPGA netlist or to VHDL. Language, compiler and development environment developed by Celoxia (http://www.celoxica.com/methodology/handelc.asp) BrokenLink.

Some extensions:

	* ''par'' to indicate a parallel block (see CodeOrdering)
	* ''chan'' a channel is a construct allowing synchronization at the hardware signal level, e.g. data that lives in different clock domains where the clocks are not synchronized can be brought together via a chan.
	* ''instance counts on functions'' you specify an upper limit on how many instances of a function may be instantiated in hardware.
	* ''rom array'' like const array, but the hint helps the compiler

This is very odd because the http://www.celoxica.com/ web site talks about hardware using FPGA and commercial solutions but there seems to be no mention of Handel-C. It does exist and in 2002 they ran training courses: http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2002/08/14/26314/celoxica-to-run-handel-c-course.htm

''There's some history at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handel-C  Looks like it changed hands a bit; it's now presumably owned by Mentor Graphics.''
