You think Wiki is hardly ever OnTopic any more? That RecentChanges is too clogged up with discussion of Wiki itself or off topic stuff? This is where you note down the interesting, software related stuff on Wiki.

----
'''New stuff''' including useful new stuff on old pages
	* VerySmallSteps are 90% of the battle?
	* VisualAgeJavaRefactoringBrowser - a vote to help IBM that's made me think hard about a better Java environment
	* MethodologistsOfTheFuture - can we have some good ones one day please?
	* EjbLinks - someone is giving a lot of time to help Wiki understand the future of enterprise Java, and maybe therefore influence it more?
	* DefineArchitect - a real architect just won't give up trying to understand what software ones really do.  Problem is: none of us know either.

'''Old stuff''' 

''Deletions here imply only "Let's give other pages a chance for a bit". This list should be reasonably short at all times. But please add any good software page you find in the WikiIceberg at any time.''
	* ExtremeNormalForm - poetic inspiration for UnitTest''''''s
	* MethodObject - Mr Cunningham at work 
	* NonlinearityOfXp - the supreme example of a Wiki page that went way off subject, became very long, was never adequately refactored - but is still extremely readable and important?
