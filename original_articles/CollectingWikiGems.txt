This is the art and practice of extracting in a process very much like mining, the gems which exist in this R''''''awWiki. 

Every time I find one, I pick it up, look at it, and then decide whether I should put it in my bag. (My PersonalWiki). Sometimes only part of what I pick up is worth saving, so I chip off the residue and keep the rest. 

This is partly in response to possibility that although what I have in reality is a copy of the Gem, the original may be lost from this wiki.
