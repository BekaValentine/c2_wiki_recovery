The sole intent of the geographical categorization was for XpFolk to more easily discover if there is a bunch of LikeMindedFolk near them -- DavidSaff

''Some of the companies are also multiple sites so it's not clear which location is running XP.  Geographic, then alphabetical makes sense.''

If a company consists of multiple geographic XP sites, the company can appear more than once in this page.

This was our first experiment with ExtremeProgramming and it went quite well. We found that there was a bit of a learning curve, but once the team got into the swing of things and built up a relatively stable code base, it went smoothly. -- StephenPetschulat (Vancouver, Canada)
