In the past, especially in the Hebrew culture, young men learned a trade  via apprenticeship... usually from their own father.  Jesus learned to be a Carpenter from Joseph.  Until the 1800s, most education in this country was HomeSchooling, and most people worked at home.  The industrial revolution, among other things, encouraged a lot of changes.  The internet, and other forces (e.g. the results of the breakdown of families) is starting to slowly turn this trend around.

I'm planning to employ families (my own and others), and possibly spinning out smaller family-run companies.  One of the ways I'm tackling this is through an Apprenticeship (http://www.rolemodelsoftware.com/moreAboutUs/apprenticeship.php) approach.  It doesn't have to be "all in the family", though.

We've found that hooking more experienced developers with younger developers is extremely powerful.  One of the really neat things that happens is that the more experienced developer gets his own research assistant.  The young guys tend to have more time to surf the web and dig through books to find information.  The more experienced analyze the information and apply wisdom.  A combination of youthful enthusiasm and mature perspectives combine to produce wonderful results for both. -- KenAuer
