Steve Callaway appears to be ''h. sapiens'' and an AI systems designer. He lives in Plymouth, Devon, England. He studies Norse mythology, Anglo-Saxon English and Cornish language, besides writing for www.wikipedia.org and occasionally doing some serious consultancy work.

He likes the RubyLanguage very much indeed. Unfortunately the JavaLanguage pays the bills.
