When I went looking for a PHP-based wiki several weeks ago, there were none so I set off to create one [a WikiClone].  When I got a reasonable version going and came back here to "register" it, I found two other PHP implementations
already there.  Sheesh.

Anyway, I based my code on PikiPiki, a Python wiki implementation that I admire for its clean design.  I have followed the formatting rules of PikiPiki, although I'm thinking about converting to classic wiki rules.

My biggest goal was to implement a wiki that allows for '''very fast browsing'''.  PHP seemed a good candidate since when run as an Apache module we can skip the whole fork/exec overhead thing.  Although I'm fairly happy with the result, the algorithm I used to handle formatting chews up a lot of time. If only PHP3 had the '/e' option for regular expressions.

Oh yeah, you can find my code and an example PhikiWiki web via some links on http://www.ontosys.com/reports/PHP.html
