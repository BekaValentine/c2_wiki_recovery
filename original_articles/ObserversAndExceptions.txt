[refactoring of ObserversThrowLocalExceptions] 

In the recent discussions about exceptions, problems with the 
ObserverPattern have come to light. 

An Observable is responsible for notifying its observers whenever 
relevant state changes occur. Since exceptions are, in essence, violations of the standard control flow, they present problems in for such 
radically uncoupled objects.

There are two major consequences: 

	* methods on the Observable object should not throw exceptions unless they TidyUpBeforeThrowing
	* Either ObserversShouldNeverThrowExceptions or ObservablesShouldUseATwoPhaseCommit
