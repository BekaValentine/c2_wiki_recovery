ProjectSmell is akin to CodeSmell, however unlike code, a project cannot be rewritten.
* Why can't a project be re-written?

''Probably because projects have a lot more inertia than code. Yes they can but it is much more difficult''

ProjectSmell usually accompanies a project where a successful outcome is supposedly lucrative.
