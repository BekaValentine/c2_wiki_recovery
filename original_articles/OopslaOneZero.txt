OOPSLA is changing as of 2010 -- OOPSLA is becoming SPLASH 

SPLASH:
* Isn't just a new name for our favorite conference-SPLASH has a new charter and mission: To bring together practitioners and researchers who are passionate about software, programming, design, and software engineering to explore the frontiers of software and software practice. 
* Takes most of its name from OOPSLA: '''S'''ystems, '''P'''rogramming, '''L'''anguages, and '''A'''pplications: '''S'''oftware for '''H'''umanity. 

OOPSLA:
* Original mission of understanding and promoting objects has been mostly achieved with the pervasive adoption of objects, though is still a lot of work to do there. But 
* Has always exceeded its mission-being an engine for innovation and incubating important new ideas related (even remotely) to objects. 
* Has helped spawn multiple technologies and conferences including the Unified Modeling Language (UML) MODELS conference, Agile, Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), Onward!, WikiSym, DesignPatterns and the PatternLanguages of Programs (PLoP) conferences, and the DynamicLanguages Symposium (DLS).
