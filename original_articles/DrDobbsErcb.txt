Dr. Dobb's Electronic Review of Computer Books
*** http://www.drdobbs.com/book-reviews/184406215

After perusing it a bit, my ultimate test was that I could not find any mention of RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode, not even in the pending reviews section. Although the reviews seemed pretty good, if a little StatusQuo-ish, this is a pretty big mark against the site, in my opinion. [Aug. 2001]

Still no mention of RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode in Jan. 2005.
