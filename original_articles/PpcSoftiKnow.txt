Ppcsoft iKnow is a productivity tool for MS Windows XP/Vista/7 designed to help knowledge workers manage information overload.

iKnow is a PersonalInformationManager inspired in part by Wikis.

iKnow stores all your notes in a text file using a custom MarkDown format designed to be easily read and edited using any standard text editor. iKnow uses a Wysiwyg editor for easy editing.

The main feature of iKnow is automatic linking of all notes without using CamelCase. Being a ''personal'' Wiki and a desktop application, iKnow is powerful enough to create hyperlinks between notes on-the-fly without using any special syntax. 

iKnow has a small footprint and is easy to use.

Ppcsoft iKnow is available in 4 different editions:
* Lite edition (Free)
* Home edition ($29)
* Standard edition ($79)
* Professional edition ($249)

As a result of this blurb I have downloaded it and tried it out (the free edition so far). It works as described and I can do a number of things including hyperlinks. There is one problem with the hyperlinks. I tried to make a link to a page on this wiki but that will not work as when it saves it it converts to lowercase, and the result gives the wrong information. There is now a beta version which fixes this bug.

One way of thinking about this problem is the CaseSensitivity of the calls to wiki pages. That is something which does not seem to be discussed anywhere I have yet found on WikiWiki.
