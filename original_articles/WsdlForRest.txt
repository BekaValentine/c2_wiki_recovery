I do not like SOAP, but Ithink WSDL is great.

Shudder to think of complicated WebServices without WSDL.

But, WSDL is not tied to SOAP.  What us Restians need is a standard WSDL implementaion for REST services.

... except that real RESTafarians don't need a service description language, only a forms language (e.g. HTML).

	that is when one is making the naive assumption that the only consumer of a REST resource is a GUI. Embedding hyperlinks in the output is pointless to a naive client that has no contract that the resource will persist consistent interfaces, and thus has no idea what the embedded hyperlinks or forms mean.
