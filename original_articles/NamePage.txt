Actually, let's not be too hasty about this, as this needs some thought and discussion.  WikiUser''''''s have HomePage''''''s as in CategoryHomePage, but authors and other persons of interest as in CategoryAuthor and CategoryPerson, would not have HomePage''''''s if not a WikiUser, but would instead have NamePage''''''s.  WikiUser''''''s have HomePage''''''s that they update and use for communication with other WikiUser''''''s.  Wiki persons of interest have only NamePage''''''s where WikiUser''''''s keep information about that person.

''Also some of the backlinks were on a page where the person had chosen to use NamePage rather than HomePage. That is their choice and in my view deserves some respect.'' -- JohnFletcher
