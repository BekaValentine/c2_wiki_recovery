Well...

I'm Peekee; hopefully, somebody might even look at this in the near future.

If anybody is interested, my website is http://members.tripod.co.uk/AlanRiddell/Main.html [BrokenLink - try http://web.archive.org/web/20010210211159/http://members.tripod.co.uk/AlanRiddell/Main.html].

And in case you are horribly lost, go to the FrontPage.

Also amusing here is TeenageSlang.

Hi, PeeKee

I was in Edinburgh some years before. On new year's eve. Amazing. And I visited St Andrews, which is also a very nice place. So I envy you and wish you enough sun to stay happy. Welcome at wiki. -- ManfredSchaefer
