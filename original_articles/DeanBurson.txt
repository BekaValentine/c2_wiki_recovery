I'm the Chief Architect at Traxian Corporation, a startup software company in San Francisco. We're building integration/workflow software for small businesses. 

When I'm not busy with Traxian, I spend a good deal of time sailing a Columbia 28 on San Francisco Bay and flying a 1946 Luscombe 8A around the bay area.
