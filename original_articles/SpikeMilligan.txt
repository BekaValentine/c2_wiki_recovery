SpikeMilligan passed away on Feb. 26, 2002. The last and funniest scion of the famous GoonShow, Milligan went on to such glorious fancies as the Q series and several extremely silly and worthwhile books. Those that miss him may enjoy the links at http://www.fireflycafe.org/spike/spikelinks.html.

Very sad, but I can't help thinking, ''"Put him in the curry!"'' ...

I'm sure he'd like that. His own official obit, which he wrote himself a few years back, is at http://www.lovelyjane.btinternet.co.uk/Spike.htm. Rather cheers one up.

He also decided on his epitaph before he died; it reads "I told you I was ill", and the Gaelic translation (''Duirt me leat go raibh me breoite'') appears on the headstone of his grave.
