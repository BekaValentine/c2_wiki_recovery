Sometimes when you are editing a page in wiki, you may wish to edit a related page at the same time. This may be particularly technique when merging or extracting page information in relation to another page or pages. 

This is possible using a single display screen (I use a secondary screen with 1920 by 1080 resolution)  and the approach found on WikiDisplayedAsPages. The simple coding of several Iframes initially displaying pages which aggregate or search the wiki or web is the staring point. You can copy and/also use the page appearing on my web site as: http://donaldr.noyes.com/c2/MultipleWikiPageEdits.htm to begin a process allowing this. (space removed when page created later today)

The page is meant to be self-evident in usage, but will later contain a page explaining how to use. 

One of the advantages of multi-page editing is the ability to drag and drop directly (which accomplishes in TwoClicks a cut and paste operation otherwise requiring keyboard effort and access).
* When used with a a local PersonalWikiServer and my own internet site, a private/public Wiki Experience can be had. 
** On my machine I have a cloned version of EddiesWiki which loads a group of pages which I edit privately and refactor to my taste.
