Is this pattern stuff a cult?  Some of our colleagues 
thought so as a group
of us met every Monday to study Alexander's TheTimelessWayOfBuilding.
(Monday School, get it?)

School attendees were:

	* RoxieRochat
	* NormKerth
	* WardCunningham
	* MikeMiller

Roxie wrote up her notes as a TekLabs report:
''To Build a Pattern Language for Smalltalk Programs: Study Group Notes'',
Rochat, Roxanna, ed., 
Technical Report No. SPT-88-09 (Sept. 1988).

Roxie and Ward summarized their findings as
''The Vision of the Pattern Language of Programs'' [http://c2.com/doc/oopsla88.html]
which they submitted to the OOPSLA-88 workshop on the 
''Specification and Design for Object-Oriented Programming''. 
Sept. 26, 1988
