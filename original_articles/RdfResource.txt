All things being described by ResourceDescriptionFramework expressions are called RDF resources. A resource may be a WikiPage. A resource may also be an object that is not directly accessible via the Web; e.g. a printed book. Resources are always named by UniformResourceIdentifier plus optional anchor ids.
