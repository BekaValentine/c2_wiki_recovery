For starters:

	* ''PracticalCommonLisp'' by PeterSeibel
	* ''AnsiCommonLisp'' by PaulGraham
	* ''Lisp, 3rd Edition'' by PatrickHenryWinston/Horn
	* ''CommonLispaGentleIntroductionToSymbolicComputation'' by David S. Touretzky
	* ''LandOfLisp'' by Conrad Barski, M.D.

More advanced texts:

	* ''OnLisp'' by PaulGraham advanced, mind-bending chapters on macros; on Web
	* ''ParadigmsOfArtificialIntelligenceProgramming'' (PAIP) by PeterNorvig is written with the viewpoint that to become a great programmer, one has to first ReadGreatPrograms (comparing programming to literature).  A fine book. See: http://www.norvig.com/paip.html .
	* ''CommonLispTheLanguage, 2nd edition'' (CLtL2) by GuySteele is not quite the official standard, but pretty close; it was written by a member of the standards committee partway through the standardisation process. Downloadable in various forms (even latex source) at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/cltl2.html The differences between this book and the ANSI specs are listed at http://cbbrowne.com/info/commonlisp.html#AEN9751
	* The language standard itself (X3.226-1994) makes a pretty good reference.  The DeadTrees version costs real money, but the CommonLispHyperSpec is available at no cost on the web
	* ''TheArtOfTheMetaObjectProtocol'' (AMOP) by GregorKiczales, Jim Des Rivieres and Daniel G. Bobrow (advanced, mind bending)
	* ''Object-Oriented Programming in Common Lisp: A Programmer's Guide to CLOS'' by Sonya E. Keene

Not a CommonLisp book, but a must read, is  ''StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.''

''The Little Lisper,'' by Friedman and Felleisen, is an interesting Lisp book that could be considered a proto-patterns book.  It's structured as a series of many small problem/solution pairs, each based in the context of earlier knowledge described in the book. Each chapter introduces an important programming principles and then explains it in terms of problem/solution pairs. -- NatPryce

[The most recent edition is now called ''TheLittleSchemer.'']

OnLisp is a fine book, but I read through it just once and then fired off an error report to its author.  ''ParadigmsOfArtificialIntelligenceProgramming'' I keep coming back to; it's practically a comfort book to me.  It deserves attention outside the Lisp world. -- DariusBacon
