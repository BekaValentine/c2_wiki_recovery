An implementation at HP of the SplitCapabilityModel. (The "Client Utility" was also known as "The E-Speak Beta", as opposed to "The E-Speak Product", which was based on SPKI (the SimplePublicKeyInfrastructure).

The Client Utility was a project started at HP Labs in late 1995 as an implementation of the The Global Computer http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Alan_Karp/publications/global.pdf .  A system built around the Client Utility Architecture was released in December 1999 as the Beta 2.2 version of HP's middleware product E-speak.  Following that release, the product was retargeted to B2B platforms.  The resulting E-speak 3.14 release in April 2000 was substantially different from the Client Utility, but it did retain many of its features.  HP abandoned all its middleware products, including e-speak, in May 2001.  At that time, five companies were using e-speak as a critical component of their businesses.

The Client Utility Architecture was produced before the implementation was started.  (It is also available in PDF from http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2001/HPL-2001-136.html.)  Although this document represents our thinking early in the design process, it does not describe the E-speak Beta 2.2 as delivered.  However, it is the best tutorial available.
