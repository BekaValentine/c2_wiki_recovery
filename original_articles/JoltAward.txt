Jan 25, 2002: WikiWikiWeb a finalist for 12th annual JoltAward category Web Sites and Developer Networks. http://www.sdmagazine.com/jolts/press_r1-29-02.htm Go Ward and Company!  Stay tuned for the winners, to be announced Wednesday April 24, 2002.

GoogleGroups took the JoltAward in this category in 2002. WikiWikiWeb got the runner up JoltProductivityAward. 

To be honest, GoogleGroups probably deserves to be number 1 anyway, but JoltProductivityAward sounds cooler than JoltAward, so it's a win-win.
