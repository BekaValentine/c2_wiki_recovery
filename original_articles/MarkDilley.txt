'''My thoughts about the WorldWideWikiWeb''' are centered around the idea that we regular people can create an information system that is simple and would fall below the radar so as not to cause a backlash against it,(WikiWikiUndergroundNewsChannel) like with internet radio. I think my idea of OneBigWiki (see also AllInOneWiki) (Wiki for wikis or wiki4wiki or w4w as web addresses, like p2p. . . only cubed, ''no the next exponential''. . . ) http://replay.web.archive.org/20040203131635/http://www.worldwidewiki.net/wiki/OneBigWiki

Hey, Mark, don't forget to tell anyone you know that uses a wiki in the workplace about our survey for our class on "Computer Supported Cooperative Work" at UM's School of Information (SI) (http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=87711184252 -requires javascript- ) -- it seems to us so far that the concept of Wiki works well for collaborative work as well as less formal endeavors - though there is a lot more paranoia in the work setting (which may seem anti-WikiSpirit) and there are probably plenty of squabbles to have with the connotations of our use of "work" as distinct from what goes on in Public Wikis -- Anyway we would LOVE for people who have experience with Wiki in their workplace to run through the survey and come back to THE Wiki to discuss it at: WikiInTheWorkplaceSurvey. - TomAllison

Mark, I like your movie list -- Have you seen "La Jettee"? (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0056119) Its the French original that Twelve Monkeys was based on -- it's something like 25 minutes long and all still shots --- It's currently my favorite movie of all time... Also, "My Dinner With Andre" (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0082783) -- it's a classic and looks like it would fit with the rest of your list -- Finally, my favorite for a very long time (maybe still, I just can't get over La Jettee, right now :)) -- is Ingmar Bergman's "Fanny and Alexander" (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0083922) -- incredible -- Just passing on some movie love -- TomAllison 

oo, oo --  wait a minute, what about absolutely anything that John Sayles ( http://us.imdb.com/Name?Sayles,%20John ) has ever made? includes:
	
* "City of Hope" http://us.imdb.com/Title?0101588 and 
* "Matewan" http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093509 (and he was an uncredited writer on "The Howling" http://us.imdb.com/Title?0082533 - that movie was so good - for a pulp horror flick - that you just knew it had to have some talent behind it...)

RoadMaps where we'd only have road maps to all articles on all wikis. I am planning to do a few roadmaps on this wiki so this could be a start.
