A compiler's view of code resembles a big map seen thru a soda straw. The 
compiler can, for example, track a river and ensure that roads do indeed 
have bridges over it. But such a tiny peephole can't see the BigPictures.

Because we have this ability, far beyond the compiler's ken, we want to 
draw the entire map. When we do, we don't want to consider tedious details 
that a compiler can consider instantly. We seek an efficient DivisionOfLabor between the human and the compiler. So, instead of complaining when 
bridges are not found, the compiler can just add them and keep going.
