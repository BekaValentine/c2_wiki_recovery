A Gamma Pattern (after ErichGamma) is
one of the KindsOfPatterns.
It is a pattern that
describes some constellation of structure or behavior
that recurs in softwares.

EditHint: ''How exactly is this different than DesignPatterns?''  Seconded.  Is the term "GammaPattern" widely used in the patterns community?  If not, we should merge this with DesignPatterns.
