It works and Microsoft is ecstatic to help developers, unlike RealPlayer (see RealNetworks for rant). ASF v. 2.0 is going to be the new industry standard (MPEG-4, actually), so WindowsMediaPlayer is the king of the hill. Justifiably so. Smartest people in streaming media.
 Don't be an idiot.  RealPlayer is uch better than anything by MicrosoftCorporation.
