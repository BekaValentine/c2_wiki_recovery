Because of WhyWikiWorks, flamage and flamebait is best deleted on sight. This may momentarily infuriate the flame participants, making them seem even more ridiculous than they are. But with luck that may also help them snap out of it.

Of course, like venomous bees, they may get angry and swarm at your IP number. You just ignore the venom - the only way to make signal is to delete noise. And an IP number feels nothing.

A good way to delete flames is to just tone them down a little. Then tone them down a little more tomorrow. And tone them down even more the next day. If there is nothing left after that, then delete. -- WardCunningham
