
Hi, My main page is at http://regier.dnsalias.net/avery/

I'm a member of the JOS project: http://www.jos.org/ ''(sort of BrokenLink 2005-06-02)'' and I'm the current maintainer of DevWiki and the Tournament and Bracket Tracker. (http://bracket-tracker.sf.net)

My primary work is in the JavaServlet environment.  I mostly write tools, ApplicationFrameworks, libraries, and WebServices for my employer.

Technical Editor for JavaToolsForExtremeProgramming, JSTLKickStart, MasteringJSPCustomTagsandTagLibraries, and MasteringJakartaStruts.
