The CooperativeGamePrinciple says that 
''Software development is a (finite, goal-seeking) cooperative game of invention and communication, in which people use markers and props to inspire and remind each other and themselves, in getting to the next move in the game. The endpoint of the game is an operating software system. The residue of the game is a set of markers to assist the players of the next game. The next game is the alteration or replacement of the system, or creation of a neighboring system.''
