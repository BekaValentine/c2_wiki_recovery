Freelance Software Writer. Well, JustaProgrammer really.

Based in Plymouth, England.

I have a background in Embedded real-time systems, mostly in C amd C++ but have also worked with Java, Forth and currently mostly enjoy writing in the PythonLanguage. I studied Electronics at University, so came to computers from the bottom up. One of those dangerous people who like to program with a 'scope on the desk.

I use a PersonalWiki which has made me much better organised.

Dave - thanks for sharing your experience on PersonalWiki. It inspired me to begin moving the four address lists I juggle onto my personal wiki. -- MarkIrons
