Hi, I am a native of Italy who has been living and teaching in the USA for many years now.  I am an English/Italian college professor, interested in technology.  I recently started experimenting with wikis in my classes.  I am writing a paper (about wikis) to present to a conference next summer.  Here is a link to my website with my wiki experiments: http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/elejeune/
