Lambda is a greek letter (looks something like an up-side-down back-to-front y) that is often used to represent these things:
	*An EigenValue of a matrix
	*The decay constant of a radioactive material (''not'' the half-life), or other exponential process
	*FunctionalAbstraction in the LambdaCalculus and, usually spelled out, some programming languages (typically FunctionalProgrammingLanguage''''''s, but not always) related to that calculus
	* In the context of 'lambda sensor', an exhaust oxygen sensor in a closed-loop fuel management system for an internal combustion engine
	* Wavelength

These are represented by lower case lambda (&#955; or &lambda;).

By talking about the lambda nature of a programming language, we usually mean the tendency of treating functions as values (instead of special constructs) and functions having LexicalClosure''''''s.

There is also a capital Lambda (&#923; or &Lambda;) -- not sure what that is used for, outside of fraternity house names.

	* The cosmological constant
	* TypeAbstraction in SystemF

(note: I just tried to type lambdas in Unicode, but somehow they got converted to numeric entity names, which were already there, so I removed them.  I'm using Mozilla 1.5.)

Does a dog have lambda nature? ''MuAnswer.''

'''No no, mu is the ''next'' Greek letter!-)'''
