The DolphinWikiWeb is a WikiClone from ObjectArts and is based originally on JosWiki. It is used to host the wiki site for all things concerning DolphinSmalltalk. Visit us at http://www.object-arts.co.uk/wiki/html/Dolphin/FrontPage.htm. 

It incorporates a number of changes over the original, including the ability to render up actual HTML pages, which consequently allows for faster browsing. The PerlLanguage source is available under GnuPublicLicense at http://object-arts.com/Lib/Downloads/DolphinWikiWeb.zip (??).
