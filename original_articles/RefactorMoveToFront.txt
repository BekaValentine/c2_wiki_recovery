When someone makes a complaint that something is difficult to find, find it yourself and move it to the front of a page that such a person would likely visit on their search for the topic.

'''Examples'''

A while back, someone complained that the ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap page (which is a common entrypoint to Wiki and ExtremeProgramming) was devoid of links that started from the basics. Placing the current greeting at the top of that page is an attempt to RefactorMoveToFront so that future visitors don't get frustrated in the same way.

On the WhyWikiWorksNot page, someone mentioned that they didn't UseSignatures because they didn't know how to. After a RefactorMoveToFront, future people who reference that page (after presumably visiting it at least once) will not have the same problem.

See MoveToFront and MoveToFrontLists.
