NakedCode is that horrible feeling when you are afraid to reveal code to others because you are afraid of what they will think.

Many ClosetProgrammers stay in the closet too long and do not release their code. What will she think of him when she sees his naked code?

Once the programmer comes out of the closet naked, revealing all code, he realizes it isn't that bad. Most users/other developers are happy just to have the code and don't even judge it as much as the programmer originally feared.

However, at other times, sometimes releasing the code can be partly dreadful ''in the mind mostly'' - judgmental, critical, and harsh she is - the other programmers. Usually it is not an ''entirely'' dreadful experience in actuality. Humans tend to fear public humiliation greatly, and exaggerate what ''could'' happen in their minds.  Some programmers tend to be obsessive compulsive and perfectionist - which doesn't help one bit.  At times the only power that can reveal the naked code is extremely high self esteem and confidence.
