We are a group of people in Minneapolis who are new to XP and are trying to learn it together.

We are part of the AgileExperienceGroup mailing list on YahooGroups: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Agile_Experience_Group/, and have our own wiki at http://www.latenighthacking.com/wiki/wiki.pl?AgileMethodologyProjectGroup.
