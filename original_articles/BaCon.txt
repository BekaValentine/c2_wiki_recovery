BaCon is a free BASIC to C converter for Unix-based systems. 

The following design goals were followed: 
* Must run on each Unix/Linux/BSD platform, including MacOSX
* Converted source code must be compilable with GCC
* Must resemble genuine BASIC with implicit variable declarations
* Spoken language constructs are preferred
To use Bacon your system must have either Korn Shell, or ZShell, or Bourne Again Shell (BASH) available. If none of these shells are available on your platform, download and install the free Public Domain Korn Shell which can execute BaCon also. Furthermore BaCon works with the traditional Korn Shell KSH88, but also with a newer Kornshell implementation like the MirBSD Korn Shell.

BaCon intends to be a programming aid in creating tools which can be compiled on different platforms (including 64bit environments). It tries to revive the days of the good old BASIC.

Code converted by BaCon can be compiled by GCC, the Compaq C Compiler or TCC.
