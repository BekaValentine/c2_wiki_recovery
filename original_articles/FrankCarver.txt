Frank Carver is a software engineer currently living in Ipswich, England.  he has done a variety of other work, though, including three years in the Royal Navy and work as a lifeguard at various swimming pools.

Frank has been designing and writing software since about 1978, when he was introduced to BASIC on an ICL minicomputer and a Commodore PET.  He spent some time writing FORTRAN, APL, BCPL and CORAL on a Xerox Sigma-6.  He then went to the University of Warwick to study Computer Systems Engineering where he immersed himself in Pascal, C and the new C++ as well the early days of net news.  Imagine, it was possible for one person (if dedicated) to actually read ''all'' of a days net news.

After a series of computer related employment he now runs a small but successful consultancy (see http://www.efsol.com/) mainly servicing BT Labs at Martlesham Heath. BT Labs has now been renamed (at great cost, I'm sure) "Adastral Park".  It's still the same site where a large part of British telecom's computer R&D takes place though. 

Frank's top skills include Object-Oriented design and programming in Java and C++.

Frank is also the author of the "Golden Rules of Stress-Free Programming" (http://www.efsol.com/golden.html)
(which may also be found as StressFreeProgramming here on Wiki) and the FrikiServlet very simple Java Wiki.  Frank is also an active moderator and participant at the Java Ranch ( http://www.javaranch.com/ ), and teaches computer courses to teenagers at Suffolk College ( http://www.suffolk.ac.uk ).  As part of his study and teaching at the college he is in the process of building and expanding a repository of his experience and materials at http://www.education-pages.co.uk/ .

Frank is now also looking after and extending a collection of resources and advice for Java web developers at http://www.servletshop.com/ .

Frank may be contacted by email as mailto:frank@efsol.com and his official "home page" is at http://www.efsol.com/FrankCarver.html.
