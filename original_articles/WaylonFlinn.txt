I've just discovered the WikiWikiWeb, but here's my impression so far of what it is:

* An exchange of information
* A method for the comparison and creation of value systems

'''Patterns'''

Here is my own personal definition for a Pattern:

* A pattern is a value system that works

This implies an objective, at least contextually, measure of fitness. I posit that this measure of fitness
includes, but is not limited to, the following:

* the system must be able to be made concrete, that is, it must be possible to create something in the relevant context (often the physical world) which represents or reflects the value system.

* a majority of these representations must cause the goal implied by the context to be met

This leads me to the conclusion that the context itself must supply a significant portion of the fitness measure, in the form of a goal. For example, at the most fundemental level of the physical world (at least according to our current understanding) this goal seems to take the form of resolution into a steady state probability distribution (for particle locations), that is, a probability distribution which does not change significantly with time. This further implies that constantness is the ultimate fitness measure, but even this seems externally imposed.
