1. Flash.outageStartDateTime.gmtTime() in wrong format. Needs to be in the correct format that the .save() uses.

2. COMPLETED:
Number of facilities impacted must be a number. JavaScript must be used to catch this in its validate function.

4. TestDevice() threw an exception; check it out. Didn't give the 'please check your device' msg.

5. DeleteDevice() barfed.

6. Create Flash was kicking me back to the create screen (no confirmation dialog) and the flash was not saved.

7. In Tracker, user can see CauseOfOutage/MethodOfDetection all the time, so it looks like garbage data (BUS ERROR/Sienna Wavecatcher). We will have to have an n/a type entry even though it's required. :(

8. Flash search Web page doesn't always keep the default search attributes from last time; these are also used when sorting (a sort re-searches with the last criteria). In particular, the date check/dropdowns don't save their default state.

9. All listboxes subbed with !foo! still add spaces around themselves again and again.

10. The icons next to logout() and one other should be the same a href as the link 'logout' ... but go to some 404 page instead.
