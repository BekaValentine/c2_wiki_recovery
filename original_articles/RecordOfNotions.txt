Devise a scheme to record them when or shortly after you think about them.
* This helps you establish a written record (manual or computerized) which will allow later recollection, classification and linking to other notions or ideas
** A text file with descriptions (store in a "notions" or "ideas" locale) cardfile or computer directory or collection
** By scanning a handwritten paper document into a PaperPort Directory
* One might also record notions and ideas expressed in one form or another by others, which you enlarge, enhance, or reformulate, stacking upon, or setting up against it, your own notions and ideas, creating some new personalized notions or ideas.
** A news article on a subject of interest might spark innovative approaches in handling or dealing with the item's topic.
** Some one might bring to light a solution or a concept which you have a notion is different if not polar opposite to what you think it might be.
* Create your own means of recording the notions, using a form that gives you an ability to search, index and link the notions into a larger body of work.
** Use something like WikiBatics
** Create the record of notions in some PersonalInformationSystem you have designed or acquired compatible for such a thing.
