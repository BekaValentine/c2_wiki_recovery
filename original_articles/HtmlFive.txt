''HTML5 is the fifth revision of the HTML markup language standard, which (among other things) improves support for multimedia and graphical content, makes the DocumentObjectModel an explicit part of the standard, provides tags to identify semantic content, and specifies APIs that can be used with JavaScript.''

'''Flop?'''

Html 5 may be going the way of VRML, based on industry vibes. It seems vendors are playing games to favor their platforms, creating fractured standards (an oxymoron), and people are not happy about relearning or supporting multiple markup techniques and would rather the industry add features to existing HTML rather then deprecate bunches of it. And "local storage" is making some security people nervous. It's too early to say for sure, but 5 is starting to smell like it's been left out of the fridge for too long.

If anything, it seems to be used more for smart-phones than desktops because there are fewer "legacy" smartphones that don't support HTML5 or have old browsers. 

Has anybody done anything interesting with it lately? If so, what features did it have that "vintage" HTML didn't that improved the result?

Yes
