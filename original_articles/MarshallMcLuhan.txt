Herbert Marshall Mc''''Luhan (b. July 21, 1911; d. December 31, 1980)

Famous for various quotes, especially the MediumIsTheMessage, and author (or co-author) of various works, such as TheMediumIsTheMassage (ISBN 1584230703), and a gramophone record (CS9501) with the same title.

Said "The electric light is pure information", which seems like an odd statement until you realize that a lightbulb has two discrete states, just a computer bit.
