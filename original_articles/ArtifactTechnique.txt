''The notion yields the scheme  -> yields the design -> forms the process -> creates the object/artifact '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes 20120213 201301112 20140329

There is a difference spelled out in the short quip above, between '''thinking''' (the notion) about how to do something (the action), and '''forming''' (the process), of something that works.
* When designing or utilizing a process  Artifactory, one may find a good, a better, and perhaps even a best usage which becomes the object
* ItDepends a great degree upon knowing what kind/type object/artifact) you are to make

This is the kind of problem one arrives at when the question comes up:
* HowDoYouKnowWhenYouAreDone'''?''' 
** Raising this question is an indication of a shortcoming in the '''technique'''
The ultimate goal in this scheme is to form an artifact that is UsefulUsableUsed
