Luddite Logic is the logic as if you were using the simplest technology that is still capable of realizing the SystemMetaphor.  See LudditeOfficeAutomation.

I don't think it is that simple. Sometimes one spends years perfecting a given technology, and starting over will probably slow them down. Plus, many new things are simply fads rather than truely superior. See MindOverhaulEconomics.

True, it's a matter of balance. This has been discussed in OldCodeRusts and RefactorLegacyCode. One has to work on the old project, while keeping an eye on new technologies. Development in isolation is often a bad idea - See XanaduProject.
