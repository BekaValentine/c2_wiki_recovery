I'd like RecentChanges sorted with the most recent change first and limited to only one day.

''Try QuickChanges. -- WardCunningham''

Change the layout of RecentChanges to have the most recent edits/changes listed first (i.e. sorted from most recent to least recent).  Thus the reader does not have to scroll to the bottom of the page to see where the latest developments are.  This seems minor, but would be of great convenience to every RecentEditsJunkie and RecentChangesJunkie out there.

''See NewRecentChanges.''

I wish Wiki had a cross reference button which did a FindPage for the name of the current page. -- JamesNoble

''The title of a page is a link to pages that cite it. -- WardCunningham''

Except that this feature seems broken. -- TimChambers

''The search uses HTTP_REFERER. If you block this then it won't work. I use this obscure mechanism because it keeps dumb spider software from issuing zillions of searches. -- Ward''

It would be nice if I could put EditText anywhere I wanted in a page.

''You can always edit a page by inserting ''edit='' into the proper place in the url. -- WardCunningham''

You can add a link to Amazon by putting ISBN <number> into square brackets. It would be nice if the form ISBN: <number> (note the colon) would work as well, since that's the form Amazon uses on its web pages. It would make it simpler to cut and paste the ISBN from one place to the other. -- KatyMulvey

''Done. I also dropped the requirement for square brackets and simplified the look of a formatted ISBN by dropping the AmazonAssociate explanation. -- WardCunningham''

Could one include the number of changed lines or the size of the largest changed block for each entry on RecentChanges? See MinorEditsDisabledDiscussion.

''NewRecentChanges seems to do this and more.''
