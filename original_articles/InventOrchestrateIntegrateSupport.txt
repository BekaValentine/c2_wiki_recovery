In an interview in 2006, WardCunningham mentioned four factors necessary in SustainingInnovation:
 Invention
 Orchestration
 Integration and
 Support

They are taken to be part of what is needed to make a wiki successful. The idea of wiki, while having success beyond his initial dreams, does not presuppose that when another individual or organization starts up a wiki, that it will be successful. As essential as these four factors are, the building up a CriticalSocialMass must be added to make success probable.
