I have implemented a capability model in KeheiWiki and it ties in well with the apache groups file. 
* It has been there for some time though recently I found ways to generalize it and remove any hierarchical constraints
* In essence anyone may have any number of capabilities associated with their identity 
** You can be a member of multiple groups.
** Any page or action in KeheiWiki may designate what combination of capabilities is required to modify the page or perform the action. 
** Actions being, say, rename a page, change own password or declare a new namespace.

KeheiWiki is now being used for wiction.org project
* A 'wiction' is the product of one or more authors collectively working on a collaboration (short story, novelette, serial, novel, trilogy, etc.) and unleashing it to readers for their enjoyment.  
* Each such collaboration is a separate instance of KeheiWiki.
** The wiction.org project is available:
