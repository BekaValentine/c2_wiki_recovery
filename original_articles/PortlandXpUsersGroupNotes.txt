* 2004 June 8	-- ArloBelshee The Process of Courage

Courage is more than just no fear. It starts with a dedication to "no fear", but develops into much more. Put simply, Courage is the desire for change. People naturally fear change; when the team has Courage, it seeks change out.

So, how do you get there? How do you bypass human nature and make change not only the normal way of things, but something that everyone on the team continually seeks out?

I will present a number of techniques that worked well for our team, and discuss why they did. The specific optimal techniques will vary from team to team, but the underlying objectives will remain. Hopefully, I can also give you a little taste of the state of true courage - and the difference between courage and fearlessness.

	* 2004 February 10  -- MichaelLeach: Software Craftsmanship and the Outsourcing of Software Engineering

Software Engineering is a commodity skill and today's Engineers must become Software Craftsman to maintain a competitive edge, or become a casualty of the outsourcing trend.

This presentation will answer the following questions:
	* What is Software Craftsmanship?
	* When should Software Craftsmanship be applied?
	* How do I become a Software Craftsman?
	* How are XP and other agile methodologies related to SC?

JimShore of Titanium I.T. spoke on continual design under unenviable conditions. Somehow, RikSmoody and Novell failed to make the connection, and we did not have use of the room.  The cleaning staff persisted in vacuuming the hallway near where we gathered.

XP's emphasis on TestDrivenDevelopment, MercilessRefactoring, and SimpleDesign come together as "ContinualDesign" (aka EvolutionaryDesign).  What is continual design?  How does it work?  What about architecture?  How does it really work when it comes to hard problems in the real world?  JimShore has been experimenting with continual design on many projects since 2000.  He discussed his experience and the surprising results he's had.

'''Planning and Feedback - May 1st, 2001'''

''Facilitated by MichaelLeach, WardCunningham, and JimLittle''

Thanks again to our sponsors Novell and Logical e-Business Solutions who provided the meeting space and food!

This XPDX meeting focused on the PlanningGame. MichaelLeach provided a high level introduction of how the game is played and the group briefly discussed the concept of planning and how it is currently defined within their organization.

The PlanningGame was then enacted in a 30-45 minute demonstration with WardCunningham and JimLittle playing the roles of Development and MichaelLeach acting in the Business role. The premise of the game was based on a Business customer trying to develop an online version of the board game Monopoly with the assistance of an XP development team. MonopolyUserStories were presented, estimated, split/combined, re-estimated, prioritized, and negotiated for a 3 week 1st iteration.

Following the demonstration, the group split into smaller groups of 4 and conducted a hands on planning exercise for iteration 2 using pre-printed story cards (thanks Jim!). One group member was elected to represent Business while the other 3 represented Development. XP Coaches floated around the room and offered assistance. This exercise lasted about 45-60 minutes. Here is one team at work ...

During the exercise, participants were encouraged to write their questions down on PostIt notes for later discussion. JimLittle then organized and addressed the questions while sharing his wealth of experience using XP on a demanding Internet project. 

The evening concluded with the distribution of a PlanningGame epilogue authored by AlexGinos which highlights moves that take place beyond the PlanningGame.

'''UnitTest''''''s and ContinuousIntegration - March 6th, 2001'''

''Facilitated by AlexGinos and BrianKnowles''

''Eats provided by CSG Professionals.'' 
''Digs provided by Novell, Inc.'' 
Thanks sponsors!

Thanks to everyone who came to the second XPDX meeting on March 6th. We had a good turn out again and a very interesting meeting.

AlexGinos kicked off the meeting with a brief overview of what UnitTest''''''s are and how to use them in ExtremeProgramming. This lead into a very fruitful discussion (it lasted for two hours!) of UnitTest''''''ing tools, techniques, gotchas and how to do ContinuousIntegration. MartinFowler was present and shared his perspective and experiences with these topics. He mentioned ThoughtWorks' experiences with a BuildMonkey that facilitates automated ContinuousIntegration. More details on their experiences can be had via Martin's ContinuousIntegration article. [http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html]

He also mentioned a testing technique they use called the ObjectMother to centralize object creation for use in complex UnitTest''''''s. The idea is to centrally locate the creation and management of objects that UnitTest''''''s depend upon. This keeps test startup code in one place and also improves performance by avoiding too much object churn.

Mention was made of a few other tools:
	* NUnit is a JavaUnit derivative that tests .NET applications.
	* HttpUnit was discussed briefly as a way to programmatically apply FunctionalTest''''''s to an HTML user interface.
	* IntelleJ's IDEA Java IDE has some very interesting refactoring tools and might integrate JakartaAnt into their project management functionality in the future.

Finally, BrianKnowles gave a demonstration of work he has done to automate UnitTest''''''ing in a JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition application. He first gave an overview of how JtwoeeUnit works and how to use it to test code accessed by JavaServlets. Then he went over how JakartaAnt works and how to use it to assemble and test your J2EE applications. Finally, in an impressive show of skill and grace, he demonstrated JakartaAnt automatically assembling a J2EE application, deploying it, starting JakartaTomcat, and running all defined unit tests within the application (both plain JUnit tests and J2EEUnit tests).

'''Inaugural Meeting - February 8, 2001'''

'''Introduction'''

AlexGinos provided an overview and introduction to the purpose of the group.
This group exists to provide:
	* mutual support for people interested in using XP
	* networking for XP related jobs
	* a place to give feedback to the creators of XP and thereby further its evolution.

'''Distinguished Speaker -� WardCunningham'''

WardCunningham then gave a short presentation on the past, present and future of ExtremeProgramming and what he�s up to now.

ExtremeProgramming grew out of Ward�s work at Tektronix, building real products with SmallTalk and ObjectOriented principles, early on in OO's adoption. After being asked what he was up to every day, Ward began to structure his development so his answer could end ''"...for the customer"''. To do this, he started asking himself these questions before any undertaking.

''"What am I doing?"''

''"Why am I doing it?"''

''"Whom am I doing it for?"''

''"What�s next?"''

With this customer focus, OO�s ability to simplify ReFactoring code and successful experiments with PairProgramming, the kernel of XP was assembled. Then, about five years ago, KentBeck ''"turned up the knobs to ten"'' on a troubled project at Chrysler, successfully putting XP through the paces on a significant project.

XP is now known as a LightWeightMethodology, however, Ward does not believe that�s a good categorization. He�d rather have people understand that XP is focused more on the final deliverable than on producing project management artifacts. Ward asked the group to list off light-weight methodologies and the following were mentioned:
	* ScrumProcess
	* AdaptiveSoftwareDevelopment
	* CrystalClearMethodology
	* FeatureDrivenDesign
It was even proposed that there should be a UnifiedLightweightMethodology :-)

Three XP books have now been published and there are more on the way (if not here already). ''"The publishers have figured out that thin methodology books sell."''
	* ''ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange'' by KentBeck
	* ''ExtremeProgrammingInstalled'' by RonJeffries ''et al''
	* ''PlanningExtremeProgramming'' by KentBeck ''et al''

Ward then listed off recent or upcoming conferences that will deal with XP:
	* XpTwoThousandAndOne
	* XpUniverse
	* SD 2001
	* OopslaZeroZero
	* XpWorkshop

The XP buzz in the industry is building. As a show of hands displayed, few people are following all of its tenets yet, but many are interested in learning how it can help deliver better customer results.

Currently, Ward is focusing his attention on better defining the business role of XP. Traditional business processes are handed down from big business and don't fit entrepreneurial startups well. Since XP is a good risk control tool and there is an absolute focus on outcomes (liquidity in the business world), the start-up environment appears to be a good fit. He has taken an academic interest, collaborating with a successful local entrepreneur in applying XP principles at a new start-up company. His goal is to define a unified XP-like process for startups.

'''Activity'''

A "get to know ya" game was played to introduce everyone to each other. The goal was to meet as many people as possible in fifteen minutes and find something personal in common. Some attendees can really network!

'''Business'''

Prof. AndrewBlack will be teaching an XP course at the OregonGraduateInstitute this spring. He would be grateful if any XP'ers would be willing to be guest speakers, provide tips, or even be an on-site customer for a stretch. Contact Prof. Black at black@cse.ogi.edu if you are interested.

What should this brand-new group be called? After a few nominations, a nearly unanimous decision for XpDx was rendered. This acronym nearly rivals GNU on the recursion scale. Aaron Singmaster-Judd from the TechnoLoft swiftly snapped up xpdx.org on Friday. Stay tuned, well let everyone know when there's a site. Thanks Aaron!

The question of what format following meetings should take was posed to the group. Here's a list of suggestions:
	* PortlandJavaUsersGroup is a good model.
	* Good guest speakers.
	* Panels and discussions.
	* Technical presentations.
	* A discussion of how to use metaphors in XP.
	* Cover one aspect of XP each month.
	* Do XP in the small for an hour.
	* Discuss tools that people use.
	* Start the meetings with introductions.

It was decided that the meeting should be held once a month and avoid conflicts with other industry groups in the area. Also, finding a permanent venue was discussed with multiple sites being proposed. A schedule and meeting location will be announced shortly.
