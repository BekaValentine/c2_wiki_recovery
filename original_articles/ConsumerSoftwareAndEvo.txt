If the product is aimed at a mass market, how can you be sure yout customer stories are representative of the whole market?

This problem is no better or worse with EvolutionaryDelivery than any other kind of software (or any other consumer product). The usual techniques apply:
	* Good marketing folks
	* A strong and clearly communicated vision of the product
	* A clear connection to real customers (asking your spouse, focus groups, etc)
