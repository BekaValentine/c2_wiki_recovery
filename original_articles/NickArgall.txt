Nick Argall is a programmer at Pracom Ltd, a telecommunications carrier in Australia.

He programs mostly in DelphiLanguage, although he also does a bit of Java and a lot of Database.  Often thinks of joining a user group or something similar, but having a wife and two very small kids limits this considerably.

One of those really painful people with an opinion on everything :)

Got involved in the PatternLanguageForTextualCommunications project, but it LostMomentum.
