Zwiki is a GPL'd WikiWikiClone based on the powerful ZopeApplicationServer (Zope), 
from which it gains a great deal of leverage. 
Zwiki is flexible and has some unique capabilities, combined into a reasonably intuitive whole.
It combines well with other Zope add-ons such as PloNe. 
The polish and documentation is improving. 
We'd welcome your help.

Zope is cross platform and easy to install or find free hosting for; if you can get over the Zope requirement, in my biased opinion you should take a close look at Zwiki. (And if it's not right for you, I'd love to hear why - thanks!)
