On some occasions, several browsers look for an icon file 'favicon.ico' in the root directory of the server.

Browsers known to do this:
	* MicrosoftInternetExplorer
	* KonquerorBrowser
	* GaleonBrowser
	* MozillaBrowser 0.9.7 and later (it doesn't have to be .ico), it actually uses the link tag: like so <link rel="icon" href="happyface.png" type="image/png" />, see http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110296
	* SafariBrowser
	* OperaBrowser 7.0 and later
	* OmniWebBrowser 5.0 Beta and later (I think.)

What they are doing with it:
	* Use the icon for bookmarks.
	* Show the icon on the address bar by the URL. 
	* Show the icon in tabs if you use tabbed browsing
	* Use the icon on the desktop if a link from the desktop is made (on Windows)

''FaviconDotIco was introduced by the MicrosoftInternetExplorer 5.''
MSIE4 also displayed custom icons in the address bar and on internet links. Did it use a different mechanism for this?

The one for c2 (now showing up above, at least with e.g. Firefox) is...a dead cricket, toes up, right? :-)

''See http://c2.com/ for the full sized logo.''

Well, shrunk down to the size of the URL window on my browser, it looks like a dead bug.  More of a cockroach than a cricket, though.  

At least it makes sense:  part of our job, as programmers, is killing bugs.  :)
