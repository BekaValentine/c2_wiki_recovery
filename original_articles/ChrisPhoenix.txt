I'm interested in dyslexia, nanotechnology, psychology, outer space, and other xenophiliac concepts.   

My personal home page is http://www.xenophilia.org/ .

I've started a user-editable web site, sort of a cross between WikiWiki and crit.org. See XenophiliaByChrisPhoenix. 

Write me if you want the xenophilia source, or if you're interested in any xenophiliac ideas.
