Hello. I'm Jonathan Feinberg.

I recently moved from New York City to the Boston area with my wife and son (http://MrFeinberg.com/gabe/) in order to join IBM Research, in Cambridge. I'm in the '''Collaborative User Experience''' group, where we're trying to influence the design of software to support collaboration.

I was at netomat, inc. for over a year before coming to the Hub. It's too hard to describe, so go see http://netomat.net/ for the scoop.

I have recently begun a collaboration with a certain WardCunningham, who has kindly offered to add a small language to my physics toy (http://MrFeinberg.com/physics/). He has shown me some extremely cuspy parsing code so far. The project is hosted at SourceForge, name of "mf-physics".

I have worked closely with Martin Wattenberg, who created the MapOfTheMarket while he was the research director at Smartmoney.com. He and I met when we both answered an ad placed by Marek Walczak, who was looking for programmers to help him realize his crazy art project involving real-time synchronized text, VRML, and sound performance over the internet. You can read about that and other things "like" it, at Marek and Martin's site, http://mw2mw.com/ .

I have also worked with Golan Levin on his "Secret Lives of Numbers", the "Alphabet Synthesis Machine", and the "Telesymphony", in which the audience's cell phones are the instruments.

You can read about some of my my musical history at http://MrFeinberg.com/discography/ .
