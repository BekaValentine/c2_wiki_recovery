The Liberty Alliance Project

It is concerned with the technology that enables companies to share customers' user IDs, passwords and other personal data across web applications. 

Inherent in the concept of a community is the notion of identity. Methods are being formulated to create, manage, and authenticate OnlineIdentities and broker services based on information related to identity. It is a business alliance formed for the purpose of delivering and supporting single sign-ons on the Internet for consumers and businesses.
