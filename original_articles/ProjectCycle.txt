In the XpFixedPlanningGame, a period distinguished by:

	* An abbreviated inception/elaboration phase with a week or two of planning/negotiation of UserStories in FixTimeVaryScope mode so as to fit the scheduled BusinessStories.
	* A construction phase consisting of '''Four''' XP iterations.
	* A transition phase consisting of a few days of deployment and recriminations :-)

All up this takes about a quarter of a year ... which is handy ...
