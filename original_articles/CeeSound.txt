Csound is basically a DomainSpecificLanguage used to create audio files; the input and output to your 'programs' consists of PCM audio data (AIFF, WAV, ... - i.e., a format using raw, uncompressed sample data). For a more thorough description, see http://www.csounds.com/whatis/index.html . There are several distributions and implementations of the Csound compiler; most can be found through the main page at http://www.csounds.com . (Note the 's' in these URLs.)

The language itself rather resembles AssemblyLanguage; as one might expect, there have thus been several attempts made to implement HigherLevelLanguage''''''s on top of it.

KarlKnechtel (I have plans for yet another of these HigherLevelLanguage''''''s, too - rather, an XML schema; the 'code' could be translated into CeeSound .orc and .sco files via XSLT or something, though I plan to do it in Perl)

AtteJensen - I run csound5 live from my laptop controlled from various midi keyboards. It's very stable, very fast and very flexible

I use Csound. Very good program; I even wrote plugins for it. I did invent a higher level language for the score, specifically a form of MusicMacroLanguage. For the orchestra I find the standard Csound format to be OK.
