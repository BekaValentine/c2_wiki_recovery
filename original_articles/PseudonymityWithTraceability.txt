'''An alternative to RealNamesPlease and PseudonymityWithUntraceability.'''

Expecting users to use their real names when they are already well known in various web (or other) communities by a certain pseudonyme seem's a bit off to me. I use the wiki name MilkMiruku, but I do not make any attempt to keep my real name or identity a secret. If anyone wishes to know my details, they are fairly easily accessable online. -- MilkMiruku
