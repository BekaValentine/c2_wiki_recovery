My name is Cohan Sujay.  I started writing programs when dinosaurs roamed the earth among BBC Micros and IBM 186s.  That was a long time ago.  

I am currently working on a collaboration tool that supports planning games in a distributed team AgilePlace available to the public at http://www.tryxp.org .  You can get an account, share your project with other team members, and collaborate on the project with them using online planning games!

First major project: developing control system software for telescopes.  Keep your eyes on the stars.  You'll develop a great posture.

Short stints: PSI and Sun.

Internships: VisualAgeSmalltalk country club, built a SmalltalkLanguage JSP Engine, worked on session management and failover.  The JSP Engine used to be downloadable from this page http://www.whysmalltalk.com/developmentandtools/index.htm#stjsp

Testing: Tested software for internal tools at IBM and worked on an agile test process AgileBridge''''''s which is more fun than most other test processes I know.

I think KentBeck came up with ExtremeProgramming by applying principles from Japanese manufacturing concepts to software engineering.  We applied the same principles to testing in the above process.

I work at OTI Labs, IBM, Raleigh.  We build UI libs for PDAs.

My cyberhome is at http://www.floranta.com/oriondown, complete with a cyberpet (visit http://splotch.sourceforge.net if you want the code).  I just started a blog at http://cohan.blog-city.com.

I draw cartoons about programmers in my spare time: http://www.floranta.com ... oopssie!  That is now my pet web-project, aka., http://www.thiscafe.com

I've also worked on Eclipse plugins for concurrent testing, static analysis tools, code generators, and on collaboration tools (see http://floranta.sourceforge.net).

I'm currently looking for metaphors for programming that may have applications in training and research.
