Professor of Computer Science, Associate Chair of the Computer Science and Engineering Program, and Senior Researcher at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS).  He has published over 300 technical papers and 6 books that cover a range of research topics, including patterns, optimization techniques, and empirical analyses of software frameworks and domain-specific modeling environments that facilitate the development of distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) middleware and applications running over high-speed networks and embedded system interconnects.  Dr. Schmidt has served as a Deputy Office Director and a Program Manager at DARPA, where he led the national R&D effort on middleware for DRE systems.  Dr. Schmidt has also served as the co-chair for the Software Design and Productivity (SDP) Coordinating Group of the US government's
multi-agency Information Technology Research and Development (IT R&D) Program, which formulated the multi-agency research agenda in software design.  In addition to his academic research and government service, Dr. Schmidt has over fifteen years of experience leading the development of ACE, TAO, CIAO, and CoSMIC, which are widely used, open-source DRE middleware frameworks and model-driven tools that contain a rich set of components and domain-specific languages that implement patterns and product-line architectures for high-performance DRE systems.
