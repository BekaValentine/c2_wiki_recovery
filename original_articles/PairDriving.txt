Like a pair of programmers riding a tandem bicycle??
----
I have used PairDriving often - one person drives the keyboard while the other person steers the mouse.  In this case a BackSeatDriver can be good.

This works well every now and again, of course it takes a synergy among the pair.  And it only works well for limited spurts of acceleration :) 

It's like having someone on the same page as you.  Each of you finishes the other's sentences, literally.

The same wiki page?  Dunno if that was what you meant, but I like it. -- DanielKnapp

This reminds me of a video game my brother and I played on a Commodore-64.  The game featured a direction control using an 8-way joystick.  The game also featured a firing control likewise using an 8-way joystick.  It was a wild ride through space (360 degreee scrolling), as one of us steered and the other fired, at the enemy spacecraft.

Also, I have found it is very easy to Pair Program when you have a Mac G4 with a 22" Cinema monitor.  This provides ample screen space for both programmers to see, and it makes it easy for one to control the mouse while the other controls the keyboard.  So, for the "modest" investment of $2300 you can treat your pairs right!

There is an earlier reference to PairDriving from PairProgrammingErgonomics (which may have been what prompted this page). There is also a more detailed description of a PairDriving experience in ExtremeFlow.
