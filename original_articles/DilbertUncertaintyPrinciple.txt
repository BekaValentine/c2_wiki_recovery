''Dilbert's Uncertainty Principle'' states that

	 :	'''The more precisely the COST of a project is determined, the less precisely the KNOWLEDGE of what is going on is known.'''

Or in Dilbert word "If you understand a project, you won't know its cost, and viceversa".

''So if you're a clueless manager, you can estimate any project to actual honest-to-goodness certainty?  :)''

Absolutely. The project will cost exactly the amount it is budgeted for. The results, however, will be unpredictable.
