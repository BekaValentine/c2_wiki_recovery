The point during the implementation of a compiler for a ProgrammingLanguage, from where on it is possible to implement the compiler in the language being compiled.

An early BreakEven is desirable, because it avoids large amounts of code being implemented in the boot-strapping language, that are discarded once the point is reached.

This is an important point during the BootStrap''''''ping of a compiler for a new ProgrammingLanguage.
