Doctor in the UK.
I like Wikis as a work-group tool for medical organizations - it is fair to say that the administration of our local health service dislikes them for very similar reasons. A very good idea, well done that man.

I have a newish Wiki at http://www.defoam.net/wiki/tavi-0.22/ and our local Linux User Group has one at http://www.dclug.org.uk/wiki/.

One of my interests is in the introduction of Open Source software into healthcare (FLOSS) - proprietary software and the model that develops and supports it have already proved inadequate.

Open Source Healthcare Alliance is at http://www.oshca.org.
