Stephen Gaskin is a modestly famous hippy. He has written books, served in Korea, given lectures, gone to jail, founded a couple of humanitarian organizations (not to mention TheFarm, once the largest hippy commune in the world), run for President of the USA and generally wrought great countercultural works.

He lists computers as an 'avocational interest', but it's not clear if he hacks. I'd bet money that he'd love the wiki.

At least one of the authors of the AntiPatternsBook has at least one of his stories; see the connection to TheMatrix.
