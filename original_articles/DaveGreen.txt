20 years a programmer, starting with IBM, now with Nationwide Building Society, alternating several times between suppliers and customers along the way.

Back at IBM, we were generating a VM version of VTAM from the SNA architecture definition.  Today, there are 50 developers writing business systems using a tool of my own devising, known as Process Author.

I regard programming as an evil whose root causes are inadequate technology and impoverished thinking.  It is an article of my faith that when we have eliminated it, the problems revealed will be much more interesting.

My current fighting front is in the area of building componentised business software.
