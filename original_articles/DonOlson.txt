[Don wrote HandsInView as his first pattern after listening
to JimCoplien give a talk about the form in July, 1995.  That became a good lead-in to talk about
EverythingAboutObjects. See also MakeFearFuel. He is the author, with CarolStimmel, of TheManagerPool, from Addison Wesley, published in October, 2001]

I am very interested in Jim Coplien's Organizational Patterns and have attempted one of my own called TrainHardFightEasy, which has taken on a life of its own in a larger Pattern Language (yikes!), joined by the
likes of CultOfPersonality, ScapeGoat, TrialProject, and others. Let me know what you think. Some of these found their way into TheManagerPool. To JimCoplien, a rowsing cheer for stirring up all these ideas buzzing around my noggin!

Has anybody experienced this? See TheTroubleWithConsensus. Is your boss in search of the BigRedButton? Let me know.

If you need a jump-start into Patterns, contact LindaRising. She is the greatest source I know for contacts, publications, conference information, and just plain wisdom regarding the Patterns world.

''Patterns Mining'' is where it's at, and BobHanmer is the guy to talk to if you want to know how to pick experts' minds to preserve knowledge across time. He also knows an amazing amount about railroads which are the source of many computing patterns.

Many, many thanks to WardCunningham for creating WikiWikiWeb. Someday I hope we can continue our discussion of 
Jaynes' OriginOfConsciousness...

As to my current activities, I am a drop-out from software engineering after 23 years, now living as a writer and a late-life graduate student. Such a relief!

''Could you tell us who is paying your bills, how hour family is understanding your decisions and where do you want to go to-morrow?''

Sure, happy to. First of all, paying the bills is possible because my wife and I have always lived a bit below our means and saved against just these sorts of life changes. We also continue to live well but frugally - we eat most of our meals at home, have older but paid-for, well-maintained vehicles, and have parties for entertainment rather than going out on the town (all my colleagues are equally poor, but sure know how to have a good time. Our get-togethers really rock!). I won't say that the transition wasn't difficult. Cutting our income stream by two-thirds created some psychological stress, but actual effects from that reduction were pretty minor. We discovered how much money we threw away just for the sake of convenience or out of ignorance. Our pace is now slower, and having time to think more and do less results in a greater appreciation for all that we have and a near erasure of the entire consumer mentality that we used to carry as a barrier against the excessive "busy-ness" of American life. I'm now teaching English composition through an assistantship and contemplating a doctoral program in Applied Linguistics after I finish this program. I've never been happier in my life, nor loved going to work more than I do now. And you know something - nobody in my milieu ever talks about the stock market, real estate prices, or how much money they wish they had. It's all about ideas, books, film, art, theatre, poetry, and life. And everyone is SO good looking!

Beautiful passage, Don. This and your contributions to GetaLife have stopped me in my tracks today. It does make the domain name on your email address ring strangely. :)

Hi Don, I've updated GetaLife and WayToWin with my more recent developments.

I admire what you've done and the liberated state you've achieved. Although events have moved me away from Flagstaff and Sedona, I've found an environment that serves, and which provides the means to fuel the transition.

Thanks for your input.  It took me longer than it should have to realize that the carrot I chased was held by someone who realized more benefit from my efforts than I ever did.  Switching from a FalseMotive to something attainable has helped restore my courage.
