PhD student of ProgrammingLanguage''''''s at PUC-Rio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

I consider myself JustaProgrammer and JustaStudent, and am very fond of dynamic languages. My MSc dissertation was  about interfacing the LuaLanguage to the .NET CommonLanguageRuntime. I was a member of the Lua.Net project, at

http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/luanet

and I amd the author of a Lua to .NET bridge and a Lua to .NET compiler (it converts Lua bytecodes to CIL).

Just started my PhD, so I have four more years to go (until 2009).
