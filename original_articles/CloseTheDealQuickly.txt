[Part of the NegotiatingPatternLanguage]

In some circumstances, such as sales, if the potential customer/client leaves the negotiations he/she will NeverComeBack. For many buyers, selecting a job offer is an example of the BeautyContestProblem, so either you have to convince them that ''your'' offer is the best they will get, or else they will leave. (Of course, if they do come back to your showroom, you have them at an advantage -- but that's generally rare). So it is a good idea to CloseTheDealQuickly. Some ways to do this:

* Give them a DeadlineToAccept. "This offer is only good today" can be a surprisingly effective technique, especially against an unskilled negotiator.

* Alternatively, give them a carrot for closing the deal early ("if you buy this car today, we'll throw in a free tank of gas!")

* Even if you have no other offers, act like you have MoreThanOneOffer. Especially if the resource being bought is scarce (only one job opening, only one loss-leader on the lot), let they buyer know (or make the buyer think) they are in competition with someone else, and only the first to accept will get the deal.

''Please note that the "techniques" described here are mostly bullshit. If you want to create long term relationships you need to treat your customers/business partners properly. You keep me by treating me right every time. You lose me by bullshitting me exactly once.''
