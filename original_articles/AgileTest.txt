AgileTest from Polygenix (http://www.polygenix.com/ BrokenLink WaybackMachine disabled by robots.txt) is a commercial tool that generates JavaLanguage '''Imposters''' (dynamically generated MockObject''''''s) at the bytecode level. ImposterObject''''''s can mock any non-final interface ''or class''. AgileTest also generates '''Interlopers'''. InterloperObject''''''s enable dynamic object substitution at any point in the class under test, allowing for comprehensive mock-based testing of non-parameterized object collaborations.

Polygenix AgileTest is (or was when it was available) free for non-commercial use.
