TheCppStandardsCommittee has a web site at http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/ which gives an archive of the debate about the current CeePlusPlus standard, C++11.

The official name of the committee is JTC1/SC22/WG21 and it is the international standardization working group for the programming language C++.

C++ is developed in an unusually open process, though official membership of ANSI in particular requires an annual fee.  Other national bodies set their own policies.  Many members of the committee read the newsgroup comp.std.c++, which also serves as a conduit for defect reports regarding published standards.
