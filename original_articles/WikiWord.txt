	'''WikiWord''':	A WikiCase "word" which identifies and links WikiPage''''''s. It is an amalgamation of two or more words composed of at least two letters each, without intervening white spaces, where the first letter of each component word is capitalized and the remaining letters are in lowercase.
 
An equivalent term, WikiName, is taken to mean the same. (Note: this definition of WikiWord/WikiName is specific to this wiki. Another wiki may use differing definitions and implementations.)
 
The enormous power of WikiWord''''''s is that they function as ''words''. That allows you to frame very complex statements in a very concise language, and to say things whose subtext can be supplied and altered communally, and non-locally in time. This makes explicit a key attribute of UniversalMind.
