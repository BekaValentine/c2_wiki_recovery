Richard Edwards

I'm a web developer. I've been using computers since they were introduced to desktops. My complete resume is at http://www.angelfire.com/ca/redwards 

I'm a beekeeper. I've been keeping honeybees since the US was "killer bee"-free. Now I do swarm removals in my immediate area only.
