TestingFramework for RegressionTesting of programs written in the PythonLanguage. 

In time for  the release of Python 2.1, the 'Py''''''Unit' framework has been voted into the Python Standard Library, shipped with Python itself. This probably makes it the definitive Python XUnit. For those using earlier versions of Python there is a standalone distribution too. See http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/ for more information and documentation. -- StevePurcell

Py''''''Unit can be found in recent releases of Python under the module name "unittest"; see http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-unittest.html
