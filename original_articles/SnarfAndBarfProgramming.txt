Synonym for CopyAndPasteProgramming.

SnarfAndBarfProgramming is like what happens when you do some refactorings.
	* Copy a mess of code from another area that just about works (the Snarf)
	* Paste in into a new area (the Barf)
	* Make it work for the new context
	* Find the similarities
	* OnceAndOnlyOnce like a madman

I think that "SnarfAndBarfProgramming" should really does (or should) only refer to the copy and paste steps.
You should do the refactoring part, but that doesn't strike me as something deserving the term "SnarfAndBarfProgramming."
