In the United States, I have a close friend named Jim Forest. When I first met him eight years ago, he was working
with the Catholic Peace Fellowship. Last winter, Jim came to visit. I usually wash the dishes after we've finished the
evening meal, before sitting down and drinking tea with everyone also. One night, Jim asked if he might do the
dishes. I said, "Go ahead, but if you wash the dishes you must know the way to wash them." Jim replied, "Come on,
you think I don't know how to wash the dishes?" I answered, "There are two ways to wash the dishes. The first is to
wash the dishes in order to have clean dishes and the second is to wash the dishes in order to wash the dishes." Jim
was delighted and said, "I choose the second way - to wash the dishes to wash the dishes." From then on, Jim knew
how to wash the dishes. I transferred the "responsibility" to him for an entire week.

Last summer I spent a week at Plum Village (http://www.plumvillage.org) and heard several of his lectures - he is very charismatic person, even if you don't buy everything he is saying.

Plum Village is a nice place for a vacation, if you have EasternWuss tendencies. Not ZenAsJapaneseBootCamp, but rather BuddismLite: lots of children around and a schedule that leaves visitors time to reflect. And wash the dishes.
