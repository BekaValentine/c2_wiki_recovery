The Dada Engine is a system for generating random text from grammars. It compiles and runs on (most) UNIX-like systems. Other similar program is rmutt.

The format resembles C in some way (including the preprocessor macros). Rules, expressions, variables, etc are supported.

Example file is:
 factoid:  "they are watching us" | "things go better with Coke"
         | "the woodpecker never bashes his brains out"
         | ["love"|"greed"|"angular momentum"] " makes the world go round"
 #ifdef UNIX
         | "motd is not a daemon but a text file"
 #endif
 ;
