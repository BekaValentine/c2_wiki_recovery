If the EigenValue's magnitude is greater than 1, 
it equals (1 + interest rate) [''or 1 + growth rate if that's clearer to you''].

If the EigenValue's magnitude is less than 1, 
it equals (1 - decay rate).

If the EigenValue's magnitude is 1, the system neither grows nor decays.
It might flip-flop or cycle, though.

If the EigenValue is a complex number,
it indicates a cycling system.

''How about combinations of EigenValue''''''s? It's not all scaling; what makes multiplication by one matrix do a reflection, and another a rotation?''

If the EigenValue is -1,
multiplying by it does a reflection 
(which is also a 180 degree rotation).

If the EigenValue is a negative real number,
multiplying by it does a reflection (and a scaling).

If the EigenValue is i,
multiplying by it is the same as rotating 90 degrees.
After 2 rotations, you will do a reflection.
After 4 rotations, 
you will wrap all the way around.
This is a cycle.

If the EigenValue is a complex number,
multiplying by it does a rotation (and a scaling).
After several rotations, 
you will eventually wrap all the way around.
This is a cycle.
