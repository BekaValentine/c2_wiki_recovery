If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely 100
people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it would
look something like the following. 
 
		  There would be:
 
			_57 Asians
			_21 Europeans
			_14 from the Western Hemisphere, (both north and South) 
			__8 Africans
			_52 would be female
			_48 would be male
			_70 would be non-white
			_30 would be white
			_70 would be non-Christian
			_30 would be Christian
			_89 would be heterosexual
			_11 would be homosexual
			__6 people would possess 59% of the entire
                                world's wealth
				and all 6 would be from the United States
			_80 would live in substandard housing
			_70 would be unable to read
			_50 would suffer from malnutrition
			__1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
			__1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
			__1 would own a computer

When one considers our world from such a perspective, the need for both acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly apparent. 



As software developers, the bottom one is the only one that matters.

Hmm, the above formatting presents itself *extremely strangely* in my Netscape 3.0 browser.  ''(I worked around the formatting--it was triggering the numeric list handling.)''

1/3 of the people in the US own a computer.  So there has to be more
than 1% of the world who owns a computer.  Perhaps these are old figures.

11% homosexuals is too big.  Perhaps that is the percent of people 
who have performed a homosexual act.  Some cultures have almost no
homosexuals.  Are there ''any'' cultures with 11% homosexuals?
There must be some bisexuals.

''Are we sure it's not that some cultures are so intolerant of homosexuals that they don't reveal themselves rather than be, for example, beheaded?'' -- KatieLucas

Actually ,statistically, about 10-11% of the world's population is homosexual.
If one were to count everybody who had even a single homosexual experience as 
gay, that figure would move up to 50%.                                        


White/non-white is imprecise.  Usually someone who is half European
is considered non-white.  Or three-quarters.  Or seven-eighths.
I wonder how they counted South American cultures that are a mixture of
Spanish and native american?  

I don't believe that 70% of people can't read.  China has a good literacy
program, and it has one third of the population.  Literacy in Africa is
poor, but it doesn't have as many people.  Literacy in India is poor, and
it has more people.  But I bet over half of all people over 8 can read.
Maybe the literacy rate is so low because they are counting babies.

But this is all beside the point.  You can't teach tolerance with statistics.
You have to get to know people who are different from yourself.  A South
African once told me that the biggest force for racial unity in South
Africa (during the time of apartheid) was the army, because it forced a
lot of white men to work with, depend on, and get to know black men, and
so ruined their stereotypes.  Better communication and more interaction are what
will help us get along better, not statistics.  Statistics just make us
start to argue about how they were gathered and whether they are accurate.

The world literacy rate, including kids, is probably 70-80%.  I think 70 people would be able to read.
