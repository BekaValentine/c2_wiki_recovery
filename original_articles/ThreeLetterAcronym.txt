ThreeLetterAcronym can be further contracted to TLA, which is self-referential, or meta-referential. Where are Achilles and the Turtle when you need them?


TLAs are attempts by people in the IT industry to emulate the efficiency of computers. This does lead to efficiencies when communicating with other people who work in the same domain, but often obfuscates issues for non technical people (NTP) who tend to assume we are all elitist gits. --BryanDollery

''Where are Achilles and the Turtle when you need them?''

Achilles had overtaken the Tortoise, and had seated himself comfortably on its back. 'So you've got to the end of our race-course?' said the Tortoise. 'Even though it does consist of an infinite series of distances? I thought some wiseacre or other had proved that the thing couldn't be done.'
