In constructing a WikiWord or other Linking, we establish an order of sorts. Sometimes Adjective''''''Noun words, other times Noun''''''Gerund and other combinations of two or more parts of speech. It is usual to put the most important first. When extending a WikiWord beyond those first used on this wiki (WardsWiki) to include DateTags and other alphanumeric combinations, the order of the used extension (Number last, or Number first) emphasizes what is most important (especially if one sorts these creations for inclusion in lists or establishing storage hierarchies).

Thus DocumentName20120917 or 20120917DocumentName are different representations. The first, to organize by name, the second to organize by date. In a FederatedWiki, perhaps you can have either or while having only one artifact, so that DocumentName20120917 and 20120917DocumentName are treated as aliases for a single unique document. You might even go so far as to use something like My''''''WorkingDocumentName Alias''''''Includes 20120917 & Document''''''Name. This is one usage scheme you can use to achieve InversionAndRearrangment

In the SmallestFederatedWiki as proposed by WardCunningham, usages might also include something like FederatedWikiDisplay AliasIncludes (20120917 & DocumentName & 20120902) to show two different versions based on date. The basis need not be date, but might use author, site, publication, etc as distinctions.
