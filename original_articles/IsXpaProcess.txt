I was stunned by a statement by KentBeck at the XpTwoThousandAndOne that he doesn't see XP as a process.

Now I ask myself: "what is it then, after all?"
	* a state of mind
	* an attitude
	* a "methodology" (whatever that is)
	* a problem solving strategy
	* a set of values/principles/practices
	* a social contract
	* ...?

For me, my understanding changed over time. I was first focussed on the practices. Later on the practices became only means to set the values in place. The longer I do XP, the more I like to see it as an attitude. --DierkKoenig

To compare with ShuHaRi, XP is a process on the Shu level, but maybe more of an attitude on the Ri level...
