I live in Portland, OR (Sellwood). Work at HP as a WebServices software engineer.   Java, J2EE & XML are my tools of choice (especially useful are XDoclet, Castor and Ant).

p.s, I still don't understand why a lot of personal wiki pages are written in the ThirdPerson.  Just to let you know, I'm not important enough for someone else to write mine, hence the first person dialog that I am having with you, dear reader.
