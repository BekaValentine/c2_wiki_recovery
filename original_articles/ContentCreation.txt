This is a ContentCreationWiki, with a primary focus on generating content rather than classifying it.

ContentCreation is focussed on providing information for readers about the topics being covered. This involves updating with new releases of software which is documented and also making new links and updates among the things which are here already. Some of the information is dated. This often provides a history of how this site developed. Development of the structure is focussed on the needs of readers. -- JohnFletcher
