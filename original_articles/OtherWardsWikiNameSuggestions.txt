There have been many name suggestions for what is currently WardsWiki.  Hopefully, someday, something imaginative and catchy will spring up from the collective minds of the masses.

What makes a good name?

	* Something short.
	* Something catchy.
	* Something imaginative.
	* Something humorous.
	* ...and not flavoured with hummus.
