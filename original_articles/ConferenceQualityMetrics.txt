Back when I was a frequent flier I used to rate conferences based on the following criteria.
	* Did sessions begin and end on schedule?  Yes or No.
	* In the sessions that you attended, what percentage of the presentations listed in the final program actually happened?
	* If you submitted a paper, was feedback from the session chair clear and reliable?  Yes or No.
	* How many times were you left twiddling your thumbs because of a projector problem?
You will note in particular that the acceptance rate of the conference is ''not'' on the list.

More cynically, I would rate the venue based on minimal standards of comfort as well as the availability of food and coffee.  I have a peeve against hotels that let the coffee run out and/or that whisk everything away promptly at the end of the scheduled break.  To deprive me of coffee because a poorly organized session ran 15 minutes past its end time is to add insult to injury.
