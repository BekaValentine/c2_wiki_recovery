''[Editing note: Should this category be combined with a bunch of the other categories covering silliness on this Wiki? Or not, what say ya?]'' I agree, but could find much.

There seem to be lots of silly songs on WardsWiki, either written by the posters here, or by other persons on the Internet (and widely distributed).  Since I find this stuff amusing, I've created a category for these.

Please respect copyrights, of course...
