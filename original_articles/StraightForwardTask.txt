A StraightForwardTask is a task that is similar enough to prior work that its effort and risk can be readily predicted. It contains no known places where  new technical art must be created.

Sometimes a StraightForwardTask can take weeks, months, or years -- StraightForwardTask is not a synonym for "quick" or "easy". The phrase characterizes the predictability of the task, not its duration or effort.

In this context, it is used in contrast to "InventionRequiredTask" or "TrivialTask".

Writing a wrapper for a library with tens of function calls and datatypes is a StraightForwardTask.
