Autumn 2013: Occasional drop-in to the Smallest Federated Wiki hangout.

Autumn 2012: Have been working with Disney in Seattle for a year, going to Software Craftsmanship meet-ups, studying Scala at Coursera and trying out remote discussion groups via Google Hangout.

Autumn 2011: Looking for my Next Big Thing, digging into code katas and reaching out to the Seattle technical community.

Previous point of interest: had a sticker from http://arxta.net on my laptop.  Artisanal Retro-Futurism X Team-Scale Anarcho-Syndicalism.  (No, it's not about mining the Moon for cheese...it's "back to the future" with Agile development).

From August 2005 through July 2011... trying to bring agility to Google with limited success.  Following other agilistas on Twitter.

Worked at Plumtree Software in SF from February 2003-Aug 2005 on cross-platform single-source development.

I enjoyed the AgileDevelopmentConference July 2003 in Salt Lake City.  Maybe I'll be back for 2010?

I had a good trip to XP2001 (http://www.xp2001.org) in Sardinia.  Anyone else? 
Regrettably my pictures didn't come out.

Found c2.com's WikiSpace via a set of contacts at 1998's LinuxWorld conference,
and thence to the SiliconValleyPatternsGroup.  Known there as a note taker and 
sometime artist. 

I first ran across ChristopherAlexander's A PatternLanguage on the bookcase 
of a summer sublet, and had no idea that it had been adopted by software designers.

Summer 2001 - 2002. Contracting part-time.
April 2001 - At Sendmail Inc. until a layoff.

From 7/2000 to 2/2001, working in an ExtremeProgramming team as a Java servlet developer at EvantSolutions in SF.  Loved it.

Previous to that, as a Java servlet developer at Time''''''Dance [http://www.timedance.com] (RIP) in SiliconValley.

Before that, for 2 years as as an Internet firewall specialist in San Francisco.

mailto:jsmiller@acm.org ''(so that's where the spam has been coming from!)''

Since my dad programs the accelerator at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(his 2nd career after high energy physics), that makes me a SecondGenerationProgrammer.  I might be among the last of the 
PunchCardGeneration.

I might be a GentlePersonAfflictedWithPeculiarNotions like PeterMerel if I 
had someone to conspire with.

Wiki looks cute, but strange, in the Scamper browser in SqueakSmalltalk.  Now if I could only figure out where the Back button was...

Thanks for your contributions to the hangout - I would like to be there every week, but a busy schedule prevents it.
