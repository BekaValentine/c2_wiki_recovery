Forked off of YagniAndDatabases.

To what extent do YouArentGonnaNeedIt interact with SpikeSolution''''''s?  You say that you need a database because you did a SpikeSolution and you know that you won't scale to what the users ultimately require without one, but you put off doing anything about it because YouArentGonnaNeedItYet?

In that case do you even need to do the SpikeSolution, if you already know that FlatFile''''''s won't do the job?  Isn't skipping that extra research work the SimplestThing (see also PerlVirtueLaziness)?

Does this fit within a more general discussion of YagniAndSystemArchitecture?  Some discussion of system architecture found in YagniIsBologna.  See also CanAnArchitectureEmerge.
