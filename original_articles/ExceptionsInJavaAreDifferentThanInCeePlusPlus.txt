The exception facilities in JavaLanguage are completely different from those in CeePlusPlus, so a good programmer should take different approaches to exception handling (and almost everything else) when programming in these two very different languages.

Consider this statement: "if you just declare that you throw the exception then you are not catching it and logging the context in which the exception occurred."  That might be true for a C++ program, but that isn't true in Java.  Java carries a complete stack trace back to the handling code.
