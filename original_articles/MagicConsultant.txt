This one:
	* Flies in
	* Waves his magic wand over whatever your problems are
	* Leaves

Next time you have the same problem you've got no choice but to summon our friend to repeat his magic. A classic symptom of this is when you find yourself wondering "who was that masked man" as he leaves. Or when people point to parts of their project and say "don't touch that it was done by consultants, it works but nobody here knows why."
