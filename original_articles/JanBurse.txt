Hi all, we are trying to use WikiWeb to develop the core
of a description language for agent-based simulations in 
social science.

My job is to describe the ArtificialStockMarket model by
BrianArthur. Others have other models assigned. In the
end we will look at all the descriptions.

The ArtificialStockMarket model is described in a paper 
from the SantaFeInstitute. A stripped down version, without
genetic algorithms is included in the SwarmSimulationPackage.
For educational purposes we have produced a version for
the QuicksilverSimulationPackage.
