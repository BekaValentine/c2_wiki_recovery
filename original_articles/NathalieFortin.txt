I have my Wiki for a few months now and this morning I was going through the help menu of my Wiki to learn more of what I can do with it and how to edit it, and I found this site! Thought I would add my name to it.

I'm currently new as a Webmaster and still experimenting.

If you want to take a look at my wiki, it is located at http://www.nathaliefortin.biz/wiki .

It is only, or mostly, in french but I'm fluently bilingual French-English, and also intermediate in German. So don't hesite to drop me a line or two!

Can also be reach at moi@nathaliefortin.biz .
