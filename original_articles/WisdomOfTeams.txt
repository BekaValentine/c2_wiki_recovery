[ISBN: 0887306764] The authors define "high-performance teams" as those teams that produce far more together than the sum of the individual members working separately. Such teams use dynamic task assignment to play to each other's strengths. The authors offer no advice for manufacturing such teams, which they find to form only occasionally and spontainously, other than to note that they only form in organizations that value real productivity. So called "team building" exercisies don't seem to help.

It is interesting to compare this work to ExtremeProgramming. Where they overlap they agree, though this volume considers teams of various function while xp concerns itself with only programming and can offer much more concrete advice. -- WardCunningham
