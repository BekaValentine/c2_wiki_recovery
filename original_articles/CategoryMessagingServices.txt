'''Underutilised but important category?''' DeleteWhenCooked

I suggest all pages with Soap, Rest (RestArchitecturalStyle), etc should be tagged with this category. 
* And yes I have seen PleasePleaseDontCategorizeEveryPageOnWiki, but I think this is a very important category. 
* prompted by seeing the page JabberAndSoap without appropriate categories at all

Changed mind. I have created CategoryWebServices (itself being category as CategoryM''''''essagingServices) instead.
