Prototypes are very indicative of what a function/method/object
does. A good programmer can scan quickly an object definition
and its methods in prototype form and discover if it fits.

Looking at prototypes encourages people to think in terms
of encapsulation. Basically the question being asked is
"Does this method need any more or less information to give me
this result?". If the answer is yes then there is a design
error in the method, its object or somewhere else.


I (EwanBirney) personally like the IDL language for quick
prototype check, using DesignInIdl even though I rarely use CORBA (IDL's main
implementing system) in real life
