I believe WinstonChurchill said: "Montgomery: In defeat indomitable, in victory insufferable."

TheFullMonty is also quite pervasive in the erotic media industry. It has a variety of meanings, depending on context ... but I suspect most are apparent without further explication here.

The Full Monty movie is very funny where a group of men from Sheffield who are on the dole hit on the idea of stripping to make some money. Very, very funny.
