'' 'Tis one of the relics Brother Maynard carries with him.''

The specifications here couldn't be clearer: ''First shalt thou take out the holy pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceedest to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then, lobbest thou thy holy hand grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shalt snuff it. -- Armaments 2:18-21''

Arthur & all assembled: "Nahmen"

And yet Arthur blew it. He counted: 1, 2, 5.

[''Arthur's numerical dyslexia was a very subtle running gag until now...'']

''Three sir!''

["Run away! Run away! (''Retreat, sir!'') Retreat!"]

''Well of course King Arthur blew it. Do you expect managers to be able to understand a specification?''

Fortunately, the specification contained sufficient margin of error that the "cute widdle bunny" died anyway...
