A knock-knock joke is a good example to use when one of your non-geek friends asks you what a "protocol" is.  It has a standard initiation message, followed by a standard acceptance message, a send-and-echo, and a final message that ends the transaction.

Some of the more interesting knock-knock jokes are those where the protocol is violated, such as the banana/orange and Philip Glass jokes above.
