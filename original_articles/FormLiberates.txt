FormLiberates is not just about rhyme schemes in poetry.  It also describes the latitude given to the XP programmers when they follow tightly set coding conventions and instant regression testing.  It lets them move fast, drop ego and code ownership and build up team playing.  It takes more discipline than I have ever been able to gather on a project for its start, but gives freedom of movement later.  Also more or less what one of the programmers on the project told me.  -- AlistairCockburn
