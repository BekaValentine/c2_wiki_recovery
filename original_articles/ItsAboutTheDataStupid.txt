After working on distributed systems for many many years
i have come to the conclusion that seeing the world as
distributed objects doesn't work as well as i had orginially
hoped because distributed
objects require too much common complexity to stay nimble
and light. DOs require you to buy into complex frameworks
which eventually kill you.

Modeling the distributed world as data flow preserves maximum
flexibility while maintaining a great deal power. You don't get the same
power of a DO system but, like the beetle, its simplicity
and robustness may keep it around while more complex
organisms have died off...again.
