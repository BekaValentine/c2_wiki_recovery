SortAndBuild clarifies something for me. When I was first introduced to patterns, I thought they were in fact supposed to be low-level, and I was dubious about whether they could be complete. Then I learned more about them, and found myself agreeing that these were valid patterns... but I hadn't realized until now that they're higher-level than my initial conception. Looking into low-level patterns seems as if it would be fascinating, though. -- DanielKnapp
