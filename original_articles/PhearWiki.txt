pHEAR WiKI is hosted at: http://linux.wareseeker.com/Miscellaneous/phear-wiki-.02.zip/340826 (as near as i can see)

pHEAR WiKI is a quick hack of a wiki that was put together in a day (plus another day to package and document).  The main focus is ease of administration,  relatively simple install, and ease of use (especially for the non-wiki initiated).	

Some of the features include:

	* Administration abilities: 
		* easy backup and restore of Wiki data files
		* database compacting
		* page deletion
		* page version control (restore old versions of pages), 

	* Easy to edit and create new pages
	* Keyword highlighting: assign keywords to a page that are highlighted in other pages
	* Simple keyword searching
	* URL Archiving
	* Embedable commands for enhanced Wiki'ing
	* Easy template system to fit wiki into your site

'''''This is the first wiki ever (that I know of) that has a create a page function.''''' 
Well, you can always type in a URL like http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?edit=SomeRandomNewPageName2 for WardsWiki (and most others). But having explicit access to add a new page name is a nice feature, yes. -- KarlKnechtel

... After looking at it: I was rather expecting a form box where you'd type the new page title and hit Submit, and go to an edit page - putting that text field on the actual editing page works fine too, though. I also like the separation of "Name" and "Title" - although for ZincWiki I intend to provide PolymorphicWikiPageTitles, I anticipate that there will be a need for a page to provide a "canonical title" as well as a "page key" ("name" in PhearWiki parlance) for the database.
