I arrived here through the WWW Collaboration Projects [http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~liberte/www/collaboration.html] page.

I'm building an internal knowledge web for my company [http://www.fourgen.com/] and am on the lookout for tools that will make the web come alive. This is very promising.

One concern I have is that our http server is NT-based. I'd like to implement a WikiWikiWeb at work, but so far I'm not clear on how I'll do it on an NT.
