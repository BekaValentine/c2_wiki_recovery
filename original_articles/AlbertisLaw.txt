Here is another liability: beautiful drawings can become ends in themselves. 

Often, if the drawing deceives, it is not only the viewer who is enchanged but also the maker, who is the victim of his own artifice. 

Alberti understood 
* this danger and pointed out that architects should not try to imitate painters and produce lifelike drawings. 
* The purpose of architectural drawings was merely to illustrate the relationship of various parts... 
* as many architects of today do not, that the rules of drawing and the rules of building are not one and the same
* mastery of drawing does not ensure success in building.
