An excerpt: 
	* Book 4 (Metal)
	* Chapter 6

Hearing a disturbance, the master programmer went into the novice's cubicle.

"Curse these personal computers!" cried the novice in anger, 
"To make them do anything I must use three or even four editing programs.
Sometimes I get so confused that I erase entire files.  
This is truly intolerable!"

The master programmer stared at the novice.
"And what would you do to remedy this state of affairs?" he asked.

The novice thought for a moment.  "I will design a new editing program,"
he said, "a program that will replace all these others."

Suddenly the master struck the novice on the side of his head.
It was not a heavy blow, but the novice was nonetheless surprised.
"What did you do that for?" exclaimed the novice.

"I have no wish to learn another editing program," said the master.

And suddenly the novice was enlightened.
