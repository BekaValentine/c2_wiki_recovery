Let everyone decide who to accept edits from, and how to merge and cherry-pick content on their own copy of C2. Yes, this is much the same as the old CvWiki idea - but with decentralized content this could actually work. StewardsKillCeeTwo. Instead of police let the stewards act as Ward's MergeTrustee''''''s and let's get this whole show back on the road again.

The C2 wiki itself would then simply be Ward's merge of the results of the work of his stewards. This should be practically no work for Ward and not too much for anyone else to manage - because a steward will pick their own stewards, and so on and so on.

The KevinBacon effect means this way C2 should be able to cover pretty much the entire world of geeks in just 6 steps ...

''Interesting idea. There exist wikis which can be backed by DistributedVersionControl systems like GitVersionControl. In this case, you get the choice of editing individual pages at a time via the familiar web forms or checking out the entire wiki to make sweeping changes across the whole thing. Several of my dev projects currently use IkiWiki, for example. The problem: merging is hard! Also, existing distributed tools would work at the granularity of the entire state of the wiki, whereas we would probably only care about branching and versioning individual pages. --IanOsgood''
