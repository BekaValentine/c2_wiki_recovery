Some programming languages and environments provide good search facilities for finding things like methods calls. The prime example, the SmalltalkLanguage, allows you to look for all the senders of a given message. You can exploit this feature to bookmark points in your code that you want to come back to by adding, say, a 
''toDo:'' method to 
''Object''. You can then say:
  aThingyWidget 
    disconnect;
    toDo: 'make sure everything is cleaned up properly'

The implementation of ''toDo:'' might be empty or might write its parameter to a log. When you go to production, you make sure that there are no senders of ''toDo:'' left in the code. In other languages, you could add a method to some debugging or infrastructure class, in the same way that people have assertion classes. -- SteveFreeman
