For those of you who haven't read it yet, I heartily
recommend James Gleick's biography of RichardFeynman,
''Genius''.
I'm sure that at least some of you used Feynman's physics
text at school. It is a fascinating view
of a truly amazing individual.

Additionally, ''Thinking Allowed'' recently aired a one 
hour interview with Murray Gell-Mann, which was proved
a very entertaining. Insights from one of the preeminent
physicists of the 20th century. Their number is 1-800-999-4415.
the tape is $3x.xx, and, I think, worth it.
