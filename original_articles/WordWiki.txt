A WordWiki is a wiki based on any kind of Word, instead of pages based on WikiWords, being an experimental idea only. Thus any and every word can become a page. In a F''''''ileBasedWiki, whether or not it is to be treated as a link is dependent upon whether or not the word has a corresponding WikiPage.

In this kind of wiki, even word constructions which are not usually considered to be words and which may be composed of numbers or mixed number/character words can be considered links to pages. Examples: (2008, May2008, 6Examples, ThomasAEdison, foo, getPage). 

In a WordWiki, any of the above word constructions could be made to reference pages, and thus become links to a page (file) having a name which uses the same characters as the constructed word.
