There is a userdefined TwinPage on MeatBall, inviting collective research and discussion on this SocialAnnotation community.


TrailFire calls their annotations TrailMarks. Each TrailMark is addressable by its own URL. A FireTrail is an automatically generated WebRing on the fly, that can be initiated by every user. It consists of TrailMark'''''s, which can be edited in RichText as in HTML-mode. TrailMark""s are automagically sequenced, if they are under the same FireTrail name. TrailMarks allow embedded MP3- and video-objects.  

There is a TrailFire trail in wiki-mode, called DiigoTrailfireWikiCollaboration, inviting interested pioneers of this innovation. At least one of the marks in this trail annotates this page. Annotations of wikis reduce the workload of the annotated wiki, allowing unobtrusive annotations and at the same time notifications to the resp. wiki page visitors, that the wiki page is annotated.
