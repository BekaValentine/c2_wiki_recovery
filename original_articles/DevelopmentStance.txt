A development stance is a set of often loosely related ideas or heuristics that characterize how software developers view their tasks.  The term is meant to help us visualize a literal ''physical'' stance:  how (and where, and when) we stand when we face the challenges that our work provides us.

Contrast a development stance with a development method.  A stance is more loosely defined than a method.  A method certainly implies a stance, and vice versa.  But the relationship is not one-to-one:  Although some modern software development methods make much of their differences from one another, from a development stance point of view, these are just intramurals.  Booch and OMT, for instance, differed in method but not, by and large, in stance, thus their (somewhat uneasy) merger.

A development stance may also influence the naming of the methods.
The ThoughtPattern evoked from DefensiveProgramming is not the same as from OffensiveProgramming, and ExtremeProgramming give rise to altogether different ideas.
