I wanted to refer to 'the' LazyPattern, but was hit on the head with the number of hits of http:wiki?search=Lazy. I think a sensible pattern, category or summary page is in order, which I herewith create.

The following pages were identified as fitting into this category:

* CopyOnWrite
* ExplicitLazyEvaluation
* ExplicitLazyProgramming
* ImplicitLazyEvaluation
* JustInTime
* LazyEvaluation
* LazyEvaluationAndTransactionSemantics
* LazyEvaluationExampleInAssembly
* LazyEvaluationExampleInVisualBasic
* LazyEvaluationOverhead
* LazyInheritance
* LazyInitialization
* LazyInstantiationPattern
* LazyObject
* LazyObjectExample
* LazyOptimization
* LazyProxies

These links are now in CategoryLazyPattern.
