''Introduction to PageSeeder

PageSeeder is a system that allows threaded discussions to occur at multiple points throughout web pages. This is particularly useful for on-line reviewing of documents. It allows people to be registered for a discussion group so that they can access the pages and receive email notification of new postings. It also allows a group editor to create and modify new web pages and upload them to the discussion area. Below are some links to further information on PageSeeder.
