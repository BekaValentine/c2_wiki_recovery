This page last changed two years ago in April2002. I have a question to regarding events.

In MSDN DrGui's columns, an August 1999 article on COM events said "COM+ will bring some major changes to the world of events...".  Does anyone know whether there are still reasons why one would construct an event handling mechanism using COM (not COM+). If so, what is a situation that warrant this type of usage.

The article I am referring to is located at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnguion/html/msdn_drguion020298.asp.

Any Com gurus?
