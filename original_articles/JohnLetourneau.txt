I am a software engineer at Lucent Technologies in Columbus Ohio. My responsibilities include architecture and performance consultation to projects within Lucent. I am also an instructor for a few of the courses offered to Lucent software developers in the areas of architecture and performance; this keeps me flying around the country on a fairly regular basis. To reach me via email, my address is: topgun@lucent.com

My involvement in patterns started many years ago [BG - Before GoF] and has picked up lately with various project and other work activities. Hanging around BobHanmer and JimCoplien probably helped too 8-)

I'm currently working on a grand project with these and other people to bring together patterns in telecommunication systems; mostly software and some hardware context. My history in architecting, developing, testing, and field support of network element and peripheral support systems gives me a broad perspective on a variety of system types and requirements. All in all I have a great job.
