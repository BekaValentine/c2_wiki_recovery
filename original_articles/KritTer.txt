My real name is Chris Purcell, but I use my nickname '''Kritter''' (or '''KritTer''' in Wiki sites) exclusively online, except for MeatBall, so have used it here to be easily recognizable to others who already know me.

I am (currently; 2003-2006, ideally) a PhD student in ComputerScience at Cambridge University, England.

I was responsible for the introduction of page history and categories to the Wiki engine of the CocoaDev sister site. I am interested in Wiki Categories, NameSpace''''''s and the SemanticWeb, specifically SemanticWikiWikiWeb. I started the FacetWiki project in furtherance of these interests.
