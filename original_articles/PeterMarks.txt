I have been developing software since childhood. Having spent most of my working life as a freelance consultant and developer, I am increasingly of the belief that, as software developers, we should seek to regain our childish invention, playful experimentation and imagination.

I am currently working with JohnNolan and DavidKingLassman on a wild Internet technology project.

I am inspired by the ideas of ExtremeProgramming and the ProgrammersStone, and I am definitely in search of AsimplerWay.
