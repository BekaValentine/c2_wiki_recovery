The "End of Growth" describes a period in a civilization's growth where "the land runs out". ''Individualism'' must give rise to ''collaboration'', because at this phase everything one individual does affects everyone else. The Internet and the wiki are the semi-subconscious, nascent awareness of this. But it take a complete 180-degree turn for the true ParadigmShift to occur.

A way to realize this is to note that:  '''There is no amount of universe that can accomidate exponential growth'''.  We have a finite planet.  This economy has yet to realize that Industrialism must eventually give way to the CreativeEconomy -- part of which has been emerging ''right here'' on the wiki itself.  

Note:  We have a finite universe.  Nuclear energy would use the last vestige of energy from the BigBang, so it not a smart path.  NuclearPowerIsBetter is demonstrably false, a point mostly championed by TheKooks.

''All energy consumption uses "the last vestige of energy from the BigBang". Whether you use radiant energy from the sun or nuclear energy from rocks, using any of it in any way pushes us closer to entropy. There are unquestionably safety issues with nuclear power, especially fission-based approaches.  Hopefully, fusion-based approaches -- once they are viable -- will not only be safer, but they don't rely on rare "heavy" radioactive sources like uranium of which we may only have enough on this planet to last another 200 or so years if we continue to use fission power.''
