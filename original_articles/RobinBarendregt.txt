Hi!
Welcome to my rather primitive WikiWikiWeb page :-)
I'm a programmer with many interests. Professionally I try to do most development work using the SmalltalkLanguage however (hey, I'm lazy!). Currently I work for a company called Roots in Belgium. Need to know more? Just ask at 'eb.stoor@tgerdnerab.nibor' reverse
