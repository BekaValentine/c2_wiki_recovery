Free online training:

''(Limited access.  One course at a time.  Limited time only.)''

NetObjectives is creating "Streamzines" -- online on demand video broadcasts of entry-level training.

Their current plan is to offer one Streamzine a month.  Anyone can have free access for that month.
Sometime in the first quarter of 2006, they plan to start a fee-based service that would give you access to all past Streamzines.

'''[Reviews]'''

I viewed the "Introduction to Refactoring Streamzine."

It's listed as "30 to 35 minutes."  Content running time, with no pauses, is 25 minutes.  The "extra" 5 to 10 minutes is "pause time," during the presentation, where you're encouraged to read some of the more complex slides, think about what is being presented, and discuss the topic with others you may be watching with.  The time estimate seems reasonable.

I was '''impressed''' by the quality of the presentation.
It's an introductory course, for an audience of beginners who don't yet understand refactoring.
But it does a very good job of describing the various trade-offs of the risks and gains of conservative vs aggressive refactoring.
That is, it clearly describes the benefits of "taking small steps" in a refactoring, vs the risks of taking on several changes at once.
It encourages the student to think critically about the trade-offs they will make.

One nit-pick criticism:
The NUnit test screen doesn't match the program being refactored.
(But I've reported this to them, and they might fix it.)

Even without "fixing" my one nit-pick criticism above, I still rate this one of the best on-line Computer Based Training (CBT) sessions I've seen.
Technical quality of the presentation is very high.
Content is good, relevant, and deep enough to interest even an experienced practitioner.
And the speaker is quite listenable; good vocal tone and quality.

Give it a listen.  (Before the free online access expires!!!  ;-)  I don't think you'll regret it.
