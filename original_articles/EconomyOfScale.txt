Relative saving realized when the size of a plant, enterprise, etc., is increased. For example, lower production cost of an automobile due to production of a large number of cars of the same type is due to economy of scale. There may also exist a DISECONOMY OF SCALE where the increased size contributes to an increase in unit cost or a decrease in quality (see LeanThinking and EconomyOfScope).
