Greetings, Wiki.

I am a software developer from Truro, Cornwall, U.K. currently living and working in South Wales.

I have been 'lurking' here for some time (2 years?), and have finally got around to taking the plunge and contributing to this truly fantastic place. Long live Wiki!

Pages I have contributed to:

''Welcome to Wiki, Matthew. Thanks for contributing and for 'lurking'. As a fully-fledged WikiCitizen who's proud of being a contributor and to be identified as such, you might want to make a UserName. Thus all future contributions that you make will be rightfully credited to you, instead of to your IP address, thus giving you a more tangible footprint in the WikiCommunity. Just my suggestion. Again, welcome. -- CarlosNsRodrigues''

Thanks for the welcome, Carlos. I've made my username - very happy about it!
