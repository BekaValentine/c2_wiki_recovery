Imagine there was such as thing as an AgileSoftwareAward, with a committee of well known folks from the agile community. A bit like the Jolt awards but not such heavy focus on developer oriented software.

Do you think that would help people associate Agile approaches with excellent software?

Does the Gordon Pask award meet any of the critera for your idea? http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2005/07/30#gordon-pask

''Maybe. Although I'm interested in a more direct line: the common aim of the larger software community is to produce great software. An agile award scheme should reward this and reveal a relationship between great software and the principles and goals of agile development. Since the Gordon Pask award recognises 'Contributions to Agile Practice', I would say that it only has significance within the agile community.''

I'm trying to think of alternatives to an AgileMaturityModel. Certification programs in general go against the grain of agile development, but that doesn't mean that great agile software development teams should not be recognised as such.  --ChrisSteinbach
