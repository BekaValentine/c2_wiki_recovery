Ralph invented Snobol [SnobolLanguage], a string manipulation and pattern
matching language, while at BellLabs.

Icon [IconLanguage] is a pattern matching language with Pascalish syntax
done by Ralph and his students at Arizona.
The matching was generalized in a nice way by allowing all
operators and functions (even user-written functions) to
return both a value and a success/failure indicator. 

The only thing Pascalish about the syntax is the use of ':=' for assignment.
It doesn't use BEGIN/END for block delimiters.
