EditHint: the category is getting too big to visual list-scan (unless you have FastEyes). Perhaps this category topic could split existing MS topics into groups similar to:

* Specific Products
** Desktop products
** Server & enterprise products
** Languages & development tools
* Pro-Microsoft topics
* Anti-Microsoft topics
* General philosophy about Microsoft
* Other

Overlap is okay.
