When I went to start a company, the search for a 'cool' company name was pretty difficult.
Trying lots of stuff in a domain-name checker, it seemed like "all of the good ones are taken."
Common sources of arbitrary proper names are Latin and Greek words, and various Mythologies.

'''Danbala''' is a Haitian loa that happens to be a snake.  

Perhaps you've seen the movie ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'', 
or read the William Gibson book ''Count Zero''.

This seems to tie in pretty well to my great affection for the PythonLanguage.
