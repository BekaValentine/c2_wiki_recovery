You can't uninstall WindowsMessenger from WindowsXp.  Well, you're not supposed to be able to, at least.  C:\WINDOWS\INF\SYSOC.INF, globally replace HIDE with nothing, and you can magically uninstall quite a few things.

It's not so much the bundling that bothers me as MicroSoft forcing you to have a component on your system...
