Strine for "contagious eccentric to be shunned". The closest seppo equivalent is probably "communist". But then again seppoes are all RatBag(s).

''More specifically, a RatBag is someone who isn't shut up when you say NoWorries.''

RatBag can also be used semi-affectionately, just as "Bastard" has 18.5 shades of meaning.

having no clue what this meant, altavista told me +strine +seppo was on http://members.tripod.com/~thisthat/slang.html

it's an aussie slang reference.

according to this document, seppo = American, strine = lots of aussie slang said at once, and ratbag = not a nice person.

''See LetStalkStrine.''

("Strine" can be thought of as the word "Australian", pronounced with an Australian English accent, the first vowel and 'l' getting lost)

''Strictly speaking, only a RatBag would claim RatBag''''''s are not nice. The rest of us would say, NoWorries, they're part of our way of life.''

"seppo", of course, is rhyming slang. "Septic Tank" == "Yank".
----
What about "blighter"?

Likely from "Blighty" for UK, from Urdu "belaiti," European. Not a Strine word, but.
