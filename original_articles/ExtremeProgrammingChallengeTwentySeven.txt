''''ExtremeProgrammingChallengeTwentySeven - Using ExtremeProgramming techniques to manager the implementation of a ThirdPartyProduct.

I am currently working as a consultant for a SoftwareHouse implementing their products into Client organisations. I was wondering whether any of the techniques that form part of an ExtremeProgramming Project can be used to succesfully manage the implementation. There is a small amount of programming involved in creating interfaces between the product and other applications but the majority of the effort is in customising the toolset to match the business requirements. The Client has chosen the product but the actual requirements as to what is required by the end users are not defined. It seems to me that UserStories can provide some benefit in eliciting the UserRequirement''''''s but what other techniques can be used and how can they be applied? Has anyone tried this before and what were the results?
