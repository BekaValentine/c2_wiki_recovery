There are a few ways you can recover damaged pages using methods within and without the WikiWikiWeb.

From within WikiWikiWeb:
* EditPage followed by EditCopy from a previous author
** This will be the page as constructed in the previous edit
* Previous copies may be available in the edit history: http://c2.com/wiki/history
** The pages are stored in plain text and are limited in retention history to a few days. 

External to the WikiWikiWeb:
* CachedSnapshotOfPage
