One of the GreatResearchLabs.

XeroxCorporation, about the time they acquired ScientificDataSystems,
founded a research laboratory in the hills above Palo Alto, the Palo Alto Research Center.
It was only after an elite staff of scientists and
engineers had been recruited and assembled at the dedication
of the facilities that they were to hear of their mission:
invent the ''paperless office'' of the future. 

It was a good mission, though many thought it off the wall
at the time.  The group really did invent the office of
the future.  It just didn't turn out to be paperless.

Achievements include but are not limited to:

* Most of the GUI idioms that we now take for granted
* WYSIWYG proportional-font document editing (please confirm if you are in the know)
* Laser printers
* Improvements in Ethernet connectivity
* SmallTalk, essentially the first "dynamic" OOP language
* Arguably one of the greatest real-life Dilbertian failures as far as capitalizing on innovation, ranking right up there with the record company that rejected the Beatles because "guitar bands are on their way out".
