(''OopslaProgramCommitteeMembershipPatterns'')

Going from total immersion in a conference, to isolation
from the conference, is good neither for the conference
nor the chair.  The chair accumulates a wealth of experience
during her tenure, experience that should not go to waste.

The chair deserves a rest after a year of hard work on
behalf of a conference, yet should be given a place of
honor and influence in the successor conference:
Many cultures find esteemed positions of
background influence for leaders whose
formal responsibilities come to an end.

'''Therefore:'''  Invite last year's chair to
a prominent position on the ProgramCommittee.
The former chair can advise the current chair
in areas of the current chair's inexperience.

Chairs from prior years can add much to a program
committee as well, as long as one can avoid the
problem of too much leadership and not enough workers.

The authority of the current chair and wisdom of the
immediate past chair come into balance under the mutual
respect fitting their stations.
