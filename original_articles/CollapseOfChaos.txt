The title of a book by Cohen and Stewart. If simple rules can give rise to complex behaviour, and complex rules can also give rise to complex behaviour, where does all the simplicity come from?

The short answer is, because of abstraction. The complexity is there, but ignored. The book is generally on the subject of EmergentBehavior, and talks about, for example, how the laws of chemistry ''emerge'' from the laws of physics.
