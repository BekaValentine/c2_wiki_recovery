WikiTeam is the ArchiveTeam subcommittee for DigitalPreservation of all existing wikis; it has preserved tens of thousands of wikis on the InternetArchive. See http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiTeam.

Since 2011 we mostly focused on MediaWiki wikis, but we really want to expand. UseModWiki sites are the most valuable and sensible next target; it would only take a few lines of code for basic archival support. Anyone want to help? http://github.com/WikiTeam/wikiteam/issues/172
