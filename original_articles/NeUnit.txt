NE-Unit is a TestingFramework that is designed to let one user interface front-end share multiple testing back-ends.

This separation of user interface and test program provides several advantages:
	* Multiple TestingFrameworks can be used
	* If a C/C++ test crashes, the user interface does not crash with it
	* The test can be run independently from the testing front-end, allowing you to use your favourite debugger on just the test code.


Back-ends are available for the following languages:
	* C/C++
	* Python
	* PHP

The following front-ends are available:
	* A GUI front-end written in PyGTK
	* A command-line console term (with nice colored output)

Planned:
	* A Vim front-end
	* A web front-end

Tests for specific programs such as web applications or databases can be executed using specific test modules.
