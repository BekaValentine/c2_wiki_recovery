''Type case'' denotes a SwitchStatement-like construct that dispatches not on the value but on the (static or dynamic) type of a value or an object.

The GangOfFour VisitorPattern is a way to implement DoubleDispatch on the dynamic type of an object. More generally, ProgrammingLanguage''''''s that provide unions or sum types often also provide PatternMatching to implement dispatch on the type of an object.

TemplateSpecialization in CeePlusPlus is an example of dispatch on the static type of an object.
