''The truth is, as much as we would like, we don't have to know how something is designed or built, to use it '' DonaldNoyes.ThinkingOutLoud.20111008

I have moved to a new option in my quest to collect and make available information I need, or have an interest in. Instead of insisting on full control and knowledge about how a tool was built, or all of the design and build technology employed, if ItWorks for me to do what I want to do, I'll make use of it!

Certainly such things and privacy and security concerns are required if one is to intelligently utilize modern technology, but intricate, nuts and bolts knowledge is not required in order to make you more productive and allow you to use your time in searching, discovering, enjoying and saving the artifacts you require.

Be honest about what you know, what you don't know, and ask good questions.
