I wrote the WyPy 18 line Python wiki, and PwyKy, so I'm quite interested in wiki development, obviously.

QuickWeb is coming along great (i.e. fully working, good features, etc.), but I worry about the fundamental flaws of all Web systems: lack of a "starting place", and subsequent loss of information. Needs some kind of portal.

It would be great if Wiki-like systems could export all of the links in RDF, so one could browse the site from some kind of RDF-to-image conversion results. Of course, it would be difficult for really large wikis such as this one, but worth a try on some of the smaller ones. I think AaronSwartz is planning this for BlogSpace.
