Most people drink alcohol, some do not.

It would be nice if the ones who did refrained from asking the ones who do not why they choose not to drink ten times in a night.

Good reasons not to drink:

* It is a hard drug with similar consequences to other hard drugs - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1295099/?tool=pmcentrez and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2380692 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_effects_of_alcohol
* It is a neurotoxin - https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:q3yjJt0dVc8J:pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/10report/chap02e.pdf+&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESglZbcVcrADS1qTbIYWKCP81yQ2NJP30MRBoZuYSXoppTOgKLTtC90j43Pe7i3PpA2tyJCOBZFnoPCcKkJCzsnIJ35TVD8KKKfXws-GiFIWTV_uJFD1OU15OH2yUBozrnz7uJ4v&sig=AHIEtbTcelVEdeODJw9FnTNYxBdJdzlM1Q&pli=1
* Most people go over the recommended limit due the effect of impaired judgement
* Hangovers suck
* "She wasn't as pretty as I remembered"
* Heroin is fun too

To balance things out, good reasons to drink:

* It's fun
* To fit in
* Big girls need love too
** ''Only the inebriated like big girls? There's a certain Sir Mix-a-lot that would like to have a word with you.''
* You might get lucky with a normal sized girl
* Muscle relaxant effect helps you survive a transmat beam when your planet's blowing up
* It's fun
