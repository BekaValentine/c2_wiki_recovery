I'm David Jaquay.  I have a blog at http://djaquay.blogspot.com.

I code in PythonLanguage, (frequently for fun, and for profit when possible), JavaLanguage, CeeSharp, CeePlusPlus and CeeLanguage.

I also play GameOfChess (poorly), love/chase/photograph trains, study geology, admire creative types (while aspiring to do the same myself), and have a wonderful wife, son and daughter.

I can even be reached at mailto:djaquay@yahoo.com.  (I gave up on spam mangling a while back; Yahoo's spam filter is good enough for me.)

Dave
