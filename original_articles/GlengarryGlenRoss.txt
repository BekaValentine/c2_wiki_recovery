Glengarry Glen Ross was a 1992 movie based on a David Mamet play of the same name.  It was directed by James Foley and had a great cast, including Al Pacino, Alec Baldwin, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, and Jonathan Pryce.  In the film, an abusive sales motivator comes to chew out some burned out salesmen.  He tells them that the first prize for the monthly sales contest is a Cadillac, second prize a set of steak knives, and third prize - you're fired.  The men grouse that their sales leads are stale, but if they just got some good leads - the Glengarry leads the sales motivator dangles in their faces - they could find some of their former success.  The men try to find a way out of their predicament.  The next day, they come back to the office and find that the office has been burglarized and the leads have been stolen.  

A great character-driven film about how quickly men can go from high to low in the frustrating and exhilarating world of sales, which constantly tests their masculinity.
