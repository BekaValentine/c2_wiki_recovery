This page will soon be a useful RoadMap to using VersionControl with ExtremeProgramming.

Right now, it's just a semi-ordered list of version-control-related pages.  Feel free to
add value.

Starting points:

	'''ExtremeVersionControl / ExtremeVersionControlDiscussion''':	description of using VersionControl with XP
	'''XpVersionControlFaq''':	covers using CVS and why ContinuousIntegration won't kill you

	'''VersionControl''':	 
	'''ConfigurationManagement''':

MarcGirod added a family of pages on the general subject of SCM:
* SoftwareConfigurationManagement
* ConfigurationManagementOfSoftware
* ManagementOfSoftwareConfigurations
* SoftwareManagementOfConfigurations

There are some good practices you can apply to version control. Some work well with XP, others are rendered superfluous by it (e.g. ReviewBeforeCheckin), others are probably incompatible. Similarly there are some XP practices and recommendations that appear at odds with the conventional wisdom of version control.

* CommitEarlyAndOften
* ReduceSizeOfCheckIn
* CheckDiffsBeforeCommit
* ReviewBeforeCheckin ''some argue this is too heavyweight for XP''
* ManageConfigurationBackwards
* FrequentReleases
* SingleReleasePoint
** IntegrationMachine
** IntegrationToken
* UseOneCodeLine

There are a lot of version control packages out there:

* CVS -- ConcurrentVersionsSystem (FreeSoftware)
** SubVersion (replacement for CVS; also free)
** MetaCvs (client-side enhancement to CVS; free)
* GitVersionControl
* GnuArch
* MonoTone
* DavidsAdvancedRevisionControlSystem (darcs)
* BazaarNg
* PerforceVersionControl
* SourceSafe (MicroSoft's pony)
* ClearCase (Rational's)
* EnvyDeveloper

* Continuus
* Razor
* StarBase
* MKS SourceIntegrity/TrackIntegrity
* PVCS (PvcsVersionControl)
* TrueChange

* AeGis
* PRCS
* QVCS
* TCCS
* RCS
* SCCS

Most of this list was gleaned from the discussion at
ClearCaseComparedToCompetition; it provides some information about how
they stack up against each other (and should probably be renamed to
indicate its broader scope).

''[I just completed a search of page titles for each of the above, and found nothing new.  Please do a title search when you add new entries.]''
