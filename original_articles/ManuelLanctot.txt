I'm 20 years old and living in Montreal, Quebec. CEGEP Studies in Literature and later in Humanities, blah blah. I'm usually shy and don't write a lot on wikis, especially since I know I do too many errors in English. Other than that, I waste most of my time reading, watching movies and hacking at Linux (hacking, not ''cracking''). 

It's possible to contact me at: [deleted after seeing this page on Google]

''You should drop by the next meeting of the MontrealXpUsersGroup!''

At first, I thought you were talking about Windows XP. *shudders* I'll think about it, thanks. :)
