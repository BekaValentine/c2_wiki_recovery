BoredomIsaSmell.  Possibly the only smell you should heed when it comes to the decision to automate.

Examples of non-boring tasks, which would be less-suited to automation, with their boring counterparts, which would be more beneficial to automate:

	* '''Not boring:''' Coming up with a style guide for a new language
	* '''Boring:''' Re-indenting code

	* '''Not boring:''' Higher-level search-and-replace (i.e., finding all code that directly uses the database and making it use an indirect layer)
	* '''Boring:''' Literal search-and-replace (change "getSelectSql" to "selectSql")

	* '''Not boring:''' Extracting an interface
	* '''Boring:''' Implementing an interface (in a language like Java)

	* '''Not boring:''' Choosing between delegation and inheritance
	* '''Boring:''' Writing delegation code

	* '''Not boring:''' Planning
	* '''Boring:''' Collecting metrics

	* '''Not boring:''' Writing test procedures
	* '''Boring:''' Running test procedures

	* '''Not boring:''' Determining how to build and deploy the software
	* '''Boring:''' Building and deploying the software

	* '''Not boring:''' 20%
	* '''Boring:''' 80%

I HaveThisPattern. Every time I find myself saying "this is boring" while working on my Web site, I end up creating another script to AutomateBoredom: site maintenance, uploading changes, HTML validation, link checking, indexing, etc. Editor macros insert tag pairs while writing content. New pages use a standard page template for boilerplate material. I now spend almost all of my Web design time writing and editing content, not formatting, without using a ContentManagementSystem. (My site validation script indicates successful results with a GreenBar, and incorrect pages produce a RedBar. Reminiscent of a UnitTest, but written before I'd heard of them.)

This may explain part of the popularity of blog software: it lets people create a well-organized site without mucking around with HTML, alleviating the need to AutomateBoredom entirely.
