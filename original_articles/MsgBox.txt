MsgBox is VisualBasic's wrapper for the Win32 MessageBox API function. It takes a message body, a title and constant for which buttons to display (like OK, Cancel, Yes, No, etc.) 

Pretty impressive, eh? 

Very nice, but the next time I paste in VB code remind me to put SixSingleQuotes around these kinds of identifiers:-)

I once asked my class what was wrong with: 

  MsgBox("Do you wish to continue?", vbOkOnly + vbExclamation) 
No-one noticed that even though the box asks a yes or no question, it displays only an OK button and also an ! icon instead of a ?.
