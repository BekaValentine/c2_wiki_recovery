That is the name of the PersonalWiki running on an Intranet or individual's machine. A local wiki which can be browsed at any time whether connected to the internet or not. 

It is a wiki into which one may store WikiPage''''''s from many wikis and categorize them to their hearts content. It helps when looking back for a page as it was at the time it was read or archived using simple but MeaningfulName''''''s. For instance this page when completed today could be stored in MyWiki as WardsWiki_MyWiki_200503031558.wik. This can be a part of an organizing scheme which includes not only MyWiki, but also the results of PaperPorting, where the page could be captured as a document MyWiki, in a subFolder called WardsWiki.
