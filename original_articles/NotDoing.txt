A technique of the ToltecTeachings. (Google search for "Theun Mares", "Carlos Castaneda".)

When we are faced with a situation, we usually tend to react in a few limited ways, based on our past experience. For instance, a female raising her voice in anger might make one flinch and feel (and act) defensively. NotDoing could be, for instance, reacting in a friendly way, or laughing aloud, or anything out of the ordinary.

Some of the ideas behind the technique are:

	* A hunter that is predictable leaves himself open to being hunted.
	* By practicing NotDoing, one becomes more flexible.
	* Practicing NotDoing allows one to experience new things (consequences of a situation, etc.), thus enriching oneself.

''The advice given by the psychologists who advocate the "think positive" doctrine is often of this type.''

Also the sort of thing SunTzu calls IndirectTactics.

Is there any language that would have a verb for NotDoing, a verb that would allw one to express NotDoing as doing something ''other''? Something like ''taire'' (in French), ''schweigen'' (in German), ''tiga'' (in Swedish) means ''not saying''; deliberately, actively, obstinately keeping quiet.

''English: HowAbout: avoid, eschew, bypass, refrain, skirt, quiet and a WikiWord DoNotSpeak'''

Not to mention the often used term: '''Hmmm''' (HearMeMakeMeaning ''silently'')

A canidate for a verb meaning NotDoing -- My recently discovered strategy of '''''Procrastination''''' which has some value not readily apparent, one might even call it a virtue, especially when applied by those who are RunningSixYearsBehind. Or if you desire another shorter verb, try '''''postpone''''' -- DonaldNoyes
