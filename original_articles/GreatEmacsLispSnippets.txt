 (defun my-insert-timeofday ()
   (interactive "*")
   (insert (format-time-string "%a, %d %b %y %H:%M\n")))

''or just:''

Bind '''control-u meta-! date''' to '''\C-ct''' like this:

   (global-set-key [(control c) ?t]
     (function (lambda () (interactive) (shell-command "date" 0))))

'Help for confused vi users'

  (setq wq "You're not using vi!")

'What file was I editing anyway?'

  (define-key global-map "\C-c\C-sf" 
    '(lambda () (interactive nil) (message "%s" (buffer-file-name))))
