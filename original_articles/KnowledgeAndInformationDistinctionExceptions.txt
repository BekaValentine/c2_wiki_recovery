Patterns, PersonalHeuristics, BoundaryObjects, DocumentsWithExtremeReification and which have stood the test of time are examples of exceptions to the distinction outlined in the introduction to KnowledgeAndInformation

I assume you are suggesting that these are examples of knowledge which does not reside in the mind ?

If you stand fast that NO knowledge can be ever be captured by a static representation, there is little I can do to change your paradigm. I wish to point out it is beneficial to adopt a more flexible frame and to entertain the possibility that some representations may contain qualities we associate with knowledge. There is always the possibility that dialog around the representation will result in new or altered knowledge.

The examples given at the start here are qualitatively different (in my mind) from the run-of-the-mill, document or form, they have greater value, larger context, more social acceptance and negotiation. I give these instances another name: i.e., KnowledgeArtifacts.
----
I don't stand fast that NO knowledge can be ever captured by a static representation.  I do find it convenient to take this position and search for compelling contradictory evidence.  I haven't seen any yet.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the examples you have given above to see their relevance.

Pushing the envelope, I can several ways in which to extend the position.  One is to say that a static representation is the transfer vehicle for knowledge between two minds.  Hence, the static representation does not need to be knowledge per se.

Another line of argument would be that I am postulating that information and knowledge are mutually exclusive concepts, and maybe they aren't.

I'm interested in developing an understanding which stands up to reasonable tests and acts as a sound basis for building a whole range of other concepts.  I am looking to build my concepts on a rock as a foundation, not on quick sand.  To do the latter, is to make every concept equally slippery and intangible, to my way of thinking.
