WikiAsp is a simple wiki program written in ActiveServerPages. It uses the AspWiki as the base code but it reverts back to the simpler traditional look-and-feel of wiki pages (hence, the name reversal). Furthermore, some interesting features were added to this version.

WikiAsp is currently running at trial public free hosting sites:
 http://lambda.vze.com	or
