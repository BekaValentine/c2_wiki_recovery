This is a website that finds books for you,
http://www.bookfinder.com/

The same basic principle as AcsesBookfinder (search a lot of bookstores on the web, and list the results from all of them) except that it also searches used book sites not just new and gives you many search choices. A good first place to look if you're trying to find something rare or out of print, price is important, or if you prefer the ability to search for used and new books at the same time.  Supports several languages.
