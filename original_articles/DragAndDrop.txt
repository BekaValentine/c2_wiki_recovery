Visually appealing approach to sort out positioning using a mouse...

seriously: there is a drag and drop (dnd) framework in the jdk, which also crosses application boundaries. For dnd-ing only inside an application, that can be avoided using the mouse events. Much code is avoided that way, but much more is gained.
