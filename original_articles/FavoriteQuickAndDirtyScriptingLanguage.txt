If you need to throw a little project or utility up quickly, not worrying about future maintenance, what language do you prefer?

* TopMind: Interpreted ExBase. Easy to bang out CRUD-ish features, but with an easier connection to imperative diddling not convenient in MS-Access.
** For quick webby stuff, ColdFusion. It has better HTML integration and map (dictionary) syntax than PHP. And a better type system in my opinion.
* JonGrover: CeeSharp and WinForms. Because my InformationOriented Library is written in C#, but UI selection is unimportant for a quick utility.
* DaveVoorhis: JavaLanguage or PhpLanguage as appropriate.  They're both horrible languages that make me feel unclean, but I can hammer out vast quantities of throw-away code in no time at all, mainly by leveraging all the pre-existing code out there.  If I need to do quick-n-dirty database stuff, I use my RelProject if it's database-oriented, PostgreSql if it's SQL-oriented, or MicrosoftAccess if it's GUI-oriented.
** ''So Php's uncleanliness makes you feel less guilty about throwing away throw-away code?''
* (Your handle and preference here)
