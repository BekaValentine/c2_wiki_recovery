I used to write for MarkSwanson and The Wild Hunt. I took the first course in Smalltalk that RalphJohnson taught at the University of Illinois. I'm a testing consultant and have also returned to take another whack at a PhD under Ralph. Thanks to RonJeffries, I find myself sometimes arguing that developers are doing too much UnitTest''''''ing. This is a big switch.

May I say, Marick's Corner is one of my favorite test resources on the web.

''Allan was probably referring to my lists of tools, consultants, and courses. I've handed those off to Danny Faught. They can still be found at http://www.rstcorp.com/marick.''

I have a third web site at http://www.testingcraft.com. It's a place where people can show explicit examples of testing techniques and the like. Programmers learn to program (and design) by looking at code, especially big systems. Testers are supposed to learn by hearing generalities and seeing them applied to toy problems. Doesn't work. Testing Craft is an attempt to dredge out more big examples, especially ones testers can collaborate on.
