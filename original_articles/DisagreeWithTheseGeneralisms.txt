From a phrase by RobertDiFalco in FearlessLeader

There are many ways to do this on Wiki. Some of them are still legal.

	* Go on at length in reply, in a general kind of way.
	* DisagreeByDeleting. Not, how shall we say, fully PoliticallyCorrect these days. Some would say it never was.
	* Provide a specific but nit-picking counter-example. Any relationship to real life in the counter-example is seen as a weakness. See also WikiPettifoggery.
	* Take a very long time to write pages full of very honest and insightful real project experience, without hope of getting paid and cleverly avoiding being sued. Refer to these in a concise and humble way underneath generalisms that you wish to question. This has not often been tried on Wiki.
