The Southern California XP Users Group discusses and explores issues relating to agile processes and Extreme Programming.  We are based in Los Angeles/Orange County but also cover the area from San Diego, north to Santa Barbara, and out to Riverside and even Bakersfield and Barstow.  As the membership grows, we can split and regroup for the convenience of the members.

We're currently discussing how to grow our group.  We've been meeting for informal lunch discussions every other Wednesday (see the mailing list for schedule and location).  You're invited to participate and offer your suggestions and opinions.
