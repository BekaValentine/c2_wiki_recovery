''Spawned from TextSmell''''''s...''

'''No Readily Available Examples''': Too much generality is a sign that your statement is incomplete, incorrect, and/or incommunicable.

'''Emotions''': The masterminds of trickery: anger, frustration, depression, and lust.  When under their spell, you feel as if you're thinking clearly.  This is a nearly unsmellable smell.  That is, there's no way for you to fully understand that hitting the "Send" button is a mistake.  If you can find it in you:  Sleep on it.  Take a walk.  Do something that helps you get your priorities straight.  After you've done that, toss your first draft and start again.  (See also: StampOutFires.)

'''Tiredness''': Another subtle killer.  Tiredness is a drug that makes people think they're witty and piercing. Can you wait until morning to publicize your writing?  You probably won't regret it.
