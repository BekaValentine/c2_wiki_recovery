 Some of us are rhyming challenged
 Please rhyme but leave intent unscavenged
 Some rhyming dictionaries are [1][2][3]
 Raise signal and make syncopy!

 Rhyming's not a game for kids--
 Not when our TV's hit the skids
 Or magazines have lost their sheen
 And books and music aren't that keen.
 It's then we turn to metered lines
 To vent in feet, iambs and rhymes.
 So, if you wish to mark this page
 With anything but measured rage,
 Instead to type a poem groovy
 Oh please--great gods!--just watch a movie.

 There's little worse
 Than doggerel verse
 (Unless it's terse;
 'tis William's curse)

      Fetch me a Nurse!

 Hey, let's encourage,
 our brains to forage,
 an' scan the ol' range.
 We just might arrange
 a rhyme with orange.
