I am an Object Oriented Systems Architect based out of Victoria, Canada. I have been serving the Object Oriented community for over a decade delivering object oriented solutions using Java, Smalltalk and C++. I specialize in OO development methodologies, EJB, J2EE, EAI and Web Architectures. 

Even though I spend lot of my time in Java, I still enjoy playing with Smalltalk.
