Development Project Wisdom from the film PitchDark:

	Johns: How's it look? 
	Riddick: Looks clear. 
	[They step forward, and a creature jumps at them. They fight and kill it.] 
	Johns: You said it was clear! 
	Riddick: I said it *looked* clear. 
	Johns: Well, how does it look now? 
	Riddick: Looks clear.

	I do not know which to prefer, 
	The beauty of inflections 
	Or the beauty of innuendoes, 
	The blackbird whistling 
	Or just after.
