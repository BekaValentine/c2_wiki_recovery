The first novel by IainBanks. The story is far too weird to summarize, having many twists and turns in the plot.

I don't want to spoil the ending - read it.

Probably the truest book ever written on the nature of Magic. -- Anon

This is an incredible read, and now the topic of my IainBanks extended essay, it's that good. --ss
