Just as in the GameOfGo, each wikipage has a certain potential to grow and influence the development of the wiki as a whole. If you want to be effective as an editor, or even more importantly as a host, don't rush to complete pages. Doing that is the equivalent of AjiKeshi. Instead simply sketch in the themes that are important to you and let other complete and tangentialize them.

Nurturing WikiAji is essential if you'd like to see your material grow. It's the antithesis of the WalledGarden.

''Not a good metaphor.  In Go, aji is the potential for damage, not growth.''

I thought aji is potential, period. But then I do not know Japanese.
* I don't know whether the Japanese term outside of Go has a value connotation attached to it, but in Go, ''aji'' is always negative.  There is no such thing as "good aji in your position", only "bad aji in your position for which you have to watch out", or "bad aji in your opponent's position to be exploited".  --AndyPierce

I have now asked Japanese about Aji. They have confirmed that Aji indeed has the meaning of "Taste", matching the explanation in SenseisLibrary. By the way, that web page also indicated Aji can be either good or bad. But I would also accept the position that if unqualified, Aji may have negative connotations attached to it.
* I think I wrote the above paragraph months ago. I like to add that if your GameOfGo playing style is nothing but Aji, it would not go anywhere. -- dl

If Andy is correct, what are we to make of AjiKeshi - and why would AjiKeshi be a bad thing?

AjiKeshi is bad because it is wasted potential.  In go, aji is the lingering weakness in a position.  Weakness does not equal flaw however, which is to say that if you play to strike directly at the weakness, with correct defense your opponent emerges unhurt.  The idea is to manoever the game into such a position that at some future time, you make a play that both activates the aji in your opponents position and ''at the same time'' requires a response elsewhere.  In this double-threat circumstance, the opponent must chose which of two simultaneous threats to address, leaving you free to fully exploit the other one.  This only works if you leave the first aji around to cause trouble later.  If you simply make direct plays against it, you give up the possibility of getting in a double-threat move later.

''So? Aji that is good for you is bad for your opponent. Your weaknesses and his must be ordered correctly to avoid AjiKeshi.''
