Enterprise Application Integration is the art of getting all the processes and data in your company to all work together.  There are three basic ways we do this:

	* DatabaseIntegration
	* MethodIntegration
	* UserInterfaceIntegration
----
I would also add
	* PointToPointIntegration
	* RepositoryIntegration ''(Is this not redundant with database integration, mentioned above? DeleteWhenCooked.)''
----
There is another type called application integration but if these are really method integration supplied by application vendors.
----
''Applications are what makes [enterprise information system] integration hard! (See EnterpriseApplicationProblems.)  What problems do you see with the DoItFramework approach to eliminating applications and integrating all problem area requirements with a single application neutral platform?''
----
I would say there are way more than three methods required for application integration.  Typically some form of MiddleWare is required, either in the sense of an ObjectBroker, MessageOrientedMiddleware, or InterfaceEngines.

MicroSoft announced a product called BizTalk together with the DistributedInternetArchitecture in ?1999. It started delivery after 2000. Currently in early 2004 it is still the tool Microsoft would recommend for integrating information from existing applications. In theory these integration could be done using Webservices, however use of a MiddleWare is far easier. 

This article from MicroSoft is probably worth reading, if there is a need to understand what do the products actually do. I hope someone will summarize it for the those of us interested in an overview.

When ServiceOrientedArchitecture start to deliver products meeting all objectives, then there will not be a need for separate MiddleWare products.
