Anyhow, if you're a Linux luser, you may want to go to http://gfpoken.bigw.org/, and download a game written by a friend of mine, Martin''''''Hock. It's called GFingerPoken, and it's the best thing since cheese.

This horribly antiquated page is the highest ranked link about me in a Google search of 'Jonathan Pearce'. That is highly sad. In a pitiable attempt to rectify this, I have decided to edit this WikiTopic. 

My new web home is http://www.jonathan.pearce.name/. It is full of exciting and interesting information about myself, Jonathan David Pearce, also known as Dwindlehop. Much good may it do you.
