The IntelligentBrowser helps you navigate through the SeaOfContent.  An idea stemmed from discussions about implementing MoreSophisticatedReferencing, the IntelligentBrowser (IB) is really a PresentationAgent who will both navigate the user from predefined link to link, while deciding about the actual content that gets presented, and its format.

The IB then would just be the front-end to the PresentationAgent.  Make sense?
