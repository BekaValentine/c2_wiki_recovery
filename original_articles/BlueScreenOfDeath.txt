In WindowsNt and WindowsTwoThousand, a post-mortem dump so named for its background color. Commonly referred to as a "Bee-sod."

 Windows NT crashed.
 I am the Blue Screen of Death.
 No one hears your screams.

Old joke:
	A: Windows NT doesn't have nag screens.
	B: Then what are these blue things that keep popping up?

Or change the color to whatever you want (within the old standard 16 choices). Edit ''system.ini'' and add 2 lines to the [386enh] section:
 M''''''essageBackColor=2
 M''''''essageTextColor=C
The above example results in a bright red on green BSOD.
      0 = black
      1 = blue
      2 = green
      3 = cyan
      4 = red
      5 = magenta
      6 = yellow/brown
      7 = white
      8 = gray
      9 = bright blue
      A = bright green
      B = bright cyan
      C = bright red
      D = bright magenta
      E = bright yellow
      F = bright white

Ad space on the BlueScreenOfDeath is a business opportunity that MicrosoftCorporation has yet to exploit. I wonder what AppleComputer would pay?

The BlueScreenOfDeath was also a rollicking good YearTwoThousand story by PeterMerel. Try http://home.san.rr.com/merel/bs.html
