A LiveCdOs is an OperatingSystem configuration that can be booted from a CD (http://encyclopedia.fablis.com/index.php/Live_CD).  To be useful, the distribution must be able to recognise a good variety of common hardware configurations.

There are some interesting applications (e.g. LiveCdOs based router at http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=livecdrouter).

Live CD bootable OperatingSystem tends to mean no harddrive. The kernel is loaded to memory and no form of hard storage is ''necessary'' to run the operating system. (Of course you can always mount your favourite device to store data...)
