Frank Adrian has been designing software for quite a while.
He has worked at companies such as Tektronix, MentorGraphics, ParcPlace, the FirstDataBank division of TheHearstCorporation, and Symantec working as an individual contributor and in technical leadership and/or management roles.  All of this means he manages, mentors, and generally tries to stay out of the way of several people who do actual work.

His current interests include application of patterns to the software design process and, in particular, testing, as well as looking for meta-patterns in the design patterns currently being published.
