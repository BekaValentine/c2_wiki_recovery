Halloo. I'm not sure if I should be here. I'm not particularly interested in the ostensible subject of this wiki, but more in the general concept of wikis. Where is a better place for me to be? I am going to spend some time checking out WikiWikiClone''''''s.

My home site is http://www.very.net/ and my email address is mailto:lisa@very.net.

Thanks to the anonymous person who answered my email address formatting question, and thanks to CliffordAdams for pointing me at the http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OtherWikis page!
