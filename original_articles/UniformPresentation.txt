For objects or concepts which have similar use, there must be similar presentation. 

This means that if one is editing control system batch recipes, the recipes must be presented with controls that are similar, and similarly placed on the respective screens. 

In other words, things that are to be used the same need interfaces that work the same. 

Yes, this is obvious, but should be stated nonetheless.

Also see KnownRepresentation. See GuiGuidelines for more principles.
