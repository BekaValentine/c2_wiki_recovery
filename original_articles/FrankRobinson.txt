Hi. I'm Frank Robinson, from San Marcos, Texas. I am a computer science graduate student at Southwest Texas State University.
----
My courses this fall include Survey of Software Engineering, Database Theory and Design, and Distributed Operating Systems, all at the graduate level.
----
I am looking forward to conversing with those on the Wiki Web about software engineering and databases.

I linked here from the Object Oriented page (one of them). As of August 2000, I had roughly 6 months programming experience with QBasic. Since I already had a BS degree, I dove right in to the computer science curriculum. They started us out with C++, because it is "easier to learn than C" and because it can be "object oriented". In the second semester, we got into building classes, which I think is really cool. Later, I took a course in OOP, in which we used C++ and Java. I also had courses in operating systems and networking, which both used the straight C language. There are many merits to C, one being the relative stability of it, and one being that many OSs and systems programs are written in it, so knowing it is a definite plus. 

I am finally getting to a point where I don't get 100's of syntax errors on every program, and am looking forward to doing some real development.

I just got a job helping an instructor with a web-based course, using a commercial product called Blackboard. I have a meeting next Tuesday with the Blackboard facilitator.
