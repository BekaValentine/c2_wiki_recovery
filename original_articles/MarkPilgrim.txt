Very funny piece about specs and types of developers, http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/08/16/specs. Excerpt: "Some people would argue that not all developers are morons or assholes, but they are mistaken. For example, some people posit the existence of what I will call the "angel" developer. "Angels" read specs closely, write code, and then thoroughly test it against the accompanying test suite before shipping their product. Angels do not actually exist, but they are a useful fiction to make spec writers to feel better about themselves."

Mark pretty much stopped maintaining his various blogs in October 2004.  The archives are still up and worth reading, however.
