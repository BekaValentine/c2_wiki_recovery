Requirements can be regarded as a gamble. You bet a certain amount of resource, and if you figure the odds right you get paid. Even when you're salaried, you get a type of pay - business continuity and the trust of your boss and/or client. So you need to think about the odds. In general it's much better to build something with a DefinitePayoff than something that just MightPayoff. But better still if it's an ImmediatePayoff ...

A DefinitePayoff is a statement that YouAreGonnaNeedIt.  This judgment should be made with caution.  Is there an explicit UserRequirement for this feature, or is it only something you think you need.  Beware of assuming TheCustomersAreIdiots.
