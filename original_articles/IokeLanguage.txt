IokeLanguage is a PrototypeBased language fairly similar to IoLanguage, with two main differences: it aims to be (even) more expressive, and it targets the JavaVirtualMachine. In addition to IoLanguage, it contains many ideas taken from LispLanguage (especially the powerful macros and the condition system) and RubyLanguage ... and also SmalltalkLanguage, but then that's to be expected given its IoLanguage heritage.

IokeLanguage was begun in 2008 by OlaBini.

My (JasonGrossman's) impression is that it's remarkably bug-free and well documented for a new one-person project.
