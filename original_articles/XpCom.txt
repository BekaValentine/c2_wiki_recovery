XpCom ( "Cross Platform ComponentObjectModel" ) is a set of InterfaceDefinitionLanguage spec for CeePlusPlus and JavaScript (via Xp''''''Connect), used by TheMozillaProject (of cross platform MozillaFirefox fame) for creating extensions that serve in RichInternetApplication''''''s.

The OpenSource XpCom technology supports threading, but are not required to be re-entrant. This is where outward similarities with MicrosoftCorporation's ComComponent end. XpCom does not have the elaborate performance related implementations to make thread safe distinctions between in-process and out-of-process situations. 
* ''"XpCom proxy services only support multiple threads sharing an otherwise non-reentrant component."'' See http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/co-xpcom.html

The XpIDL compiler has its roots from the Corba world.

getting the best of Emacs and Mozilla (talk about XmlRPC, REST) from Kevin Burton

MozillaXul extension is MozillaBrowser-based tool to develop RichInternetApplication''''''s. see http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/co-xpcom4/ 

Some SoapProtocol based XpCom components exist already. What practical opportunities, if any, exist for people wanting to expose legacy BigIron information to intranet? [I avoid internet because WebServicesSecurity is "BleedingE''''''dge" technology]
