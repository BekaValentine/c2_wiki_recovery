Be careful how you name things. The incorrect name might stick and influence the phenomenon itself. For example, WikiSquatting was named, because it reminded me of squats in Holland. Probably WalledGarden was a better name. 

Labels are powerful things: they constrain our thinking in ways that strongly affect our behaviour. As a thought experiment, consider how your reaction to the pages in the first list above might differ if WikiSquatting page was titled Wiki''''''Seeding, Wiki''''''Leg''''''Up or somesuch.
