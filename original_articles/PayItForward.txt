When someone does you a big favor, don't pay it back... PayItForward!

To PayItForward, do an action described as this:

	1. It has to be something that really helps people.
	2. Something they can't do by themselves.
	3. I do it for them, they do it for three other people.

''In the spirit of WikiGnome''''''s'''''', I took down the broken link to cinephile, and replaced it with these. Perhaps it has something to do with the idea of PayItForward...it may be utopian, but it's still working...''

Isn't this a little bit utopian?

''Any idea to change the world for the better will always seem utopian at first. But even if only a few people do it, it's still a big step towards making life easier for everyone, and improving our quality of life. Thinking about PayItForward always makes me feel more optimistic about everything!''

It would seem to me the that essence of a society is that you put into the pot even if you don't derive direct benefit from it simply because you are weaker on your own. Hence this is not a utopian ideal - it's a necessary behaviour for a well functioning society.

I don't know if it's Utopian, but it's a concept truly simple that everybody can put it to work (even if not everybody does so, like in the movie).

* It's also something that many folks are inclined to do at a specific time in their lives. e.g.
** Successful people as they enter their retirement years, are quite inclined to become Mentors and Charitable donors.

This phrase is often attributed to RobertHeinlein. I don't know if he said it first, but he apparently said it a lot.  

* RobertHeinlein used the phrase when helping out younger, less established authors. I don't remember whether he had it from his own mentors; anyway, the application to programming should be obvious.
