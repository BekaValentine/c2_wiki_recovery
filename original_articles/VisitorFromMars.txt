'''Problem:'''
As people become enmeshed in a situation, they lose perspective. Projects develop "blind spots." Assumptions gather moss, remaining unchallenged.

'''Context:'''
Any ongoing situation that has aspects that only undergo scrutiny infrequently.

'''Forces: '''
	* Time and schedule pressure force people to focus, screening out new, possibly conflicting information.
	* Group cohesion often blocks out fresh points of view.
	* As time passes, people develop calluses, and no longer notice rough spots in a design or interface.
	* The risk of "getting it wrong" is high, and the consequences are muy significant.
'''Solution: '''
While ComingUpToSpeed in a new situation, we pass through a unique window of opportunity during which we have a fresh, untainted view of the project and problem domain. Take advantage of this period while you're new to a project, or when new members join. Write down impressions. Note rough spots.

Formally grant VisitorFromMars status to newcomers, so that the old-timers may be more responsive to fresh feedback.

'''Resulting Context:'''
Valuable feedback is captured and incorporated.

My team has had a product in QA for several years; the number of usability bugs has been very low lately. Recently we "skinned" the product for a new OEM partner, changing terminology and syntax in the CLI and terminology and appearance in the GUI. Suddenly everyone is a VisitorFromMars. After a few days of complaints (NothingWorks) we started getting really good usability bug reports, sometimes on issues that have been present for years. Now those are tapering off again, after only a month.

The paradigm I like to apply to this is, "Why should I care?" Try WhyShouldiCare with your current or upcoming project to completely isolate the components from each other. This will give you a new perspective, you betcha.
