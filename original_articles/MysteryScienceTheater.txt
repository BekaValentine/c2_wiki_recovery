"Mystery Science Theater 3000": a classic cable show where a guy and his robots were forced to watch bad movies by an evil scientist. Now defunct, but appeared on Comedy Central and the Sci-Fi Channel in the USA.

Often abbreviated "MST3K". Fans of the show call themselves "MSTies".

Also released as a movie of the same name -- which is the only episode I've ever seen, not being in the US.  -- GavinLambert

One of the few shows I miss a lot. Of course, we MST3K a lot of movies, but it's not quite the same.

This show was awesome, I really miss it. I'm hoping that they'll release all of 1st through 5th season collectors' edition dvd's with Joel and the bots commenting on themselves commenting on the movie. - A Joel Fan.

''Regrettably, they don't have the rights to release a lot of the movies they riffed in that way; the Rhino videos that they sold were movies that they were able to secure the rights to sell on video.  -- MattBehrens, who named his computers megaweapon, kalgan et al. on NamesGivenToComputers''
