This is the proposed name for a hypothetical protocol that would provide support for proposed InterWiki and WorldWideWikiWeb features.

Current wikis use HTTP.  The goals of this hypothetical new protocol would be provide a standardized way to find a page by name without a client needing to know any WikiEngine-specific URL formats, to provide BackLink''''''s to other wikis, and other inter-wiki navigation and notification features.

wiki:// wwtp:// and wwww:// have been proposed as the URL scheme identifiers.

See UniversalWikiNamingLocators WikiUrlScheme WikiServerUrlScheme and WikiNoLocationUrlScheme. These support my MultiServerWiki proposal -- PhilipDorrell.
