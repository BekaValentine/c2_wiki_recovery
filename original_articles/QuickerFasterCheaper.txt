Quicker and Faster? Redundant. Is this page worth keeping?

Manager's who cannot understand the ReturnOnInvestment (ROI) of just about anything that doesn't get the income stream opened  as soon as possible. Every project is a rush job, corners exist only to be cut. The mission is JustGetItOutTheDoor and WorryAboutThatLater. 

I had the misfortune once to move from a bespoke software house to an Internet startup company managed by people who knew nothing about IT or the Net and everything about the urgency of the latest CunningPlan to make a mint, save the company and make them millionaires in 3 years. You know the rest. It was thankfully my only work experience in the PermanentCrisis world of the MBA version of martial law, where the StateOfCrisis justifies suspending the normal communication practices of exchange of ideas in favour of "All power to the managers". They all appeared to firmly believe that any understanding of technical matters was necessarily linked to an inability to comprehend their chosen field of increasing productivity by taking even the most ambitious "accelerated development" estimate of time needed and substituting days for weeks. Techie objections about details like all the customer's credit card details being held in plain text in their unsecured databases were small minded quibbling by those without their unique ability to see "The Big Picture" and get "The Vision". Some of us reckoned "The Vision" looked like it might be through prison bars at that rate and, as the saying goes, "Made our excuses and left". They went bust thankfully (though not for the bulk of the blameless staff)
