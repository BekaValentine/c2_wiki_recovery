Similar to the ScientificBeliefTrap - where a Developer will continue to follow a particular avenue of database design, coding, language (or whatever) in the belief that they have developed so much in this particular way that to change now would be just too much effort.

Compare this to other developers who jump onto every new thing as it arrives, often throwing the baby out with the bath water in process in their rush to embrace something new.

A good developer will sit somewhere in the middle realising when they have reached the limits with their current tools without being too eager to switch every time something new comes along.
