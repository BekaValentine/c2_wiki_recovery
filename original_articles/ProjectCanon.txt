An ExtremeProgrammingProject in Paris, at AgenceBless (http://www.agencebless.com/ ''[BrokenLink as of 2003-10-19]''). Bless is an interactive marketing agency; we build brands, or assist in building brands, either off-line or on-line, ideally leveraging the strengths of both media. Enough commercial hype, on with the project. 

''Is there a non-flash backdoor into this site?'' -- ''Nope.''

Note on broken link: This is an example of what happens when a page contains commercial advertising, The link is broken when the start-up folds or is acquired. This is not uncommon on start-ups.

''What happened on ProjectCanon? Was the ExtremeProgramming attempt a success? Is anyone around who might shed light on this?'' --DonaldNoyes

We are building a comprehensive software platform to support our business. Called the "backbone", its components include a ContentManagementSystem codenamed "Canon". We looked at the state of the art in CMS's and decided that while most of them had a lot of features that we didn't really need, none of them had the few features we really needed. (Plus most of them were ridiculously expensive.) We decided to build our own.

The system is slated to be released as OpenSource. Or maybe I should say "supposed to" - the notion is still given lip service to, but execution has been deferred for half a year.

Meanwhile, suggestions of alternate names appreciated - "Canon" is already the name of an XML product out there. (The "naming stories" : should relate to the practice of religion in some sense, preferably in an irreverent manner, in keeping with the "Bless" name; and to "content" in the broader sense, though with an emphasis on literary content.)

How about a recursive acronym, in the spirit of GNU:  "COSMIC:  COSMIC Open Source Management Is Canonical"   (not sure I should sign this... :-)

'''Quick stats'''

As of 2001/03/10, 150+ tests, 20-something of them AcceptanceTest''''''s (some tests do "double duty" of a sort for interesting reasons). Total production code size of very, very approximately 6 KLOC, 80 classes as of 2001/01/24; it's grown quite a bit between then and now (esp. class-wise) but I don't have exact figures handy.
