I'm tempted to make it a WikiAuthoringSystem where we write documentation, then write a spider which grabs a series of pages, pours them into a prettier template, converts links, etc. so that those pages can be moved out to a public server. I'm also playing a little with a project mgmt system based on ZopeApplicationServer, and can see integrating the 2 for purposes of issue-discussion... --BillSeitz

I used PikiPiki to author a business plan.  Here is what I did:

	* created a separate folder to work in
	* used the normal wiki to draft ideas
	* hacked the wiki code to run standalone instead of CGI
	* got it to generate one page without all the edit/search stuff
	* then made it loop through all the pages in the folder
	* fixed it so that the links called standalone pages instead of CGI
	* cleaned up all the missing links, which wiki already checked for
	* put a home button on every page

The changes to PikiPiki were all pretty simple. -- SteveHowell
