inverse of ReplaceTempWithQuery

'''Example Usage:'''

The Crystal Report OCX control (typically used in VisualBasic under MicroSoft Windows) has a function "FetchSelectionFormula()" which, for some reason, takes several seconds to execute.
Each call takes several seconds to execute, even if it's called several times in a row.
It returns a string -- the "where" clause of the query for the report, so I optimized our function that customizes this where clause by introducing a local String variable; we now work on the local string before calling "ReplaceSelectionFormula()" with our final result.
This change made simple one page reports display about twice as fast.
