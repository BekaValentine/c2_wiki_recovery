LinuxTuples is an implementation of TupleSpace''''''s, aimed at Linux running on x86 hardware. It should be portable to other Unix platforms relatively easily but it is developed and maintained on Linux/x86. LinuxTuples is written primarily in C, with some interface code available for running in Python. Tuple spaces were invented by DavidGelernter of Yale University and have since become available for the Java language.
