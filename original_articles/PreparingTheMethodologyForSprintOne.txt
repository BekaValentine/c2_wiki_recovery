Furtunately Agile Methodologies are simple and intuitive. People don't need weeks of training to understand the techniques. You must however consider whath methodology is the right choice for the project at hand.

Here are some patterns that helped me set up the right methodology at project kick-off:

* DontSettleForScrum
* BalanceAgilityAndDiscipline
* PatternsOfDailyStandUpMeetings 
* UseSeasonedFacilitator
