A page whose title indicates that the page's content (or at least the primary claims, though not any ThreadMode discussion) is the responsibility of a particular individual. The individual may be a WikiZen, or a well-known member of some scientific community. Recent examples include:

* TopOnTypes
* AlanKayOnMessaging

Usually, these pages are uncontroversial; the main exception is when a wikizen's pronouncements (which are left unsigned elsewhere) are moved onto an AccordingToPage by another user.
