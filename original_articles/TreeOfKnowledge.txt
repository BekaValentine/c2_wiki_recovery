The '''tree of knowledge''' is WhatItIs. The wiki.

Think about it: the bible story mentions that the tree is/was a dualism. Computers and the Internet are made with that dualism honed to its ultimate: BinaryArithmetic. Add to that DataStructures towards a UnifiedDataModel and you have a complete '''TheoryOfKnowledge'''.

Consider that WhatItWantsToBe is ultimately a TreeOfLife: a social, living environment of value exchange.

...and the Apple computer, complete with the bite taken out of the apple: a convenient parallel.
