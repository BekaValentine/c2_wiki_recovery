An implementation of the OMG IDLScript standard.

CorbaScript is an ObjectOriented ScriptingLanguage, meant to act as a CompositionLanguage for CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture components.

http://corbaweb.lifl.fr/CorbaScript/ is the official HomePage, but http://corbaweb.lifl.fr/CorbaScript/index.html seems like a better introduction.

There is a CGI-enabled implementation called WCS or WebCorbaScript at http://www.minoru-development.com/corbascript/index.html
