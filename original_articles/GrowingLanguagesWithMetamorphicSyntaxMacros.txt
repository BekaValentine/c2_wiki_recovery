A paper by ClausBraband and MichaelSchwartzbach of the University of Aarhus (Denmark) on the macro preprocessor used in <BigWig>.  Compares and contrasts it with many other macro preprocessors, including those of CeePlusPlus, SchemeLanguage (DefineSyntax), DylanLanguage, and a few others.  Interesting read.

Supposedly, a similar system is in NeedleLanguage.
