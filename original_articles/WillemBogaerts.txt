Programmer for Kratz Business Solutions in Capelle aan den IJssel, Holland

I have programmed in (Auto)Lisp a lot in the past, but recently I have worked as a VB, VB .NET and PHP programmer. PHP is my favourite and I still miss Lisp. Tried to do XP on some projects, with various results.

''Would you care to expand on that? What worked, what didn't, and why?''

The results greatly depended on the project managers I worked with. Some project managers had sold the requirements months before I was told to program it, and some called me in at the right time to receive input from me. Internal projects worked out best, as the organizations were afraid to let programmers communicate to external customers. Funny enough, they made absolutely no problem whatsoever about salespeople handling technical stuff.

Oh, and I was a medieval wood- and bone worker for a year. No joke. I was working in a theme park that shows how life was in Holland in different times. What I learned there is that programming is a craft.
