A process using Wizards, Code Generators, and IntelligentTemplates to generate code.

Some assert that the generated code is as good as manually coded programs.

'''Auto Code '''
* ...an extremely flexible and easily customizable automatic code generation tool. Using template-based generation technology, you can configure the exact format and specification of the resulting code. This makes it easy for you to generate code for rapid control prototyping and hardware-in-the-loop testing on one real-time platform and then switch templates to generate code for your final production target.
** AutoCode features:
*** Automatic code generation for C or Ada
*** Template-based code generation that you can customize for virtually any target
*** Implementation at any level in the model hierarchy for incremental test and validation
*** Support for discrete and continuous models -- single-rate, multirate, and asynchronous
*** Full support of SystemBuild floating-point and fixed-point data

*"... describes a way in which multiple target source code can be generated from a single model. A custom data class is developed so that it can be used to define both signal and parameter data types necessary for data dictionary-driven models. This capability allows a single model to be used to generate code for multiple target hardware architectures."
