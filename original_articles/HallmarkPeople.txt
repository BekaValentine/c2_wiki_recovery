HallmarkPeople are those folks who write in flowery language suitable for a greeting card, but questionable in technical forums or other professional contexts.  They have a melodramatic writing style that when you first read it seems to elevate their normally plain observations into something poetic and profound.  Subsequent readings are progressively more annoying.

Then you discover they just rearranged the words to some 1970's rock band's signature song that they heard in their formative years.  Key sources are lyrics from Yes, Kansas, and Styx.
