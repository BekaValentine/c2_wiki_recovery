A few thoughts:

Similar to a WikiPage, a BlikiPage uses a WikiPage on a WikiEngine for writing that is intended to be more like AuthorMode or ThreadMode Blogging. Contributions from others may be encouraged, but may be left in ThreadMode. Typically, true Blogging only allows comments to be appended rather than true edits.

Also, the original author of a BlikiPage may not have fully fleshed out all of his/her ideas before creating the page, and may prefer a more evolutionary approach, interlinked with other WikiPage''''''s that are expected to evolve as well.

For example:
