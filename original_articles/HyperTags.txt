HyperTags

A not so new concept which may soon revolutionize computer users' ability to UseByScanning, real-world artifacts via a form of hyperlinking based on HyperTags being placed upon and/or replacing nametags, billboards, highway signs, products (replacing or enhancing bar-scanning technology, and even bumper-stickers! The technology employed could be a combination of optical (as in photographic, scanning, infra-red, or invisible paints), wireless (as in WiFi, RFID, DigitalBroadcasting via the airwaves (on separate and dedicated channels or multiplexed within commercial and/or public broadcasting), audible as well as signals above the range of human hearing (sent through air, water, or conducted through solid materials) (even one's water-pipes might be useful as media). Printed material might also serve as media for hyper-tags (using special encoded text, or optical recognition of ordinary text.
* And you might even have RFID embedded in your flesh directing everyone to donaldr.noyes.com ...
** it will not be required or necessary that RFIDs be embedded in your flesh since most people already carry devices which have a range 1000 times distant from their persons. RFIDs are proximity devices, having a range measured in feet, whereas PersonalCommunicators have a range measured in miles.

With the DisappearingComputer, HyperTags will become valuable references for the C''''''onnectedGeneration (those presently under 40 years of age). Can you imagine a pointer-scanner optically attached to that wearable N''''''anoComputer and built in to an ear-eye device (most probably looking like an ordinary pair of glasses) Perhaps even the N''''''anoComputer will built into the device and not require optical-attachment.

Technology is already underway:
* over 100 models of MobilePhones are already equipped for HyperTags:

* HyperTags using infra-red do not require MobilePhone, and can use ports on PDAs, or Lap-tops, Palm computers, or other such devices and can also report:
