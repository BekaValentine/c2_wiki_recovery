What Is Discipline?

I suggest it is choosing a larger long-term gain over a smaller short-term gain.

Hard work pays off in the long run, but Laziness pays off right now.

Note that a given business may not value the long-term. There is some financial theory behind this, such as FutureValue being worth "less" than current value. Whether it "should" be that way is a long a winding debate. But regardless of the theory, if you are in such an organization, you may be required to focus on the short and medium term, and work for the longer term will not be valued in performance reviews. I'm just the messenger. -t

'''Discipline''' is doing what you are supposed to do, when you are supposed to do it, whether you want to or not. A whole lot of the problems in this world could be solved if more people kept that simple definition in mind. [cough]
