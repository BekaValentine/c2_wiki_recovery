This is a meme (purportedly) created by Lawrence Lessig of Harvard University, noting his observations on the dominating power of computers and the software that runs on them.  

As software becomes ubiquitous, their power rises proportionally.  If people cannot inspect or modify the code, they, through a more-or-less subconscious "assimilation", become entrenched to the rules and protocols implemented by the creator's of that software, whereby it becomes difficult to abandon the manufacturer; in effect, creating a post facto dependency.  At the time, because of the power of Windows and its marketing machine, this was seen as a possible '''totalitarian''' danger.
