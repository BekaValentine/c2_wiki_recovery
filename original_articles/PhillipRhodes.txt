''Hi, Phillip. Did you attend TriangleXpMeetingOne, Monday October 28th, 2002?''

Yep, sure did.  That was the only meeting I've made it to so far though.

''Okay. That explains your sudden appearance on the TriangleXpMeetingOne page a couple years after the fact. :-) -- ElizabethWiethoff''


Yeah, I had kinda forgotten about it, and just happened to stumble across the wiki entry, and thought I might as
well add myself, even though it has been a couple of years.  I need to start attending the meetings again,
if I can ever find time. -- Phil
