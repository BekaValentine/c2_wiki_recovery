The WorldWideWebConsortium standards for representation of documents (for instance, HtmlDocuments with CascadingStyleSheets and ExtensibleMarkupLanguage documents) as an object model. Three levels of the specification exist, where each is a superset of the last, and levels 2 and 3 are separated into modules. See http://www.w3.org/DOM/ for details.
