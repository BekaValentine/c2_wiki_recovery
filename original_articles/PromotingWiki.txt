''Thanks for your answer here. I am doing this already. What are the next points? It would be also good to talk about it. I am looking for arguments. That's why I started searching for pages. I need a page with a lot of good contents which explains why wiki and why not forums or newsgroups.''

Are there some other pages here which gives answers?

''The following discussion is about promoting WardsWiki, not wikis in general. I think.''

I often wonder whether pointing people at Wiki is a good idea. Since I consider Wiki a resource of immense value, I almost consider it criminal not to tell people about it (an anti-KnowledgeIsPower sentiment). Weighed against that are the risks such promotion would have for present WikiUser''''''s. Reduced SignalToNoise ratio or WikiVandal''''''ism may ensue. At best, the new community members become ideal WikiCitizen''''''s, but then would we reach a W''''''ikiEntropy, where the sheer number of postings (even if containing high SignalToNoise) becomes too great for a RecentChanges page to be effective? I don't ever want to have to GoogleMyWiki...am I being naive? :-) I guess these sentiments have been echoed many times before (my memory suggests such pages as TragedyOfTheCommons...). -- DanGreen
