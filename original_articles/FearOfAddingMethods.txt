The naive belief that adding methods to a class always makes it more complicated...


"No," the novice said, "we should use this design instead of that one because it's clearly simpler; it has fewer methods." (...leading to "one big massive 'do it all' method" a GodMethod)


But the thing is.. if all this GodMethod does is to execute an complex object graph that somehow represents a kind of expression language.. is it still a GodMethod? 

Where should one paint the line between adding methods or creating a new language (also possible known as a new object graph?)
