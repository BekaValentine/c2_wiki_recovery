Who knows WikiForums or at least WikiLikeThing''''''s that allow hyperlinked interaction with 3D graphics, sound and kinetics?

Additionally it would be nice to have it as a SmartWiki, i.e. if the underlying WikiEngine were Wiki-userprogrammable.
 
Every hint is welcome. -- FridemarPache

I am also interested in 3DWikis. -- Andreas Kuckartz

The Comanche SqueakWiki will allow you to do these things. It runs server-side, but if you want your visitors to experience/edit the 3D graphics and the sound, they will be required to download the Squeak plugin http://squeakland.org/plugin/download.html for their browser. - StephanBranczyk
