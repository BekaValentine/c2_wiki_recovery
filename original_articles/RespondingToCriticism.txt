'''Summary Of Discussion'''

Discussed here is criticism and the evolution of ideas, how one can deal with the thoughts and ideas generated in a critical exchange. Ending with a result that a conclusive, community agreement about the idea is reached. Carefully avoided are differentiations which will not lead to agreeable conclusions. The conclusions that one reaches are not necessarily represented by a single viewpoint, but may include conclusions allowing the formation and acceptance of several acceptable views and accomodations.

'''Criticism of Ideas'''

The following applies to ideas, partly developed and exposed to a community that values free, open and honest discussion which uncover an idea's strengths and weaknesses: 
		
When you pose an idea and it receives a reply or comment, consider whether the comment strengthens and extends the originators sense , or is about  structural or logical weakness. Members concerned with successful dialogue will usually: 
* Evaluate a reply or comment to the ongoing idea development with the intent of extracting things which contribute to the strengthening and clarification of what was originally intended, realizing that the respondent has expressed questions, modifications, and concerns regarding some particular weakness or inaccuracy in the idea or has some suggestions, amplifications or modifications which will improve the idea. 
* Try to Discover how the reply or comment can contribute to changes which need to be made to improve it's expression. 
* Be quick to Make adjustments and Corrections which are needed. If the reply or comment someone else has made modifies the idea by expressing another view of the idea or brings to light something your idea either lacks or fails to produce, responds promptly. This shows an openness to discussion and a willingness to hear what others think of the idea. The quick reaction to amplify, correct and adjust, or restate the idea is likely to create a framework where the dialog can continue and the idea will develop more fully. 
* Realize that when an idea is first expressed, it is probably not complete. It can stand some development and change. 
* Recognize a new idea may have many unexplored facets. To state what before was a thought or the kernel of an idea is much like beginning a journey. The journey of an idea may lead to initial acceptance or rejection. 
* Accept that as others join in contributing to its progress, the idea takes on new ownership. Rather than just being your idea, it becomes a more complete idea which is owned by all the contributors. Hopefully others not involved in its formation will try it out and find in practice it works. They are owners as well, not as originators, but as practitioners. The idea may be more far reaching than originally intended in that others may apply it to other disciplines with or without modification. These are the best ideas, which have at their center substance which touches the essence of things(whatever that is), or discovers a universal niche. 
* Also the idea may, in the process of positive dialog, encounter negative replies and comments. The initial idea may be ill-conceived or unsupportable. Some ideas may sound good, receive initial support, but not work in practice. This is what some call a Bad Idea. In Positive Dialog, the bad idea loses and either goes out of existence or produces undesired results'' Because a CriticalSpirit knows that nobody is certain of everything and not every idea is received in the process of positive dialog, we must not write off every idea as a dead end. Many times they are just rest stops our minds require along the way that don't happen to coincide with everyone else around us at the time.

'''Applying Self Criticism'''

People often avoid the valuable application of self-criticism particularly needed in cases when everyone seems in agreement. This can be done by simply questioning and posing arguments about what weaknesses exist, what improvements might be made, and what may need to be added or removed to make the idea more viable and complete.
