Slightly disillusioned "Computer person". After a degree in ComputerScience and 10 years in the industry looking at moving into Sandwiches. I figure people will always need lunch :-)

Based in Halifax, UK (That's between Manchester and Leeds and a long way from LondonTown for those with inadequate atlases).

I'm here looking for inspiration

''And a very fine thing SandwichMaking is, too. But I suspect you might regret it when it comes to PayDay. --RogerBrowne''

Yes, but think of the satisfaction of knowing that you have fulfilled a vital role in society. And GordonBrown won't be able to say you aren't a ProperBusiness.

Hi Neil. I was disillusioned once myself. I got my inspiration from RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode and ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange.
