The process approach is dramatically different from the management one: it is a cookbook way, as opposed to a chemical analysis way. When you cannot understand what is being produced, you mandate the way it is being produced. If you are precise enough, this will reliably end up in reproducible results.

Of course, it requires that you can be precise enough, which implicitly sets up some limits, and the typical danger is anyway at the opposite: over-specification.
