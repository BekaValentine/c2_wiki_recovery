The HomeFactory is a factory where products would be manufactured, i.e. assembled, boxed and shipped from a small dedicated space in the home of a worker.  It could include small assemblies, craftworks, programs produced and prepared on CdRoms and FlashDrives, and many other possible products. It would be one of the answers to CarAddiction and a complement to the HomeOffice, and the HomeStore.
