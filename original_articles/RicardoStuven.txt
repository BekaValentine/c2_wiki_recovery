I'm a SoftwareCraftsman (eternal apprentice ;) ) from SantiagoDeChile. 

My first face-to-face encounter with computers, at the age of eight, was with a friend's Atari800XL. Then, I knew I wanted a SinclairSpectrum :) This one delayed its arrival till I reached the age of twelve, as a Christmas gift. With its 48K of RAM, I started the long way towards DotNet. Here I am, but not before having passed by some other platforms, languages, girlfriends and some nasty bosses.
