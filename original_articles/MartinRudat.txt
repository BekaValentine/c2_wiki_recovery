Someone aspiring to be JustaProgrammer, or possibly JustAnEngineer, or whatever JobTitle getting to program well rather than manage attracts this week...

Probably guilty of BeingTooClever, but I don't get paid to program (yet).

I have learned BasicLanguage, CeeLanguage, PerlLanguage, and PostScriptLanguage on my own, and I've been taught CeePlusPlus and JavaLanguage at university.

I've played around the edges of some LispLanguage -like programs, but can't quite grasp what all the fuss is about.

I kind of like the sound of TableOrientedProgramming, and I'm vaguely considering trying to perpetrate a ToyLanguage on PalmOs involving it.

''Are you a student?''

Yes, I'm doing a computer course Down Here in Australia. This last week was officially study-for-exam week, but I've been poking around here instead. I can't say that I'm too keen on the attitude of 'do the minimum required to pass' that seems to be shared by lots of people. One person decried the fact that he had to learn so many languages (oh, the horror!), while he was doing a course that did not in fact have any subjects called 'Programming'.

''I "do the minimum required to pass."  I just spend all the time that frees up researching language design ideas and all those extra programming languages.  It helps that I'm a physics major, so I can slack off in a subject I like-but-don't-love and then spend my time doing something I love.''

''I wonder if the folks that decry "learning all those languages" spend their spare time researching quantum physics.  Somehow, I rather doubt it.  -- JonathanTang''
