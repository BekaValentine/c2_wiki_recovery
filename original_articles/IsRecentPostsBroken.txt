Moved from I''''''sThePostsFeatureBroken:

It seems like the RecentPosts feature isn't working.
Admittedly when it was introduced three years ago
it was said to be temporary. Maybe it really was.

So, is it broken, or has it been withdrawn?

''Perhaps since so few people now post with their UserName cookie, it's been deemed no longer necessary.''

    Not Found
    The requested URL /cgi/posts was not found on this server.

Looks broken to me.
