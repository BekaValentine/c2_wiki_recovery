Here a proposition of ComputerSystemMetaPattern:

Six levels from ''the PhysicalRealWorld'' to ''the PhysicalRealWorld'':

0. The PhysicalRealWorld

1. The CodingLevel: how to you implement '''bits''', '''bytes''' into the PhysicalRealWorld

2. The LexicalLevel: see LexSoftware for an explanation

3. The SyntaxicalLevel: see YaccSoftware for an explanation

4. The IdiomsLevel

5. The PatternLevel

6. The ApplicationLevel: how you use patterns to make an application, how this application interact with the PhysicalRealWorld. We can call also call this level: ContextLevel (like ContextDiagram in SaDeeTee)

7. The PhysicalRealWorld

Questions:

- Is this model reentrant or fractal?

In order to make a complete computer system, you need multiples peripherals, with their own microcode. So I guess it's a reentrant model.

- Is it a MetaPattern?

- Why is it difficult to make a ComputerSystem able to ''learn'' and retain knowledge?

Because you need to organize the knowledge BEFORE you enter this knowledge in the ComputerSystem, and BEFORE you extract this knowledge.
