NoteTab is a TextEditor/HyperTextMarkupLanguage editor.  While the commercial features are a bit useless to hand-coders (such as me), there is a freeware version available.  It handles well, but the extra stuffing is a bit too weighty for what it is.  On the other hand, some of the included "clip libraries" make some HTML formatting easy.  Highlight the text, hit <ESC> and type in part or all of the "clip" name, hit enter, and it's done. For example, to turn several lines into, say, an unordered list: highlight the lines, type <ESC>-un-<enter> (for unordered list), and each line has <li>...</li> around it, with <ul>...</ul> enclosing the list items.

It allows you to filter highlighted text (or the whole file) through Perl programs, so you can write your own tools if you like. Demoronizer, anyone? Also works well with Dave Raggett's HtmlTidy program.

''Also supports "outline" (docname.otl) documents.  These documents can only be created in the licensed version, but can be browsed using the free version.''
