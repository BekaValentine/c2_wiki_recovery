I graduated in December 2002, from CalBerkeley, where I studied ComputerScience. I stayed at Berkeley to earn my master's degree in bioengineering (http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/), working on computational biology. I spent some time at SRI International, and currently work at DNAnexus, a startup building a software platform for large-scale DNA sequence analysis.

I'm also very interested in programming languages, operating systems, and in the art and science of software in general. In my spare time I play and compose music.
