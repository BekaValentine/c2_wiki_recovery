Cool CVS client.  http://www.smartcvs.com

'''The Good'''

	1 Very comprehensive view of what has changed
	1 Good sorting/searching
	1 Very fast for large projects (caches CVS results)
	1 SSH1 and SSH2 support built in
	1 Supports external SSH client

'''The Bad'''

	1 Small but annoying inconveniences left in the free version ($45 is a low license fee, though)
