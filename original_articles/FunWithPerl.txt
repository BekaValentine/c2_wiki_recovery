"Fun With Perl" (FWP) is a mailing list for trading Perl tricks and asking "is there a better way to..." questions.

There's also the occasional round of PerlGolf.

Many of the tricks that pass through FWP have no place in production code (and their authors admit it), but it's a fun way to stretch your mind and grow your Perl skills.
