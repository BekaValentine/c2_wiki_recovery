I predict the rise of two-panel smart-phones. They'd fold up like a wallet, but have two panels when you open them up. I doubt flexible screens will be practical any time soon such that the split will be accepted and UI's designed around it. One panel would serve as the "navigation panel", kind of like the left side of many web-pages, and the other will be the detail or content. Or one panel serves as the virtual keyboard. You'd get twice the screen-size of typical smart-phones.

They won't be very good for watching movies because of the split, but fairly good at "productivity apps" and would be able to do many tablet-like things. Hook a real keyboard and mouse to it and you have a '''pocket desktop''' just about, with a screen roughly the size of the original Apple Mac desktop. --top Sept. 2014.

They won't fold, FlipPhones are for losers. There will just be front and back screens. One screen for apps or the phone ui, the other for dashboard type display.
