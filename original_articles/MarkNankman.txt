Name: Mark Nankman

Reasons for entering wiki:
        * my new but fast growing interest in XP (ExtremeProgramming)

I am currently living in Baltimore, MD in the U.S.A. It took a while for the INS to provide me with a employment authorisation document, but I have that now, and intend to find another IT-job.

I previously worked for Ordina UTM B.V. in The Netherlands. (http://www.ordina.nl), a rapidly growing software company with approx. 4000 employees.
