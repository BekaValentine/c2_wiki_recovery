I've always been a fan of ReFactoring and DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork. Always seeking extreme and non-extreme projects focusing on accounting, retail, and distribution business environments; both Unix and Windows systems.

I believe that MyMyersBriggsTypeIs ENFP ("Champion").  This surprised me at first when I took a little online quiz and then I realized it's probably pretty accurate.  I'm clearly extroverted (the E) and am also a strong P, but the NF part is middling.
