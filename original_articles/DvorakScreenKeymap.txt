You may want to use EditText to copy the contents. 

#Change the command key to get it out of the way:
escape "^~~"

#Remap the regular keys (almost perfect):
source $HOME/.screenrcs/keymap.dvorak.reg

#Remap the control keys (rather bad - read the flie before using it):
source $HOME/.screenrcs/keymap.dvorak.ctl
