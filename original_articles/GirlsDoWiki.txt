This is more productive.  A list of Girls Who DO Wiki, in response to the suggestion that GirlsDontWiki.  Maybe even, OfCourseGirlsWiki is more appropriate.

''I don't know when this page was created, but what's below doesn't seem that productive to me.''

Girls who wiki:

Tech Girl.

WikiChickies?

IMHO, WomenWhoWiki would be a better page name.

''Do they also do the Hokey Pokey? :-)''

Anon do wiki as well :-)

''There's also a list of Women on the MinoritiesOnWiki page.''

See also the UseRealNamesForWomen survey on MeatballWiki.

''Oh c'mon! I'm surprised GirlsGoneWiki hasn't surfaced!''  :-)
