Gene Autryï¿½s Saturday matinee saddle pals wanted to be just like their hero. Gene responded with the Cowboy Code, sometimes known as the Cowboy Commandments. They are as relevant today as they were then.

* The Cowboy must never shoot first, hit a smaller man, or take unfair advantage.
* He must never go back on his word, or a trust confided in him.
* He must always tell the truth.
* He must be gentle with children, the elderly, and animals.
* He must not advocate or possess racially or religiously intolerant ideas.
* He must help people in distress.
* He must be a good worker.
* He must keep himself clean in thought, speech, action, and personal habits.
* He must respect women, parents, and his nation's laws.
* The Cowboy is a patriot.

''Pretty similar to the other version above, which perhaps was typed by memory by someone who was a big Autry fan as a boy? :-) Or maybe the version I found is the fuzzy one.''
