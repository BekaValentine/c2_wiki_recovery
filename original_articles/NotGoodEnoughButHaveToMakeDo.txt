'''Is this page GoodEnough?'''

It is NotGoodEnoughButHaveToMakeDo, a BetterThanNothing page.

HalfBakedAttemptsLeadNowhere viewpoints are as valid as the HalfFinishedWorkLeadsToCollaboration viewpoint. The key is MakeRoomForAllViewpoints, and the contrary opinions assist the readers to do CriticalThinking.

This page was created to reduce the size of '''PandemicResponsePatterns''' so the former page could have a more focused discussion on the main topic. And at this later point in time I say NotGoodEnoughButHaveToMakeDo is a page should stay to make "a statement on its own". If CommunityBuilding efforts at this wiki become more successful, then there will be less need to rely on NotGoodEnoughButHaveToMakeDo, to convey important but ignored pattern related topics. -- DavidLiu

''There was an article about this in probably NewScientist sometime in the past, oh, year. If not that then SciAm. It just summarized some of the work done using computer simulations of epidemics and how effective different responses are. I say this merely to point out the dearth of solid information and references in this page despite its attempt at a serious tone.''

* thanks for picking up your pen and you are right in your remarks. I value SayItDirectly
* there are lots of information left unsaid (on purpose) by the original author, who has followed this topic for years (as a lay person). For example, who did the original research that led to the development of vaccine. What vaccines are available. What do the government leaders (e.g. a health minister) say about distribution, which notable persons in which countries made recent remarks on the topic, etc.
* these are left out because:
** GoodEnoughIsNotGoodEnough
** avoid DeathFromPerfection and DeathByPerfection
** above all, avoid WikiSuccessCanInhibitNewWriters. I want more ways open to attract new contributors
* also please note the parent page is trying to focus on "getting a community based solution" on "an inevitability". We do not want communities to turn against each other, "loss of democracy" when things start to move.
