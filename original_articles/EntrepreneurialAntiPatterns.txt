From that page:

	 :	"Fred", Lee said to me, "George hasn't been in here on a weekend in almost a year. He's never in before 8:00 A.M. anymore and never here after 5:30.[...]"

Good for George. Doesn't this indicate that the company is changing from a shoesting to a normal company? Or am I missing something?

Further down:
	 :	As I was ''driving'' to a board meeting right afterwards though, I thought to myself, [...] there's more! [..] There was a cardboard box lying on the passenger seat of my car. I flipped it over to reveal its blank bottom and started scribbling notes relating to other deathtraps all over it. ''By the time I reached my destination, it was covered up''. [my emphasis]

Is this really the sort of guy from whom we should be looking for advice? If Frederick J. Beste III thinks that writing extensive notes on the bottom of a card-board box on the passenger seat while driving is acceptable, then he has a very different notion of risk than do I. But then , I'm no entrepeneur. -- KeithBraithwaite
