"Do or do not. There is no try."

 Try
     'Do something
 Catch ex as Exception
 End Try

I think Yoda exception handling would look more like:

  atomically $ doSomething
               `orElse` (return ())

There is no partial success. There is no 'try', and no 'retry'. YouDontWantAnExceptionYouWantaTransaction.
