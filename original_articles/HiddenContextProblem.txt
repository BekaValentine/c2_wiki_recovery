To illustrate the vast scope of meaning and context, consider the following problem:

Imagine AgentX typed the message "Foo is awful^H^H^H^H^Hgreat!" into a computer, translated to egyptian hieroglyphs, saved as a spreadsheet, encrypted, stenographed into an image, converted to a spectrum of sound, and a program that would wait four days then call a remote phone to play the sound once before deleting itself.

System Requirements
* Find anything AgentX knows about Foo without alerting AgentX.

''- consider the context needed just to read and understand the problem.''
