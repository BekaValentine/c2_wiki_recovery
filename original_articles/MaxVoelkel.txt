My homepage is at http://www.xam.de and I was a computer science student in Germany. Now I work on my PhD thesis, which will be about something like a semantic wiki. I start thinking at http://www.freshbrain.com, and have completed my Ph.D.

''You may find some insight on PersonalWiki.'' - thanx!
