When a study group starts reading DesignPatterns it automatically gets an agenda and a schedule that lasts six months. That's one pattern a week for about twenty-three weeks.

The Pattern Languages Group in New York finished DesignPatterns around May of 1996. We continued in much the same way reading papers from the PLoP Conferences, other patterns books, individual papers from several authors and rereading sections of DesignPatterns.

Now we're wondering how to proceed.  We've come up with a few ideas:
	*Implement Checks
	*Have members review papers before the group reads them
	*Spend more than one week on a topic or paper
	*Revisit complicated topics
	*Produce something:
		*GUI Designers Guide to Patterns
		*Database Application writer's guide to patterns 
		*Guide to Patterns after reading DesignPatterns
	*Spend more time on architecture patterns
		*As a category these are useful patterns.

Last update to this page (before this one) was August, 1997. It is probable that this agenda is no longer applicable? What is the current agenda?
