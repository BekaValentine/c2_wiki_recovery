Hello:

My name is Keith Wedinger and I am a software engineer living and working in Central Ohio.  I am currently working on several Windows NT development projects using C++, VB, COM, MTS and relational databases.  In my copious spare time, I test Microsoft's beta releases of Windows 2000 and I experiment with RedHat's excellent Linux distribution.

Please feel free to visit my web site at http://www.serve.com/uccats.
