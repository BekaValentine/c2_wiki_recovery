Does anyone remember the BasicLanguage implementation FutureBasic? It was my first language on a Mac, about twelve years ago now, while in version 2. Their web page seems to suggest that Future Basic 3 is now available. Has anyone used it? Is it worth it? Was this language really as great as my childhood memories suggest? --AdamBerger

I'm using it every day. It's a great IDE, right now.
It builds applications for 68K, PPC, and Carbon (Mac OSX). There are many examples available in the CD. It's sold by annual subscription (updating for 1 year). It's distributed in US, Europe, Japan and Australia.
