Mike Bennett is an IT consultant specialising in financial XML standards and development process. 

Also part of the CIX online community where I am known as hypercube@cix

I originally qualified as an Electronic Engineer and have spent most of my career adapting the industrial disciplines of engineering, into an IT context - most recently in that process wasteland which is the financial sector. Most of my work has been test management, project management and introducing formal processes for same. 

I lecture one day a week at the University of Westminster. 

I live in Bedford right now, but mostly my orbit is London. 

I grew up in Zimbabwe but that's a long time ago. I still participate in national life by helping the Opposition out in a small capacity over here. 

I fly a hang glider (Discovery 195, 20 hours) and think that's enough personal pronouns!
