Derisive term for PlugAndPlay, when MS first implemented PnP in MicrosoftWindows.  Early versions of PnP did't always work very well; though that largely was due to implementing PlugAndPlay on top of legacy hardware interfaces (ISA bus, RS-232, IEEE1284 parallel port, IDE) with poor support for this sorta thing.

Other hardware interface standards designed from the start for automatic device discovery and configuration (including PCI, USB, SCSI) support PlugAndPlay quite well.
