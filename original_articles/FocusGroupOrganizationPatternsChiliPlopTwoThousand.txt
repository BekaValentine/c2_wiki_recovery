'''None of us is as smart as all of us''' -- towards an organization pattern language.

Want to participate?   Contact MartineDevos mailto:martine.devos@eds.com

Looking over my shoulders -- participating in other (former) workshops
or focus groups -- are NeilHarrison mailto:nbh@bighorn.dr.lucent.com, JimCoplien mailto:cope@research.bell-labs.com and
StephenBerczuk mailto:berczuk@acm.org.

The workshop builds on work we did together in preparation of a book on
Organisation Patterns and on the results of our workshop at Oopsla '99.

The series of focus groups on organisation and process patterns was
initiated by MichaelBeedle mailto: beedlem@fti-consulting.com two years ago.

''Abstract'':
'''None of us is as smart as all of us''' -- GeraldWeinberg

Some software organizations serve their customers well, they deliver on
time, deliver a profit to the stockholders and build a supporting
workplace for the team. And
some don't. Quality of the result of our efforts depends on the quality
of communication between users, customers and developers, designers.

Patterns help us understand existing organizations. Patterns have
everything to do with transferring knowledge. They are often associated
with reuse. They provide transfer of concept, insights, and information.. Our software projects don't span generations.

So we need short cuts, getting teams together that are able of learning
and sharing a common language in a short time.
A good pattern language for organization should give us both the means
of expression and the freedom to tailor the solution to the particular
environment and context of application of the patterns.
