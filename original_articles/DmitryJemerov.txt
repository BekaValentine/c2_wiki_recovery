A last-year student and a maniac programmer ( :-) ), having just graduated with a diploma evaluating the use of ExtremeProgramming for writing corporate information systems. I work for VineYard (http://www.vineyardinc.com). I have written InfinityExplorer (http://infexp.sf.net), and I'm one of the developers of FarManager (http://www.rarsoft.com). I am also the lead developer of SyndiRella (http://www.syndirella.net). I live in St.Petersburg, Russia.

My e-mail is yole@yole.ru, and my ICQ UIN is 84614327. I also was a FidoNet SysOp (2:5030/654), but now my node is officially dead.

Nice to meet you, Dmitry ;-) Enjoy.
