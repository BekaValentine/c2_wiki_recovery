A category for pages that are almost entirely devoted to mincing words in that distinctive DeGeneralization fashion.

Probably a bad category. Good categories are thematic, classifying Wiki pages in mutually-exclusive categories. Having categories based on the style of the page or some other aspect of it will cross-cut across the whole wiki. Besides, people are interested in programming or philosophy or whatever, not definitions versus discussions ....

How useful is it to classify WhatIsConsciousness or CountryVsNation as DeGeneralization?
