The metaphor of the script includes such elements as plot, sequence, dialog, action, challenges and scene setting. 

Limitations are that the script is inherently constraining so it shouldn't be used for experts. And if the metaphor is taken strictly then the sequence of events will be unbreakable, making it ''extremely'' constraining. Compare InteractiveFiction with a regular novel.
