'''The "new" Windows Start Menu...''' 
* Launches and switches programs.
* Consists of a flat, scrollable, non-hierarchical panel of large clickable or touchable icons called tiles, which often display "live" status information, images, or other dynamic content.  In some respects, it is reminiscent of the box-of-icons approach used in Windows 3.x.  It is similar to -- and serves the same function as -- the icon-based app selection mechanisms used in the Android and iOS mobile operating systems.
* Was introduced in Windows Phone 7; is now featured in Windows 8.
* Is a major component of what was previously known as "Metro Style", but is now called the "Modern Style" user interface.

'''About the touch menu''' 
* According to ChaitanyaSareen:
** '' "Just like the introduction of the mouse, innovations like this do not happen without new OS support, new apps, and new hardware" '' 
** '' "We believe that, as with the mouse, we will see touch augmenting, but not replacing, most every aspect of the PC experience over time" ''
** '' "Moving beyond the Start menu, people now rely on the Taskbar, notification area, and desktop icons to launch applications and perform other tasks" ''
** '' "The goal behind the Windows 8 Start menu was to take all of those elements and create a more harmonious approach" ''
