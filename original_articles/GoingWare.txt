GoingWare is my software consulting business at http://www.goingware.com .

I'm starting to try out ExtremeProgramming a bit in my work.

I do cross-platform development in C++ for MacOS, BeOS, Windows and Unix / Linux, as well as Java work.

Please read my article on LargeScaleIndividualSoftwareDevelopment and add your own thoughts.
