An object which has been eviscerated, so that only its guts remain; the original object itself is gone.

For example:

 class Point
 {
 	private double x ;
 	private double y ;
 	// methods and stuff
 }

Is eviscerated to:

 double x ;
 doubly y ;

Evisceration can be used as a time or space optimisation; it saves the time and space overhead of an object. This is useful if your language or runtime doesn't do InlineObjects; most JVMs don't.

EvisceratedObject''''''s are useful as variables and as parameters. The annoying thing about EvisceratedObject''''''s is that you can't return them from methods in most languages, as you can usually only return one thing.

EvisceratedObject''''''s can be hidden inside collections, behind an OO interface; this is known as a CrossSection.

For example:

 class Point''''''Array
 {
 	private double[] xs ;
 	private double[] ys ;
 	// constructor etc
 	public Point get( int i )
 	{
 		return new Point( xs[i], ys[i] ) ;
 	}
 	public void set( int i, Point p )
 	{
 		xs[i] = p.x() ;
 		ys[i] = p.y() ;
 	}
 }

A subtle advantage of EvisceratedObject''''''s is that you can use them without ever having a real object. This might be useful if the real object is for some reason much more expensive than the sum of its parts, or requires some magic other than its parts to create.

For example, say you want to traverse a tree-structured XML document. In particular, you want to apply some operation to each element. If you wanted to pass an Element object to the operation, you would probably have to build Element objects which knew about their child elements, which in turn knew about their children, etc, so you would have to render the entire document as a tree before you could start. If you instead pass an eviscerated Element (just its name, attributes and perhaps any text content), you avoid this, and so are able to traverse the document without loading the entire thing at once.

* This is largely a pointless duplication of EviscerateParameters and, to some extent, CrossSection. EvisceratedObject is a more general case of both of those pages; perhaps they should be refactored towards this common centre;  -- TomAnderson
* It seems to me that an EvisceratedObject should literally be an object minus its guts, not the guts ''sans'' the rest of the object.
* Perhaps a name like SkinnedObject, JustTheGuts, or JustTheData would be better? -- JasperPaulsen
