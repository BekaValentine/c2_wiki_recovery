The ExtremeHypothesis is, of course, "This project we're looking at right here is Extreme."

A project supports the ExtremeHypothesis to the extent that it follows the ExtremeProgramming methodology. Some practitioners have suggested that projects should be rated by a number 0 <= p <= 1 designating the Proper Proportion of Extremeness of which the Project Partakes (PPEPP). 

Sticklers for detail of course point out that p is a function of time and contemplate a graph of p vs time. These individuals suggest that the top boundary of the graph, p=1, be designated Project Perfection, while the lower boundary, p=0, be designated Project Phailure. 

True Extremists, of course, just use good old 0 and 1, none of these wimpy uncommitted in-between kind of girly-man numbers.
