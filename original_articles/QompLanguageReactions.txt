Qomp is not a language, it is QompItself. Reactions are to be addressed toward QompItself, not the language.
* Now THAT is quite arrogant.  Part of Qomp IS a language - in particular, the QompLanguage portion that describes the ''syntax'' and ''semantics'' of the language described with the name 'Qomp'.  And we are WELL within our rights to direct reactions towards QompLanguage if we are thinking about the language.  What makes you think you know better where our reactions were addressed, that you felt it appropriate to tear the content out of this page and stick it in a page called 'QompItselfReactions'?.

Without an infrastructure, a language is useless. Qomp is not a new infrastructure that abandons all old code bases. Qomp makes use of existing infrastructure, and Qomp is an infrastructure itself.

''For that matter, the same could be said of JavaPlatform.  JavaLanguage, JavaVirtualMachine, a mountain of libraries, a standardization process, and a culture are all aspects of the overall AmorphousBlobOfHumanInsensitivity that is Java.  Perhaps some of the forces that drove decisions in QompLanguage came from other aspects of the overall whole and thus might have been taken differently if designing "just" a language.''
