Collaborative Development is a pattern language I'm working on. It is not fleshed out enough yet to post. This is my first attempt at writing a pattern language.

The forces that I plan to address are:
	* The needs of the team (knowledge transfer, goal completion, conflict resolution etc.)
	* The needs of the team members (money, respect, growth, customization etc.)

Specific emphasis will be placed on Decision Making and Process Change.
