HigherPrinciplesDiscussion is created as a discussion page on '''Wiki''''''HigherPrinciples'''.

After enduring seemingly endless wars even since I came to Wiki, and seeing valued WikiZens left in disgust (very strong word but it communicates the feeling of the ones that left), I felt there is a need to look BeyondWarAndCasualties.

And perhaps quite timely as well. LarrySanger has just published his memoirs, and revealed a side of WikiPedia I was never aware as a user. Instead before I became active here I was not aware of the difficulties facing the most valuable RegularContributors here.

* MakeRoomForAllViewpoints
* EgolessWiki
* CommunityProcess
* WelcomeToWikiPleaseBePolite
* LetEveryWordTell

(I will explain my reasoning and exercise the right to change my mind as usual).
