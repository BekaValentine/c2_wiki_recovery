'''Observations made'''

The article at http://www.theherald.co.uk/business/28210-print.shtml quoted a study that some Scots have chosen to migrate to Dublin to make a living, as the corporate culture is more relaxed, professional, flexible and supportive. Perhaps a Decentralized Organization could aim to win back the individual creativity lost through implementation of rigid policies by management at remote locations.

The link at http://www.atkearney.com/shared_res/pdf/strat_and_leadership_S.pdf looked at factors in integration of companies after a merger. While appearing to be the "opposite" to the direction taken in this page (integration /centralising "cultural aspects"), it has value for readers interested in DecentralizedOrganization and TheHeartOfChange.

'''From the AttentionEconomy article'''

''Organizations will diminish in importance at rapid pace, relative to the importance of the individuals who are temporarily in them.''

The author went on to using Harvard U to illustrate his case. Has anyone got information in the 6-8 years since his article, whether educational institutions are indeed much more decentralized?
