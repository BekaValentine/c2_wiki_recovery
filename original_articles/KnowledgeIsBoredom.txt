The more you know the more likely you are to get bored. For example, if you know how to factor repetition out of your code, but the organization won't let you, then you will probably be bored out of your skull doing it the "low brow" way. This is one reason why organizations are reluctant to hire "overqualified" people. Such people tend to use their knowledge to "stir the pot", taking managers out of their comfort zone. And, their code probably requires a higher-skilled person to read and modify effectively, increasing replacement expenses.

It is not that every well-informed person is going to stir the pot, but a high enough percent will do it to give all a bad reputation. It is difficult to put your candle under a box and keep your mouth shut.
