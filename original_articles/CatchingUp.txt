Sometimes a notions we have can only become "WhatItWantsToBe" by the making of a structure upon which and within which we can add " the works " that will make the clock tick. To have merely a case with a face and hands does not make a clock. It must have the inner-workings which make the outer-appearance reflect the "time it is". 

In other cases, as the design field is going to be, if it is not already there, where the technology and the hardware are a generation or two ahead of the "way we do things now", a generation of implementation may simply be skipped, existing only on a sketch pad or a series of design drawings. In this way designers may "catch up" by jumping over. 

Quickness and expedience may dictate that we crystalize a design such that we can produce, manufacture and/or distribute a product or process for use in an intervening period, being serviceable until we "catch up" in implementing current and concurrent material and practices.
