WikiStub: This is a placeholder page to explore the idea of what a good wiki page is.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:The_perfect_article for WikiPedia's view (and a good starting point), but remember that WikiIsNotWikipedia and WikipediaIsNotWiki.

You know, you  messed this up, because that wasn't really "WikiPedia's view", it was ''wiki's'' view; i.e. part of the WikiWay that doesn't belong to either in isolation, but both.  Now you've hurt the WikiWay, because those codes were actually quite powerful and part of a GreatTransition for the Internet itself to move to the WikiWay.  I know this because I made many of those lines myself on WikiPedia.
