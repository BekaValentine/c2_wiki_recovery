One can potentially reduce code by making comments be logger notes and vise versa. The "logger" can be a text file for tracing or logging processes, but also a status-bar message for "debug mode" or internal process status messages.

  logger("Wake Up");
  while (! clockRing) {
    snooze();
    clockRing = clock.status;
  }
  yawn();
  butt.move(outOfBed);

  logger("Shave");
  razor.wet()
  face.putCreamOn();
  razor.move(upAndDown);

  logger("Get Dressed");
  shirt.Find("work",style.Dilbert);
  Etc...
  
I noticed this one day when my logger comments were nearly identical to my code-section comments (HeadlinesTechnique). In the spirit of OnceAndOnlyOnce, I consolidated most of them.
