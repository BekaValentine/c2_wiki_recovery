Predicate logic is the branch of logic dealing with propositions in which subject and predicate are separately signified, reasoning whose validity depends on this level of articulation, and systems containing such propositions and reasoning. Also called quantification theory. 

''This formal system is distinguished from other systems in that its formulas contain variables which can be quantified.''
