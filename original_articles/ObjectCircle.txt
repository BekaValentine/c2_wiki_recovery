A PolygonObject which is round and defined by its radius, which is the distance from its center. Also, the  diameter is twice the radius, and the area=2*pi*r^2. Its center is usually defined as (x,y) in CartesianCoordinates.

AntiComment:

''What's the context for this page?'' AntiComment, I think.
