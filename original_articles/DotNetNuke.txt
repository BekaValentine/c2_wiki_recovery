Why is this thing listed on WikiEngines? Doesn't look like it is a WikiClone or even has any extension which resembles that. Btw, doesn't seem all too professional anyhow (javascript: links all over, spacer gifs, bloated html templates, not even a search function). Appears that "OpenSource" is just used here once more as promotional BuzzWord.

If Promotion means activity and improvement, I am for it, buzzword or not. Let's see where this goes.

Its not listed as a Wiki on WikiEngines.  There is a wiki that is written as a module for DotNetNuke.
