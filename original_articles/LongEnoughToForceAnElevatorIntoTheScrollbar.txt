''Originated on WellFactoredCode...''
Look at the vertical scrollbar on this window (if this is an application with a vertical scroll bar).  Notice that there is no rectangular box ("elevator") between the up and down arrows.

It took me a minute to realize that I did not know what was being described, and another few seconds to realize what was meant.  I added this description (my first added page) in hopes that it might help someone.  If it is so obvious as to be "lame", feel free to delete it.

''Well, I actually think RandyKramer is referring to the vertical scrollbar in the text input box of the edit page. And I'd say this reflects another bit of bad UI on the part of the browser developers. The scrollbar should never be present without both arrows and elevator; it doesn't make sense to have arrows with no elevator -- especially since the arrows don't do anything until the text is long enough to scroll. -- TomStambaugh''

Further discussion moved to LongEnoughToForceAnElevatorIntoTheScrollbarDiscussion. Sorry, but I don't see anything unusual. Perhaps it depends on monitor size, browser version, OS version, etc.
