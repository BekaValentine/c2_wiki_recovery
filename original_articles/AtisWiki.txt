AtisWiki was a WikiWikiClone based on CvWiki.
	* uses perl5 features, e.g. CGI.pm
	* Somewhat modular: Backend and wikimarkup-to-html-conversion are implemented as Perl Modules.
	* Multiformat: You can choose at runtime between different markups: ascii, wiki, html, transclude.
	* page renaming.
	* Pluggable Backends: CVS, RCS, File.
	* script to convert the Wiki to html.
	* GPLed (thanks, Ward!)

AtisWiki was developed for in-house documentation at ATIS Department of Computer Science, University of Karlsruhe / Germany. 

The AtisWiki home Wiki is at http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~denker/old/AtisWiki.html

Marcus,

I am currently trying to install and configure AtisWiki and on step 4 of the installation guide it reads:

4) copy GNUWiki to /usr/lib/cgi-bin, edit config: e.g:
   -> change path to PageArchive.pm / Wiki.pm:
       use lib '/home/marcus';
   -> choose Backend:
        e.g.  use PageArchiveRCS;
   -> change path to the Wiki-files/choose Backend:
       my $pa = new PageArchive("/usr/local/wiki/GNUWiki");
     or:      ...      PageArchiveRCS(....).

I was wondering what file this config I had to edit is under or what it is called... Can you help me out and clarify this step in the installation process?

Thanks

AustinBrookie

Works great! Thank you Marcus & WikiMaster''''''s. 

I'm running it at http://joyful.com/cgi/wiki?AboutThisWiki with some usability hacks - in particular, the edit text form appears on every page for faster editing. Comments welcome!

''Hey there Marcus, I confess I only tried to run AtisWiki for the first time - been using CvWiki until today. In general it worked great, but I hit a couple of snags:''

	* ''The RCS page archive class didn't work for me - it may be that my version of RCS produces strings in a different format to yours - it wouldn't show/keep a complete revision history. So I had to go back to CVS but then ...''

	* ''I don't know if this is intentional, but the time-machine aspect of CvWiki seems to have been lost. If I pull up an old page it has links to the current wiki pages, not the aged ones.''

''This last is a killer for using it for project documentation - I think I'm going to have to go back to CvWiki. Unless you happen to have fixed these in the latest version ... ?'' -- PeterMerel

A nice implementation!

I had to fix the Print Raw HTML function, as it needed the HTTP headers to function correctly. As I fixed it, I decided to wrap the "raw" HTML with Wiki's header and footer, just to make things consistent with other pages - the only difference between swiki and rawhtml (on my box) is that rawhtml doesn't create links to other pages in the Wiki.

My first project (using a Wiki) involves documenting the SNMP MIBs in our cable modem product. I slightly modified the LinkPattern so MIB variable names like "docsIfCmStatusT2Timeouts" are accepted as links:

 $LinkPattern = "([a-z]*[A-Z]+[a-z]+[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]*|_[\\\w.:_]+_)";
I haven't tried linking it with CVS or RCS yet; there hasn't been enough activity to spur me on.

I have a problem with BackLink''''''s though - nearly all 400 pages in the MIB documentation reference its front page, but it only displays about a dozen of the BackLink''''''s. Editing and saving the front page hasn't changed anything. It would be nice to get this working right, because one click would generate an index. -- LarryKollar

I released a new version today, here is the Changelog:

Version 0.3alpha:
	* changed "Backlinks" to do simple searching until I find the Backlinks-BUG.

Version 0.2alpha
	* added Umlauts to FormatWiki.html
	* added Umlauts to $LinkPattern
	* use application/x-www-form-urlencoded for posting instead of multipart/form-data (Problems with some Versions if Lynx, reported by Andreas Gross)
	* case-insensitive searching (by SimonMichael)
	* added file: URLs (FIX by SimonMichael)
	* FormatRawHtml: send HTTP-Header before sending the HTML-Data (Bugfix by LarryKollar)
	* FormatWiki: bullet list: <TAB> optional (problems with some Versions of Lynx, reported by Andreas Gross)
	* $LinkPattern: allows CAPSWord, but not CAPSWORD (SimonMichael)
	* Moved printHeaderText, printFooterText to "LookAndFeel.pm"
	* created LookAndFeelJoyfull.pm, LookAndFeelRO.pm ("Joyful" Edit-box by SimonMichael)
	* Wiki-Markup: Lines starting with "|" : no Parsing for WikiLink''''''s (requested by Andreas Gross)
	* Lines can be joined with "\" at the end of the line.
	* Quoting of Wikinames: $WikiName will not be converted to a link (requested by Andreas Gross)
	* copied locking from CVWiki

No WayBackMode yet, but I'll add this soon. -- MarcusDenker

I'm having trouble getting backslashes to appear using wiki mode in AtisWiki. Any ideas?

''Use a different wiki? The AtisWiki TODO file says "BUG: \ in the middle of a line".''

Alternatively, you could try changing the following line in FormatWiki.pm (in the WikiToHTML subroutine):

old:

    $_ =~ s/\\.*\n/ /g; 
new:

    $_ =~ s/\\[ \t]*\n/ /g; 
This change should (I haven't tested it) make backslashes special only at the end of a line (with optional trailing whitespace). -- CliffordAdams
