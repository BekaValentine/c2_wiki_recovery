Also known as SoftwareDesignForTesting :-)

As you design a segment of code, one should consider what one will need in order to verify that a segment of code is behaving correctly and and that you're getting correct results.  I stipulate that any results presented by a code segment should be accessible in some manner by an external automation routine. Whatever that may be. Because I am already one with the Dominion (Microsoft) and Lazy (Visual Basic for Applications Bound) I am finding the VB/VBA Office environment adequate for most of my work needs.  Code testability is an essential ingredient for any coding environment.  That being said. Please forgive me if I remain in my chosen area of knowledge; VB/VBA/MS Office.
