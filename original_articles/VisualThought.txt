It is a very capable drawing package, particularly good for diagrams with symbols and attached connections. Has anyone created new symbols/palettes for it?

''Can you describe it a bit more? The documentation at the URL above is sparse and would like to know some more before spending time downloading it. Does it have templates for UML etc?''

Yes, it has "palettes" for everything, including UML, ERD, Flowchart, Booch, HP Fusion, Jacobson, OMT, network and logic circuits.
