I am an Electrical Engineer converting to Software Engineering.  I have worked at Tektronix in Beaverton, Emerson Electric in St. Louis, Boeing Electronics and Boeing Airplane in Seattle/Everett and MFIA here in Portland, Oregon.  My most notorious work accomplishment was the manufacturing engineering work in building the box that shoots the Peacekeeper (aka MX) missile.

I plan to spend a few more months taking CS classes at PSU, and find a job so I can live the good life.

Smalltalk is very much different from anything else I've seen, and I'm still digesting it. I've been exposed to it for only 7 weeks.

I would like to know why Smalltalk should be preferred to C++.
