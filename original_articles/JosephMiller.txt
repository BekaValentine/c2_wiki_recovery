I'm a postdoc in mathematics in NewZealand. I'm new to Wiki, but I think I like it.

To find out a little more about me check out my other home page: '''http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~jmiller/'''.

'''Questions.''' You're a mathematician?!? ''Are there really new things to be proved?''
'''''What do you study?'''''

'''Answers.''' Yes. ''Again, yes. But don't ask me about it.'' '''''Okay, if you insist.'''''
I work in the fringe between ComputabilityTheory (also called RecursionTheory) and classical mathematics. In
particular, I've been known to study:

	* AlgorithmicRandomness
	* ReverseMathematics
	* ComputableAnalysis

None of these link to actual WikiPage''''''s yet, but I might change that someday.
