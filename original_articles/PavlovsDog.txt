The archetype of classical behaviourism. Pavlov hooked a starving dog's salivary gland up to a tube. He rang a bell. Nothing happened. Then he rang a bell and presented food. Saliva. Did that a few times then rang a bell without presenting food. Yup, saliva.

This demonstrates learning. What I learned is, don't let that Pavlov guy anywhere near your dog.
