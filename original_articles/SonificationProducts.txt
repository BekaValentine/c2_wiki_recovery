'''If you find yourself'''

designing sonifications for small, mobile, info-tech consumer products

''for example''
* e1: sound schemes for menu browsing in a mobile phone [Marila 2002] http://www.icad.org/websiteV2.0/Conferences/ICAD2002/proceedings/39_JuhaMarila.pdf
* e2: sound design for a digital camera [Maeda et al. 2002] http://www.icad.org/websiteV2.0/Conferences/ICAD2002/proceedings/35_KoozooMaeda.pdf
* e3: sound design for electric home appliances [Tsuchida 2002]http://www.icad.org/websiteV2.0/Conferences/ICAD2002/proceedings/78_tsuchida.pdf

''with the problem that''
	 :	the sounds in most products are either alarms or embellishments, and most people are not familiar with sonifications that convey other types of information

''entailing forces''
* f1: people are used to alarms and decorative sounds
* f2: but are not familiar with the use of sounds to provide information for other kinds of tasks

'''THEN'''

Design a sonification that provides information that makes the product more useful, usable and enjoyable

''Apply''
	 :	The Bauhaus aesthetic that "form should follow function" along with the design and evaluation criteria from papers at ICAD 2002 listed here:
* Amusing, Interesting
* Annoyance, Nuisance, Stress, Unnecessary
* Brand, Logo, Look and feel, Image, Style, Theme
* Comfort, Ergonomics, Pleasantness
* Culture, Culture-neutral
* Effectiveness, Efficiency, Effort, Performance
* Emotional quality
* Environmental context, Intentional context
* Hearable, Perceivable
* Expressiveness, Information level, Urgency
* Learning curve, Instant Usability, Long-term Usability
* Understandable, Accuracy, Errors, Identifiable
* Usefulness, Functionality, Importance, Relevance

''to construct''
	 :	a sonification that sets the product apart by making it more useful, usable, easy to learn and understand, and pleasurable to use.

''leading to''
	 :	wider use of sonifications in new products

''and''
	 :	application of sonification from laboratory research projects to real world applications
