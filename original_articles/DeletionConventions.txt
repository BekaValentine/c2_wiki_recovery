Anyone can delete anything, and anyone can restore a PageDeletion. However, it would be nice if people generally followed some of the suggested conventions below.

* First, WhenToDeletePages.
** AreYouThere
** DeleteOnceRestoreOnce
** ExponentialBackoffEditing
** WikiSquatting
* Then, HowToDeletePages. Deletion tags:
** DeletedButWelcome (HowToUseDeletedButWelcome)
** DeleteNoContent (BeforeYouDeleteNoContent)
** DeleteNoContextLinks
** DeleteObsolete
