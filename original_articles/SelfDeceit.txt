SelfDeceit (or KiddingY''''''ourself) is practiced by everyone but me. :)

I was recently on the receiving end of CriticizeBluntly in life. I purposefully put away the matter for a few days before reflecting on the comments. If I do so immediately, my defenses would go up and could wind up dismissing all charges. I could go into a Holier''''''Than''''''Thou mode and sink into SelfDeceit without knowing about it.
* Above is a good reason to put away for consideration the comments received for a few more weeks. :)

All considered, SelfDeceit is not good as it is a DenialOfService''''''T''''''oTheSoul. A person can get by without nourishment only for so long then getting visibly weakened. With M''''''ilesToGoBeforeISleep, I cannot afford the luxury of SelfDeceit. I am now getting hungry and yearn for C''''''hickenSoupForTheSoul.

'''Almost SelfDeceit but pragmatic'''

It may appear that I am providing "justification" for SelfDeceit here. Having said that, the Churchill quote in ''"AlmostTrue"'' is, on balance, valid.

"Rationalization" aside, if you have to "lie" because of "HigherPrinciples''''''A''''''tStake", you will do a better job if you convince yourself first of what you "need others to buy-in".

Note FiveStagesOfGrief starts with SelfDeceit, it is only human to want to "shield" ourselves from the bad news.

'''So what are the RulesToLiveBy, in terms of matters relevant to this page?'''

Probably one way is to make sure that there are frequent and ample opportunities for Introspection. Make it very apparent to yourself about your own self-interests, acknowledge its presence, as well as its "importance".

If you do not survive, you cannot be there promoting higher principles. OTOH, is the current situation that desperate? Are there indeed no other ways to proceed? Or perhaps "waiting" is the better choice for the moment?

In rare instances, people "sacrifice" themselves with survival at stake, believing that others in the community are better suited (such as skills, opportunities) to "carry the torch".

Tough questions and no easy answers.
