This is a placeholder really, just so my name appears in blue instead of with a ? at the end.

I'm fussy like that.

Pretty soon I'll upload my autobiography (ISBN: 0807059099), so you lucky wikizens will have something good to read.

In the meantime, I'm a HumbleLispWeenie for fun, and program RubyOnRails all day for marginally less fun but more money.
