I founded the first and biggest Italian developers web site http://www.programmazione.it in 1999.
I worked for many years as a consultant in software development & project management in Italy & Switzerland and, in 2000, I founded an ICT company (I'm the Chief Technology Officer).
I'm coordinating the Italian Agile Movement (http://www.agilemovement.it), the official Italian Agile User Group (listed in the Agile Alliance User Group directory).

In the last few years, I studied the chaos theory for my pleasure in my spare time but one day, as in a lightning flash, I realized that it was applicable to software development and I started looking for someone who shared my "revelation" :-), I found Jim's 'Adaptive Software Development' and some others like K. J. Dooley 'A Complex Adaptive Systems Model of Organisation Change' and T. Peters 'Thriving on Chaos, Handbook for a Management Revolution'.
I discovered then the AgileManifesto (and the AgileAlliance) and now here I am. :-)

In 2003 I have been elected as member of the AgileAlliance board of directors.
