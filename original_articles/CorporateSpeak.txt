An affliction similar to NewSpeak, but pandemic in American businesses.  Typified by (mis)use of motivational terms (''It's not a problem, it's a '''challenge''' ''), faddishness with technical jargon (anything-dot-com,
e-anything), and a curious desire to get quality results without paying for them.

e.g. Work Smarter, Not Harder ? Ironically, XP is about that (in a logical meaning of the term). I guess the irony was always that a project managed in a totally illogical manner was most likely to have this as their battle cry.
