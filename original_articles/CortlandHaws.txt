I actually changed my name to Cortland Klein.
SubEthaEdit is a great program; I wonder if the idea of live multiuser editing could apply to WikiWikiWeb as a whole.

Hey, why do most Wiki's not promote ''''''GoodUrl''''''s? For example, this page is http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CortlandHaws . Shouldn't it be h''''''ttp://c2.com/wiki/C''''''ortlandHaws ?

''No, that is a different URL where the CortlandHaws page isn't''
