''Vapors and clouds to raindrops and puddles to streams, rivers, lakes and oceans which re-assimilate into "new and different vapors" ''
* WhatIs "My Thinking and Thoughts"
** Complex, Disjointed and suffering from lack of "Total Organization"
*** probably not achievable in a lifetime since things are added faster than we can organize them
*** this is true also of the "GlobalBrain" or the internet, whichever is the bigger (I suspect the first)
** We postpone the tremendous work involved in joining, linking and relating material in a form similar to a presentation, a process or a discussion
*** since this is not the way our mind works. It is wired in an "AnonymousMesh" 
*** perhaps in trying to name or label things in our mind, we would only make it harder to recover or recollect, since "where in the world did I put the thing" is related to "what in the world did I call the thing".
*** rather our mind is more like the uncondensed, mixed and floating vapors, we call "clouds", which are nearly shapeless, even when not and reminding us of, or looking like something familiar, like a dog, an elephant or a goodyearblimp, in but a short time, it does not (look like it)
* Recently, when thinking about ideas I have now and have had in the past about the organization of PersonalInformation, stored within computers and computer networks, in looking back, I discover what I call "AnticipationalHints" of what may come to be. 
** this is like the concept expressed by WardCunningham on many occasions about what something "Wants to be" which translated, may mean, what I want the vapors or the cloud of thinking about it to become in realized condensations of objects, or object pools (which we may call "puddles")
** the imaging in out mind of such pools, stretches to what becomes of the pools when becoming either bigger, or by evaporation  smaller.
*** when bigger, becoming streamlets, joining with other pools (becoming larger) into streams into creekd, into rivers, into lakes, into oceans!
** this is what the "GlobalBrain" or the internet, whichever, has as a vapor or collection of individual thought has to growing collective of other individual thinking and thought.
