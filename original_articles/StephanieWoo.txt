''Stephanie, This is an open access site but this does not mean it is available to host material which is OffTopic for the purposes of this site. Your material is all OffTopic for this site which is concerned with people, projects and patterns for computer programming. If you want to host this material, as compared with testing how a wiki works, you should look for some other site. Someone else, not me, is deleting your material. This site was actually the original wiki site and many others are now around for different purposes. Please have a look at WelcomeVisitors and understand something about this site.  Best wishes'' -- JohnFletcher

this is someone else - the content isn't even original; it's just some professor's syllabus. Go find a Gothic Novels Wiki - they'd welcome it, and we'd welcome a bridge link here...
