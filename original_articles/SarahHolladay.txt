I have a cat, '''''Purrsk''''', and a dog, '''''Keyta''''', and her four puppies:

	*'''''Beauregard'''''
	*'''''Cassandra'''''
	*'''''Elise'''''
	*'''''Josephine'''''

'''''I did it myself'''''.

''In my opinion, they are excellent works of art, from someone with exceptional natural talent.''
