A Category by which AntiPattern''''''s can be classified.

From the AntiPatternsBook, there are four:
* DevelopmentAntiPattern

We can add:
* GreyPattern (maybe not an AntiPattern)
* PeopleWareAntiPattern (sub-category from ManagementAntiPattern?)

['''NOTE:''' is this page not redundant? Can this content be moved to CategoryAntiPattern and that page contain an index?]
