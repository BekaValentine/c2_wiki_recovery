One's Kibo Number is meant as a measure of degrees of separation from JamesKiboParry.  Your Kibo Number is 1 higher than the lowest Kibo Number of anyone you've received e-mail from.  If you've received mail from Kibo yourself, your Kibo Number is 1.

Not quite as important since, by now, more people know about AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs than about Kibo.

Proclaim your KiboNumber, if applicable:

	* NickBensema: 1
	* Xibo: 1
	* PaulHudson: 1 (I think. It was a very long time ago - 1988?)
	* BrianHampel: 2 (I correspond with his sister; I must assume she's a 1.)
	* MattThompson: 1 (Newbie, 2001.  It was about Manos!)
	* ChrisSamuel: 1 (from '93 - remember to SOLARIZE!)
	* Kerri: .01

If you corresponded with him in 1988, you might be even more elite than the members of Club '91: people who posted to AltReligionKibology in its first year.  --NickBensema

I'm pretty sure it was before a.r.k, yes -- PaulHudson
