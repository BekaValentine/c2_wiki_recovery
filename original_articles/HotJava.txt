HotJava is a 100% Java Web browser produced by SunMicrosystems. HotJava has a small footprint and is very customizable. More information is at http://java.sun.com/products/hotjava/index.html.

I don't know what Sun's definition of a "small footprint" is, but on my machine with 32MB, which happily runs Netscape 4, HotJava immediately starts thrashing. AFAIK, it's the biggest memory hog of all browsers I have seen.
