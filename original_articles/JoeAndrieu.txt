Hello.

I am an Internet consultant, currently doing project management.  I'm also the founder and president of the InternetDevelopersAssociation [http://www.association.org], a non-profit trade association for Internet content developers.  My primary interest here in for my own project, developing a multi-user environment.

Recently a friend recommended reading Christopher Alexander's The Timeless Way Of Building and it has added a whole new dimension to the project. I've recently purchased the Gang Of Four book and I'm looking forward to reading it.

Many thanks to Ward Cunningham and the rest of the community here.  It is a joy to find such a wonderful, living resource.
