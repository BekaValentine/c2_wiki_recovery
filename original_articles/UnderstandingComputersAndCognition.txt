Stunning.  This book is many things:  

	* an introduction to existentialism, hermeneutics, and the theory of biology.
	* a critique of modern ArtificialIntelligence and cognitive science work.
	* a proposal for a new way to design computer software.
	* a ''rockin' ''discussion of TheRationalisticTradition.

Just read it.
