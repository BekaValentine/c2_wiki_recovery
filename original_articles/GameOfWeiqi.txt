Weiqi is an ancient strategy board game for two persons that originated in China. It is known in Western society as GameOfGo, due to the extensive promotion funded by '''Nihon Ki-In''' and other Japanese initiatives.

Also to the credit of Japanese, the ''Hikaru No Go Manga'' managed to rescue a lot of youngsters from TV back to the folds of this game. I, DavidLiu, found out about this Manga phenomena from BBC cableTV in 2003. This Manga series (refer: http://senseis.xmp.net/?HikaruNoGoManga) managed to have translations into English and Chinese languages.
