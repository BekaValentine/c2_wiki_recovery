I am currently (end of '97) working on a medical information system with decision support component.  It's written in mainly C++ but with some Delphi OCX's.  We're using an Objectivity OODB.

Although I have an educational background of business analysis, I've worked in on systems ranging from PC BIOS and burn-in diagnostics to Smalltalk environment development real-time medical programmes and a tad of business programming.  I am interested in testability, reproducibility and correctness in object oriented programming.

I am very impressed and optimistic about the state of the art in patterns.  I wish I had another 6 hours a day to keep up on them.

I'm always up for discussions.
