Organizational Patterns of Agile Software Development

see /.: http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/1817241 ... "Paul S. R. Chisholm writes ''What makes a software development project succeed? It's not language or tools or process. It's not a simple as people; even great programmers sometimes find themselves associated with disasters. In some sense, a successful project is the same thing as a successful organization; but what makes those? We need an anti-Dilbert. In Organizational Patterns of Agile Software Development, James O. Coplien and Neil B. Harrison lay out the results of their research on the subject; what they found, helps.''"
