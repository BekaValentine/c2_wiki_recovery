I have been working in the field of OO development since 1988. This is relatively late compared to WardAndKent. However, I was fortunate enough to be part of a ResearchTrianglePark community that thrived on Smalltalk. I learned OO Design (Class Responsibility Collaboration cards) by watching a video that WardAndKent produced with Reed Phillips at NorthCarolinaStateUniversity. I worked at IBM for six years. At IBM, I got a great education in delivering some quality products. Good people were the most important ingredient in those products.

A huge telecommunications project in 1993 taught me some things about use cases. I was fortunate to meet some of the great people (who are still active in this community) in Bell Northern Research Ottawa and RTP on that project. After a year and a half, I moved from this huge, multi-site project to one where I worked as a liaison between a Business Process Reengineering group and an Object Center. The dynamics of business and software people was definitely an invaluable experience.

I moved into the world of startups in 1996 and saw an even more diverse group of people. Delivery was "life or death" and I realized that software in these organizations didn't have to come with caveats. Startups need to be agile. People play an important role in that agility. Good people are necessary to deliver software projects of any magnitude.

My philosophy is that there are many different types of projects. Certainly one size of process does not fit all. Like many in this community, I have seen projects that are wildly successful and others that were absolute failures. Through all of these projects, I have found that what is important is your family and friends. Projects come and go, as far as I know, life on earth comes only once.

''Hi Randy - Do you know if the video you saw is available online, or is there perhaps a better reference or source for the NCSU video project? I searched the NCSU site for Ward's name, and found only a design lecture presentation by LaurieWilliams which references CRC cards (downloadable from http://ecommerce.ncsu.edu/studio/lectures/designLecture.pdf) ... I can't find anything about Reed Phillips on the web that relates to CRC cards except http://www.mojowire.com/TravelsWithSmalltalk/DaveThomas-TravelsWithSmalltalk.htm. TIA -- KarenSmiley''
