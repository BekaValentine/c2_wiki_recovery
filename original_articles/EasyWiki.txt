http://erfurtwiki.sourceforge.net/EasyWiki, download size 1.5MB

A distribution (or "fork") of the ErfurtWiki engine, specially tailored for Windows systems - not meant for Windows 3.x, only NT derivatives like WindowsXp and Win2000 are supported! It comes with a simple installer and extracts all required files into fixed places (C:\EasyWiki\). The benefit: pages are also editable via Windows NotePad because of the flat file backend.
The archive it is made up of:
* ErfurtWiki as base - written in PHP
* separate (PhpLanguage) PHP interpreter - regardless if there is already one installed
* Nanoweb HTTP server (also written in plain PHP script!) from http://nanoweb.si.kz/

While it is extremely simple to install (everything happens automatically), the Web server is not really stable under all Windows versions. It comes without documentation for the wiki engine and Web server, while the ErfurtWiki engine is still configurable (if one knows how to).
