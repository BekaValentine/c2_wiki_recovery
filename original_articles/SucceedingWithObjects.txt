[ISBN:0201628783] This book, by Adele Goldberg and Kenneth S. Rubin is a very rich source of information on getting your organization up and running with object oriented technology. The authors offer ''frameworks'' to choose from  that can help you succeed in your development efforts.  I have found their frameworks for Reuse especially useful.
