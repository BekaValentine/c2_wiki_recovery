The functionality was improved and called QuickDiff.

''Original functionality:''

When a lengthy or important page shows up in RecentChanges you may wonder what change put it there. You can get a line by line list of differences. Here's how...

	* Press EditText at the bottom of the page to get the text entry form for the page.
	* Press EditCopy at the bottom of this page to get the backup copy's entry form.
	* Scroll to the bottom of this page looking for the '''Differences''' section heading.

Wiki runs a unix ''diff'' between the two versions and puts the output, if any, in the '''Differences''' section. A page authored from only one site won't have a backup copy so you won't find an EditCopy button. In this case there is nothing to compare.

Here's an idea: could you put an <A NAME> around the Differences section, such that a script could cause my web browser to go straight to there? -- GrahamHughes
