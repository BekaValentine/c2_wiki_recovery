KyleCordes and I just got back from XpUniverse full of energy about forming an XP group here in St. Louis. I've currently started an XP mailing list in town (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpstl), and I'm about to announce an organizational meeting of a users group as soon as we can figure out where to meet.

Any potential XPers in St. Louis should feel free to join the mailing list or email me directly at bbutton@objectmentor.com -- BrianButton

XpStLouis also has a web site now, and has had a couple of meetings.

Better (more active and open) site, run by the same group leaders:
