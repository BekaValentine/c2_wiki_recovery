DataVision is an Open Source reporting tool similar to Crystal Reports. Reports can be designed using a drag-and-drop GUI. They may be run, viewed, and printed from the application or exported as HTML, XML, PDF, LaTeX2e, DocBook, or tab- or comma-delimited text files. The output files produced by LaTeX2e and DocBook can in turn be used to produce PDF, text, HTML, PostScript, and more. Written in Java

RIVA is a report building utility. At its core, RIVA takes dynamic data and generates easily configurable business graphs from them. The RIVA application uses JFreeChart, JFreeReport, and Commons-Logging as its base infrastructure. The RIVA SDK incorporates Eclipse, Maven, JUnit and several other standard libraries.

Considered related by someone on the web (someone talking about using a library like JFreeReport and then wanting to generate PS/PDF):

iText is a library that allows you to generate PDF files on the fly.

The iText classes are very useful for people who need to generate read-only, platform independent documents containing text, lists, tables and images

Furthermore, JasperReports uses iText to drive the PDF output of its reporting engine.

Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) is the world's first print formatter driven by XslFormattingObjects (XSL-FO) and the world's first output independent formatter. It is a Java application that reads a formatting object (FO) tree and renders the resulting pages to a specified output. Output formats currently supported include PDF, PCL, PS, SVG, XML (area tree representation), Print, AWT, MIF and TXT. The primary output target is PDF.
