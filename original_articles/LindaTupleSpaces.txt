Linda implemented TupleSpace for parallel and distributed computing. Linda (and TupleSpace) was an invention of the YaleLindaGroup led by DavidGelernter.

A commercial implementation is available from ScientificComputingAssociates: http://www.sca.com/site/products/linda.html

''Time seems to have moved on. The most recent references I could see at Yale is 1996 and some of the links are broken. ScientificComputingAssociates appear to have sold their domain name and are now at http://LindaSpaces.com/ -- JohnFletcher''

They should not be confused with the other Scientific Computing Associates at http://www.scausa.com.

See: Sun's JavaSpaces and IBM's TSpaces (http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/TSpaces/)

Is TSpaces really related to Linda? It's hard to see from the IBM commercial overtalk.
