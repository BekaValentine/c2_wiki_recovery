The SEI CapabilityMaturityModel specifies an increasing series of levels that a software development organization can be at. But what is a SoftwareDevelopmentProcess but a semi-automated system for developing software. So the SEI is specifying a system, so maybe they are actually a software development organization. If so what level would they be at? --PeteMcBreen (who sees this as one of life's InterestingQuestions)

The process they use to develop CMMs is probably somewhere in the range between Repeatable and Defined (level 2-3), but it's unlikely that the SEI has had an assessment done on its CMM writing process because there's too little reason to do so.

But why do you ask?  If the CMM were a level zero in their own practices, it might suggest that they don't know what they're talking about, don't "practice what they preach" as the saying goes.  In that case, we're allowed to ignore them with a clean conscience.  But whoa, we're allowed to do that anyway.

Well, there are several different CMM's (CapabilityMaturityModel's) from
the SEI so it might be useful to know which combination of the System CMM,
Software CMM, and People CMM you are referring to. If you mean "all of the
above", then would it surprise you to know that someone actually proposed
a CMM for the development of CMMs? --BradAppleton
