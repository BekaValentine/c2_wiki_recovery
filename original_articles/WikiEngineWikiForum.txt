Is a solution emerging to call a given instance of wiki software a WikiEngine and a given instance of a particular wiki a WikiForum? How bad is the confusion problem? For many words -- flower, car -- in English, context answers the confusion, and if context is not enough we add for example "species" or "model" for types of something -- e.g., this flower species, this model car. 

If we really want a word to add to wiki (for the purposes of making a WikiName, say :-) don't think of a wiki primarily as a forum. Can we come up with a word besides "forum" maybe something that honors DocumentMode as much as ThreadMode?

How about...

Brainstorming:

	* WikiSite 
	* WikiWeb 
	* Wiki
	* WikiWiki
	* WikiCollection
	* ...

I vote for WikiWeb (adrian15)

A problem with WikiWeb is that a TWiki installation includes multiple webs (Main, TWiki, Know, and Sandbox by default).  I vote for WikiSite.  -- RandyKramer - 7 Apr 2003
