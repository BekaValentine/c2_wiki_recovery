RemoveLineAddSameLineAgain (RLASLA) is a refactoring where the developer removes a line of code that fails to compile, then re-adds the same line again. This refactoring is usually performed for one of two reasons:

* A CodeMonkey performs RLASLA in hopes that somehow their compile error is an internal compiler error, not a human/monkey error
* An IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment user is attempting to compensate for the IDE's erroneous AST parsing or stale byte-code cache

RLASLA is a RefactoringSmell, meaning that there is no context under which it can be performed (aside from demonstration purposes) that does not point to a suspicion that something else in your development environment is horribly broken.
