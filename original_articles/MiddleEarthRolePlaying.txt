A good introduction for other games like RoleMaster. It is also produced by I.C.E. May once again get popular now the films are out. MERPS, as the name suggests, is based in Middle Earth. The tables are easier for beginners to get to grips with and it is not too difficult to move your characters onto RoleMaster later.
