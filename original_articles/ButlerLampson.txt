ButlerLampson once said, "all problems in Computer Science can be solved by another level of indirection" (sometimes misquoted as YouCanSolveAnyProblemWithAnotherLevelOfIndirection).

Butler's home page is at http://www.research.microsoft.com/lampson/default.htm

Author of HintsForComputerSystemDesign. Recipient of 1992 TuringAward.

In response to YouCanSolveAnyProblemWithAnotherLevelOfIndirection, and some other stuff, SteveHowell said this:

	 :	Every computer problem can be solved by adding											a layer of indirection.														
																	
	 :	Every societal problem can be solved by removing											a layer of indirection.

RohitKhare's essay http://www.4k-associates.com/IEEE-L7-names-trust.html
says that Butler Lampson was quoting David Wheeler, who worked on
EDSAC at the University of Cambridge and who invented the SubRoutine.
