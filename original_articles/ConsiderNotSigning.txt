Whenever you write something here and you're about to sign it, ask yourself why.

	1 To keep the thread straight
		* Refactor to document mode
			* Oftentimes the page cannot be meaningfully refactored until more ThreadMode discussion has occurred.  But consider applying RefactorByCondensingQuestionAnswerPair when you respond.
	1 To take credit
		* DoNotWorryAboutTheCredit - it is amazing what one can accomplish if one does not care who gets the credit.
	1 To take responsibility, so people know who to blame for edits.
		* DontBlameJustDo.  Instead of worrying about who made the change, why not just fix it?
	1 Different authors' opinions carry different weights
		* This is an AntiPattern.  Contributions should be judged on their merits, not by who made them.
** Of course, if I'm not familiar with technology Foo and well-respected, and well-versed Userbar makes one comment about it, but well-known to be technologicially challenged Userbaz makes a contradictory comment, I'm going to go with Userbar's opinion until I have need to do further research on my own.

Consider also adding your name to the Contributors list instead of adding a signed comment.  This tends to keep the page in DocumentMode, and is a useful middle ground between signed threads and DoNotWorryAboutTheCredit.
