Joseph Campbell (1904-1987) is one of the more well-known mythographers, who formalized the descriptions of various myth cycles into some fairly consistent patterns.  He wrote a 4-volume series ( ''Masks of God'' ) detailing the histories of 3 major cultural areas and the overview of them (volumn 4 is the weakest, being that overview/synthesis).
GeorgeLucas used his work as the basis for the plot line(s) in the StarWars movie series.
