TestFirstUserInterfaces fields frequent JavaSwing questions, so here's a list of citations to some answers...

	* ''UnitTestingInJava - How Tests Drive the Code''
		* http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558608680
		* ''"The book teaches how to use JUnit to develop applications in a TestDrivenDevelopment style and covers advanced topics, eg. Web applications, GraphicalUserInterface''''''s, databases and threaded apps.''
		* ''"Search within http://www.mkp.com to download forewords, table of contents and sample chapter which is about test-first development of Java Swing GUIs."'' --JohannesLink

	* http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TestFirstUserInterfaces/message/63
		* ''a beautiful post by AndrewForward, including a code sample and lists of very specific useful concepts''
		* ''"My current project is Java using AWT / Swing with testing help from JUnit... In essence, before I write any production code (even for the GUI) - I really try and consider what I want a certain component (button, menu, panel, etc) to do and I figure out how I can assert it has just done what I expected (right, TDD). Perhaps because GUI libraries are already so huge that we might think TDD won't work - but it does.''

	* http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TestFirstUserInterfaces/message/193
		* ''my search cited Swing ''in-passim'' there, but the post also contains a very nice sumary of general TestFirstUserInterfaces issues ;-)''

	* GuiTesting
		* ''"Here is an example test, which adds a subtree of business nodes to a structure represented by a JTree, saves it, deletes the top of the subtree, and finally confirms that all of the subnodes below are removed as well.''"
