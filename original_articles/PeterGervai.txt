That's me.

Okay, I'm a network engineer, programmer, maybe writer or simply a BOFH. 

You can see me on dmoz.org for example in the HungaryEurope categories ( http://dmoz.org/World/Magyar/ ).

You should 'avoid' my webpage at http://grin.hu/ and it's mostly in Hungarian anyway.

My email is probably grin (a) grin (one dot) hu and apart from the funny kind of writing I have pretty powerful spam filters and automagic open relay reporting tools. *wink*

And, if you hadn't figured yet, yes I'm Hungarian.
