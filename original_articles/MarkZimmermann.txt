I'm learning to Wiki: see http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki for an ongoing experiment ''(the '''ZhurnalWiki''')''; see http://www.his.com/~z/ for more than any sensible person would want to know about me; and see http://zhurnaly.com/ for my online journals, aka  the '' '''^zhurnal''' '', of miscellaneous musings ''(a static version of the '''ZhurnalWiki''')''. 

I live in the Washington DC area, and am interested in far too many things: math, computer science, art, literature, history, philosophy, humor, classical liberalism/libertarianism, homeschooling, libraries, juggling, marathon and ultramarathon running, mind, LifeAndWorkPlanningBooks, WikiJournaling, etc. ''(and I admit to knowing JoelShprentz and JudyDecker)'' ...
