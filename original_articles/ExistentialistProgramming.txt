* Programmers have free will. 
* Programming is a series of choices, creating stress. 
* Few decisions are without any negative consequences. 
* Some things are irrational or absurd, without explanation. 
* If one makes a decision, they must follow through.

Your programming is yours and yours alone.  You have the freedom to code, and with that comes responsibility for what you type.  You may try to escape from this anxiety by ignoring or denying that freedom and responsibility. But this amounts to ignoring or denying the actual situation, and you will succeed only in deceiving yourself.  You must become fully aware of the true character of the life of a programmer and bravely accept it.

Caudo ergo sum.
