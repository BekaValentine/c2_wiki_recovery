When programming a computer, concerns eventually emerge about how efficiently the hardware and software assets are utilized in the execution of the program. It is through Optimization that such efficiencies are realized.

'''Compiler Optimization'''
* http://www.compileroptimizations.com/
* The process of tuning the output of a compiler to minimize some attribute (or maximize the efficiency) of an executable program.
** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_optimization
'''Optimization Themes'''
* Compiler optimization techniques have a number of themes which can be employed

'''Loop Optimizations'''
* Most execution time of a scientific program is spent on loops. Thus a lot of compiler analysis and optimization techniques have been developed to make the execution of loops faster.
