BeanCounters count beans.  Their tools to search for information have to produce results that balance to the penny.  That requires databases and query tools.

Geeks just use '''grep''' on tables and ignore the NonBeans that their search returns.  Totals and BottomLine''''''s are less important to them. SeekInformation needs its own page.
