* Left handed screwdriver
* Elbow grease
* Striped paint
* propwash/jetwash
* stud stretcher
* dough patches (pizza shop, until someone was unexpectedly successful)
* bottle of Grid-Leak Bias (tube electronics)
* Headlight fluid
* Muffler bearings
* (heard second hand) buckets of Technicolor to repair film
