'' Hello, Bobby - are you letting the people concerned (AnujChaudhri, GagarineYaikhom, and KakaKoktang) know about their pages you've created?''

Yeah, of course I have informed them. - BobbyMaisnam 02/07/2003

Wiki is great!

Whoever helped me there to "delete" the KakaKoktang page, thanks a lot. By the way, Greg, in case you read this, according to Wiki conventions, one person should only have one username. So, I have deleted the KakaKoktang page.
