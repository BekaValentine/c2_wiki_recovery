I have extensive consulting, writing, and development experience in Java Web-based applications. I have worked with several J2EE enterprise applications for different industries. Some of my research interest areas are Software Architecture, Patterns and Pattern Languages, Software Process Management. 

I'm the author of Pattern Language for Data Driven Presentation Layer for Dynamic and Configurable Web Systems. This pattern language was workshopped in PLoP'04 conference. You can read this paper at http://hillside.net/plop/2004/papers/sacharya0/PLoP2004_sacharya0_0.pdf

If you have any questions about the patterns discussed there or any general questions in J2EE based Web systems, send an email to <<s.acharya@computer.org.>>
