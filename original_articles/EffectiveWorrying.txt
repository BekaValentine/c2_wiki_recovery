If you are going to worry about things, first read each of the following:

Then examine whether or not there is anything you can do about the situation to correct or improve it. If you can, and it is in the realm of your responsibility, then do it. If it belongs to someone else, you have two choices: alert the person about it, with the expectation that they will do what is required, or, don't let them know. The latter solution will leave you in the state of worry, but you will at least have considered correcting the situation.

EffectiveWorrying is that brand of worry that motivates correction. It is worry that removes the cause of worry.
