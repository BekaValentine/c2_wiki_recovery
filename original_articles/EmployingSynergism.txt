It has been said by some that the most important thing about success can be summed up in three words; "Location, location and location". What is inherent in this statement is that of EmployingSynergism.  What is it that makes location so important to success? It is that in addition to all of the efforts, plans, products and pricing that an enterprise may employ, that "placement" is perhaps the most critical of all the operational decisions that can be made. 

Location of an enterprise is a decision which can be enhanced by the effects of synergy. Synergism can be thought of a a sort of "magnet". In this way many successful businesses will locate their physical plants at a places where differing but complementary enterprises exist or are planned to exist. Such strategies are used in the planning of such things as Office Parks, Shopping Centers, Banks, Hotels, Restaurants, and Convention Centers, all of which when physically adjacent or proximate, exert beneficial effects on each other. This is true even when some so located are competitors. 

Synergism exists, not because of "luck" so much as it is by advance "planning". Observing and inspecting trends and directions of deployment of populations, commercial and private buildings and city, county and state provisions and restrictions of zoning and land usage can not be overemphasized as important consideration in establishing a "location". There is even a discipline called Demography which studies, categorizes and enters the results into a decision-making process.
