'''Tips and Instructions for Using Categories'''

Categories are a way for wiki to group and find related topics. Categories assigned to topics are usually listed at the bottom of many wiki topics. To find other topics in a given category, click on the topic name above. This should take you to a category page.

Some category pages list suggested topics in an outline format. However, all topics allow one to click on the topic name (big blue or purple words at top) to trigger a search of all topics containing that category. Note that it may take a day or two for the wiki engine to index new topics or newly-labelled topics. See CategoryCategory for listings of categories and sources of further category information.
