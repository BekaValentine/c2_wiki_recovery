In programming parlance this is the poor developer that has to come behind the CowboyCoder and clean up the CowboyCode, while surrounded by screaming management/marketing and other sundry hostiles.

This can either lead to the cavalry riding in to save the day, or conversely a ''Custer's Last Stand''.

In some respects the AnonymousCavalryman can be a CowboyCoder in his own right - with the added ability to quickly grok the CowboyCoder's source, and patch the gaping holes in it.
