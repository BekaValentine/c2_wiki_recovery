Colloquial English phrase for a choice that is not a choice - either there is only one option, or two options that are equally undesirable or virtually identical...

''Is this the same thing as a CatchTwentyTwo?''
No.  CatchTwentyTwo is when both (or all) choices are contradictory.  You have to be crazy to want to fly a mission, so you're grounded.  But if you are scared, you're sane, so you are required to fly.

Tobias Hobson (c. 1544-1631) was a Cambridge stable manager who let (rented) horses. He insisted customers take the horse in the stall closest to the door (the next one up) or take none at all. Hence, a Hobson's choice is no choice at all. He was made famous by Milton. The phrase dates to 1660.
