I have seen much criticism on SoftwareEngineering recently (MayZeroFive), which I want to group here:

* IsThereEverGoingToBeSufficientEconomicIncentiveToDoSoftwareRight
* ProgrammersAreNotProfessionals
* IfSmalltalkIsSoGoodWhyDoesNobodyUseIt
* HowToProfessionalizeProgramming
* and more

I have seen much BullShit with false pretension of criticism in MayZeroFive; do you want to consolidate it for posterity? -- CostinCozianu

What do you expect? Letting it lie as unrefactored ThreadMess and clutter the WikiSpace? I'd rather document what is there and belongs together as long as that it clear. -- GunnarZarncke

Well, you could refactor something else instead or you could contribute some real content, but of course, it's your privilege to decide how you choose to waste your time. -- Costin

Doing some less liked cleanup work for the WikiCommunity is part of the professional responsibility of a WikiZen, don't you think? But of course, it's your privilege to let some corners of this wiki become a WikiSlum, where WikiTroll''''''s live in a ThreadMess. -- .gz

* Costin - highlighting things like this and drawing them together for comparison is an important part of recognising the wheat from the chaff and starting the editing and refactoring process. Please StopHarassingTheGnomes, the time is not wasted.
