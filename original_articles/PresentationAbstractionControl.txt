From PoSa:

''The PresentationAbstractionControl architectural pattern (PAC) defines a structure for interactive software systems in the form of a hierarchy of cooperating agents. 

Every agent is responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality and consists of three components: presentation, abstraction, and control. 

This subdivision separates the human-computer interaction of the agent from its functional core and its communication with other agents.''
