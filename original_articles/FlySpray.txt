Flyspray is a web-based bug tracking tool. See http://flyspray.rocks.cc/. Prettier than Mantis; much easier to install and configure than Bugzilla (but less capable).

It's implemented in PHP. It uses a database backend via ADODB (MySQL, PostgreSQL). Flyspray is licensed under LGPL 2.1. Other co-requisite packages are licensed under various free (as in freedom) open source licenses. Current (1-May-2005) release is 0.97.

It has features for:
* users, permissions for users by activity, by project.
* projects have users and project permisssions (OR'd with user's base permissions), description, visibility, others.
* reports have attributes: project, title, description, reported by, comments, categories (think component), status, comments, attachments, reported against some level, ... 
* close codes, affected OS, ... a number of other attributes of reports are configurable.

Stable in use on Win2K with XAMPP. Target environment is Linux.

Just installed it here, as part of package selection. My initial impression is that it is more than good enough for my needs. I'm a one-man-shop developing web applications. In truth, Flyspray is a bit rich for my needs, but I'll just not use some of the features. The feature set looks rich enough to support many projects with at least a hundred users. More?
