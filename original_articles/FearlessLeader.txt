In my experience, for the most part Managers don't attract anyone.  Effective workers attract Managers, but that is a different thing...

I DisagreeWithTheseGeneralisms. I've had managers that have really enabled me as an architect... that haved buffered me from much of the politics that could have distracted me from my purpose. When I am working in the role of an architect, I really value a great Development Manager!! In my opinion, a good Development Manager is just as important and valuable as a GoodArchitect and a Good Team. Each requires the other. I have had Development Managers that had little to do with our architectures but still had a huge impact by challenging me to look at new technology, enable me to throw away the diskpacks, and protected as well as sold our vision to the rest of the company. I really owe many of my successes to managers like these. --RobertDiFalco

''Your vision for the GoodArchitect is made a lot more convincing for me by this appreciation of the GoodManager. In writing such things you seem oblivious of some old taboos on Wiki. Hopefully some other people will now become oblivious of them too. -- RichardDrake''

You put explosive landmines in a football field?! Boris, that is a rotten thing to do.

I just knew you would approve, Fearless Leader.

I'm on my way up, Boris, and I'm taking you with me!
