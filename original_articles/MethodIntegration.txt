This seems like more of a straight RemoteProcedureCall or DistributedObjectProtocol system than an actual way of integrating different systems.  What do you do when you want to pass actual data from one system to the next?  What do you do when you have a system which doesn't work within a NetworkCentric design?

Questions like these is why you end up with InterfaceEngines.
