Can I be an ExtremeProgrammer without being part of an ExtremeProgramming team?

''Who would you do your PairProgramming with?''

Perhaps no one, but consider ExtremeProgrammingForOne. 

If you must use a plural form, be sure not to use a word ending in "s", instead of PairProgrammer''''''s, you might use something like: P''''''airProgrammingConsist, or P''''''airProgrammingTeam. If you have more than one team, you might use P''''''airProgrammingTeamGrouping.  I personally prefer the more direct and simpler PairProgrammer''''''s.
