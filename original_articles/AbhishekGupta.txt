''Welcome, Abhishek!  You've come to the right place then!  I've been told that loosely translated, Abhishek means "coronation", or "the coronated king".  Is this true?  Again, welcome.'' -- CarlosNsRodrigues

Thank you Carlos. Yes indeed it means "the coronation of the king". I wonder if you had to do a lot of searching to find that out! Thanks again. -- AbhishekGupta
