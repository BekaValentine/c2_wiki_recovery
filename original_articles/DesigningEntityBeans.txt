''Bean-Managed Persistence''

A BMP entity bean should delegate all its real work to a data access object -- an object that performs all the necessary JDBC calls. The BMP entity bean retrieves its primary key from the EjbContext and passes it to the DataAccessObject as a parameter.

''Container-Managed Persistence''

No design required; just good names.
