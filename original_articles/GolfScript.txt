An esoteric language designed to win at language-agnostic CodeGolf. It's a stack language with 44 built-in operators, some overloaded. "Blocks" provide both control structures and re-use as in FalseLanguage and DeeCee. Some parts of the language are very golf specific ("when your script is executed, all input from stdin is read first and placed as a string onto the stack").
