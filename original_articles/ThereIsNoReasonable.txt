We often hear censors tell us that they will only prevent us from seeing "what would offend a reasonable person" or, worse because it's sexist, "what would offend a reasonable woman", or, worst, because it assumes all human intercourse must be acceptable to children, "what it is reasonable for a child to read".

Well, ThereIsNoReasonable. There's just signal and noise. The time-tested tried-and-true MakeSignalNotNoise is the only true guide to what is OnTopic vs what is OffTopic on wiki. TheCostinWay and its inevitable ancillae are trying to tell us that pages like RulesOfGeelf or MoviesToConsider should be deleted, but any page on MicrosoftsTenYearOldBuzzword is sacred and must stay. I don't think that's reasonable and you do? Then ThereIsNoReasonable. There is only tolerance for views that differ from your own.

TolerateOffTopic because ThereIsNoReasonable and, except for noise instead of signal, there is no OffTopic either. --PeterMerel

''What percent of wiki's problems would you say are related to off-topic content verus on-topic but disputed?''

* It's not a matter of problems due to OffTopic, it's a matter of an opportunity to exercise WikiPower.  You may have noticed, even totally OnTopic pages have fallen victim to WikiPower.  People wait like vultures, waiting for the slightest excuse to pounce with either criticism or the almighty delete.  It can be quite comical if viewed from the correct perspective.  Better that there be plenty of OffTopic to draw the WikiPower abuser's wrath, instead of them pouncing on the OnTopic things as well.  There can not be peace, because of the way that Wiki gives power to all, to either use with wisdom or to abuse at will.

''What's the distinction between reasonable and time-tested tried-and-true? Is it true ThereIsNoReasonable way to distinguish signal from noise? -- MarkTilley''

Oh, that's easy. DocumentMode, or stuff that is ReFactorable to DocumentMode (non-empty EigenPage''''''s), is signal. The rest is noise. -- Pete

''That sounds reasonable to me ...''

Okay, so ThereIsaReasonable ...

''Now Peter, I would appreciate if you put the effort to represent my position with the minimal degree of accuracy. I never claimed nor implied that either RulesOfGeelf or MoviesToConsider should be deleted. And I believe that even you can make the elementary distinction between MoviesToConsider and S''''''omeTrollNextPersonalSlander. -- Costin''

Even I certainly can. If the troll's slanders were signal, I'd welcome them. His stuff isn't necessarily OffTopic - much of it is at least WikiOnWiki - but just noise. At least, to me. Then again no one has ever called me reasonable ...
