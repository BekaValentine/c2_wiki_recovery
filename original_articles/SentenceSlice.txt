''Like cutting a slice of bread from a loaf, Except the loaf is still whole. (a copy segment) -'' DoingStuff.DonaldNoyes.20141218
----
It is a sentence taken from the larger content of a collaboration document or other completed sentence containing artifact by making a copy of a sentence within the document and then using it (some might call this transclusion), perhaps to make a sandwich - not to make another loaf) 

It is a fair way of using a part of someone's work. SentenceSlice''''''s should '''always''' include a way to identify the source and if in a publicly reachable hyper-document, provide a hyperlink to its URL.
