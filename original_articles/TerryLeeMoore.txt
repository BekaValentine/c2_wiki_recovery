HI, I'm Terry.  I've just found Wiki & wonder how I could have missed it all these years.
I am a senior UNIX systems administrator in Boulder, CO. What else would you like to know?

Hi Terry. I just tried your email address. It bounced. Where are you now? Heather at heatherlovatt@yahoo.ca (Sorry, I'm new. I'll figure this out.)
