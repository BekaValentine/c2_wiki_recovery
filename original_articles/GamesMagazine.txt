This magazine is a step above the regular pencil puzzle magazines. Their rich use of color and innovative, unique puzzles and games make this the highest quality puzzle magazine on the market. They also review board games and international games, and even electronic games.

Solving pencil puzzles and logic problems are like musical studies. They keep you sharp and your brain functioning. This magazine is definitely worth its weight in gold in that respect.

I've found it to be not exactly the same "serious" sort of puzzling as MartinGardner, but it still exercises the brain.  There's a mix of hard puzzles with "LateralThinking" zingers, and you aren't always told which is which.

Often includes visual puzzles by ScottKim.
