LiterateProgramming and the SemanticWeb are ideas from different times, which do have a connection.

Some people have been working in this area for some time, for example:

* Literate Programming in XML (Norman Walsh)
** http://nwalsh.com/docs/articles/xml2002/lp/paper.html
** http://nwalsh.com/docs/articles/xml2002/paper.pdf
* Three Layer Approach (http://www.isrl.illinois.edu/~kmreiss/projects/xmldoc/poster/poster.pdf)

It appears to me that with tools emerging for the SemanticWeb (e.g. CubicWeb) that progress can be made in this area. I didn't get on as well as I expected with CubicWeb as it seemed to lack flexibility and also capacity for input and export of the information. I am now exploring NepomukKde which is an implementation of the SemanticDesktop. -- JohnFletcher
