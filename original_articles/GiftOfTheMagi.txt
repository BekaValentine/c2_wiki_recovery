A poor couple is desperately in love, and each spouse wants to buy the other one special gift for Christmas.  The wife prizes her long, silky hair, while the husband prizes his expensive pocketwatch.  The wife cuts her hair and sells it, using the money to buy her husband a beautiful gold chain for his pocketwatch.  Meanwhile, the husband sells his beloved pocketwatch and uses the money to buy his wife a beautiful comb for her long tresses of hair. The story finishes:

	 :	"But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi."
