'''Questions on Culture, Integrity and Trust within an organization '''

From Jill Geisler article at http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=34&aid=39203, which, while aimed for media, has application to lots of other firms.
	1. What do we stand for as an organization?
	2. What does a staff person need to do to succeed?
	3. What does a manager need to do to succeed?
	4. Are all employees held to the same standards of professional performance? If not, what standards are differentially applied?
	5. How solid are our systems of verification on stories?
	6. What ethical guidelines do we have here? Written? Understood?
	7. How welcome are people to question our guidelines in cases where they can envision journalistically sound alternatives?
	8. How clearly do staffers understand their obligation to avoid conflicts of interest, including the areas of gifts, outside employment, or political activity?
	9. How much peer pressure, if any, exists among staff against "blowing the whistle" on a colleague?
	10. How comfortable do staffers feel bringing bad news to their managers? Why?
	11. How responsive is our organization to outside complaints?
	12. What, if anything, is needed to build stronger trust between staff and managers here?
