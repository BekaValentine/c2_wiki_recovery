A database implemented in 20,000 lines of code that does the work of several major products, (distributed/replicated/nested transactions/flexible views based on logic variables) Mnesia is a part of the open source ErlangLanguage system.

It is free and proven in industrial (e.g. telecommunications) settings.  The framework containing Erlang and Mnesia is the Open Telecommunications Platform.

The Mnesia user's manual is at:

Also there is a short (15 page)  overview of Mnesia that's worth a read.

This is a cracking little-big database system. I am very impressed with what I have seen so far. It is a distributed database with built-in replication support. I normally need three or four heavyweight products to do all this stuff. One very special thing it does is allow transactions to be wrapped up as a functor and passed to the database. Since transactions are completely specified they cannot hang; the system just retries till any lock problems are solved. A lovely thing that I wish I could use for my work. Erlang though. Tricky sell to a client :). --RichardHenderson.

After a brief look, I am unable to figure out what kind of database this is (hierarchical, network, relational, etc.) It seems similar to LightweightDirectoryAccessProtocol.
