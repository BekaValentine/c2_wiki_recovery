Probably the type of music done with a chorus of people. Maybe the most usual type is the 4 mixed voices (soprano, contralto, tenor and bass, 2 of women and 2 of men) but may have the full spectrum (mezzos, baritones, &c...).

Music is usually 'a capella' (ie. without any instruments, but with the voice) or maybe some organ, piano...

Pretty nice and relaxing, certainly... -- DavidDeLis

In my idiolect it doesn't need to be so light on accompaniment. For instance, GustavMahler's 8th symphony wants an orchestra of 250 players or thereabouts, but it's still ChoralMusic because it makes a lot of use of a chorus.

ChoralMusic with more than 4 parts usually has more than one instance of each of the usual parts, rather than having separate parts for mezzo-sopranos or baritones or whatever. --GarethMcCaughan
The CanonicalExample is Tallis's SpemInAllium, which uses forty separate voices, each of one or two singers.

The choirs I sing with (e.g. http://biv2000.aicsa.org.au/) seem to have an unsually high number of computer people.  Some people  think this is because ChoralMusic in some way complements the parts of the brain exercised in technical work. -- MartinPool
