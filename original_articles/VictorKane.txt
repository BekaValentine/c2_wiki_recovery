I am a 51 year old software engineer here in BuenosAires, Argentina. I've been working the last three years in C++ on Unix and Windows NT platforms in the field of ComputerTelephonyIntegration.

I have now forced myself to take a four-month sabbatical in order to "really" do modern SoftwareEngineering (with capital letters this time).
