A true leader is one "equal" that is followed because he has a vision that is shared with the others "equals". The followers may depart from the leader at any moment, there is no penalty, since the leader does not own anything. The followers accept their leader by their own will since they him useful.

Contrast this with FormalLeaders, who are appointed by a manager. Actually FormalLeaders are managers themselves.
