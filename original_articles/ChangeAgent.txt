A ChangeAgent is someone who is irritating enough to cause an organization to change, but not so irritating that s/he gets thrown out.

After the good joke, we must understand that a ChangeAgent is:
* A pattern for a manager to use to implement change.
* A recommended form of behavior from many consultants to improve your career.
* A consulting specialization.
* Hype.
