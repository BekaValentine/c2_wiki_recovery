Software you acquire at no cost (ie FreeAsInBeer).  Not necessarily the same as LibreSoftware (FreeSoftware). GratisSoftware derives its name from the Swedish word "gratis", meaning free (as in complimentary), differentiating itself from the Spanish word "libre", meaning free as in liberty (or maybe FreeAsInSpeech).
