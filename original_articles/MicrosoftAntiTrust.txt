The Microsoft Anti-Trust case is still ongoing, it has proven MicroSoft enjoys TrustStatus according to the ShermanAntiTrustAct.

The MainArgument of the case is that MicrosoftInternetExplorer is the most popular browser because it was BunDled (UgLy CamelCase!) with MicrosoftWindows which happens to be the most popular OperatingSystem out there. BillGates claimed that DeIntegrating MicrosoftInternetExplorer and MicrosoftWindows would be impossible and increase support costs. Famously, this claim was rebutted by Fetser's 98Lite where he demonstrated MicrosoftWindows 98 running without any IE at all. The court ruled that OS and InternetBrowser were separate. They also ruled that MicroSoft intentionally bundled OperatingSystem and browser in order to compete with NetScape. (More Stupid UgLy CamelCase - find actual page name.)

The act of using a monopoly to wipe out competitors is called being NetScaped.
