Many PocketPc owners feel cheated, as the ROM version of Reader does not support the protection level now included in current e-book titles. Others of us found the ClearType technology no big whoop (does it really support only that one type face - the sans-serif?) and finds the PocketPc implementation slower and clunkier than it should have been. (In fairness, I have yet to find an acceptable alternative reader for my Jornada.) -- JimRussell

Sam - are you using the desktop version?
