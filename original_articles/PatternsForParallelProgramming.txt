This seems to me to be a very useful book summarising much of the information needed to get going with ParallelProgramming. It helps to explain the different choices of ParallelProgrammingModel and when to use them. It covers both MessagePassingInterface (MPI) and OpenMultiProcessing (OpenMP) models. -- JohnFletcher
