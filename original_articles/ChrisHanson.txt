I've been developing Macintosh software for 12 years now, and I've been working with the CocoaFramework and its ancestors (OpenStep) for 5 years. I have a weblog at http://www.livejournal.com/users/chanson/, with an RSS feed at http://www.livejournal.com/users/chanson/rss.

My personal web site is at http://www.dementia.org/~cmh/. My company, bDistributed.com (http://bDistributed.com/), develops custom web and desktop applications using the CocoaFramework and WebObjects. It's located in the Chicago area.
