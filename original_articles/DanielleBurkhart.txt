Describe DanielleBurkhart here.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am Danielle Burkhart. I want to learn the ancient art of Wiki-Wiki to connect with people who have similar interests and career goals as myself.

Hi Danielle! Welcome to WikiWiki. I hope you enjoy your stay! -- SusanRoy

Yea 10 years is not ancient, but Wiki sounds like an ancient word. A belated thank you for the warm welcome -- Danielle

A friend found this page and couldn't believe it was really me. It is but I'm now not Burkhart. -- Danielle

* If that's a cause for congratulations - which I suspect it is - then congratulations.  Do you want to rename/move your page to reflect the change?
