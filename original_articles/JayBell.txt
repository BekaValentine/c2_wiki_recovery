A software engineer from the United Kingdom.

No scratch that, I'm JustaProgrammer, with a hint of JustaStudent. Maybe after a few ales I become a software engineer.

I make video games at a company called Attention To Detail - http://www.atd.co.uk ( BrokenLink )

You can reach me at jay.bell AT atd DOT co DOT uk

I recently installed a Wiki for use on our company intranet, and very gradually people are beginning to use it. I used TWikiClone, largely because of its bells and whistles feature set. ''Not'' the easiest thing in the world to set up though...
