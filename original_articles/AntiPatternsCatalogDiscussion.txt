'''Comments and discussion page for the AntiPatternsCatalog'''

----

Categorical Listing from the AntiPatternsBook. These are definitive, according to the reference, please don't change. 

''Does this mean don't add new AntiPattern''''''s to this list, or just don't alter/change the categories as listed?''

* I think the goal was to keep this in synch with the AntiPatternsBook, but that seems silly. Let's just keep growing - that's what the Wiki is for?

A couple of anti-patterns are mentioned in the following online article regarding Javascript of all things. Of particular interest might be: "AllWebDevelopmentIsNewDevelopment". There is also a link from the article to a listing of Riel's OO Heuristics; see http://www.devpapers.com/article/259/

'''Deduplication of listings and cleanup'''

* I did some cleanup in the ManagementAntiPattern area and category (CategoryManagementAntiPattern). Try to deduplicate ManagementAntiPattern''''''s and to sort them by type with an appropriate RoadMap page (ManagementAntiPatternRoadMap). I will try to catch the orphan pages also when I find them. 
* Did the same for DevelopmentAntiPattern''''''s and associated categories and RoadMap.
* I removed NationalIsm from the AntiPatternsCatalog. Obviouly, even if it is a BadThing, it is difficult to consider it as an AntiPattern.
* I created backward links between categories and RoadMaps index.
