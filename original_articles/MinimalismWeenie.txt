A minimalism weenie trims way too many features from the software, system, or application.

A MinimalismWeenie counteracts a FeatureWeenie.
* Not necessarily.  There's a breed of FeatureWeenie that wants the exact minimum set of orthogonal features such that any feature one wishes to implement atop them is possible, especially in framework and language design.  These would be the AsSimpleAsPossibleButNoSimplerWeenie''''''s, or perhaps UnifiedModelOfEverythingWeenie''''''s - minimalist and maximalist at the same time, the true beauty of simplicity without simplisticity. 
** As with HighLevelLowLevelLanguage, this might be a compromise, or MinMaximalism
