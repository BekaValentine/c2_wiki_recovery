To insert an image into a page, do so as you would insert an ordinary link, as described in MoreAboutEditingLinks. This means that your image must be located at an external server.

The 290 K image on this page should serve as an example of why you should pause before blindly inserting images onto wiki. It is generally considered bad form to direct link an image, so you might want to ask permission. The image might also be under a restrictive copyright licence, so exercise care.

One might encounter a broken image EVEN if the image does in fact exist on the external server if the external server's admin has blocked the ability to hotlink images.

Note that the blocking depends on the http-referrer - how else should a site know that a request came from an 'illegatimate' source.
* See http://altlab.com/htaccess_tutorial.html for how this works.
* See http://www.firefox-browser.de/wiki/Referer for how to change your referrer settings.

On resizing and recommeded size: Message and response DonaldNoyes.MartySchrader.20100524

''Hey, Donald? I hope you can forgive me for resizing and replacing the Wiki page growth chart on TheWikiPlateau. The image was just too huge, y'know? -- MartySchrader ''

Thanks, I knew this but hadn't done it yet. Looks like 800px wide is about right. I'll try to make sure in the future that any pics or graphics are about this size.

'''Size Inflation'''

The size of the average web image seems to be creeping up such that a wiki re-sizing technique is becoming more of a need. It's growing hard to find an adequate size.

I believe the average size is creeping up because of three factors: 

* Wider monitors
* Bandwidth is getting cheaper/faster such that there is less pressure to keep native images small (letting HTML/CSS attributes resize it on the browser)
* Browsers are gradually getting better at interpolating such that browser-side resizing is less likely to produce blocky "pixelating". (I kept an eye on this because of a complaint at my work.)
