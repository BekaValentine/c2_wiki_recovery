InformationAndCommunicationTechnology (ICT) refer to the symbiotic existence of Information technolgy and communication technology.

As suggested by the PttAuthorities, in the beginning there were only telegraph and telephone (before computing machines that were implemented during second world war).

At the dawn of the ICT revolution in the early 70s, BigIron machines and analog based communications were separate concerns. Now the distinction between the two worlds are sometimes blurred.

Although great economic success of SupplyChainManagement has been made possible by ICT advancements (notable achievements include G''''''lobalBook processes of the financial institutions decades ago), ICT without the CommunityTechnology element has often resulted in the DisruptiveTechnology syndrome.
