A simple implementable scheme for the use of interwiki links at the page level:

Each wiki creates a 2 to 16 character unique word to be used for reference to its wiki:
* Wards Wiki could be either c2 or WardsWiki
* Meatball Wiki could be mb or MeatBall 
The choice as to whether a site would participate in the InterWiki, could be very simply a result of having a R''''''eadOnlyPage called InterWikiSite. 

Within this page would be at least 4 R''''''eadOnly components:
* A shorthand 2 to 4 character InterWikiPrefix:
** c2
* A longer InterWiki Name: 
** WardsWiki
* A link to a R''''''eadOnlyPage called InterWikiPages, which would contain the names of all pages which an InterWiki Site Administrator has made available for insertion into the InterWiki. 
** This might be all pages or just a selected number of the pages
* An InterWikiLogo created in a standard size gif 76 by 76 pixels, or as Specified in a InterWikiStandard 
** this could then be used within menus or pages.

'''Modification Required'''

The modifications that might have to be made to the participating wiki's Server would be relatively simple:

'''Decisions:'''
* Each wiki would make a choice as to what wikis it would link to, 
** capture from the chose wikis: 
*** InterWikiLogo, 
*** InterWikiPrefix and 
*** InterWikiPageList 
'''Processes:'''
* Process the InterWikiPageList in such a way as to present their existence to users of its wiki, 
** either inpage at the link level using the WikiWord, 
** or at the page level in a footer menu -- similar to the way Ward shows the SisterSites
'''Presentations:'''
The method used to display and link to the InterWiki would be something like the following:
* Example Page - FrontPage - here showing two representative wikis: 
** c2:FrontPage
** mb:FrontPage
'''Other possible presentations:'''
* Reference to multiple links:
** InterWiki:FrontPage (where a menu of the multiple link choices would be displayed)
* The wiki could include some sort of lookup of selected links:
** Clicking on the Interwiki:FrontPage link could execute the search and present the results.
