"Networking" has been given a bad name by the sort
of idiot who hands out a business card to his dentist,
her obstetrician, their seatmate on the rollercoaster...
"Oh, I'm networking," the idiot says, when explaining
its appalling behavior.

In fact, true NetWorks are an essential part of creating excellent software teams.  True NetWorks contain  people who share your recognition of the QualityWithoutaName.  You may not like everybody in your network, but you admire their work, and they respect yours.

Every project I work on contains one or two people whom I admire, and who serve as personal catalysts: when I work with them, I'm faster, smarter, and better-informed. I  enjoy working with such people. When spaces open up on my
next team, I recommend former co-workers, not because
they may someday do me a reciprocal favor, but because
they will be doing me an immediate favor by joining my new team.

Over the years, I have pulled friends into jobs, and they
me, 'not' for the sake of good lunchtime gossip, but because
I trust them to do good work.  Excellent co-workers raise the bar: they force me to be excellent in order to keep up. 

NetWorks are invaluable for StayingCurrent; when I need
information outside my specialty, or an opinion on an article I haven't read, I ask a member of my
network.  Again, this is not logrolling; it is delegation. Hello.
