'' Q: How do I utilize one of your suggested add-in Ant tasks with CC? Do I need to plugin this alternate PVCS checkout task for my normal modificationset.

I'm using PVCS (pcli) from a WinXP box, connecting with some username required to a network mounted drive y:/pvcs ''

A: Referring to my notice (Michael Parker): 
In my case, I added /cruisecontrol/src/org/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/optional/pvcs the classes simply to the local source of cc, because I need to make some additions. It would also be possible to make pvcs-contrib.jar and add it to the cruisecontrol/lib directory.

This classes are used to handle the checkout/getting of the archived files with modifications.

To detect the modifications cruisecontrol uses his own net.sourceforge.cruisecontrol.sourcecontrols.PVCS.java which uses the pvcs command line interface (pcli.exe) due to your pvcs-tag in the config.xml.

To check for modifications pcli first needs to create a temporary file (files.tmp) of all versioned archives stored in yourConcreteProject.
After that it uses a temporary command-file called CruiseControlPVCS.pcli to execute the check.
Here your information is used provided by the PVCS-tag in the config.xml of cruisecontrol.
 
example-content of CruiseControlPVCS.pcli:
''
   set -vProject "-prW:\PVCS\pvcsdata.neu\databases\yourDatabase"
   set -vSubProject "/projects/yourConcreteProject"
   run -e vlog "-xo+evlog.txt" "-d12.Oct.2004,12:00:00*12.Oct.2004,12:49:07" "@files.tmp"
''
 
   inDateFormat is used in the third line.
   outDateFormat refers to the Dateformat used in the files.tmp.
