Stanford had a seminar honoring the man who revolutionized our
view of computers, and discussing the part of his vision that
is yet to be realized.  They have a set of very interesting
videos with all kinds of leading people in the computer field
at http://scpd.stanford.edu/engelbart_colloquium (previously http://stanford-online.stanford.edu/engelbart/)

introduced by Michael A. Keller -- Stanford Libraries.
