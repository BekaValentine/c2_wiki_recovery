Hi Juys. I'm Ed. I'm trying to build a wiki over at Tripod. You can check it out at http://cgi-wiki.tripod.com/cgi-bin/wiki/wiki.cgi?Index.

So... is this where you discuss this?  Anywas, do you guys have a chat channel?  Like, maybe one on http://freenode.net?  -- EdSmilde

Hi Ed - there is a #wiki channel on irc.freenode.net, but it's for wiki topics in general, not just this site. That said, some WardsWiki regulars can be found there. -- EarleMartin

Awesome.  Wow, this took me a long time to respond to...   EdSmilde
