An early (mid-80's) bit-mapped animation package for the Macintosh.

JayFenton wrote an animation & music thing for the mac but it didn't fit. He split it into two products. The animation part became the foundation for
his company, MacroMind, but the music part was cool too.

Well things have moved on a bit from here. The software referred to above was named Videoworks, if memory serves me correctly. Macromind is the company that created Director, which is a real stalwart of the multimedia industry. 

MacroMind later merged with ParacompInc, to become MacroMind-Paracomp, then with Authorware to become MacromediaInc
