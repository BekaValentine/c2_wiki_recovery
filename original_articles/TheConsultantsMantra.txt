When you are tearing your remaining hair out because some particularly dense client won't listen, or throws incompetence or bullshit at you, remember this maxim:

'''"It's okay -- we bill by the hour."'''

That should save you a lot of grief.

''Ours was, "It all pays the same." Just say it over and over.''
