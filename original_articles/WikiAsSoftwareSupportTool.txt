Wikis seems well-suited to replacing certain newsgroups that primarily enable inexperienced software users or developers to find answers to their questions.  I see the following benefits:

	* You can edit out wrong answers
	* Connecting related threads will be a little more seamless
	* The ability to look up a topic or phrase and getting a page list with matches
	* The advantage being in the "Wiki Now" with hyperlinked external related material available with a click  
	* You can adapt the script (or scripts, depending on what clone you start with) to do all manner of neat things. AutoTracker is one example.
	* There is no obstacle to contributing (like logins, etc.), so everyone is both a reader and a potential contributor, and are likely to do so

I'm finding it difficult to get people to use wiki. It's just different enough to put them off :-(

''I've found it hard to get people to start using a sparsely populated wiki. Unless some people get immediate value, they won't come back. If you can start with a small number of people who "get it," work with them to populate the wiki, and then bring others in. If people see immediate value, getting them to the next step--where they see the value of actively participating--is a lot easier. --  DaveSmith''

For some strategies to deal with this problem, see WhyDontOthersGetWiki and PromotingWiki.

''Also see CoreContributorFoundation''.  After the initial work has been put in, then it becomes self-sustaining, especially if you allow WikiHomePage''''''s.  People will identify more with Wiki because a small part of it is "theirs".  My $0.02.  I fully agree with the above-mentioned advantages of Wiki.'' -- CarlosNsRodrigues
