The relation between Inflation vs Unemployment is known as the Philips Curve and was based on a statistical anomaly that showed the data when plotted produced a nice curve. Ever since it was noticed it has been used to describe the system and is often found to be wrong in that Inflation and Unemployment can both increase or decrease at the same time. There are too many other variables for this simplistic formula to work. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve
