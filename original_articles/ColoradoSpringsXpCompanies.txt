'''Further Guidance'''

Practices are a great thing to share and MichaelFinney loves to see them. However, the question of whether a company is XP or not based on what practices are done has been raised. 

http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/NotXP.htm by Chet Hendrickson suggests that the best way to decide whether or not a project is an XpProject is by looking to see how the project supports the values of communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage. With all due respect to Chet, MichaelFinney would agree except that values are too vague to use as a measuring device. That is why KentBeck introduced the XP principles to help. See http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PrinciplesOfXP.html

''Is Colorado Springs big enough to merit its own page of XpCompanies?  Maybe this page should be merged into the Denver XP page.' -- ChrisBaugh''

''Yes, it deserves its own page.'' -- MichaelFinney

Is the CassattCorporation still doing XP?

Cassatt is doing TDD still (Dec 2005). Who knows about the other practices?
