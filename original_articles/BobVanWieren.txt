I am Bob Van Wieren, Director of Support Services for ChristianSchoolsInternational in Grand Rapids, MI. We serve 500 schools throughout North America and the world. You can find us at http://www.csionline.org. We are interested in collaboration tools to link schools throughout the world. So I am experimenting with this site.
