Webl, a.k.a the ''Compaq WebLanguage'', is a scripting language for programming web applications. It's a small prototype-based language with some support for modules.

It has a very nice ''markup algebra'' for manipulating and navigating around structured text, and ''service combinators'' to manage communicating with unreliable remote sites.

This implementation runs on a JavaVirtualMachine and can call out into Java libraries.

''Perhaps this page should be renamed CompaqWebLanguage. "Web language" is generally something like PHP, ColdFusion, etc.''
