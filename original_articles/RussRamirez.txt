Russ Ramirez [mailto:ramirez@vnet.ibm.com] currently works in the AS/400 division of IBM at Rochester, MN. He has been ''consciously'' building OO frameworks using patterns and idioms since May '94.  Some of Russ's favorite books in the OO category are (in no particular order):

	* DesignPatterns
	* Advanced C++ [http://www.research.att.com:80/orgs/ssr/people/cope/AdvancedC++/index.html, BrokenLink on 2007-04-27]
	* A TimelessWayOfBuilding
	* Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things
	* PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign
	* C++ FAQs [http://www.aw.com/he/CS/CSCategories/C++/cline58958.html, BrokenLink on 2007-04-27]

Russ recently attended PLoP '95 (unfortunately he missed the '94 conference) and loved it. He has spent more time doing the patterns thing than writing about it but hopes to change that. He is currently working on several pattern languages of pervasive design issues that hopefully will find their way to places like PLoP '96 for further improvement.
