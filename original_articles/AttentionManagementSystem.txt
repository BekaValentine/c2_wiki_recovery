An AttentionManagementSystem is a system which manages input from email, social networks, handheld devices, broadcast messages, offers and information based on a users description of what is more important to them vs what is less important to them. All communication can be tagged with a few interest endemes each of which is an instance of an interest focus oriented EndemeSet. The user inputs their interest endemes and the system provides those communications which match one InterestEndeme of theirs. Then broadcasters can tag each broadcast with a particular InterestEndeme and only those with a close interest match will see it. --JonGrover

This could be a winner in the new AttentionEconomy.
