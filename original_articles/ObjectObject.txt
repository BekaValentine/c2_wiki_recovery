Seeing ValueObject, ParameterObject, ResultObject, ArgumentObject I had to think: Isn't this all the same? Just reflecting language entities? 

A quick search for Object reveals (http:wiki?search=Object):

* ActiveObject 
* ArgumentObject 
* CommandObject 
* CompoundObjects 
* ConstructorObject 
* ContextObject 
* CurriedObject 
* DataAccessObject 
* DataTransferObject 
* DateAndValueObject 
* DefaultObject 
* DeferredExceptionObject 
* DumbDataObject 
* DummyObject 
* FakeObject 
* FunctionCallObject 
* FunctionObject 
* FunctorObject 
* FutureObjects 
* GenericFunctionObject 
* ImmutableObject 
* ImmutableValueObject 
* MethodObject 
* MockObject 
* MutableValueObject 
* NullObject 
* ParameterObject 
* QueryObject 
* ResultObject 
* StateObject 
* StreamObject 
* SynchronizationObject 
* TheNilObject 
* ThrowawayObject 
* TransactionClosureObject 
* TransferObject 
* TypeObject 
* UndefinedObject 
* ValueObject 
(there are more, but these fall into the category I mean).

Obviously there is quite some redundancy here (in the pages as well as in the objects themselves).

What about ObjectsAsObjects?
