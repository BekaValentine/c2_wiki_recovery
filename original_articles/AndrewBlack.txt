Andrew Black is a Professor at Portland State University. He teaches Object-Oriented Programming, Distributed Systems, and for the first time in the Spring of 2001 ... XP! He has also been a researcher at Digital Equipment Corporation, and a Professor at the Oregon Graduate Institute and the University of Washington.

His home page is at http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~black/, where you will find references to his courses and recent talks.

He became interested in XP after hearing Ward and Ron Jeffries talk about it, and after teaching a conventional O-O analysis and design course. In his experience, real development groups always focus on the code, and processes that ignore that fact are doomed. In other words, code is more important than UML diagrams, and the process needs to believe that.
