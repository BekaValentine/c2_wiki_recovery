SR (SynchronizingResourcesLanguage??) is a language for writing ConcurrentPrograms. The main language constructs are resources and operations. Resources encapsulate processes and variables they share; operations provide the primary mechanism for process interaction. SR provides a novel integration of the mechanisms for invoking and servicing operations. Consequently, all of local and remote procedure call, rendezvous, MessagePassing, dynamic process creation, multicast, and semaphores are supported. SR also supports shared global variables and operations.
