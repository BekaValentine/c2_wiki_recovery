A purposely destructive individual that goes around Wiki making disruptive and derogatory comments by quoting endless passages and listing endless links to WikiPages.  Not unlike the very annoying door-to-door religious badgerer, who spouts off endless quotes from the bible, most out of context, and with the intent to overwhelm and confuse their victims.
