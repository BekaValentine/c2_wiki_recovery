One of the NextBigThing''''''s. A Wearable Cell Phone will need to have this feature which will allow the wearer to speak trained voice segments which will dial and connect to desired numbers. Phones which are to be worn would not need any visual display other than a multicolor LED which could indicate such things as power on, command accepted, ready for next command (yellow, green, red). Wearable Video and Camera phones with Pda or PalmSize display similar to the "Dick Tracy" Wrist Device, or an eyeglass retina camera and projection Device would also be possible extensions of the Audio Only Device which would be worn as an earpiece or as eyeglass frame, necklace, or Star Trek type broach. -- 20040622
