If you've messed up someone else's page, you may still be able to fix it from the backup copy.

	1. Click the EditText link at the bottom of the page (or ''Reload'' the old one)
	2. Find and follow the EditCopy hyperlink at the bottom of that page
	3. ''Save'' the copy over your mistakes

(If the above procedure can't be used, check for a backup copy of the page in http://c2.com/wiki/history.)

Also, it might prove good to double-check the contents of the page just before saving.

''Some people keep independent backups. If a page has been lost or mutilated beyond recovery, put a "RestoreMe" tag on it and see what happens.''
