AsimplerWay is predicated on exploration without fear. To do this we need to give ourselves permission to bypass expectations and inhibitions and just play.

Facilitation of all types (this includes consultancy, running conferences) often comes down to identifying the inhibitions in a context and giving ''permission'' for these to be ignored. -- DavidHarvey

It has been said that 'hypnotism' is a form of PermissionToAct. Suggestibility in a situation comes down to the subject allowing the hypnotist to take responsibility for the act, thereby removing the normal inhibitions. Inhibition being seen as a false sense of responsibility, or more normally a set of responsibilities enforced on the subject which they have not fully accepted.

I accused KentBeck of being a hypnotist with regard to ExtremeProgramming: he often talks of peoples' fears and challenges them, and secondly, he champions OnlyAcceptResponsibility (never have it given). He did not respond, only smiled - but that could have been the beer. Maybe we should also discuss HypnotismAsADevelopmentMethod ? -- JohnNolan


Sounds like in this case we're talking about PermissionToNotAct, that is to turn down a requirement from someone who pays your wages (for now). Isn't that the one of the secrets of consultancy -- because the consultant isn't part of the system, they have more room to maneuver?
