I am a member of CALJUG (http://www.caljug.org) and XPIndia (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpindia)

I like ExtremeProgramming, and am trying to follow it at my work place.
I find the connection between and Aikido and Extreme Programming very fascinating. I have written about it at ExtremeProgrammingAndAikido. 

I've read LateralThinking by Edward DeBono, and can't help noticing the Lateral element in Extreme Programming. Check LateralThinkingInExtremeProgramming. Recently read the book FiveDysfunctionsOfATeam - and I think it holds explanations as to why XP manages to succeed and build great teams.

''Somik, Thanks for the discussion about XP and Aikido!  I have been interested in some time in learning Aikido because I had heard some about its content.  But I had not heard before of its unique self-paired teaching style.  That makes it even more interesting!

Perhaps others would want to compare other programming styles (waterfall methodology, etc.) to other martial arts?''
