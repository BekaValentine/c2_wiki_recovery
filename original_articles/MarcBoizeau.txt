I'm a French developper. I currently work for a Company named ASI http://www.asi-informatique.fr. 

I'm interested in issues related to Business Intelligence,  Oracle, JEE and Microsoft technologies. 

I posted a  few articles here:

I used to post on a blog:
      http://oraclevsmicrosoft.blogspot.com. which is sometimes refered to for my C# Mandelbrot set algorithm   implementation.


I also created the OracleVsMicrosoft WikiPage.
