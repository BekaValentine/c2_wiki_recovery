How important really is TypingSpeed for Software Development? How do programmers really get their WPM up? 

''I touch type but dreadfully slowly, well below 50WPM. And I use my left thumb to hit the 'b' key. Yet, I have never felt limited by typing speed. With code completion and shortcuts for common blocks it's even less of an issue. I'd be surprised if there were people who thought code faster than they could type.''

''On a related note, am I alone with the problem of having hands which are too small for standard keyboards? I can type more comfortably on my tiny netbook. Why can't I buy a '''decent''' desktop keyboard of smaller size. You can buy a shoes in different sizes, and even some mice have adjustable size - why not keyboards?''

Perhaps what you are looking for is a roll-up version of a laptop/netbook keyboard

''I could possibly use a latpop keyboard but if I have to choose between keys which are to far apart or keys that are too flat - I'd rather stretch my fingers. I don't understand the new trend in keyboards - making them flat and low, with almost no key travel. Laptops do that due to height limitations but why arbitrarily do that on a desktop keyboard where height doesn't matter? Clearly that's just fashion crippling function. I blame Apple. I think they used that in their desktop keyboards first.''
