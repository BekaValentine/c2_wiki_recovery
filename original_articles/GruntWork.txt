GruntWork has to be done, and it is trivially done, but a lot of programmers just don't like to waste their time doing it.It is the kind of work that a GruntProgrammer does well, repetitive stuff like:

*renaming variables
*adding references to already designed style sheets
*making sure that the button to to X is 3 pixels to the right and not 6 pixels to the right of button Y
*adding the images for all those buttons
*renaming database elements (refactoring database)
*detect all the unused variables and delete them

In summary the kind of work that a good quality IDE or Framework can make unnecessary (or at least far less boring and repetitive).
