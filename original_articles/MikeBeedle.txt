I wear many hats: coach managers, coach architects, mentor programmers, develop code, test, or talk to C-level executives (CEOs, CIOs, CFOs, CPOs, CGOs, etc.).  I do whatever it takes to deliver value to the customer and complete projects.

I use Scrum (http://www.agilescrum.com), BalancedAgility (http://www.balancedagility.com), or XBreed (http://www.xbreed.net) to develop software, with a high-dosage of OpenSource tools:  CVS, Apache, Tomcat, Bugzilla, etc.; and practices: http://www.dreamsongs.com/NewFiles/JiniCommunityPL.pdf

I have done Scrum since 1995.   Most of the appliations we develop as of late are J2EE applications.

Favorite Programming tools:  EmacsEditor, Eclipse (EclipseIde).  I like Emacs more to program in Lisp (specially with SLIME http://www.cliki.net/Slime), Haskell, Curry, Erlang or C++ but I like EclipseIde to program in Java.

I am interested in a lot of stuff like agents; functional programming; logical programming; pattern-oriented programming languages; the theory of software and patterns; Agile Methods like SCRUM, XP; lofty things like business architecures (BPR, KM, supply-chain management, workflow, etc.); complexity science; and Physics.  The items on this ''list'' are curiously related ;-)

Sometimes I play with JlisaRuleEngine at night.
