I operate the AgileCanada website and Wiki, http://www.agilecanada.com.  I also maintain the PatternsOfXUnitTestAutomation website and wiki with GerardMeszaros.

Although conversant in various programming languages (and have survival skills in three non-mother tongue natural languages), I would describe myself as a SeasonedSmalltalker who speaks Java, Ruby, etc. with a SmalltalkAccent :-).
