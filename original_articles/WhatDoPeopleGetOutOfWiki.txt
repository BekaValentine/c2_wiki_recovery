What use is Wiki to those who use it?

	* Probing new ideas

	* Learning about new things

-----

	* DesignPatterns, and project management patterns, including ExtremeProgramming.  ''(This is the PortlandPatternRepository, after all.)''

	* ExtremeProgramming and other LightweightMethodologies.

	* Refactoring of code/design, with and without XP.  (WikiPagesAboutRefactoring, RefactoringLanguage)

	* Discussing other (usually technical) topics of general interest to the current audience.

	* Experiencing this new medium and trying to figure it out!

	* Training and experiencing CollectiveIntelligence and CollectiveLove

	* PersonalInformationManagement, by using a PersonalWiki

	* Discussion of exercise & nutrition, although it annoys some purists who would like to see Wiki remain centered on programming topics
