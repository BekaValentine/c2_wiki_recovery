'''Folklore'''

Version 9 of HP-UX changed the way the "heartbeat" light in the front blinks from mere blinking to a rhythm more similar to a real heartbeat

The man page for tunefs(1) says somewhere on the bottom "You can tune a file system but you can't tune a fish."

This operating system contains the best calculator program that I have come across: xhpcalc, which contains the original code from the HP-12C, 15C and 16C calculators. If you send the program a SIG_PWRFAIL, it will even turn on the low battery indicator.
