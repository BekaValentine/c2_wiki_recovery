Some of the hints are described on this Wiki:
* Make actions atomic: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=transaction
* Use procedure arguments: HigherOrderFunction, FunctionalProgramming
* PlanToThrowOneAway
* DivideAndConquer
* EndToEndPrinciple
* DynamicCompilation
* CacheCalculations, MemoizationStrategy
* Don't generalize: YouArentGonnaNeedIt

Hints (using the slogans in the paper) for which I couldn't immediately find an appropriate page:
* Separate normal and worst case
* Do one thing well
* Get it right
* Don't hide power
* Leave it to the client
* Keep basic interfaces stable
* Keep a place to stand
* Keep secrets
* Use a good idea again
* Shed load
* Safety first
* Use hints
* Use brute force
* Compute in background
* Batch processing
* Log updates

Read the paper for the meanings of the slogans; some are not obvious.
