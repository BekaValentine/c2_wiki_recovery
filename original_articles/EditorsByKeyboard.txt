* '''Netbeans IDE:''' Their 'Ctrl', 'Space', 'Arrow down' and 'Enter' keys are worn out.
* ViEditor: Their '.', ':', and 'Esc' keys are worn out.
* EmacsEditor: Their 'Meta' and 'Bucky' keys are worn out.
* WordEditor: Their 'Ctrl', 'Alt', and 'Del' keys are worn out.

ViEditor was created by a touch-typist (BillJoy) for touch-typists. Keyboard usage is very carefully designed to allow one to keep one's fingers in the touch-typing "home" position, to not require many finger contortions that are awkward for touch typing.

EmacsEditor was created by a non-touch-typist (RichardStallman), and therefore he and it think nothing of requiring contorted hand positions for "control-meta-cokebottle" constructs; the fact that they interfere with the ergonomics of fast and comfortable touch-typing wasn't even on his radar.

None of which has anything to do with why ViEditor wears out '.', ':', and 'Esc', which is amusing but sort of true, kind of.
