A Mozilla Nightly Build is one of the new web browsers from TheMozillaProject [1]. They are OpenSource, and the nightly builds are new binaries produced every day so that people can test them and report bugs.
----
One distinction between the Mozilla nightly build and other nightly builds is that Mozilla is built on all supported platforms, using a heterogeneous build farm.
