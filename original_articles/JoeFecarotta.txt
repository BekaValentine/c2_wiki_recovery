Greetings. I am Computer Programmer, residing currently in beautiful Long Island, NY.  I am most comfortable with PHP and Java, among a dozen other web technologies I use daily. However, Computer Animation is my real passion.  Its unfortunate that there are still so few shops that do that sort of thing. 

I have 2 great kids ( third coming), and a wonderful wife Julie. You'll know me if you blend together the following:
CsLewis, Huston Smith, AynRand, Rush (both the band and the talk show host), Metallica, SevenOfNine, Ancient History, Realisim, Impressionism, Gweneth Paltrow, Xfiles, PragmaticProgramming, Protestant Christianity, Process Theology and Capitalism.   Follow me at #joefec :)
