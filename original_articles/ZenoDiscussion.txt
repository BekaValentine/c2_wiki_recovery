Abstract:

The ZENO process, as described in the paper, is "an open-source platform supporting e-discourses."
ZENO provides a high degree of structure to content and participation in on-line discussions.
If one were to view wiki on a continuum with ZENO, wiki would 'probably' be on the unstructured, free form end, while ZENO would appear on the formal, structured end.

Both 'systems' provide value in promoting human interaction, while the difficulty is in when and where implementation of either or both is appropriate, and who decides.

Please refer to the following link for accurate information on ZENO.  Corrections to the Abstract are probably necessary and encouraged. --RobChamberlin

The Zeno producers ("Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft") claimed it to be "open-source" - but now the old Zeno page http://zeno.berlios.de/ leads to its fully commercial successor project "dito" which is based on Zeno. You can download a 30-day trial version, but the license conditions are only available on request - typical practice in european science.

The new Zeno project page https://developer.berlios.de/projects/zeno/ is still called "open-source", but there I found today only the .jar executable from 2002-01-21 without any documentation. They use the sourceforge software, provide an empty wiki, a missing screenshot, but at least some email adresses from the developers (which I didn't try out). The "Project Home Page" link leads - as you guess - to dito.

Zeno as "open-source" project is dead.
