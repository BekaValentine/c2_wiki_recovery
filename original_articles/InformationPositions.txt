In a Personal use Wiki, the Artifact_Link is a means used to access an Information_Position. It can be thought of as an artifact in an Information_Archive, Library, or Universe.

They are accessed via an Information_Agent. The traditional Information_Agent is the InternetBrowser. It may be assisted by other Agents which can be used in the processing of the information in the position. The additional agents can serve additional purposes including making it otherwise UsefulUsableUsed. While I am presenting InformationPositions here as a System which is User_Centered, It need not be restricted to that role.
