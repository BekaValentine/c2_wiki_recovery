[Part of the NegotiatingPatternLanguage]

Many negotiations are conducted with only one person at the table (for either or both sides).  However, it may be advantageous to have others present (either actively at the table, or available for consultation), so unless it's explicitly allowed, consider whether or not to BringAnAlly.

* Lawyers, agents, and ExpertNegotiator''''''s are always a good thing.

* If you have the right temperament (and are tolerant of the inevitable whining), bringing small children to the dealership may be advantageous--especially if the negotiation tables are in the open and part of the showroom.  If negotiations drag on too long, the kids will start to whine and misbehave, and the dealership staff might be happy to give you a better deal to get you out of there.  (Plus, it's a great excuse to leave if things don't go smoothly--"we have to wrap this up soon, because the kids are getting tired").  Don't overdo it, though; it's unfair to the kids, and inappropriate/unprofessional in some circumstances.  (Bringing kids to the auto dealer is fine; bringing them to a job interview is not.)

* Bringing along an AbsentProxy (which would make them a PresentProxy) might be useful--the other party will then know you're not bluffing.  (However, your proxy is then open to negotiations--NegotiateWithTheBoss works both ways).

On the other hand, an ally with a big mouth ("Geez!  That's a LOT cheaper price than at the dealer across town!", or "Honey, I really ''want'' the red one!") can swiftly undermine your position.  So be careful who you bring.
