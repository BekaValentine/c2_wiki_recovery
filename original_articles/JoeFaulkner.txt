Joe is a programmer analyst who has been developing in Smalltalk since October, 1995.  He recently attended a conference where several of the presenters insisted he visit this wiki and that wiki to download this product and that product.  Not knowing what a wiki is, he returned home to search the web in search of wiki.  This site provided an introduction to the technology and afforded him the opportunity to develop his first wiki page.
