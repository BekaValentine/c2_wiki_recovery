There are some people who feel they would be able to achieve something neat if only they could get organized. Exactly how many, and whether they're correct, isn't clear.

Since "something neat" is quite often of benefit to other people too, it would be helpful if there were some repository of tips to offer some direction to those trying to bootstrap themselves to greater productivity, inventiveness.

''For a while, I've thought such a collection of tips would be a good idea. Is this a good place to start? I've added some points, partly because I think they might help and partly to offer an initial structure. -- MatthewAstley''

CategorySelfImprovementPatterns are relevant and this page belongs in that category, but if the end result may be useful to all there are also non-altruistic reasons for wanting to help a hacker get organized. How best to do this? What kinds of help can a community offer to someone who wants to be independent?

'''Tools''' (in the widest sense of the word)

	* Each task will have some tools available and each tool can be used or abused for a variety of tasks.
	* Have some idea what tools are available and which people use them.
	* If the tool proves useful, master it. Even if this means reading the manual, or dipping into the manual every three months for new ideas.
	* Experiment. Do you work best with ink or pencil? Notebook; scraps of paper; whiteboard and camera; more software?

'''Problems'''

	* Try to notice problems. Is your office space annoying you? How would you know, since you're there all the time?
	* If it causes you trouble, remember that you're a hacker. You can find a solution and it doesn't have to be the same one everyone else uses.
	* If it doesn't cause you trouble, don't be pressured into fixing it. If you're disorganized and get neat stuff done anyway...

'''Goals'''

	* Do you spend more time on the tools than using them? Maintaining the operating system or internet connection, backing up files or writing a well-known typesetting package may or may not interest you as problems in their own right. Do you need to do that? Is there a quicker pragmatic solution?

'''People'''

	* Find some good ones. (There's plenty more to say here.)

'''Health'''

	* Mental and physical health do seem to be linked. Do you have a plan for looking after them?
