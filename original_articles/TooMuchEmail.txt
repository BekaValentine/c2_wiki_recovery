Too Much E-Mail

  [TTTO "Under Pressure" by Queen & Bowie]

  Dave:  S.M.T.P... S.M.T.P... S.M.T.P... 

  Freddy:  E-mail! 
      Dragging down my day
      Just don't know what to say
      Too much e-mail
      That brings my through-put down
      Interrupts my flow

  Dave:  Puts projects on skids.

    S.M.T.P... S.M.T.P... S.S.M.T.T.P... 

  Freddy:  Don't spam me!

  Dave:  It's the terror of pulling
      all my inboxes down.
      Watching my colleagues
      Screaming--

  Freddy: Help me out!

  Freddy:  Even online 
      In the night time
      Delete all the e-mail

  Dave: Or cover my ass.

      S.M.T.P... S.M.T.P... I.MAP...

  Freddy: Exchange!
      Projects can't run
      Without open questions.
      In endless mails
      It never rains but it pours
      Projects on skids 
      Projects on skids 

  Dave:  It's the terror of pulling
      all my inboxes down.
      Watching my colleagues
      Screaming--

  Freddy: Help me out!

      Pray tomorrow I'll read faster faster faster

  Dave:  E-mail bout projects
      Projects on skids.

  Freddy:  Can't bear to read'em
      With no reply
      If I delete them my
      Boss reads his why oh why?

  Dave:  Keep replying with the answers
      And they just want more.

  Freddy (''portamento'' way up over next):
      Why why whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?

  Dave:
      Trim Trim Trim Trim
      Keep trimming your quotes down 
      To the minimum needed.
      Can't we just use our Wiki?

  Freddy:
      Why can't we give Chat that one more chance?
      Why can't we collocate, and code in pairs?
      Why cant we chit chat chit chat chit chat?       

  Dave:
      'Cause chat leaves no trail and misinforms
      us and won't change the way
      we share all the 
      de-tails of our project 
      with excellent written and
      verbal communication skills
      without e-mail so
      This is our last mail
      This is our last mail
      Here's our reply.

  Freddy:
      Too much e-mail
      Too much e-mail
      E-mail
