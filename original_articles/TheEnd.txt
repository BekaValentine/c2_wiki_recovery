''"This is the end.... my only friend" -- JimMorrison (The Doors)''

This is the last page on Wiki. That's it. It's the end of the line. Now turn around and go back where you came from.
You can, however, go to the end of the internet at http://home.att.net/~cecw/lastpage.htm
But that's it. There is nothing more. See also http://www.explodingdog.com/january2/theendoftheinternet.html
There's an Earthlink (or somesuch) DSL commercial running about the end of the internet. It would be great to get a DIVX/MPEG of that.

This page is actually a complaint about moded interfaces and the proliferation of escapes that they encourage. Read on for that rant.

''"Tha tha that's all folks." -- Porky Pig''

An early stumbling block for me in programming was learning the difference between "stop" and "end". In the FortranLanguage, for example, the former halted the execution of the program while the latter halted the compilation. In the '70s, I supported the campaign against ''modes''. This was as much about having a uniform and OutOfBand mechanism to escape one context for another as anything. The campaign failed. This came home to me this morning when I wrote the statement ...

  print "<a href=/cgi/wiki?$&>$&</a><br>\n";

Never mind the cryptic variable name ($&), this statement sucks because it requires eight terminators ''(almost)'' in a row. These are ...

	* /a -- ends the anchor
	* > -- ends the /a tag

''There's an < here, which opens the <BR> tag''

	* br -- ends the line when formatted
	* > -- ends the br tag
	* \n -- ends the line when transmitted
	* " -- ends the line when compiled
	* ; -- ends the statement when compiled
	* ''enter'' -- ends the statement when entered

It sucks because I must remember that I am nested that deep in context and must pop my way out of it before I get on to the next thing I want the computer to do. This gets me wondering, just how many ways are there in use today to say ''the end''?

	* Alt+F4 -- Ends the life of a Window or application in MS Windows, which results in a WM_CLOSE (I think) message to the Window's message loop, which eventually causes a 0 result to return from Get''''''Message(), which tells the message loop to terminate.

-- CraigPutnam

''There's a WM_QUIT message in there somewhere as well. There are also Windows messages that indicate machine shutdown, session termination, and other such events.''

As an electrical engineer, I am surprised no-one mentioned the "power switch". Isn't that the normal way to end a DOS session? Also the normal way to stop most other electronic devices. -- DavidCary	.... and you can always try to "Pull the Plug" even ? what about pulling that damned phone line ...

Being able to juggle these multiple levels of context is IMHO a fundamental programming skill. One I make sure to spend time with my students on (it comes up when preparing dynamic SQL in VB or C++). 

The real problem with the above is the ''number'' of levels. Encapsulating the tag-creation nastiness might make things easier. (Pardon any mistakes, but perl is not my lingua mater):

  $lnk = $&;
  print html_a_tag("/cgi/wiki?$lnk") . $lnk . html_a_tag_end() . "<b" . "r>" . $newline;

-- DavidBrantley

A possibly better way is to encapsulate the script-linking code. (I'm sure Ward would have done this if he was writing in Smalltalk rather than Perl.) For instance, in my wiki clone all links to the script are done through through a subroutine:

 sub Script''''''Link {
	my ($action, $text) = @_;	# Gets the subroutine parameters
	return "<a href=\"$Script''''''Name?$action\">$text</a>";
 }

...which is called in any place that needs a link back to the script. Since links to pages are common (used in 7 places so far), I wrapped them in a Get''''''Page''''''Link subroutine (which calls Script''''''Link). My version of the above print statement would read:

 print Get''''''Page''''''Link($&) . "<br>\n";

Those of us who use Forth should also remember that

 bye

will end your Forth session. This also will work in OpenFirmware (which is Forth in and of itself, I guess).

When I was at university, I encountered a package for doing
statistical manipulation or something, called MINITAB. If you typed "quit" to its command prompt, it displayed the message ''Type "exit" to leave MINITAB'', which has always struck me as a particularly impressive bit of sadism.
 web: {1} % python
 Python 1.5.2 (#11, Nov 17 1999, 22:58:09)  [GCC egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2  on bsdos4)]
 Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam
 >>> quit
 'Use Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit.'
 >>>
Note that "quit" is just a string in the default interpreter namespace. Having "quit" actually leave the application would require "quit" to become a somewhat special syntactic form. In Windows, you're told to type Ctrl-Z then press enter.

''Not necessarily:''
  class Quitter:
	def __repr__(self):
	import sys
	sys.exit(0)
  quit = Quitter()
''Of course, besides being JustWrong because of side effects in __repr__, this violates UserExpectations that typing an identifier will not perform an action. (Feel free to delete this if this Python tangent is inappropriate for this page.) -- KevinReid''

... but would it have been so wrong to make
 >>> quit()
quit the python interpreter? Like so:
  class Quitter:
	def __repr__(self): return "Use quit() to exit."
	def __call__(self): raise SystemExit
  quit = Quitter()

Also note that Matlab does the opposite: it lets you exit with
"exit" or "quit" but ''not with CTRL-D'', not even on Unix.

''For people using nslookup from their shell accounts at Primenet, "quit.primenet.com" used to point to the alias "Use.exit.to.quit.moron.primenet.com", or something similar.''

------

Using MIT Scheme interactively you cannot exit with the exit command because that is not a valid s-expression. You have to use (exit) instead. Then after a confirmation that you really wanted to exit, it closes with ''Happy Happy Joy Joy.''

TheEnd is a classic Doors song ...

	This is the end	beau - ti - ful  friend
	This is the end	my  on - ly	friend, the end of	our e-lab-orate
	plans, the end of ev-erything that stands, the end.

... and a classic Beatles song from the ''Abbey Road'' album ... 

	Oh yeah, all right
	Are you going to be in my dreams
	Tonight?
	...instrumental...
	
	And in the end
	The love you take
	Is equal to the love you make.

Interestingly, ''The End'' was the last song listed on the LP cover of ''Abbey Road'' (their last record they recorded), but not the last song on the album. Paul's little ditty ''Her Majesty'' is the last song on the record. Later releases sadly had ''Her Majesty'' on the cover.

You guys do realize, of course, that since there are WikiName''''''s on this page, it isn't really "the end"... ;-) ''(I think sumbudy 1 time removed all the WikiName''''''s now it is back in. Maybe is the joke)''
