PS/2 was the attempt of IBM to regain control over the PC-market operating systems, but MicroSoft soon monopolized the market.

-- REQUEST --

Any chance to get a PS/2 system disk? My semi-portable IBM computer did fail me at the end of 2005 (an INTEL-based model) and I can't get it started anymore... 

I'm looking to recover the data on it. 

Thanks a lot.
