It's GeekNight. You know the drill. Last week we had MartinFowler along. But this week it's gonna be even better! 

We'll be ordering pizza at about 7. When signing up, please state your choice of pizza such as Vegetarian, Meaty, Spicey, Nothing, etc. 

Agenda:

	* NMock : what's left for version 1.0 release?
	* NMock : more spikes to get past the virtual problem. ''I've hijacked the profiling API to do this - bring your C++ hard-hats.''

	* MarathonMan : solve problems with intermittent DeadLock, move towards release 0.13
	* MarathonMan : redo the website. we *really* need to do this people.
	* MarathonMan : we also need to do some planning/reprioritizing of future features

	* CruiseControl: if anyone is interested, there are some things I want to change about how CruiseControl works so we could work on that.  However, with all of the MarathonMan work this may need to wait until next week.

Attendees (and pizza preference, and whether bringing laptop/notebook):

	* JoeWalnes - Meaty or spicey (bzzzt - not coming after all).
