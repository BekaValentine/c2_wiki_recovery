I suppose I have to agree with Psychologists that I may be guilty myself of unclean thoughts, and I am thankful that because I am not good at hiding my tracks, I can look at people straight into their eyes whether I go. It is a pity that lots of gifted and powerful people succumb to TheDevilWithinOneself.
