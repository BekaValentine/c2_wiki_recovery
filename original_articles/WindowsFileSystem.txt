WindowsFileSystem (WinFS) "was set to be a platform for organizing, searching for and sharing all kinds of data and information. Microsoft described WinFS as a revolutionary storage platform that would include schemas for everything from images and documents, to people, tasks and events."

It is said a WinFS-enabled server allows capabilities (e.g. search) to go across an entire network, no longer limited to a single PC.

A beta is available in SeptemberZeroFive. And at the moment it is planned to be "in beta" past the ship date of WindowsVista.

This beta requires WindowsXp SP2 as a base OS, but will not run in WindowsServerTwoThousandThree.

No technology dependence to WindowsVista components such as MicrosoftIndigo.

"Strategy connection" exists with the BizTalk WindowsWorkflowFoundation component in activities like "data notifications".

Here is something that bugs the crap out of me when I code. Given "C:\temp\readme.txt". We have computer terms for the: folder (or path or dir) "C:\temp", file "readme.txt" and extension "txt". But we don't have a word for the whole thing "C:\temp\readme.txt". If you call it a file, people may think its "readme.txt". So what do you call it? We really need to come up with a new term. Sorry for being slightly offtopic but there's no wiki for FileNamingConventions. ''How about "filespec"?''

Isn't that the full path (or just the path) of the file? "c:\temp" is the path to the folder containing the file, not the path to the file itself. At least that's how I see things...
