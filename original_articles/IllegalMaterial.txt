There may be some material which is illegal on Wiki.

The definition of IllegalMaterial in the context of Wiki is that material which is not allowed on the server due to laws where the server resides.

Examples include:
* CopyRight - http://www.wiredsafety.org/law/copyrights/
** In general, removal upon notification is a legitimate defense. (In other words, if someone posts infringing material here and Ward removes it upon notification, that ends the matter).
* Child pornography; illegal throughout the UnitedStates.
** In some parts of the United States, other forms of pornography is illegal. The state of Oregon, where WardsWiki is hosted, has perhaps the most liberal free speech laws in the United States.
*** Of course, pr0n is OffTopic anyway.

Is the following true? 

* Everything you write is copyrighted. http://www.ssrn.com/update/lsn/cyberspace/lessons/copyr02.html
''Yes, this is true. That's the legal reason why you can't post someone else's email.''

* Service Provider Liability: http://www.ssrn.com/update/lsn/cyberspace/lessons/copyr11.html
''The DigitalMillenniumCopyrightAct created a safe harbor for ISPs. They can't be held liable for infringement by customers if they remove the material when notified about it.''
