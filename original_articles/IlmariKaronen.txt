It's been quite a while since I last visited wiki and created this page. Now that I've actually written more than a HelloWorld here, I guess I should put some real information here too.

I tend to write in ThreadMode and sign my contributions (blame my UseNet experience), but feel free to consider my comments free game for editing even if they're not tagged with an OpenAuthor badge.

Given a choice, I prefer to write my programs in PerlLanguage, or in CeeLanguage if a lower level approach is required.  At work I'm also learning to do JavaServlets, and I still remember 680x0 assembly even though it's been a while since I wrote any (and I still think of CeeLanguage as a convenient shorthand for assembly).

I have no experience of ExtremeProgramming so far, but I'm trying to get things moving in that direction at work, mostly because it could hardly fail to be an improvement over the current situation. :-( I've been trying ExtremeProgrammingForOne on a study-related Java project, and it seems to work great except when Java decides to be a PainInTheAss.

Hello from another wiki.fi addict! What's the likelihood you like near Tornio? (I know: really, really small) -- ShaeErisson

Approaching zero, unless you define Helsinki as being near Tornio.

Well, I keep wishing for local computer people -- se
