World As Myth states that all the great works of fiction, from Alice in Wonderland to the land of OZ really exists and it was manifested in our universe due to some low level sub-conscious "link" if you will between the writer and the universe. Or vice versa, in that, we make up the world and thereby bring it into being.
* Or relating this statement to software, ExtremeProgramming and Patterns: A link exists  between the "World" (past experience, sub-conscious organization, imagination and I''''''nstinctivePlanning and I''''''terativeDevelopment) which is first established by "Stories" and then later is formed by humans into "Realities". 
* Or there is a cosmic influence (the "force") on the human brain which affects conscious actions.
** Meaning: there are things which are either E''''''xtraNatural or S''''''upraNatural which affect our actions.
* Or if you relate the title about the WorldAsaMyth, using some existing "literary" words: "And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep" , and in another place: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion"
