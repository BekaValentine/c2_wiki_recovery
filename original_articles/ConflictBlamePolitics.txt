This is a model I heard for organizations dealing with Change.

Here is how I heard it described.

 Change leads to Conflict
 If unresolved
 Conflict leads to Blame
 Blame leads to '''Politics'''
or 
 Change leads to Conflict
 Conflict is resolved
 '''Organization Learns'''

I did not know who to credit for this model but, I find it useful.
