A system / resource that can be accessed simultaneously by two or more processes.

''"Simultaneously" is pretty much the same as "concurrently", and it takes two or more things in order for simultaneous or concurrent to mean anything at all. So a good paraphrase might be:''

ConcurrentSystem: A system which is concurrent.
