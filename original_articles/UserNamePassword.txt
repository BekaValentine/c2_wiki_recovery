An access and privileges attribute of many WebServices. By using this CodeCombination (and in many case letting the system remember and supply it automatically) a user secures access and defines a privilege level in doing so. 

This is one of the oldest and most enduring schemes to be found in use in the modern computing environment.

It also serves to identify a participant who might create content within the site and to set privileges. This is something inherited by the internet from the old BulletinBoard systems and from ComputerSystems in ClientServer configurations.

It is used more for supplying identity than to secure transactions, since it is possible, and perhaps easy for a person having interest in you or the site to discover and use your UserNamePassword to impersonate you.
