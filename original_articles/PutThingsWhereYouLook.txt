The idea being of course that when you go looking for something, like that special little plastic tray for your George Foreman Grill (the "Mean Lean Fat Burning Machine"), and you look in your spoon drawer but later find it in the cupboard where your pots are, you should put it back in the spoon drawer afterwards.  ''You must live alone for this to work! :)''

The same rule becomes a small pattern in coding where you should NameThingsWhatYouCallThem.

This reminds me of MoveToFront

Eminem had the best solution when he kept all his worldly possessions in a garbage bag in 8-Mile. Unfortunately many people have to do just that but must be a surreal experience to act that part knowing you have millions in the bank in reality.
