"There is too much hot hard asphalt in the world. A local road, which only gives access to buildings, needs a few stones for the wheels of the cars; nothing more.  Most of it can still be green."

Personal observation:  This pattern can be seen all over Western Switzerland, where driveways are commonly made of hollow shapes which support the car but allow grass to grow.  -- StevenBlack

------
Many northern roads which give only access to buildings need to be plowed to remove snow.  This pattern seems intended for temperate climates only; snowplows convert green paths into muddy mushy muck.
