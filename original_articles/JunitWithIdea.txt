The new EAP (Aurora) has a great looking and feedback rich graphical runner.

This runner has the following features
	* Run the current test method, all test methods of the current class, all tests contained within the current package
	* Monitor and report memory usage and timing
	* GUI runner can filter tests to only show failures
	* Ability to create temporary or permanent test run configuration
	* Diff tool for long string output differences
	* Ability to roll back to the any green bar state using the LocalVCS (label added on every test run with its status) 

A third party http://www.intellij.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/JUnitTestPlugin adds the following features (as of Aug 10, 2003 some features are only available in the Aurora version)
	* Configure a project wide organization for test classes
	* Toggle navigation between class/method under test and its associated test methods
	* Automatic creation of Test class shell based on a velocity template
	* Automatic refactoring of test class/method to reflect move/rename of class/method under tests
	* more to come ;-)
