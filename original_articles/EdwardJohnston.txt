Johnston painstakingly reconstructed the lost techniques used by mediaeval scribes, working from the letter forms found in manuscripts and the properties of contemporary materials. In doing so he reinvented the discipline of formal penmanship. His ''Writing & Illuminating & Lettering'' ISBN:0486285340 is a seminal work in the field. This book may be of interest to developers since it speaks eloquently of a craft that may only be mastered by someone with a full understanding of TheMediumAndItsProperties.
