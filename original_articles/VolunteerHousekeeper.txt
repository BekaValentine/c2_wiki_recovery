Lots of nice refactorings in the last few weeks, folks.  Keep up the good work.  Special appreciations for the cleanup of WhyWikiWorksNot.  Sorry if it seemed I lost my sense of perspective there.  -- MichaelHill

Thank you for your engagement, today I terminate my part as refactorer, to concentrate myself on the DataMusicProject, which I feel, will be more useful to the Wiki community. -- FridemarPache

I just discovered http:longs.cgi and I'm trying to make the large pages I find there smaller. It's not too hard to find sections that are starting to drift towards a new topic, and then move those sections to a page that is dedicated to that topic. Most of these pages are in ThreadMode. I know it would be good to ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode but I still find that difficult. I feel I have accomplished something useful when I pull text on some topic that was scattered over several pages and move it all together on one page (OnceAndOnlyOnce).

I did start with cutting down my own prior contribution to only one single page. But I have to say that the Wiki environment engages to develop ideas. So I'm afraid that I'll have to restart with cutting back my own contributions at least one more time. -- PieterJansegers
