Why hello!

I am 23, just got out of the UnitedStatesMarineCorps and have started my Computer Science degree this year (8/2011)

I have dabbled a bit in CeeLanguage, CeePlusPlus, and PythonLanguage so far. I must say, I really enjoy C and outside of school, I spend the majority of my time playing with it.

AndroidOS, anyone!?!? Tinkering with AndroidOS is what got interested in computers to begin with, so it holds a special place in my heart.

Looking forward to learning as much as I can from this wiki :)
