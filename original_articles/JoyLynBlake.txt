[ Jon Udell said really nice things about my hard work, dedication, and mastery of emacs, PhotoShop and Illustrator making the pages of http://www.byte.com look as great as we like to think we do. Unfortunately I'm too quick on the delete key, so you'll have to take my word for it! ]

Thanks, Jon!  I just LOVE this stuff. If anyone reading this page knows of neat new graphics programs/tips/tools/tricks,
please send me email. If I'm not doing graphics, I like discussing how to. :-)
