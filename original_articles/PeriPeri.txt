'''March 25th, 2004 :-''' PeriPeri is one year old today!

Over the last year, PeriPeri has developed the following original features:

	* Semi-lattice NameSpace for overloading WikiNames, with contextual linking (see http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~cjp39/Peri/ShatterFacetWiki)
	* StableView, protecting casual visitors from vandalism (see http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~cjp39/Peri/StableView)
	* SemanticWiki based on a familiar MetadataSyntax, currently using the DublinCore and providing RSS feeds (see http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~cjp39/Peri/MetadataSyntax)

Other features:

	* Email-like markup producing validating HTML 4.01 Strict output (see http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~cjp39/Peri/FormattingCommands)
	* A CSS-based interface that degrades gracefully on old browsers
	* A return to the ideas of InterWiki, working within the semi-lattice NameSpace (see http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~cjp39/Peri/NearLink)

Details of most of PeriPeri's features can be found at http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~cjp39/Current/PeriMechanics. PeriPeri is hosted at http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~cjp39/Peri.

PeriPeri is a spike of the FacetWiki project.

'''September 2nd, 2005''' : News from PeriPeri site: "PeriPeri project is currently on hold -- the author is investigating ways of re-factoring the base code entirely." The author has been redisigning the wiki to use PHP on PostgreSQL. No code has been released yet.
