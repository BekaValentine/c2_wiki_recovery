CategoryScientist is for pages describing important scientists and their contributions. Click on the heading for a list of scientists. To be included in this category, at least one of the following should be true (the more the better):

* Have an advanced degree in a particular scientific or engineering discipline.
* Be an active or formerly-active researcher in a particular scientific or engineering discipline (pure academic research certainly qualifies, as does industrial research of an exploratory nature. Coding up CrudScreen''''''s in Java is not considered "research").
* Be a noted authority in a particular field (this doesn't necessarily mean well-known to the general public; but one's work should be reasonably well-known by other scientists in the field).

Note that this category is not reserved for the "big names" like Turing or Knuth or Newton... though they all qualify. Nor is anyone disqualified by his/her work being obsoleted by subsequent work in the field - Newton's laws of motion have all been replaced by more modern theories (though they remain excellent approximations for velocities << the SpeedOfLight), but he still counts.
