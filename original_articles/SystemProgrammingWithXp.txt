I was recently talking with Rok Sosic, CTO of TurboLinux and EricRaymond about Xp in a small cafe. Rok Sosic, who has a strong background in SystemProgramming, wasn't very positive about Xp, though he admitted that Xp would work well with business applications. EricRaymond somehow agreed with him. Rok said of BDUF.

And After that, I encountered by chance this fascinating interview with DavidCutler in the internet (http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/fromms/kanoarchitect.asp 
). Some of his experience seemed to correpond to Xp principles, and some not. What do you think about SystemProgrammingWithXp? Has anyone tried Xp to system programming? --JuneKim
