"Leadership Ensemble" : Times Books
Written about my good friends in the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, NY, NY

In a nutshell it's about collaborative management and a boss-less 
organization.  Orpheus has given many seminars on their 
rehearsal/recording/performance management model.  Their model is used 
by corporate names such as J.P. Morgan, Morgan-Stanley, StonyField 
Farms, Gore and Associates (Gore-tex), San Diego Zoo, and many more.

Orpheus is not "Leader-less," in fact everyone in the orchestra is a 
leader.  For this very reason is why Orpheus is one of the greatest 
orchestras on planet earth.
