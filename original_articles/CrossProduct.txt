The '''Cross''''''Product''' of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both which has a length equal to the area of the parallelogram defined by them, and points in a direction such that it obeys the right-hand rule. That makes the '''Cross''''''Product''' anti-commutative.
	* ''a'' '''x''' ''b'' = -''b'' '''x''' ''a''
	* ''(ka)'' '''x''' ''b'' = k(''a'' '''x''' ''b'')
	* ''a'' '''x''' ''a'' = 0
