MikeVogel just getting serious about investigating XP. Trying to figure out if I can use the wiki to get comments on the things that I disagree with. Don't know if someone responds to the Answer''''''Me link I left if they will put the answer here or on the page.

The latter, usually.

Are you in any way related to PeterMerel? (:^p, only for those who understand Dutch I'm afraid).

I'm not related. It appears that my boss (Tim Warren) knows him, but that's hardly a relation. Tim also knows Dutch but was unable to help me grok your reference. Even worse than the fact that I'm struggling with understanding XP is that I can't even interpret your emoticon. (Sept 2002)

Re Emoticon - a colon, a 'hat' (Shift-6), and a 'p' - :^p -- two eyes, a nose and a mouth with a tongue sticking out.
I hope that helps.  .. and if M Vogel went to Purdue, then greetings, old friend! -- ChrisDaSilva
