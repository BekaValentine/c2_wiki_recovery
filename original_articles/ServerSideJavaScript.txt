As you can read on the JavaScript page, it is a ScriptingLanguage that
despite common believe doesn't only run in WebBrowsers. There have always
been server-side JavaScript interpreters (simply the CommandLine interpreters
run as CGI script processors), some sort of "low-end JavaServerPages scripts"
if you want.

Also it can be useful and is used as embedded ScriptingLanguage in a few
high end ContentManagementSystem''''''s (as module glue and low speed
application logic or so).

Node.js is a good example of server-side JS http://nodejs.org/

This suggests that it may become a common server-side language because developers have to learn it anyhow for the client-side. Having it server-side means mastering fewer languages.
