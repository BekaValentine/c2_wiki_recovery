Most of you have noticed that programming language names tend to fall in several different themes. Here is an attempt to catalogue them.

Languages may be placed in more than one category of appropriate; we will not suffer the LimitsOfHierarchies here. Different versions, such as Fortran77 vs Fortran90, and vendor-specific versions, such as VisualFoo, are valid naming patterns, but aren't very interesting, so they're not being named here.

* SmalltalkLanguage   ''''... a language I now called "Smalltalk"--as in "programming should be a matter of ..." and "children should program in ...". The name was also a reaction against the "IndoEuropean god theory" where systems were named Zeus, Odin, and Thor, and hardly did anything. I figured that "Smalltalk" was so innocuous a label that if it ever did anything nice people would be pleasantly surprised.'''' http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html
