A wiki clone written in Ruby.

There's a more comprehensive page for this wiki clone called InstikiWiki

I tried this when I needed to install a wiki on a Windows NT Lan. I know nothing about Windows NT, or networking or Ruby (I'm a Pythonista) but it was extremely easy to install and works well. I highly recommend it.

Since you mentined Python, have you tried a Python based Wiki (MoinMoin or another one)? And how would you compare these with InStiki? -- DavidLiu

I'm looking for a Python based wiki, I did briefly consider MoinMoin but at the time I didn't choose it. I can't remember why. I think I'll take another look. -- PhilJones
