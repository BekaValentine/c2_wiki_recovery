A white paper on software patterns by JimCoplien and published by Sigs. This volume covers a lot of ground in documenting the progress and promise of our fledgling community. Cope quotes extensively from a wide variety of published patterns. The reader can expect to come to an understanding ''about'' patterns by understanding patterns. Cope expects the reader to make this (somewhat zen) step. He also makes it easy. -- WardCunningham
