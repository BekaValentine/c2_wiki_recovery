A DramaticIdentity, similar to MrGuruCoder.

MrMathematician corrects obviously incorrect mathematical statements.

For example, in DontRepeatYourself: "because the square root of a non-integer is always irrational", the note was added by MrMathematician: "definitely wrong: sqrt(0.01) == 0.1, where 0.01 is non-integer and 0.1 is rational".

''Whereupon that MrMathematician is immediately fired, and replaced with another who notes that sqrt(0.01) is either +0.1 or -0.1. MrProgrammer objects that the sqrt() ''function'' usually is single-valued. MrPedantic notes that the original statement is about pure mathematics, not programming, so the new MrMathematician's point is well-taken. They all go relax over a pint.'' (MrPedantic relaxes?)

Isn't the value of the function sqrt() defined as the positive root (and ''only'' the positive root), even though a solution to an equation involving sqrt may be of any sign?
