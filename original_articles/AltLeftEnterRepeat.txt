'''Alt+Left, Enter, Repeat.'''

The dance some people do when they see the CantOpenWikiDbForUpdate error.

----

A humble plea: if you find yourself doing this, use some sort of random, increasing backoff. For example, I get CantOpenWikiDbForUpdate, I hit AltLeftEnterRepeat, I get the error again; I count to 5 before trying again; I count to 10 before trying yet another time; 20; 40; etc. (The randomness comes from counting, rather than looking at a watch.) -- GeorgePaci

Other keystrokes that might work better than '''Alt+Left, Enter''':

	* '''Ctrl+R, Enter''' -- though this might not work if you have your browser's cache options set to "Check for newer versions of the page: Every time I view the page.". (If you're wondering, the '''Enter''' is to Ok the "Send form data again?" box.)
	* '''Backspace, Enter''' -- though this doesn't work on Netscape.
	* '''F5''' -- Why didn't anyone else think of this? DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork

Using Netscape, after Alt+Left, I have to click on SAVE (Enter is ignored). Ctrl+R, Enter also works.

''Using M$IE, pressing F5 doesn't always work. And if it fails you lose your changes.''

----
I suggest that people list here their favourite key/click sequence for each browser. In that way it might be useful and avoid the blanket statements that turn out not to be true in all cases.

	* !Browse for the Acorn RiscPC StrongARM - right-click the "Save" button. This opens a new window and leaves the edit window open for retries.
