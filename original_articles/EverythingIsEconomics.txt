Everything is, in one way or another, economics. Specifically, GameTheory or FutureDiscounting.

* Economics isn't just money. --AnonymousDonor
** I consider it "resource management". The resource may be money, time, people (employee count), and/or expectations. For most organizations, money is the biggest component, and time the second. Expectations, such as customer/user satisfaction, can be measured via surveys. -t

''I wouldn't go so far to say everything, but for the most part, SoftwareEngineering (SE) is a problem to be optimized in terms of economics, i.e. productivity: the best/most features, usability, future maintainability, and quality using minimal resources and time. Perhaps SE could also be called an "optimization problem". At least this is generally how those paying for software view the problem. Engineers themselves sometimes forget that perspective and slip in GoldPlating either because they are natural perfectionists, feature pack rats, or just trying to fatten their wallet. -t''

Claiming "EverythingIsEconomics" is GoldPlating.

Every object has a relation to economy. Productive or not, efficient or not. A woman choosing to date or marry a poor musician clearly has a priority that a highly paid geek is not going to fulfill.
