In reference to programming, HocusPocus typically describes using an elaborate ritual or incantation (perhaps even WriteOnlyCode) to accomplish something that instinctively should be much more straightforward to code.  May happen due to a programmer's lack of awareness of a situation, or may be a result of a requirement cutting against the GrainOfTheLanguage, triggering GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming.

Switching languages to avoid cutting against the GrainOfTheLanguage may itself be considered HocusPocus depending on the shop, especially if the additional language is used for only one thing.  On the other hand, if a pair of languages is used together to compensate for each other's weaknesses you have AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.
