I currently program primarily in C# in the financial sector.

I like a lot of the practices of ExtremeProgramming, and I enjoy thinking about the development process in general.  I participate in CHAD, Chicago Agile Developers, http://groups.yahoo.com/group/chicago-agile-dev/.

Most of my education was in physics, philosophy, sociology, statistics, psychology, and economics.  Do these sound all over the place?  Well, my interests were united around the theme of the "Micro-Macro problem," i.e. how individual parts make up a whole, or how the whole can "emerge" to be more than just the sum of its parts.  In physics I looked at topics like how bouncing air particles create air pressure and how deterministic rules create chaos.  In philosophy / psychology, I was interested in how the neurons of the brain become the mind.  In sociology / psychology, I was interested in how individual decisions create a society, and how society affects the individual decisions.  Some aspects of the micro-macro problem can be studied with computer simulation, as in ArtificialLife.

Why did I write that all in the past tense?  I am still interested in these themes.
