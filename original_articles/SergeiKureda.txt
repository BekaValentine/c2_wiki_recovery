Hi!

I'm Sergei Kureda, a former Russian nuclear physicist, now a Kiwi (== NewZealand) Java developer, so by joining the Wiki I can drastically increase representation for both countries here. 

In 1991, I found this site, and was fascinated about ExtremeProgramming; since then, I am preaching it to everybody who happens to be in hearing range.

''But this site didn't exist until 1995!!''

Oops. I mean 2001 of course, somewhere in October.

I Introduced as much of XP as possible in our company (it is not easy to do pair programming when you are the only developer :)) and am now looking for chances to run it in bigger scale. 

P.S. I have nothing to do with the Kuredu island resort (Maldives)(http://www.vermillionmaldives.com/resorts/kuredu.htm). Which is a shame.
