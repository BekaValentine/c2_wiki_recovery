ManagementIssues are:
* TimeToMarket 
* CostToDevelop
* MaintenanceOfCode 
* CorrectnessOfCode
* BugFreeSoftware 
* PerformanceOfCode
* ExtendibilityOfCode
* ArchitectureOfCode
* FeatureSet

They are different to EnterpriseIssues as they all have direct relevance to project planning, cost, time and ability to execute a plan.  EnterpriseIssues relate to qualities of software relating to operation of software.  (Failover, redundancy, backup strategy, scalability, performance, etc)

''What is Management meant to mean here? Management of software development? This list is woefully incomplete as a  list of issues concerned with general management - perhaps a rename of this page is in order''
