I was quite impressed by this book. I rank it on par with ExtremeProgrammingExplained. In my view, what XP has done for software engineering, Scrum will do for software project management. After reading this book, and then AgileSoftwareDevelopmentEcosystems, I found a renewed understanding of the underpinnings of AgileMethodologies. I believe these three are the triple-crown of the agile books out there, and I've read a lot of them. The stuff that was missing or vague from my studies of XP have been answered by Scrum, and vice-versa. Interestingly, MikeBeedle promotes his own marriage of the two as 'XBreed'. Personally, I think XBreed is a bit weak in the XP area, but it is interesting nonetheless.
