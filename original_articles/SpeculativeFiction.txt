A term largely equivalent to ScienceFiction, but with a subtly more literary slant; SpeculativeFiction takes in ScienceFiction and fantasy, but also (depending on the weather) AlternateHistory, horror, fairytales and MagicalRealism. Perhaps the most useful definition is that it is any fiction which is not MimeticFiction.
