Hi Wikians,

I stumbled over the WikiWikiWeb by pure chance and my habit of closely reading signatures in uninteresting emails.

Do you know the saying that ''a whole new world pops up before your eyes''?

I am deeply impressed and most curious. And certainly I will get in troubles when my wife catches me at four in the morning browsing through the WikiWikiWeb.

I have fun doing perl scripts and Delphi apps, lately getting into ExtremeProgramming.

My favourite programming language right now is Ruby. Our book came out in March 2002.
