"I'm Bob Stein, a programmer and technical writer by trade. Making useful things is boundlessly rewarding to me. Things that actual people actually use. I stumbled onto this fact quite unintentionally. I want to spend more time with customers and collaborators and less time in all other working relationships. Scott Adams's second most important contribution to civilization I suggest (after Dilbert) is the concept of one-off. The gist: direct is better than indirect. Helping a living, breathing customer is better than writing a memo about helping customers."
