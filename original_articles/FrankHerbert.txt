Twentieth century author noted for the widely acclaimed novel ''Dune''.

Perhaps he was failed by his editors, who oversaw five sequels that were not as widely acclaimed.  His son (Brian Herbert) is collaborating with Kevin J. Anderson on a set of ''Dune'' prequels (''House Atriedes'' and others).

His other novels (not sequels of ''Dune'') include ''The Green Brain'', ''The White Plague'', ''Whipping Star'' and ''The Dosadi Experiment'' (the Jorj X. Mc''''''Kie series) and ''The Heaven Makers''.  In 1980 he collaborated with Max Barnard on "Without Me, You're Nothing" (ISBN:0671412876), a how-to book about home computers. (It included the so-called PROGRAMAP, a jazzed-up flowchart notation.) From the cover: "Frank Herbert, the man famous for creating prophetical fictional futures, such as the classic Dune, tells us about the real future that is NOW and tells us why the machines are not taking over."
