Many places have seemingly odd conventions and practices in place. When you ask, they just say ThatIsJustTheWayWeDoThings or use vague ManagementSpeak to wave it off. Nobody seems interested in questioning or investigating such practices. I have generally found it better (career-wise) to just shut up and go with the flow after a passing inquiry brings little. But the geek in me wants to understand the reasoning and "fix" things.
