From the ALAN manual introduction:
	 :	"Alan is a special purpose computer language specifically designed to make it very easy to create ... adventure games with little programming skills."
  
ALAN is the creation of ThomasNilsson, who also maintains the ALAN homepage (http://welcome.to/alan-if).

ALAN tries to keep a natural language look, so doesn't use typical programming constructs such as brackets or other complicated visual punctuation. It is a bit easier for non-programmers to understand and use than some of the other, more fully developed InteractiveFiction programming languages.  

Interesting enhancements to the language include StephenGriffith's tutorial (http://welcome.to/alan-if/tutor/contents.htm), his Windows console for writing in ALAN (ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/programming/alan/executables/adew.exe), and his enhancement of the standard library (http://w1.132.telia.com/~u13207378/alan/download/alanlib031.zip).
