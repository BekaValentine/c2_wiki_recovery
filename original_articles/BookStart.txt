BookStart is the thought that books can be used to start a discussion or interaction. Several people read the same or related books and use the information they gain as a starting point. The groups are sometimes called ReadersGroups.

I suggest people could put a link to BookStart on the pages of books which have helped them and say why. -- JohnFletcher

We could also have BookShelf as a tag for books which people keep on the book shelf for reference.  -- JohnFletcher
