AolServer, the Web-server program used by (surprise!) AmericaOnline. AolServer was originally NaviServer, published by NaviSoft and licensed for $5K per machine; AOL liked the server so much that they literally bought the company. After the purchase, AOL didn't want to be in the software-sales business, and they didn't want to annoy NaviSoft's other customers, so they just gave away the binary. Then PhilipGreenspun convinced one of AOL's executives that making the program open-source would be in the company's best interest.

AolServer is a multi-threaded server, allowing for dynamically-loaded libraries to extend the server.  It has Tcl interpreters embedded, and includes AolServer Dynamic Pages, a technology like ActiveServerPages, for quick development of quick-responding dynamic websites.

AolServer is used in production by AmericaOnline, among others.
