WirelessDevices are computing devices (e.g. SmartPhone''''''s using WindowsMobile, microchip based RadioFrequencyIdTags [RFID tags] and other MobileInformationDevices) that can form part of an ICT (InformationAndCommunicationTechnology) solution to serve a business need.

----
RadioFrequencyIdTags (RFID tags, commonly used as part of ElectronicProductCode(EPC)) are hot due to their role in enabling SupplyChainManagement solutions. An FAQ at http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/207%23anchor serve to inform consumers about the technology and its use.

'''WirelessSecurity'''

BlackBerry''''''s aside, lack of adequate security for WirelessDevices can be a stumbling block to widespread adoption of WirelessDevices. See http://www.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=52601030

'''WebServices and WirelessDevices'''

Beyond WirelessSecurity, WebServices involving WirelessDevices have to consider mechanisms for dealing with discontinuity (services coming in and dropping out), bandwidth considerations, and challenges that is related to the limitations with the physical resources on the WirelessDevices. See http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/tip/1,289483,sid26_gci1085478,00.html

An organization involved in related protocols is OpenMobileAlliance.

'''Human behavior tracking by machines'''

''Rental car''

Foreigner who rented cars in US were reported by reader digest (Aug04 issue) caught offguard by heavy fines for speeding, recorded by WirelessDevices in newer autos that are linked to GPS. The same type of devices were said to be used in at least one case of stalking individuals. 

"Innovative use" of RadioFrequencyIdTags have also been mentioned. It appears that "privacy legislation" has not caught up with the advances in technology.

''Implantable chip''

Veri Chip is a rice sized chip that is GPS linked, costs U$200 (in 2002 article). It has now been reported to be implemented on some proponents of this technology. See http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/1114279610

'''GlobalPositioningSystem considerations'''

GlobalPositioningSystem may not work well without line-of-sight to the satellites (e.g. in concrete jungle of cities). If a need exists for locating the WirelessDevices then probably "WiFi Positioning System" is the solution to the problem.

Another consideration for application designers is that GPS units drain energy, which is a precious commodity on WirelessDevices.

'''ProgrammingOnHandHelds'''

At mid 05, the SoftwareDevelopment field for EnterpriseApplication''''''s will look interesting.  Key players include:
* Phone companies such as Nokia has biggest installed base and they prefer JavaPlatform
* MS has the most development resources on WindowsMobile (DotNetCompactFramework) based solutions
* IBM has most mature server based Enterprise solutions that use JavaMicroEdition
* OpenSource niche players with LinuxOs preferences.
* PalmOs solutions for things like the Treo phone.

We will need portable hard disk on these devices to store all the software stack required by all these different solutions :)

'''Not confined to SupplyChainManagement / WirelessDevicesEnterpriseComputing concerns'''

Companies, those in Australia, are finding "telemetry" applications achieve BusinessValue over older technologies (e.g. cable, short range radio networks). Low data volume (but frequent communication) needs are being addressed effectively by cellular based data services like GeneralPacketRadioService. Innovation in this area can lead to reduced travel needs of support staff. See http://www.ferret.com.au/articles/8e/0c03558e.asp
