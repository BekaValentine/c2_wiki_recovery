''Strategy for Front Burner Reminders, - Before you forget a notion, WriteItDown '' DonaldNoyes.ThinkingOutloud.20121226

You are wiser than your immediate thinking suggests. It needs reminders, handles, triggers and/or mental incentives. Your awareness in the moment is concentrated upon survival instincts and the matters at hand. You have much more wisdom and knowledge, a deep reservoir of knowledge within you, which you can recall, given stimulus and a little time.

One way of connecting to what I call "OriginatingThoughts", is to MakeNotes. Notes are distillations of things you have thought about and can continue developing thought about. You should make notes about things you think worthy of additional contemplation or action. The act of writing something down, or typing it in a document artifact, will enhance through additional sensations the mental concept you are originating in your mind and connecting through the process of thought into a concept, notion or idea. These can be and lead to mental powers of invention, innovation, planning and organization. You can consciously construct in your mind structures and interconnections which can relate and connect to all of your other thoughts. 

You may find such a physical process of creating notes to be a good use of time and an activity to be entered into at any time. With the present day electronic devices and/or a small notepad and pencil, you can MakeNotes almost anywhere and anytime. 

Try it! You will find it is another of many things about which you can say ItWorks!

I want to echo this from a long and interesting experience, including many times when I need to do things again and didn't make enough notes, to times when I make notes and find that I already had made notes in the past. One of the most important things is to keep up to date with the systems for making notes. I tend to use something for a while and then move onto something else. Today I went back to an old system I last used a year ago and it had stopped working because of updates to one of the software components which I had not kept up with. I have it working more or less, but it is an important lesson - to make sure that everything is accessible into the future. -- JohnFletcher
