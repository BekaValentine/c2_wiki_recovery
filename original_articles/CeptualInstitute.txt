Dear Fridemar,	I didn't receive your message by email routing (will look to make sure my 'mailto:' is working properly.  Found you by back tracking my url references report.

Thank you for your kind words.  Your Wiki site looks very good.  I like the full cross-interactiveness.  Am just unsure how Ceptual Institute can participate with you.  PLease tell me more. Who is participating and so on. Am intrigued.	Jamie Rose

Dear Jamie (initiator and owner of the inspiring http://www.ceptualinstitute.com), I'm only a guest of this '''wonderful collaboration site''', called WardsWiki. WardCunningham is the genius, who invented Wiki, made his initial software freely available and hosts this site. PeopleIndex gives a sketchy overview about the different people who collaborate here. A good introduction into this WikiForum ( of over 8000 pages ) is WelcomeVisitors. I put this answer as a CritLink''''''ed public letter annotation on your site and leave a pointer here at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CeptualInstitute to make it easier for friendly and collaborative people to find your site and WardsWiki. -- FridemarPache
