The Smalltalk Apprentice Program (STAP) is a project-focused 
total immersion training program.  It's designed to 
accelerate Smalltalk teams by integrating project 
development with customized training.

Each STAP team consists of one KSC Mentor for every two to 
three client developers. In a STAP we will teach everything
from basic OOA&D concepts through detailed implementation
techniques.

Lately, we've begun using DesignPatterns as a tool to help 
teach our STAP Apprentices good design techniques.
