A search for each of these words against the search database available on 7 March 2000 gave these results

	* "pattern": 1376 hits/ 378 page titles (5.0%)
	* "Wiki": 1408 hits/ 279 page titles (3.7%)
	* "XP": 856 hits/200 page titles (2.7%)
	* "ExtremeProgramming: 10 hits/ 83 page titles (1.1%)

The database contained 7546 pages.

It's interesting to compare those last two separately, rather than combine them. 

Please append to, rather than modifying these figures, so that we can compare against them at some later date. My guess would be that in, say, a years time, the XP pages will be a lower proportion of the total, since the WikiMind will have drifted elsewhere. --KeithBraithwaite

'''May 12th, 2001'''
	* "pattern": 2130 hits/ 479 page titles (3.13%)
	* "Wiki":  ?? hits/727 page titles (4.76%)
	* "XP":  ?? hits/406 page titles (2.66%)
	* "ExtremeProgramming": ?? hits/145  page titles (0.94% of total)

The database contained 15,289 pages. Searching for word hits didn't work too well, as the size of the resulting pages caused network dropouts.

The database grew by 102%. ExtremeProgramming grew by 75%. XP grew by 104%, Wiki grew by 161%, and patterns by 27%.

----
It is a part of usual LanguageOrientedProgramming practice to look at the words that are used in a system. I had postponed this for a while (being new to the Wiki), but now I did.

The list at the end of this page is the first part of the output of processing wikiList.

If you do this on a software API you usually find something interesting. Special words, redundant words, wrong words ... but at first sight, I didn't find anything of significance.

Of course, if you look at the first few lines (strip some simple words) you find what this Wiki is about: Wiki Programming Patterns Extreme.

But when I read on, I felt like a shaman priest having thrown a bag of bones to read the present and the future:

	* Is * Xp * In * Pattern * Software ?
	* Software * For * Java * Language
	* Design * Object * Test 
	* Do * Group * Project

to name just a few. Just try it! Perhaps some expert can read and interpret this. I'm unable to. -- HelmutLeitner

''If you play a little loose, the very first few words sum up Wiki pretty well:''
	* The * Wiki * Of * Programming * And * Patterns

On a similar note, I am trying to divise a way to determine the "centres" of a wiki (or things similar to wikis). My best attempt so far has been http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ShortestPathPages. -- SunirShah

As one might expect, the number of occurrences of a given WikiWord per WikiPage obeys a PowerLaw. This hypothesis was tested in March 2003 with 724 pages containing the WikiWord "Unit''''''Test". A LogLog plot of the count of the pages with a given number of occurrences of "Unit''''''Test" was created. The values are linear for the first two orders of magnitude, though they diverge from the ideal value as the number of occurrences of "Unit''''''Test" per page increases:

http://www.thorgolucky.com/~cheesebrains/UnitTest.frequency.gif

Linear regression yields ''r''-squared = 0.936.

A second test with "Extreme''''''Programming" and 1,189 BackLink''''''ed pages gave a similar result, with ''r''-squared = 0.950:

http://www.thorgolucky.com/~cheesebrains/ExtremeProgramming.frequency.gif

Binning the data increases ''r''-squared to 0.99+.
