I'm looking for someone to try VirtualPairProgramming with me via Emacs multi-display, and speakfreely voicechat, using the PythonLanguage. SpeakFreely is not linux specific, but Emacs on win32 is rare.

Will the Emacs multi-display work on NT?  I thought it needed X-Windows.  Anyhow, I have NT, emacs, and know enough Python to be dangerous.  Let's talk. --WayneConrad
