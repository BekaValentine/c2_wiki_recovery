Was member of founding team at Medscape (http://www.medscape.com/). Built the tech team (development, ops, support, etc.). Then spent a couple years at another startup called AxiomLegal which is kinda a distributed corporate legal firm. Now independent, starting a hosting ASP for WikiWeblog handling - http://www.wikilogs.com/ - and an ASP for private team wiki collaboration - http://www.teamflux.com/.

Jun'03 - enjoying DavidSchmaltz's first book, TheBlindMenAndTheElephant.
'''Thoughts (rough) on InterWiki, WikiPortal, MultiWiki, etc.''' (Apr11'01) (and see my more recent page at http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/WikiWeb)

(I use ZWiki, not that it matters much, though it's reminding me of varying tagging styles across WikiClones...)

I want to run multiple wikis, many of them personal/private, so that 

	* I can control namespaces of multiple projects (e.g. each ProjectWiki has a UserStories page, without having to resort to Project1UserStores, Projects2UserStories, etc.)

	* Searches and RecentChanges have a narrow scope/context

	* Different wikis can have different access rights

I also want to be an active member of multiple other wiki-based communities

	* want to track RecentChanges in each, and jumping from one to the other is a bit of a pain

	* being able to track just a subset of pages for changes would be even cooler

	* being able (occasionally) to search across a particular set of Wikis would be good, too. Partial credit for at least being able to search on WikiNames, not page contents.

When I'm writing a WikiPage, I'd like to be able to link to a WikiPage outside the current WikiSpace

	* most often, I'll be in one of "my" Wikis, and want to link to another of my Wikis

	* but sometimes I'll want to link across hosting environments

	* and of course the point is that I want to be able to do that in a way as close as possible in style to a local WikiName reference. The other extreme of course is just using the plain old fully-qualified URL for the non-local WikiPage.
