KwikiKwiki is easy and well-structured.

Billed as "A Quickie Wiki that's not too Tricky", this is a perl module installed via cpan that includes a setup script to get things going easily.  From the manual:

	 :	Kwiki focuses on simplicity and extensibility. You can create a new kwiki website with a single command. The module has no prerequisite modules, except the ones that ship with Perl. It doesn't require a database backend, although it could be made to use one. The default kwiki behaviour is fairly full featured, and includes support for html tables. Any behaviour of the kwiki can be customized, without much trouble.
