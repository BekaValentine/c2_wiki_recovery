I am "Chief Scientist" of Digital Focus (http://www.digitalfocus.com), a consultancy in Northern VA.  We build custom enterprise applications for a variety of clients, and have recently added agile methodology consulting to our formal offerings.

I spearheaded the first large-scale XP project at Digital Focus in early 2001.  This was a real-time web-based auction system that continues to process billions of dollars worth of trades annually. Since then I have led and/or coached over 10-15 different XP/agile teams on projects of varying sizes. 

I coordinate the dissemination and adoption of agile methodologies by both internal and client development teams.  All of our internal projects at Digital Focus (Java and .NET) use XP as their standard methodology.  I have also spent quite a bit of time on-site at Fannie Mae, helping several of their development teams in different IT organizations to adopt and customize XP.  Support for XP/agile in these organizations now goes all the way up to the VP level.

I just spent four months helping another worldwide consulting organization (with over 1000 employees in India) develop an agile-style methodology for use on all of their projects.  I enjoyed learning more about how "distributed agile" can and can not work.  

My job & life has never been more fun and less stressful since I started developing using XP.  I now truly feel like a software "professional" that can always deliver value to clients. 

I always enjoy getting together with anyone in the area who is practicing/implementing XP. I also participate in the WashingtonDcAreaXpUsersGroup when I have time.
