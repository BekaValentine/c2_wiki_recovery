I think this is a rather uninspired site.  The information seemed chaotic and disorganized.

''I admit that when I first came across Wiki I didn't get it. This was partly because I expected it to be more of a repository of patterns and partly because of the probably-common reaction of "You can just edit any page? No, that can't be possible!" But I don't recall being really pissed off! Good thing, too, because it really is fun! --KielHodges''

At first I was pissed by what N. Ulander had written, but he raises a good point.  People's reaction to Wiki will be shaped by what they expect to find here.  I didn't expect anything, and was pleasantly surprised.  I would hate to come to Wiki looking something along the lines of a FAQ.  And my secret confession is that I really dislike the name "Wiki."  I wish they had come up with something cooler, like HyperText or JaVa !!

I'm sure Neal is long gone by now, so he won't mind us writing on his page.  I have to admit, the first time I saw wiki, I didn't like it.  The idea of every page being open was disturbing.  I really didn't like the idea of my writing being changed by others... that if I took the time to write something, someone could come along and undo it.  However,... after a few more years of using a very closed authentication-based online collaborative tool to support a community, I turned to wiki in desperation to offload the administrative responsibilities of community leader onto the members of the community.  I had no other mechanism available that could come close to what I was looking for.  Since then, I've become a BIG fan.  I've tried 10 or so different engines and have succeeded with 4 (using them for more than just a little while).  Nothing beats wiki for open information sharing and quick access to online presense for a project.  -- MattSimpson
