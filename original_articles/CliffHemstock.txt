I am a Business Analyst with a Global Manufacture of Computer Peripherals, and have spent 40 years in the programming community most of it doing what one Magazine editor misinterpreted as "Re-Writing" programs.

We are currently evaluating using Wiki over the "established" document management systems such as FileNet etc.

Very Best Regards,
