I'm a software engineer located in Charlotte, North Carolina, working for Wachovia (http://www.wachovia.com/).  After a stint in the DoIt team, where I had the benefit of working with JamesCollins, LarryDeane, NickMaiorana, DanaEdwards, and CarlParziale, I've moved on to build a usability and engineering practice with General (Retail) Bank's technology group.
