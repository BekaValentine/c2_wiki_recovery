I am new to WikiWiki. I am a student in the ITC program at The Graduate Center at Marlboro College http://www.gradcenter.marlboro.edu. It is a completely online graduate certificate program about teaching on the Internet.

My current class is called Refining Online Learning Environments. This is the second "environment" we are exploring. I find it overwhelming. Our first environment was YahooGroups, which most of us had used before.
My classmates are PamCarr, BruceHolloway, and GregHaas. Please check out their pages, too!

I am the School Librarian at Hampton Academy in New Hampshire (US). http://www.sau21.k12.nh.us/HAJH
