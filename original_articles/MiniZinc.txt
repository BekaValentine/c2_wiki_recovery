----
* Relationship: ConstraintProgramming

* Description: MiniZinc is a medium-level ConstraintModellingLanguage. 
* It is 
** high-level enough to express most constraint problems easily, 
** low-level enough that it can be mapped onto existing solvers easily and consistently
** a subset of the higher-level language Zinc. 
** hoped that it will be adopted as a standard by the ConstraintProgramming community
