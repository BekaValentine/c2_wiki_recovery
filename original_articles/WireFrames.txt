Wireframes are a skeletal prototype of an application. Each page in the application is represented as a page in the wireframe. The wireframe is all text and includes only two sections: the RESPONSIBILITIES tell what the page does. The LINKS are the exit points from that application page to another. They correspond directly with the RESPONSIBILITIES and XFAs of FuseDoc''''''s.
