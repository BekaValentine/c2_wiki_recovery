One of the ExtremeRoles.

The Tracker:

	* Calculates the ProjectVelocity, in RealTime
	* Asks each ExtremeProgrammer how the UserStories are doing, once or twice per week
	* Listens to the answer
	* Takes action if things seem to be wandering off track
		* Suggest a CRC session 
		* Set up a meeting with TheCustomer
		* Ask TheCoach or another XpProgrammer to help.

The role of Tracker can be made easier with an AutoTracker.

''Which is not necessarily the same as better.  Be wary of losing the human touch of a human Tracker.''
