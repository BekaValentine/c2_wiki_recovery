Simultaneous operations which may or may not share data, events, and resources. Typically used to describe computing systems in which multiple tasks are operating off of the same processing core; the tasks are assigned time slices, priority, or operation types to get them to all play together.

This term is very often misused in business and society by people who are trying to "do two things at once" without understanding the basic nature of a multi-tasking environment. Thusly, we get the kind of discussion below:
	 :	There seems to be a dichotomy pattern as yet unnamed: Getting the machines to work ''for'' you or getting them to work ''with'' you.
	 :	Best example: a WordProcessor vs a SpellingChecker. One helps you write, the other checks what you wrote.
	 :	We all do multi-tasking like driving while talking on the cell phone or coding and compiling.
None of this stuff has anything to do with multi-tasking, of course, but that's the kind of drivel you get when buzzword-hungry business types appropriate technical terms for their own use. Oh, well.
