PerlFivePorters (p5p) is the group of people responsible for maintaining Perl 5 and porting it to different platforms.

Often known for its high traffic and occasional flamewars (now much less common than previously), it is however *the* place to be to keep your finger on the pulse of where Perl is at and where it's heading.
