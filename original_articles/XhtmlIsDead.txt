XHTML is dead.

This is not due to a failure to implement the standard but due to the fact the standard was misdesigned.

See that XHTML's 1.0's claimed HTML 4.01 compatability was based on pure fiction as <br/> would actually place an angle bracket on the output page if parsed by a strict HTML 4.01 parser.

But that is not what killed XHTML.

XHTML is dead because HTML 5 is inherited directly from HTML 4.01 and does not use an XML parser.

''Another issue: <script> print a & b </script>.''

''Due to the generation of kiddie programmers raised belting out thousands of lines of HTML in Notepad, a web browser does not have the luxury of expecting all scripted ampersands '''&''' to be escaped '''&amp;'''. Hence, ampersands must NOT be escaped, because the browser must not misinterpret them and double-escape them.''

''Hence, HTML and XML remain sibling languages, never to merge.''
