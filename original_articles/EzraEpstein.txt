I went from simulating fluid dynamics to O-O in one leap: fresh out of grad school, I found myself developing SchemaE for the NeXT in 1992.  I've been FightingTheGoodFight (O-O design and development) off-and-on ever since.

When reflection was added to Java, I became interested in that language.

I'm now amused by how much "dynamism" and dynamic languages are in the news.  Only had to wait about 14 years for the strict typing to finally be shown up for the excessive restriction it tends to be.
