Office buildings tend to have huge areas which are sectioned off into smaller areas by use of FuzzyPartitions which form the walls of the cubicle. These cubicles are generally designed for use by a single employee. The cubicle will generally contain a desk, chair, telephone, and computer. There cubicle walls are generally 4 to 6 feet high and with no door.

Some claimed benefits:
	* Modular design allows for new floor plans to be easily implemented. (Has anyone actually seen this happen?) Yes, I witnessed several reoganizational shufflings. Having solid walls did not stop the reorganization to cause the redesign of several rooms into offices.
	* Small amount of privacy afforded to workers (though phone calls and other activities are still open to witnesses.)
	* Allows for easier communication between workers.

Some claimed problems:
	* Noise easily distracts and breaks concentration. Programmers need concentration to work.
	* Allows for easier communication between workers (see noise.)
	* Cubicle walls block natural light. Lack of natural light may contribute to depression.
	* Cubicle size and location may become the subject of envy, rumours and politicking.

As cubicles offer a uniform environment, some offices pale at the idea of employees embelishing their cubicles with their individual tastes and employ FurniturePolice to keep things like decoration of the cubicles to a minimum or within corporate specs.
