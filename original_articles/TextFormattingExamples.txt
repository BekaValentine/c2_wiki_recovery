	1. A numbered list, which starts with a tab and any digit, is automatically numbered.
	0  It is also called an ordered list.

	* The various kinds of lists can be nested by using extra tabs.
	2. Also this way:
		1. Nested
		2. Nested too
		3. Yet one more
		4. And another one
		5. This is not another one
	6. But this one is

	* Also the other way round:
		1. Item 1
		1. ''Item 2''
		3. 3 metI

	* And like this.
		* Nested item.
			* Even more nested item.

	 :	This is a block quote. It looks like <TAB><SPACE>:<TAB>text. This is because it really is a term: definition block with the term being a <SPACE>.

<TAB><SPACE>:<TAB>text also seems to be the best format for poems (copy-and-paste from GreatPoemsList):

'''William Shakespeare''', ''The Tempest'' act IV scene 1.

If you indent your paragraph, it will be monospaced and won't line-wrap. This is a very common mistake, but trying to rectify it by inserting new lines into the paragraph doesn't work.

Example:
      Our [many] revels now are ended. These our actors,
      As I foretold you, were all spirits and
      Are melted into air, into thin air:
      And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
 
      The cloud-capp'd towers, '''the gorgeous palaces''',
      The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
      Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve
      And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
      Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
      As dreams are made on, and our little life
      Is rounded with a sleep.

Monospaced text is also handy for showing tables (since HtmlTables are not supported). However, be wary of TabMunging.
