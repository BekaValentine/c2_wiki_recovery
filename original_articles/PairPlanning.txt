Like PairProgramming, using a fellow human to bounce ideas off of while coming up with a plan.  This technique is not, as far as I know, acknowledged by name any where.  It is, however, something I've done for a long time; I just didn't know what name to give it until someone mentioned it in conjunction with LetYourLogsBecomeYourPlans.

Steps I follow when PairPlanning:
* Define the problem or solution
* Find a person to pair with
* Agree on the definition of the problem or solution
* Brainstorm an approach

Some things to think about:
* Like with PairProgramming, one person is driving at a time; but, that responsibility can be turned over to the other at any time
* No arguments: refine ideas, don't debate them
* Don't redefine the problem/solution after its been agreed on, unless both of you agree that your definition is broken first
* Focus on approach, not implementation

There's definitely more, but I think many people do a lot of this by nature.  Perhaps formalizing it would help with productivity and communication within a team or ProjectTeam.
