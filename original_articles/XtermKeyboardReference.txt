Who needs an Xterm keyboard reference? Since virtual terminals are a bit different than the actual terminal, I'd like to have an Xterm specific keyboard reference handy. (Since Xterm is installed as default in many window managers.) So for now we're making an incomplete keyboard/mouse guide to Xterm here on wiki

This can depend which "mode" you are in if using bash. 
i.e. set -o Vi or set -o Emacs

  Keys                         Action
  ----                         ------ 
  Shift-Insert                 Copy selection to cursor
  Shift-Delete                 Doesn't work like it should :(
  Delete                       Deletes proceding character
  Backspace                    Deletes preceding character 
  Ctrl-C                       Cancels or exits current command
  Ctrl-Z                       Stops current command (sends to background). 
                               Bring back with "fg" command
  Arrow-Up                     Toggle previous commands (history back) 
  Arrow-Down                   Toggle previous commands (history forward)   

  Mouse
  -----
  Middle-Click                 Copy selection to cursor
  Left-Click                   Hold and Drag to select text
  Right-Click                  Continue selection already started
  Ctrl-Click                   Brings up special Xterm customization menus 
  (Right,Left,Center)          (in some Xterm's, all Xterms?)

''Comments:''
I wish tools kept similar keyboard layouts. When I use midnight commander, in the Edit(F4) mode, you use F5 to copy text. To me, what is logical is still Ctrl-C since C stands for copy.  In Xterm, you use Shift-Insert or middle click. Again, it would be useful to have a Ctrl-C. Maybe I will adjust bash to respond to Ctrl-C differently. 

I just don't have time to be converting things in my brain or memorizing different keyboard layouts.  I have too many other things to program or memorize as it is :)

Ctrl-C is more logical than Shift-Insert I find.. and F5 always triggers my mind as "copy files" instead of copy text. 

On that note, I'm going to start editing/hacking some linux tools to have standard keyboarding between each other. I think I'm going to start off with making a custom Xterm and MidnightCommander. Then maybe even editing Bash itself, or other shells. I'd like in a vitual terminal, to be able to select text like I do in a text editor with Shift-Arrow and be able to cut text like in a text editor.

i'm still not too happy with Emacs or Vi modes of Bash.. because they aren't exactly like true vi or emacs modes really. You still have some differencs and lacking abilities. 

I find a linear, direct, and logical approach to keyboarding  works best for me. Arrow keys are arrow keys, even though the arrow keys are farther away. My brain likes it that way, until we have some ThumbButton arrows which are easier to access. I like Ctrl-C and Ctrl-X because they are logical. F5 (MidnightCommander editing) is also kind of way up there at the top, so I'm not too fond of that right now. For files, F5 is fine.

To get the ALT key to act like a normal terminal would use CTRL-LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON then select "Alt sends Escape". Also take off "Alt/Numlock modifiers". Hrm so this solves a lot of problems
