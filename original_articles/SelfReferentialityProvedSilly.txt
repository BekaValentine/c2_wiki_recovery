'''Proof:'''

	* Assume that SelfReferentialityProvedSilly is not proved.
	* Then this page would just be silly.
	* Which is a contradiction.
	* Therefore SelfReferentialityProvedSilly. QED.

'''Counter Proof:'''

	* Assume that SelfReferentialityProvedSilly is proved.
	* Therefore this page is not silly. Or at least no sillier than ZenoDiscussion.
	* Which is a contradiction.
	* Therefore not SelfReferentialityProvedSilly. QED.

'''Para Proof:'''

	* Assume the above two proofs are both correct.
	* That was easy. QED.
