It's an english idiom... but maybe someone has a manager's anecdote that fits in and could entertain us. :)

----

''A manager I knew was into sadism, necrophilia and bestiality, but he gave it up because it was flogging a dead horse.''

AKA "''Deceased equine flagellation''"

I think the British would say ''Flogging a dead horse''?
