MonoLogue is a bit of an ugly name. I am using this as a hook because it is an unfilled link on DonaldNoyesTalk.

There is an interesting discussion going on here about the concept of a TalkPage.

There has been recent developent of this but that was not the first suggestion.

On DonaldNoyesTalk there is a reference to WikiPatterns which has the following entry added in 2013:

* ''CreateTalkPages: A page should be curated by its creator towards perfection. Discussion is separate.''

All of the other things on WikiPatterns are in the form of suggestions. This entry contains the word ''should'' and the implication that discussion should be on a separate page. I don't think that has been the usual practice on this wiki. Often comments are made on the page about, for example, a book. Some may be factual, e.g. there is a new edition, and others may be opinions.

My suggestion is that we are flexible here and not too rigid.
