If it's smart business for companies to outsource time consuming functions that they're not especially good at, does it make sense for individuals to do the same?

I'm a single programmer. It occurs to me that it might be a smart move for me to use a laundry service, hire a housekeeper, and have groceries delivered. With the time I save, I could grow my business, i.e., take on a small consulting project each month; thus, I'd spend more time doing challenging work, less time doing tedious chores, and expand my resum√© all at the same time.

What do you think, sirs and madammes? Is this lunacy, or is it smart time management?

''Charles Givens said as much in a book a few years back. I don't buy most of what he advises, but his logic was correct -- '''if''' you wisely invest the time you save by doing so.''

It is if you make a net profit. I'll leave it to you to define profit.

You win by getting more work time. You lose breaks and opportunity for flirting with the grocery dealer. I personally can think well when doing the washing. I would never let someone else do it. I like the breaks RealLife gives me.

''Use a laundry service''

Doing laundry only takes a few minutes -- throw it in the washer, go back to the computer, when it's done throw it in the dryer, go back to the computer. The time-consuming part is hanging it all up in the closet once it's dry.

''Hire a housekeeper''

Or just don't clean house. ;-)

You hang your clothes in a closet? What kind of geek are you? Just leave them in the dryer. If you're an especially fastidious geek, tumble them before dressing. -- EricHodges

If you telecommute, you don't even need clothes at all. Well, maybe a bathrobe or boxers or pajamas, if you like having the blinds open. -- JoeWeaver
