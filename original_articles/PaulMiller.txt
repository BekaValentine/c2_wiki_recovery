I'm currently a GradStudent in math with an interest in ComputerScience and SoftwareDevelopment.  I run a blog called code.py at http://pythonista.wordpress.com which is primarily about (you guessed it) Python.

If anybody has any questions, comments, anything (except death threats) for me, please leave them here.
