The AllPurposeToolKit, so far, as developed by Jim Allen and myself, consists of the following:

	* DuctTape
	* Baking soda
	* Vinegar
	* WD-40
	* Swiss Army Knife
	* Pliers
	* Hammer
	* a coat hanger
	* a packet of Post-It(TM) Notes
	* pencil with eraser
	* Keychain tape measure
	* Keychain ultrabright white LED flashlight
	* $20 bill (just in case)

Is there anything else a person needs?  Even better, is there a way to replace any two items with another item that works as well as both? -- RjLesch

''If you get a hefty pair of pliers, you don't need the hammer.''

But wait--the hammer can ''also'' be used as a (somewhat primitive) screwdriver.

''Seriously kids, hammering with a hardened steel pliers or a file will shatter it, and even a cheap case-hardened tool can bury a painful chip fragment into your eye or hand. Better add a pair of goggles to the toolkit.'' --Safe''''''TMan

If you get an extra large leatherman, you can use it to replace the knife, pliers, and  hammer.

''Some leatherman tools also have a ruler built into the case, so you wouldn't need a tape measure.''

What is the baking soda and vinegar used for other than impressing little kids?

''Both are great general-purpose cleaners, though not really substitutable for each other.  And, as you pointed out, if you need to generate a chemical reaction to increase pressure or something, you can mix the two. -- RjLesch''

You should not forget a nice big towel. Preferably soaked with some nutrition liquid!
At least that's what the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy tells you.		--	TG

Don't forget to add a DVD boxed set of all MacGyver episodes! :-)

A way to start a fire.  One interesting way is to put steel wool across a 9V battery (you might want to put a bit of duct tape across the battery terminals to store the kit, unless you want it to ignite itself!)

Assuming you could find a stick and a rock, you could make a hammer from them + the Duct tape.

Boy scout shops sell a plastic handle with a pencil width inch-long rod of magnesium sticking out of it, if scrape your knife along it sideways, it makes lovely sparks. Also, a leatherman is an amazingly useful tool.

You seem to have left out the multimeter, crescent wrench, and condom.
