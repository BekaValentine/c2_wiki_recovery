An ObjectCapabilityOperatingSystem project:

''Coyotos is a secure, microkernel-based operating system that builds on the ideas and experiences of the EROS project. Much of the code developed for EROS [ErosOs] will migrate directly to Coyotos.''

http://www.coyotos.org/

No code yet; the project was announced in late 2004.

The most controversial decision in the design of Coyotos so far is that unlike ErosOs, it will ''not'' support TransparentPersistence. See <http://www.coyotos.org/pipermail/coyotos-dev/2005-January/thread.html> for discussion.

Coyotos will be written in BitCee.
