A subset of SimpleInventions. Bootstrap technology refers to those techniques, ideas, practices and inventions, tangible and intangible, which do not require a pre-existing industrial, technological nor technical base to develop, but rather are essential to the development of just such an advanced industrial, technological and technical base.

For example, though paper clips are simple inventions, they can't be part of a bootstrap technology base since they require precision wire extrusion which belongs to advanced metalsmithing.

The bootstrap technology found in the minds of every advanced human being is so extensive that civilization could be completely rebuilt in a matter of a couple of centuries. Not on our planet though since Earth has long since exhausted all easily accessible resources.

Here is just part of the bootstrap technology found in every one of a billion human minds:
