'''Wiki page as email'''

An original contributor takes an HTML copy of his/her contribution and sends it as email for different reasons.

'''Reasons:'''

* It's quite handy to write a public letter to a friend or an author to invite them to a WikiForum.
* It's less work for the originator of the public letter or contribution to do two things with one effort ''(two flies with one clap)''.
* It's less effort for the addressee; s/he need not answer, thus signalling (at moment) no interest/time. When they answer in public, then they can save time by avoiding answering multiple individual emails.
* Sender and addressee get more context with less effort.

'''Note:'''

It is crucial that a copy of the original text is sent as email, because a ''link only email'' could lead the invited person to a deleted page or worse.

Each WikiForum could be enriched instantly with a ''page specific email notification'' of changes. The now-defunct CritLink offered this service.

''Use sparingly -- AnonymousDonor''

Several wiki now have a "please email me when this one specific page changes" feature:

* MoinMoin
* MediaWiki
* TikiWiki
* MassMind
* ... and probably others I'm not as familiar with.

The one I find most annoying just sends an email that says "This page changed" and the URI. The one I like best sends an email that says "This page changed", the URI, and the "diff" showing what exactly changed.

'''Wiki page as HTML'''

An original contributor takes an HTML copy of his/her contribution and places it on their own Web site for different reasons.

'''Reasons:'''
* ''Public BackUp'' of the original contribution 
* ''Taking Individual Responsibility'' for statements or links
* ''Workload Reduction'' for the WikiForum, allowing less problematic access of external services, such as
** searching
** archiving
** voting
** public annotating
* ''Public Relations'' (for Wikiforums, one of the best concepts of the Web)

''Not recommended -- AnonymousDonor''
----
