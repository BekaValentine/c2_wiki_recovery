From the web site:
	 :	Kali Scheme is a distributed implementation of the SchemeLanguage that permits efficient transmission of higher-order objects such as closures and continuations. The integration of distributed communication facilities within a higher-order programming language engenders a number of new abstractions and paradigms for DistributedComputing. Among these are user-specified load-balancing and migration policies for threads, incrementally-linked distributed computations, and parameterized client-server applications. Kali Scheme supports concurrency and communication using first-class procedures and continuations. It integrates procedures and continuations into a message-based distributed framework that allows any Scheme object (including code vectors) to be sent and received in a message.
