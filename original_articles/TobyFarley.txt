Toby Farley is a  JustaProgrammer who works for the technology department of a medium-sized school district.

He has been known to work in the DelphiLanguage (no hissing please - he takes it very seriously). It does not support GarbageCollection but by Gosh he still thinks DelphiLanguage qualifies as a real ObjectOrientedProgrammingLanguage. 

His interests include writing readable maintainable code and ExtremeProgramming. Despite his interest in ExtremeProgramming, he is pursuing something without so much Dogma. The CrystalClearMethodology may be more appropriate for his work place. Toby Farley has a serious case of SteveMcConnell envy.
