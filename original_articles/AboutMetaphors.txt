'''Why Metaphors'''

''Metaphors are a "basic structural form of experience, through which human beings engage,organize, and understand their world.'' (Morgan, 1983)
----
''Metaphors and analogies liberate imagination, help draw attention to alternative conceptions of reality by selectively highlighting certain features of it, and thus guide action accordingly.'' (Tsoukas, 1993) 
----
''As ways of talking and believing proliferate, new features of organizations are noticed.'' (Weick, 1979)
----
''Thinking is intimately connected to organizing; new perspectives, images or conceptual the very least capture new organizational features while, at the most, they help create the very features to which they refer'' (Tsoukas, 1993) 
----
''Metaphors and other mental models provide a means for individuals and, ultimately, organizations to create and share understanding. These mental models establish images, names and an understanding of how things fit together. They articulate what is important and unimportant ...the models must be articulated and accepted in the organization for them to be effective ... In the context of such models believing is seeing.'' (Hill and Levenhagen, 1995)
