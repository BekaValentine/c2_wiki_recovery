For a GUI-based application, this is the function called when an observed object triggers an observation. Examples are a button press, a timer, or an external notification.

For embedded and real-time systems, this is typically an interrupt handler which deals with a hardware-sourced signal such as a timer expiration, a sensor reaching a trigger level, or a value match of some other sort.
