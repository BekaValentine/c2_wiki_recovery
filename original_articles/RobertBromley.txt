I work for a small company, which makes for an interesting job.  My primary role is developer, however my other roles include chief support problem-solver and internal IT department.  My past experiences include everything from large-chain pizza shop manager to radio station show producer.  I am trying to take up photography, however I fully admit that I'll be using experience and research to make up for a lack of talent.

I find myself wanting to engage in XP, however my environment seems accurately reflected in the beginning of ExtremeProgrammingForOne.  There's a lot of good ideas in that page; I'm still meditating on how they can help.
