Related to FalseDichotomy, but the two sides are not distinct. Rather they are two extremes of a continuum.

''So FalseDichotomy versus FalseContinuum is a FalseDichotomy.''

Examples:
	* The more money we spend on public schools, the better off our children will be. The less we spend, the worse off they'll be. The false continuum is that it is possible to make schools better by spending less money more efficiently. More is not necessarily better.
	* ...

Well... all other factors being equal, it would be hard to make schools WORSE by spending more money on them, so that's not really a false continuum. A false continuum would be something like, "I've gone to college for four years, which qualified me for certain jobs. If I went to college for a few more months, I'd qualify for a few more jobs."

I'm wondering if this is better called FalseLinearEffect or FalseMonotonicDependency. FalseContinuum seems to imply that there is not really a continuum (compare with EverythingIsRelative).
