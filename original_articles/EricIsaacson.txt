Eric Isaacson (http://eji.com/eric1.gif) (see also http://eji.com/) is the author of a very cool assembler/debugger package called A86 and D86.

I used to have a copy of his bio, which outlined his experiences at Intel and his work on the original x86 assembler.

Very sharp dude.  Excellent assembler package.  Other software too.
