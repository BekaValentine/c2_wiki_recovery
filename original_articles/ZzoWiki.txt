ZzoWiki *was* a WikiWeb program that uses PHP and does not use database created by vallab. http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/wiki/

* Different formatting codes than other wikis (In my opinion, better than other wikis)
* No image support (this is so others won't place pornography in your article)
* No list of changes to pages (you will have to make local copies of pages you want)
* CamelCase words will not automatically convert to links (I find CamelCase words always converting into links is annoying, anyway)
* The main page cannot be edited, but other pages can
* You can use subdirectory page-names, such as: /DungeonsAndDragons/Healer
* It has a directory listing (which will list all pages in 1 directory, and list directories inside that directory, so you can go through it)
* The source-code is short
* Min. 15 characters and Max.1024000 characters (so that you do not have too much vandalism on the pages)
* Requires Apache web-server, it uses .htaccess file
* Open for suggestions
* Has script-commands, to almost make a programming language
* Edit requires you to put $ at the end of URL, which helps prevent vandalism

''You need to fix your spelling. I was going to do it for you, but I examined your site, and you really need to take responsibility. Maybe you're just playing a joke.'' Actually, this is not a joke. [I've fixed some of the spelling errors - please fix similarly in your initial page, and use a dictionary!] OK now I fixed the initial page. [It looks the same to me - for example, the first line is "Enybudy can edit the pages uv this wikiweb, you just hav to ad a doler-sine to the end uv the URL.", which contains seven spelling errors.] I just changed the links to point to the new file-names and deleted the old file-names.
