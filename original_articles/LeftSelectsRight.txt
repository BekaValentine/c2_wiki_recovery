GraphicalUserInterface convention whereby selecting an item in a list on the left side of a display will cause details about that item to be displayed on the right side.

If more than two panes are provided, allowing navigation through a deep hierarchy, then proceeding from left to right goes "down" the hierarchy.


''What about Hebrew and Arabic interfaces? I think this is a EuropeanCulturalAssumption.''
* User interfaces in right-to-left locales work the other way round.
** Really? I remeber research showing that ordering is left to right in the these locales too. At least partly, e.g. in numerals.
