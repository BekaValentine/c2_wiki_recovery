I always got asked (especially by INS) and still do: "What the ^%# is a CoadCertifiedMentor?"

Mentor -> teaching people & helping them understand.  IN this case, Java, OO, UML, etc.

Coad Certified -> basically this means that I was interviewed and selected personally by Peter Coad.  As TogetherSoft grew, Peter could no longer interview everyone personally, so the were no more CoadCertifiedMentor titles.  It was the earlier hires that got that title.  It is nice to be able to say that you were personally interviewed and hired by Peter Coad.

As a Coad Certified Mentor I give workshops on the Together product line and how to build better object models using colour archetypes and feature driven development.

''...And as such, you unashamedly discriminate against those of us who are chromatically challenged.''

I must say (and I can since I'm not with TogetherSoft any longer) that the color thing is neat, but doesn't do much for me anymore.   It does add another dimension to the model, though.  --DaveAstels
