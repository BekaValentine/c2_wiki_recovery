Software developer, XP coach and consultant from San Francisco.  I recently coached a very successful XP project for a life insurance company in Munich, Germany.  I'm also the former Director of Engineering at Evant, a company well known for its ExtremeProgramming.

I spoke at the first XP Brazil conference in December 2002.  I also gave a tutorial there on acceptance test-first design using WardCunningham's FrameworkForIntegrationTesting and domain-specific languages.  I'm hoping Brazil adopts XP in a big way so I'll have an excuse to spend more time there.
