This makes a lot of use of the DreyfusModel of HubertDreyfus about levels of competence. It is clear that the ideas have been around for some years. There is also a mention of ShuHaRi.

Although the title does not say so, this book is very relevant to thinking about expertise in programming, and in other disciplines too. This book has been a BookStart for me. I have been talking about it for more than a year, ever since I first found it. -- JohnFletcher
