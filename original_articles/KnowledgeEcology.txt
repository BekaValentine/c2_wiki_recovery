Knowledge ecology seeks to focus on the relationships, learning and social processes concerned with knowledge exchange, creation and use.  Knowledge ecology differs from KnowledgeManagement due to its focus on cognition, situated and social learning and knowledge sharing.

The KnowledgeEcologyNetwork proposes to adopt a social recruiting paradigm and hopes to help business and not-for-profit organizations cope with cultural changes and the people aspects of the networked economy.
