Michael Trachtman is an inquiring mind,
trying to figure out how people think.

If he can come up with patterns of how people
think in a way that he can teach them, then
he is very happy, as he has managed to both
forward theory and happiness.

Those with suggestions can contact Michael at mailto:michael@eloquence.com.
