'''Bad Architects ...'''
* have huge Egos.
**That is not inherently a problem (but it becomes a huge problem if they are incompetent)
* know what is best for you.
** If he/she really knows what is best for you, then he/she is a GoodArchitect 
* Spend more time telling you what they know than listening to what you need.
**Okey, I agree, BadArchitectsDoNotListen
* have all the answers in their heads.
** If they really have all the answers in their heads, they are not GoodArchitects, they are PerfectArchitects! (And I do not think those exist)

''This list is completely ridiculous. Let's see some rationale. - anon''

* Prefer elegance to practicability.
