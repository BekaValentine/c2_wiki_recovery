A YahooGroup (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/scrumtoronto/) founded by some graduates of a 2003 ScrumMasterCertification class, but open to anyone actively interested in the subject of ScrumProcess and related practices. '''update 6 Sep 2010 **Broken link**''' this yahoo group no longer exists

Our little wiki is hosted by ScrumStudyGroupRegistry at: http://wiki.scrums.org/index.cgi?ScrumToronto  '''update 6 Sep 2010 **Broken link**''' the scrums.org domain is no longer in use

It is mainly used to organise real live meetings in the Toronto area for discussion of ScrumProcess.

''Online'' discussion of ScrumProcess happens on the ScrumDevelopment or TorontoXpUsersGroup YahooGroups.
