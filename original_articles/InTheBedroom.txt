A movie about... hmm... 

Nothing seemed to happen in the movie. At all. For three hours.

There was an hour of absolutely nothing. A murder you don't get to see. Another hour of absolutely nothing. Then another murder. Then some old guy strips and goes to bed, and his wife asks him if he wants coffee. The end.

The director was careful to make every shot twice as long as it had to be, and cut to the next boring, pointless "atmospheric" scene whenever there was a chance one of the leads might have to actually '''act''' or '''react''' to something.

This is the penultimate ArtFilm. A whole lot of style but no substance whatsoever.

''Penultimate, eh? What was the last one? Or did you mean "ultimate"?''  "Ultimate" implies that nothing better will ever come along.

Probably Bats... but Bats at least had some redeeming qualities:
	* It ended in <3 hours.
	* People spoke with different tones of voice.
	* Things moved on screen.
	* When you turn on the emergency generator, the building explodes.

Another hypothesis: Your film expectations  are so intellectually and emotionally stunted by immersion in the usual hollywood pablum and network dreck, that both subtlety and depth are completely lost on you.

''Naw, subtlety and depth rock, but you shouldn't sacrifice plot and story in a narrative format like ''film'' for the subtle little hints at some sort of deeper subtext. It's a waste of time, seems like the Director is showing off, belittling the vast majority of the public who don't "get it" or don't ''want'' to "get it," and makes for very boring content. A good movie is good and entertaining on all levels. Sure, the T1000 might be a metaphor for abusive parenting, but he also kicks ass and takes names.''

''Can I help it if European art movies actually manage to be almost as boring as MenInBlack II??''
