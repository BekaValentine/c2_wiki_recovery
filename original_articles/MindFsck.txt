A MindFsck is the process of telling someone something to fundamentally change their intent. It is most effective to tell it to them when their critical faculties are arrested, like:

* When they're at their parents' knee - before the age of 7 is best.
* When they're in an artificially induced hypnotic state, like when sleep-starved, or doing yoga, or or watching television, or
* When they're experiencing some kind of personal crisis - death of a loved one, fear of fate, severe depression, that sort of thing.

It is possible for a MindFsck to be a good, healthy, loving thing, like when AA heals an Alcoholic. Usually, of course, it's covert and sordid, intended for TheManufacturingOfConsent. This is why ''''''MindFsck''''''s are the basis of both advertising and religion.

''AlcoholicsAnonymous does not heal alcoholics. See the AADeprogramming website.''

The use of "fsck" as a replacement for "EffYuCeeKay" (TheFword) is a Unixism. "fsck" is a Unix program which does a filesystem consistency check and repair. When your file system is badly damaged, you are indeed fscked.

	 :	'''Question:''' "What was it called?" 
	 :	'''Dennis Ritchie:''' Well, the second letter was different.

... and there I was thinking that a mind fsck was when you check that your internal beliefs, values and goals are consistent and corruption free. ;-) -- some guy
