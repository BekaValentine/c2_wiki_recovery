I wanted to do this as a sort of DoctorSuess thing, but lack the creativity for such a venture. You know how it would sound, though...
 When the Boss asks you for a date
 That you can't even fake,
 And you're still tempting Fate
 By running an old Make,
 You want to RunAwayScreaming...
etc, etc, blech. You finish it. Well, wipe it out, whatever.

''And the bugs are simply teeming,''
''And the project's past redeeming...''

There are many times I have to RunAwayScreaming from a gig or even a particular task at a gig. The PointyHairedBoss may ask for some feature to be delivered at an unreasonable date (CountTheHands) or ask for some functionality to be delivered ''before'' the functionality it depends on. Oy. There are many reasons to RunAwayScreaming.

 Boss blows a chill wind,
 Budgets frozen, projects iced.
 RunAwayScreaming!

''Uh, oh. Haiku. Just like the GodwinsLaw principle, as soon as a page starts to show symptoms of haiku,''
  ''it is finished!''
  ''Kaput!''
  ''Ümbersláng!''
(Yeah, great. Thanks for the ''<ahem>'' "improvement," Doug.)

 He has a pistol,
 The barrel is quite shiny.

''Actually, it's a black irridite finish. The flash sorta washed out the muzzle end of the barrel so it looks like the satin nickel finish. I wish I had gotten the satin nickel; it's easier to clean.''

You already cast and reload your own bullets, why not take up finishing as a new hobby? Keeping busy with hobbies is a surefire prevention for going postal.

''Noooo. I don't cast bullets. And anyway, lead bullets are for subsonic applications. Anything over 1100 feet per second typically requires a copper jacket for proper performance and to reduce barrel leading. The 350 grain .50 AE leaves a six inch barrel at over 1250 FPS. The 325 and 300 hollow point have somewhat higher muzzle velocities...''

''Oh, my goodness! I'm a gun nut, aren't I? Ack! Thpth! Geekiness engulfs me, even when I try to be cool!''

 Multi-page methods, globals...
