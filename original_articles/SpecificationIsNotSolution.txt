Some tests can't be satisfied. Or at least not under a VonNeumannArchitecture.

Specification is a statement of what the product will do and how it will act. This does not address the issue of ''how'' the product does this, unless such procedure is a necessary part of the product's behavior.

I once did a short term gig at a place that had a "specification" for their thermal transfer printer product that was a simple reverse engineering of the (existing turd collection) software. The "spec" went into great detail about the serial access to the print head, the read/write cycles, blah, blah, blah. What a total pile of kaka. After I rubbed their nose in the fact that the basic hardware/software platform was incapable of meeting the actual printing requirements they decided that maybe the "specification" wasn't quite up to snuff. Oy.

I did a quick search for the definition of Specification.  This one seems to be the most relevant.

a. specifications A detailed, exact statement of particulars, especially a statement prescribing materials, dimensions, and quality of work for something to be built, installed, or manufactured.

I think what you seem to mean by specification is more similar to an Interface in programming terms.  Perhaps InterfaceIsNotImplementation, which once stated seems obvious from a computer science standpoint.  Basically what we're talking about is TopDownVsBottomUp.  -- MikeEdwards
