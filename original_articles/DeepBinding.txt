A method for implementing DynamicScoping in LispLanguage where the value of each variable is stored in a mapping called an "association list" or "alist".  This is a list whose elements are pairs, where each pair contains in its car a symbol and in its cdr the symbol's value.  Looking up the value of a symbol is expensive in an implementation that uses DeepBinding, but creating DynamicClosure''''''s is fast and easy.

LispOnePointFive used DeepBinding for all variables in interpreted functions and for "common" variables in compiled functions.
