'''General Notes'''

''Adding Attributes''

''Please use the same attributes and the same sequence of attributes in each review.  If you add an attribute to one review, please consider adding it at the same location in each review, the WikiEngineReviewTemplate, and the WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated.''

''Reviews of New Releases''

''Please maintain separate reviews for each version of each WikiEngine. The intent is to maintain reviews of old versions of software that might still be in use on a WikiFarm or on a specific WikiSite??. See WikiEngineReviewNewRelease for the recommended approach.''

''Notes''

See WikiEngineReview, WikiEngineReviewNotes, and WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated for notes and discussion about these reviews and Wikis in general.
