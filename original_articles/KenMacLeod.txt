His books use science fiction partially as a forum to explore political ideas. ''TheStarFraction'' has some emphasis on communism, within the framework of a society that has some similarities to that of NealStephenson's ''SnowCrash''. ''TheStoneCanal'' explores anarchism/AnarchoCapitalism.

It's not all dead serious. As a fillip, Mr. Mac''''''Leod also lightly salts his novels with subtle in-jokes.

''TheStoneCanal'' has a well-written passage portraying a surprising use of BootStrap''''''ping.

''TheStoneCanal'' may have been inspired in part by DavidFriedman's 1971 ''The Machinery of Freedom'' [ISBN 0812690699], a libertarian guide to AnarchoCapitalism. Note the similarities: one of the main characters of ''TheStoneCanal'' is David Reed (who is a major proponent of AnarchoCapitalism), and the title of the first part of the novel is "The Machinery of Freedom". Mr. Friedman is also reputed to be a SF fan.

''If you are referring to David Director Friedman, he is indeed an SF fan, among other things.  Wikipedia link [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Friedman]''
