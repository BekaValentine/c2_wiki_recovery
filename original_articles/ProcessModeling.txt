ProcessModeling is probably better known to computing professionals as activities related to constructing DataFlowDiagram''''''s through the use of once popular CaseTool''''''s (now eclipsed by the use of UnwantedModelingLanguage).

However, the use of ProcessModeling probably started with the humble FlowChart that predates the arrival of BigIron computers.

ProcessModeling was elevated to a new level with the BusinessProcessReengineering craze of the early 1990s, where the favorite technique is based on IDEF. IDEF has no sequencing of activities and is not directly linked to computerization, until SoaAndLooseCoupling became the NextBigThing. 

Now in the beginning of the twenty-first century the ProcessModeling technique of choice is BusinessProcessModelingNotation (BPMN). It will take time for the user community to recognize both the limits and limitations of BPMN, and have a realistic expectation of this business facility.

There may be a resurgence in the use of FlowChart as a ProcessModeling tool as well. BenGraham, grandson of the FlowChart inventor, has written a book called "Detail Process Charting" and has developed a CaseTool as well. A comparison of this method with techniques such as IDEF can be found at http://processchart.com/comparison%20of%20business%20process%20flowcharting%20techniques.htm.

'''SystemsThinking and ProcessModeling'''

In 2006, ProcessModeling use of BusinessModeling SWOT technique was linked up with a Russian SystemsThinking method called TRIZ (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ). The result is termed P-TRIZ by Howard Smith - former BPMI co-chair, of Third Wave BusinessProcessManagement fame. Howard's assertion is that SWOT by itself is problematic in its application; however, when teamed up with TRIZ, SWOT becomes a ChangeManagement tool and caters for BusinessContinuity concerns.

P-TRIZ is a StrategicManagement tool that is meant to address PortfolioManagement and RiskManagement concerns.
