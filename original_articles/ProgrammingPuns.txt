Writing code, comments, variable names, etc., in the manner that they create a pun.

This is a common and fun practice, but it can be an AntiPattern. Making a pun can detract from the readability of the code. (See MeaningfulName''''''s.) Plus, if you work with the code long enough, some jokes can tire to the point of becoming completely annoying.

Alternately, simply a class of puns which require programming knowledge to be understood.

When a friend of mine and I were writing an oberon compiler for a class, we would give our objects humorous names, calling the symbol table class "Wingdings", our scope object "Tele", and our Token class "JRR" -- JacobCohen

I frequently add the following commands to my makefile (I am not the originator, I saw this in a makefile myself):

 love: /dev/null
       @echo not war?

It is surprising how many people have just happened to type "make love" and be amused at the response!

''yes I'd certainly be suprised that ''anyone'' is amused by that.''

Why do computer scientists confuse Halloween with Christmas? (Don't put the answer here, please... To find the answer, search Google for "computer scientists Halloween Christmas.") -- DanielKnapp

Two strings walk into a bar. One says "I'd like a beer please. 25s3z %- 9238435". The other string says "Sorry about my friend, he's not null-terminated."

	Math faculty joke heard around U.Waterloo:	First person: Pick a number between 1 and 10. Second person: You mean like, an integer?

How many people can read hex if only you, me and dead people can read hex?

''Was that a bitwise or logical and?'' No. It was addition. ''I'm sorry, could you speak up, please?''

Here's one I dreamed up:

Q: Why did the functions stop calling each other?
A: Because they had constant arguments.

''That was so bad that it overflew my stack.''

HaHaOnlySerious: this has happened to me when I forgot to refactor a method in ''all'' the classes in an inheritance chain to have the same const-ness.

Q: How does Kent Beck like his Pop-Tarts?

A: Toast-first.

''hmm, I thought he likes to have 2 people push the tart into one toaster and pops it out every few seconds to nibble and test if it's perfect and make position/heat changes. When done, only writing '7/10/06 one pop tart' as documentation.''
