Probably the earliest GraphicalProgrammingLanguage, designed in 1966 by WilliamSutherland (IvanSutherland's brother). It was heavily influenced by SketchPad, which itself was a domain-specific graphical ConstraintProgramming language (not general purpose, not TuringEquivalent). This is not all that widely known; Prograph is often called the first GraphicalProgrammingLanguage. Therefore here's some references:
