Eclectic musician (Alfred Matthew Yankovic, b. Oct. 23, 1959; see  http://www.davesfunstuff.com/27artbio.htm). Well known for various spoofs of other artists' songs (and some random ones of his own). 

Credits include "Eat It", "It's all about the Pentiums", "Polka Power", "Pretty Fly for a Rabbi" and various other silly and inane works of music. 

''Does "All About The Pentiums" really fall into the category of "inane" here?  "Silly", perhaps, but from what I could tell, WeirdAl's playful skewering of/homage to the computer culture was both pretty accurate and well received (especially by those who were programming and/or online before the AolizationOfTheInternet).''

Acting career consists mainly (from my info) of ''UHF'', where one could see Michael Richards (Kramer from ''Seinfeld'') in his err ... early acting career. (Don't take my mop!)* Good movie, perhaps you should rent it, again, spoofs of everything from Indiana Jones to who knows what else.

''I was always impressed by the songs that he did that were not takeoffs of specific songs, but of specific styles of different rock groups. "Velvet Elvis" as a Police song, "Dog Eat Dog" as something the Talking Heads might have written ... '' "Dare To Be Stupid" was a dead-on DEVO pastiche.

I used to know this guy who knew every song of his word for word and his entire social repertoire consisted of quoting Weird Al and MontyPython. I'd really like to hear him go through "Albuquerque". -- LeeNathan
