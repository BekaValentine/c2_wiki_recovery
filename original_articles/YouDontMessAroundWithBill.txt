''(Sing to the tune of--what else--Jim Croce's classic "You Don't Mess Around With Jim")''

 The Valley's got its hustlers
 Wall Street's got its rich
 RedmondWashington's got William Gates III
 He's a code-slinging sonofabitch
 Yeah he's meek and nerdy as a geek can be
 But he's richer than an oil emir
 And when the CEOs all get together at night
 You know they all call Big Bill "sir"

 You don't laugh at Donald Trumps's hair
 You don't piss up a hill
 You don't give a wedgie to Jesse Ventura
 And you don't mess around with Bill.

 Well outa Scandanavia came a college boy
 Said I think Windows really sucks
 My momma named me Linus, (and that's because I'm Finnish)
 But my friends all call me Tux
 Yeah I'm looking for the king of Tech America
 Drives a custom-built Ferrari
 And it may sound funny, but his shit cost too much money
 And I think software should be free....

 And everbody say, Jack, don't you know that...
 You don't laugh at Donald Trumps's hair
 You don't piss up a hill
 You don't give a wedgie to Jesse Ventura
 And you don't mess around with Bill.

 Well a hush fell over the boardroom
 When Bill came in and took his seat
 And when the hackin' was done, and the lawyers had their fun
 There was blood on the balance sheet
 Yeah sales were down twenty percentage points
 And the stock price even more
 And you better believe that the trade rags changed their story
 When Bill's jaw hit the floor

 Now they say
 You don't laugh at Donald Trump's hair
 You don't stand under ducks
 You don't give a wedgie to Ahnold Schwarzenegger
 And you don't mess around with Tux
 You don't laugh at Donald Trump's hair
 You don't stand under ducks
 You don't give a wedgie to Ahnold Schwarzenegger
 And you don't mess around with Tux
