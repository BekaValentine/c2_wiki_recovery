I had been working as a CsharpLanguage programmer and dabbled in VisualBasicDotNet creating web and windows applications.

A few years back I was working in the JavaLanguage focusing on web applications using ApacheCocoon and ApacheLenya for Quoin http://www.quoininc.com (as of 03/01/2004)

Then I stayed in Durham, NC and worked as a custom web application developer for Sci Med Solutions http://www.scimedsolutions.com in the RubyLanguage and creating RubyOnRails based projects. (until 05/2010)

The upper midwest called me back - I now work for Northwestern University in the Biomedical Informatics Center (NUBIC) http://www.nucats.northwestern.edu/centers/nubic
