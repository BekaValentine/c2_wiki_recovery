(Barbara Yates is much too modest to toot her own horn here,
so JanSteinman is adding something for her...)

Barbara worked with Ward in TekLabs, and produced the 
first Tek Smalltalk reference manual in 1986, using
Smalltalk code that extracted comments from Smalltalk code.
She also worked on the Tek Team Tools Smalltalk groupware project.
