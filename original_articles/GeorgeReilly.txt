I am currently (late 2005) a Senior Software Engineer at Atlas DMT in Seattle. I spent too many years at Microsoft, mostly on the IIS dev team, but I'm all better now.

For formal use, I use my middle initial, V, but GeorgeVReilly is not a valid WikiWord.

I can be reached care of my blog at http://www.georgevreilly.com/blog/
