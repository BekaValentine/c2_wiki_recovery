A PeerToPeer project by SunMicrosystems,
see http://www.jxta.org/.

The project was started by BillJoy

The technology is pretty clever, but suffers from a lack of documentation and
the APIs have many rough edges. People therefore tend to become infuriated
by it rather quickly. With a bit of effort in cleaning up the APIs and 
documenting them, Jxta could become one of the key Java technologies.

Jxta has its own wiki at http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Jxta/WebHome

Some Jxta Projects that use Jxta are: 

* Go Tournament for JXTA http://go.jxta.org/ Webstart: http://go.jxta.org/releases/jnlp/0.6/gojxta.jnlp
