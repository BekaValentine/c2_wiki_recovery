What does one program LegoMindstorms in?  There are bindings for lots of languages besides the default VisualProgrammingLanguage.

I use NQC (NotQuiteC), home page at http://www.enteract.com/~dbaum/nqc/index.html

In addition, there's a FORTH interpreter (pbForth), 
an operating system (LegOS), and
a Smalltalk package for Dolphin Smalltalk (BotKit).

It comes with a VisualProgrammingLanguage that will frustrate even the youngest child.  Statements are represented by puzzle pieces that hook together on a 2 dimensional plane.  Pieces can't overlap, which introduces arbitrary limits on program structure.
