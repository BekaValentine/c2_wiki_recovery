Welcome. ''What brings you to the World's first WikiWiki? 

You can get a quick sampling of what is here, by consulting the following pages:''

''The wiki is far more than the current RecentChanges, which seems to fill up with less interesting stuff. The pages which have been here for years are far more interesting, and are the result of the contributions of hundreds and thousands of individuals.''

''For the past couple of years (since mid-2005) the contribution level has dropped drastically. However, things may soon change due to changes in the relationship of this wiki to Search engines and services such as Google. -- DonaldNoyes 20071010''
