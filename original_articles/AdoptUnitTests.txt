Management spews platitudes about the importance of quality, but there is only one QA employee and ''s/he'' doesn't have any training.
	* Quality is falling through the cracks.
	* Developers are discouraged and BurntOut.
	* DeathMarch projects are the norm.

'''Therefore:'''

Adopt UnitTest''''''s as standard procedure. Find or create a TestingFramework. Write tests. Get TestInfected. Ask others to help you. Write tests with them. When they ask you for help, write tests with them.
