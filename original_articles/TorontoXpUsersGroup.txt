
Calling itself "XP/Agile Toronto" now, the TorontoXpUsersGroup was founded in the summer of 2000 by MikeBowler and BryanZarnett.  They ran the group until the summer of 2003 when ownership switched to LawrenceLudlow.

The group was originally formed specifically to discuss ExtremeProgramming but it has been expanded to cover all the Agile methodologies. 

'''Objectives:''' 

The XPToronto/Agile Users Group is a dedicated community of software development specialists located in the Toronto, Canada area. The members of XPToronto are committed to the acceptance of Agile development methodologies, such as Extreme Programming, Scrum and many others. Through education and discussion, XPToronto works to refine the development process. 

'''Meetings'''

Generally, discussion meetings are held on the third Tuesday of the month (except for the months of July and August when we break for the summer).

The ScrumToronto group is an affiliate of XpToronto.
