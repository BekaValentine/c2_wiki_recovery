'''Review of TWiki, May, 2000, Release'''

'''General Notes'''

''Adding Attributes''

''Please use the same attributes and the same sequence of attributes in each review.  If you add an attribute to one review, please consider adding it at the same location in each review, the WikiEngineReviewTemplate, and the WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated.''

''Reviews of New Releases''

''Please maintain separate reviews for each version of each WikiEngine. The intent is to maintain reviews of old versions of software that might still be in use on a WikiFarm or on a specific WikiSite??. See WikiEngineReviewNewRelease for the recommended approach.''

''Notes''

See WikiEngineReview, WikiEngineReviewNotes, and WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated for notes and discussion about these reviews and Wikis in general.

'''General'''

	* ''Date of Review:'' November 29, 2000

	* ''WikiEngine and Version Reviewed:'' TWiki, May, 2000, Release

	* ''WikiEngine Author:'' 

	* ''Review Summary:''

	* ''Review Quality:'' Incomplete -- I started this when the December, 2000 release was already available.  When I found it, I put this on "hold" and switched to that.  This review left incomplete -- if someone has the interest they may complete it.  There are some public WikiForums that continue to use this version of TWiki.

'''Content'''

	* ''Display WardsWiki text?'' See http://kit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/view/Main/WikiReviewTextFormattingTest.  Significantly different.  Text enclosed in angle brackets is hidden (apparently treated as HTML tags).  Lists work reasonably.  Multiple single quote emphasis does not work at all.  You would probably want a translator to import text from WardsWiki.

	* ''Text formatting rules:'' Look significantly different than WardsWiki -- see http://kit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/view/Main/TextFormattingRules

	* ''Headings?''

	* ''Allowable WikiNames:'' Original, plus adjacent caps / all caps, plus numbers, but with some limitations like a number can't precede the first lowercase letter.  See http://kit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/view/Main/WikiNotation.  (Now need some new samples for my WikiReviewTextFormattingTest.)
