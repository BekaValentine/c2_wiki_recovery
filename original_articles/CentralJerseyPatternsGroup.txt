the cjpg has fallen into disuse of late.  i recently switched jobs, and have less time to devote to the group than i did a year ago.  

if someone is willing to take over moderation of the group, please contact me and i'll hand over the reins of the mailing list and so on...

Please contact TomMoore for more information, or subscribe
to the mailing list by mailing cjpg-subscribe@egroups.com.

I (kpmurugan@yahoo.com) am interested in volunteering to be the moderator for this group.
None of the contact information given above seem to work now.
