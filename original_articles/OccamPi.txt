A successor language to occam 2 that's mostly backwards-compatible, but adds various useful new features based on the PiCalculus. The major addition has been the concept of MobileDataTypes: data, channels and processes can be safely passed around by reference, with rules in place to avoid aliasing. There's an OpenSource occam 2 and OccamPi compiler available called KRoC that'll build IA32/SPARC/MIPS executables, and another group's working on a VirtualMachine for the extended Transputer bytecode that KRoC uses.
