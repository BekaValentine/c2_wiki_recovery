I could have sworn I made this page before.  

I am a C/C++//VB.NET//PHP//ASP.NET//TCL/TK programmer.  I know, all those languages conflict with each other.  I can't help it.  My interests vary greatly.  For example, I also have held a job as a photographer (albeit for a small, university magazine), and consider myself a writer/philologist.  I also have a great interest in science (photonic communication facinates me)and cryptography.

I know what you are thinking.  

"Josh, how do you have time for all of those subjects?"  

Well, since you asked, I don't.  I've had to pretty much give up flying (I guess I forgot to mention that I took flying lessons), and photography.  I still write, and program for a career (though I am leaning towards management or Project Management, both of which I currently do as well as programming/designing).  This leaves me with *no* time, but I am happy.  I think...

By the way, my name is Josh.

You may be interested in SpecializationIsForInsects.  You're interested in a whole lot, should be right up your alley.

And C/C++/VB.NET/PHP/ASP.NET/TCL/TK don't conflict with each other.  They're more or less all in the same family.  CommonLisp/SelfLanguage/JavaLanguage/PhpLanguage/ErlangLanguage/HaskellLanguage all conflict with each other. ;)  -- JonathanTang
