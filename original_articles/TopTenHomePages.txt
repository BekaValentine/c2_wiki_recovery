I was just wondering about the incredibly wide spread of people we have here on the wiki. I started to filter out all the home pages and found that there are some 3300 of them out of the 24500 (or so) pages. I'm using my backup of the wiki here, so the details may be slightly inaccurate.

''May I ask, when was this list compiled?''
* Early 2005, I think.

'''The largest 10 homepages'''

	* 20789 bytes RichardKulisz
	* 20092 bytes JimShore
	* 19794 bytes WardCunningham

There are 91 home pages with no links to them, orphans. There are also probably many more OrphanPage''''''s that have yet to be labelled CategoryHomePage.

''Could someone [besides you-know-whos] ''pleeeze'' bump me off that list??'' --PhlIp

Done. -- SunirShah

Sorry, PhlIp, you're back again, at RichardDrake's expense. -- EarleMartin

It would be interesting on the BackLink''''''s list to separate links due to signing (--WikiName or -- WikiName) from links due to references (I heard that PeterMerel said that KentBeck insisted that...). --TimLesher

''I'll do that tomorrow. The problem is that many people don't bother to conform to the convention. I'll do the search, though.''
