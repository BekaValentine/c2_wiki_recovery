A project that JimShore (aka JimLittle) coached for a little over a year.  It was a GreenfieldApplication developed using all of the XP practices.  He wrote an experience report with a cumbersome title ("Up-Front Design Versus Evolutionary Design in Denali's Persistence Layer") about part of it.  That report can currently be found at http://www.xpuniverse.com/2001/pdfs/EP203.pdf.

Jim, I enjoyed your paper.  In particular, I liked your anecdote where writing better tests led you to architecture breakthroughs.  -- SteveHowell

Other stories about DenaliProject appear in OptimizationStories (the Denali connection pool) and on the JimShore page (Denali internationalization).  This was my most favorite XP project.  I had the pleasure of working with Jim during some of these events, and I learned a great deal from him.  Enjoyed Portland, worked with a top-notch team, learned a lot.  Thanks, Jim!  -- RobMyers
