The XpNewYorkCity ExtremeProgramming group meets in midtown Manhattan on alternate Wednesdays from 6:30 to 9:00 PM. '''For up to date meeting info please see the group's wiki at http://xpnyc.org'''

We focus on learning ExtremeProgramming by working on an XP project.

Newcomers are always welcome -- you'll give us a chance to learn about turnover on an XP project!

Our current project is Dup Detector, a tool for detecting duplicate strings of text within a collection of files. Previous projects were the Agoric Nim, WhoDidProject, and Make It So, a versioning tool for databases.
