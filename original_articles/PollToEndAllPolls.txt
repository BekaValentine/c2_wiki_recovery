Frame on this page your questions which will ensure the validity requirements so one can trust and rely upon the results:

First Question: Do you think the results of a poll which presents questions in this or any other setting can ever accurately reflect the opinion of the public at large? 
* Yes 
* No 2 
** ItDoesntDepend: Any poll will invariably be able to sample very few bits of the opinion of the public  at large. The poll will thus be very diffuse and that doesn't even count how the polls questions are determined.
** See PrisonersDilemma

* Qualified:
** ItDepends on the poll type. I trust handle based lists over mere quantity increments because they have some traceability to origin.
