SciFaiku is a form of poetry invented by Tom Brinck and inspired by the Japanese haiku. SciFaiku poems are short, minimal poems about science and science-fiction topics. They are presented with direct, tangible images in clear and simple language. For example:
 eerie summer solstice:
 hiding the little men
 from my family
''Note that this is, strictly speaking, not a haiku.''

  If you had a network of underground bases
  and you could flood them with water
  at the touch of a button,
  why would you do that?
