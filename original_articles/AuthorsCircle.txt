... the reviewers are assembled SittingInaCircle,
ready for the review process.
The circle brings the full community in direct
contact with the author and with each other.

It has become common practice to invite observers
to writers workshops:  where do they sit?

'''*  *  *'''

'''Bringing non-authors into'''
'''the literal and figurative inner circle might cause'''
'''discomfort for the author, and can be contrary to a'''
'''SafeSetting.'''

'''On the other hand, the WritersWorkshop is a'''
'''good learning opportunity for those outside'''
'''the literary community, and they should be welcome.'''

'''But just because they are in the'''
'''room doesn't mean that they are part of'''
'''the community of trust.  If they are made'''
'''part of the circle, they will feel like'''
'''participating; yet they don't yet know the'''
'''conventions for effective participation.'''
'''Excluding them altogether is disengaging.'''

'''Therefore:'''

'''Arrange the room in two circles.  The inner circle'''
'''contains the authors and the moderator.  The outer'''
'''circle, or "gallery," is for non-authors.'''

Authors that wish to remove themselves from active
participation should also remove themselves to the
outer circle, rather than sitting passively in the
inner circle:  The author being reviewed (and the
moderator, representing the author's interest) should
expect participation from all members of the inner circle.

'''*  *  *'''

This pattern strongly recalls WorkshopComprisesAuthors.

The circle makes it easy for everyone to see
the author eye-to-eye during AuthorReadsTheWork,
SuggestionsForImprovement,
and ThankTheAuthor.
All the reviewers can see each other during
the ''dialog'' of SuggestionsForImprovement.
The outer circle also provides a context for
the FlyOnTheWall author to retire to
(behind the AuthorsCircle) as the work is being
reviewed.
