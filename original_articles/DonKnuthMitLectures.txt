The "God and Computers" project continues in Fall 1999 with

DONALD E. KNUTH; Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming Stanford University 

*** http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mit-lectures.html

Since the first announcement of this lecture series there were so
many inquiries that I decided to send this e-mail to everyone
with answers to the most frequent questions.

PUBLICITY:

The lectures and the panel discussion will be webcasted -
thanks to Dr. Dobb's Journal! The website will be announced
shortly before the first lecture. Don Knuth's presentations will
also be distributed on MIT cable and to the Draper Lab.
Professional videos of the series may be purchased after the
lecture series is over.

CONTACT ADDRESS:

Don Knuth does not have e-mail! I have given him all e-mails I
have received but please direct questions or inquiries to my
assistant Jean Hwang (jhwang@ai.mit.edu, 617-452-2832). I would
especially like to ask people from the Media to set up interviews
with Don through her.

ADMISSION:

The lectures are free and open for the public. Everyone is
welcome! They will be held at MIT 34-101 (50 Vassar ST) on
Wednesdays. We will start at 4:15 pm with refreshments, the talks
and discussions begin at 4:30 pm until about 5:45 pm. After 4 pm
parking in restricted areas is acceptable but I would recommend
people to take public transportation (Red Line "Kendall", Bus
"MIT, Mass Ave").

'''GOD AND COMPUTERS''':

For information about the God and Computers Project please visit our homepage at

I am still collecting the papers from the first two years but am positive to edit the volume soon; for now, only the abstracts of previous talks are available.

QUESTIONS ON ROBOT SOULS AND CONSCIOUSNESS

I got wonderful messages with very interesting and challenging
questions but find myself unable to answer them all in
person. Some food for thought you may find at my homepage (see
below). I would especially recommend to follow the link to the
MSNBC homepage and Margie Wylie's article "What robots can teach
about souls". For questions on the difference between us and
machines, you might want to read my paper on Cog and the "Image
of God" symbol.


And here is the program of the lecture series again:
