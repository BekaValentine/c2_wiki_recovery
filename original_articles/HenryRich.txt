I spent 7 years working for IBM as a programmer and then switched to designing computer-graphics hardware (I had trained as an EE). Doing both hardware and software, I took the title of 'system architect' and hired out as a consultant for the design of flight simulators and high-performance graphics accelerators. I have retired from that work and spend my days homeschooling my older daughter. My programming has for the last 5 years been exclusively in the JayLanguage.
