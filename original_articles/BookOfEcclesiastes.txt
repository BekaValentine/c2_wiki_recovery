'''Solomon, on temporality:'''

	 :	To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
	 :	A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
	 :	A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
	 :	A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
	 :	A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
	 :	A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
	 :	A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
	 :	A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.

Ecclesiastes 3:1 - 3:8 (as famously used by the Byrds, with a musical setting written by Pete Seeger).

	 :	One generation goes and another generation comes, but the earth abides forever.

Ecclesiastes 1:4 (and subsequently the title of a fine SF book by George R. Stewart).

''Question: Solomon has much to say above (Ecclesiasties 3) about '''time''', what does he have to say of '''chance'''?''

'''Solomon, on ComplexSystems''':

	 :	I returned, and saw under the sun,
	 :	that the race is not to the swift,
	 :	nor the battle to the strong,
	 :	neither yet bread to the wise,
	 :	nor yet riches to men of understanding,
	 :	nor yet favor to men of skill;
	 :	but time and chance happeneth to them all.

Ecclesiastes 9:11

''As an aside, TheElementsOfStyle takes this powerful, concrete verse and rephrases it in the abstract (to demonstrate how superior concreteness can be):''

	 :	Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must inevitably be taken into account.
