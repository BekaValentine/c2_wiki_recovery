    ''The meaning of life to me,''
         ''is to see that person you hide away.'' 
              ''To touch the place you hide so fiercely...'' 
                     ''That place no other may go.'' 
                            ''Oh, what treasures it may hold.'' 

    ''Those treasures your heart may have...'' 
         ''That tender, beautiful soul.'' 
              ''The mysteries of the universe are there I see.'' 
                      ''If only you will let me touch that place...'' 
                            ''No other may go.'' 

    ''You are the meaning of life to me.'' 
         ''That person I may be honored enough to see.'' 
              ''Whose heart is tender... So full of mystery'' 

    ''To touch that place...'' 
         ''Is my greatest goal'' 

    ''For you my dear...'' 
         ''Are the meaning of life, to me.''
