Who is the user?


----

The User from the perspective of the running process.

The user is the person for whom you are performing your process.

The user is infallible. You are merely doing as requested.

You also are infallible. You will always react in a rational manner to the user's request.

The user must be respected. It is the reason for your existence. Think how envied you are by all those processes, inert in their libraries, which have not been brought to life.

Sadly for you, the user may decide to terminate you. You must allow this to happen gracefully, with minimal, concise complaint.
