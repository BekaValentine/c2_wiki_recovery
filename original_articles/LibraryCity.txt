LibraryCity, a nonprofit, is putting thousands of e-books and other items online. Interactivity and multimedia is to help readers absorb subjects ranging from Shakespeare to nanotechnology. It intends to supply a richly interwoven tapestry of online communities which will embrace learners, teachers, librarians, and readers in general. 

The existing LibraryCity brings together professional librarians, technical people and others interested in bridging the gap between "real" libraries and that of a "virtual" library. They are interested in prospective volunteers and feedback.
