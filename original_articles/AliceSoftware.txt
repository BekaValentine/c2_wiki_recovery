Alice is a programming framework and IDE for beginning programmers, who might not be interested in displaying text on the screen or asking for people's names, but might be interested in manipulating virtual physical objects and characters in a 3D world.

Versions include:

	Alice 99:	Original version, back when you could expect web surfers to install web plugins to view your animations.
	Alice 2.0:	Designed for high school and college students.
	Storytelling Alice:	Based on 2.0, designed for middle-school students.
	SqueakAlice:	Much like other versions of Alice, but using Squeak Smalltalk instead of Python.  (Closer to 99 or 2.0?)
	Alice 3.0:	To be integrated with The Sims 2, and to begin beta testing soon.

For details on beta testing of 3.0, see: http://www.alice.org/index.php?page=alice3_progress_report
