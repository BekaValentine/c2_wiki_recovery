This page is an intentional orphan - I did not link any other wiki pages to it. This is an experiment to see how many 'hits' orphan pages get over time. If you read this page, please add a notation with the date. Thank you.

I was pair programming the other week. I said that the code wants to go this way. Later, I said that the code wants to be refactored in a certain direction. After a few more references to the code voicing its wants, he turned to me and said, "You must have great ears, because I don't hear the code talking." That got me to thinking about this metaphor, "the code speaks".

I wonder if it's just a convenient way to claim that what I want to do is the best thing to do. If I want to refactor the code a certain way, well, that's just my opinion. But if the code wants to be refactored in a certain way, that lends an air of objectivity to the decision. See, it's not my idea, it's the ''code's'' idea.

On the other hand, the code really ''does'' speak to me. Honest. Even when I take my drugs on time.

What if your computer has no sound card? Can you still hear code speak? Or if code speaks and no-one is around to hear it, does it still make a sound?

What is the sound of one line compiling?

The code is just code; it sits there on your hard drive. The computer will interpret it very strictly and uncaringly. It is you, the programmer, who gives the code meaning because you understand it. So, when the CodeSpeaks, it is just you and your internal sense of elegance. However, most concepts of elegance are shared with others.

Found it on 2000/07/20, searching for "e-speak". As TomDeMarco says, 'if you are having the same argument over and over again, someone feels like someone isn't listening."

[4:45am UTC 18 September 2000] I felt like touching this page again.

I had an idea. Code speaks the mind of its author like any work that can be imbued with style. However, this depends on the environment in which you work. On one hand, you have Perl which emphasizes writability and Unix humour (carp?). On the other hand, you have the sterile environment of Java, which is like reading a VCR manual.

I get that too many cooks spoil the stew, so Java replaces the art of cookery with microwave TV dinners. But, gee, it's no fun. The best code speaks of the best minds. And whatever happened to the exuberance that LiterateProgramming folk had of young programmers reading code listings like novels?

Perl is fun. -- SunirShah

''I almost agree that'' "Code speaks the mind of its author like any work that can be imbued with style." ''I don't think that it's the code speaking, though, I think it's the intended design (or a pattern?) that is being subconsciously noticed.''

''As far as the analogies go, I'd say Perl is more like a good MontePython sketch, whereas Java is more like a bland old male U.S. TV anchor. Unfortunately, most of the people I work with wouldn't get a Python sketch to save their souls. -- KaelLizak''

I got here from ListenToTheCode. I think that when the CodeSpeaks, the voice is in my head telling me whether what I see (the code) matches who I am (does the code present an acceptable expression of my authorship). Therefore, the CodeSpeaks only to those who have a well-established mental image of their authorship and its proper expression. For those people who are apathetic about their authorship and its expression, the code never speaks.

By the way, I very quickly acquired an addiction as a RecentChangesJunkie, though I am still learning the best means of injection.

2002-07-29: This page keeps getting onto RecentChanges because everyone keeps saying when they found it, maybe if it stayed dead for a while it would disappear. -- PerryLorier

''Not necessarily - I found it once from RandomPages, and once through the WikiList -- 2002/07/29''

Maybe it should say that when you augment the count, you should mark the change as a MinorEdit (as I'm going to do) to keep it out of RecentChanges. On the other hand, maybe the point of the experiment is to make it findable purely through Recent Changes. Maybe another interesting experiment would be to make a page like this that is always minor-edited, so the RecentChangesJunkie''''''s never see it (although the R''''''ecentEditsJunkies would - man, are those guys crazy).

Hmm. Maybe ... just maybe ... ''such a page already exists''; how would we know if it did? There would be no inward links, and it would never show up on RecentChanges or QuickChanges. ''Maybe there's already an entire set of stealth pages, unreachable from the everyday wiki, cloaked as MinorEdit''''''s''. There could be an entire subculture of wiki, composed of R''''''ecentEditsJunkies reading and writing stealthed pages! Hmm; if they only see MinorEdit''''''ed pages, it's possible that they aren't aware of the light side (ie our side) of the wiki at all. Two separate cultures sharing one space, a LightSide and a DarkSide.

Our course of action is obvious: '''we must strike first'''.

Of course, since I'm submitting this as a MinorEdit, they'll see this. Well, too bad. '''People of the DarkSide MinorEdit''''''s-based wiki culture: prepare to be annihilated!''''
