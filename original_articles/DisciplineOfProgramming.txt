Author Edsger W. Dijkstra introduces A Discipline of Programming with the statement, "My original idea was to publish a number of beautiful algorithms in such a way that the reader could appreciate their beauty." Dijkstra achieves this goal and accomplishes a great deal more.

He begins by considering the questions:
* "What is an algorithm?"
* "What are we doing when we program?"
These questions lead him to an interesting digression on the semantics of programming languages. Dijkstra then delivers, as promised, a collection of beautiful algorithms.
* These algorithms are far ranging, covering mathematical computations, various kinds of sorting problems, pattern matching, convex hulls, and more. The value in reading A Discipline of Programming is to absorb and understand the way that Dijkstra thought about these problems, which for some, is more valuable than to have a collection of a thousand algorithms.
