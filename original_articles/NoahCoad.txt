Hello those's on Ward's World Wide Wiki (WWWW) :)

My name is Noah Coad and I'm currently a Program Manager on Microsoft Visual Studio.  My hobbies extend to playing ice hockey, building electronic gizmos with microcontrollers, pushing bits into the CPU via C# code, sharing fragments of the mind through blogging, modulating the RF spectrum with Amateur Radio (HAM) activities, creating modulated pressure waves via a guitar + piano, and most importantly spending time with my lovely wife and child (Benjamin is 9 months at the time of writing this).

I tend to hang out at these virtual environments:
* My Blog, http://coadblog.com
* My Home, http://noahcoad.com
* Twitter, http://twitter.com/noahcoad
* Facebook, http://facebook.com/noahcoad

My favorite Ward pages are:
* Cybords, http://c2.com/cybords/
* IRLP Node, http://c2.com/~ward/irlp/
* Microwave Light, http://c2.com/~ward/microwave/

BTW, did you come from one of this page? RecentVisitors, PeopleIndex

(p.s. thanks to Ward for making his wiki an open and and enjoyable experience)
