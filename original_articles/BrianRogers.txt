	* [2003 September 01] Brian is a tool.  Love, Chris

	* [2003 July 29] Hey Brian, this is EricHerman, you should put a link to the game that you developed in school on this page. Also, a friend of mine (BrettNeumeier) is looking for a name for a little CeeLanguage project that he's working on: it's a filter that takes data from StandardIn and compresses and encrypts it and passes it to StandardOut. (He plans to add it as a filter to tar, but I suppose it could be of use in other scenarios.) Anyway, you're good with pop-culture, so I thought you'd be a good person to set to thinking about what would make a good name for the teeny utility. Cheers.

I graduated from the UniversityOfWashington in 2003 with a degree in ComputerEngineering.

I am living in the SeattleWashington area. Currently, I work for MicroSoft.

In the past, I have had internships with WeyerHaeuser and ProductSight.  Interestingly enough, Weyerhaeuser was where I first heard a formal description of ExtremeProgramming.  And Product Sight was the first place [and only place, so far] I actually participated in it.

I believe in using a variety of languages, each for a given purpose.  I've been getting into the CsharpLanguage lately (see: employer).  C# seems good for Win32 stuff, but the JavaLanguage is still the best for friendly portable code.  Although I don't use it much in practice, I still do a little CeePlusPlus (or even CeeLanguage!) for "fun."

I happen to love the PerlLanguage.  It's not for everyone, of course (WhyHatePerl). In my last job, I was known as the resident PerlHacker.  If you ever need to rename 250 files or extract comments out of a series of source files ....
