An involuntary? reflex - basically like Pavlov's dog. ''(a reflex is by definition involuntary:-) )''

Example: (from LecturingToIdiots page)

	 :	More likely the lecturer is an intolerant blowhard who accepts no ideas but his own. People are diverse. Get used to it. 

It would appear that this author comes from a culture/educational system in which all authority is considered suspect, and in which respect for others is denigrated.  (He) therefore automatically responds by assuming the problem is with the lecturer.  He then throws out a slogan/mantra that he has been taught, without explanation, that has very little to do with the issue at hand.
