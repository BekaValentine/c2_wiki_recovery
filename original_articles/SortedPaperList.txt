The purpose of the SortedPaperList
* is to quickly accept papers that should be accepted
* reject papers that should be rejected
* thus saving time for discussion of papers that needed to be discussed at the OopslaProgramCommitteeMeeting. 
I used the accept/reject recommendations to sort the papers by how many accepts each got minus how
many rejects. 
Any paper with only accepts was automatically accepted, any paper with only rejects was automatically
rejected (it presumably wouldn't have a PaperChampion).
