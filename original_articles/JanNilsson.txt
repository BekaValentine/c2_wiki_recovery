WOW I think I'm here :-)

Me = computer consultant born 1957, living in Karlstad, Sweden.
Started my work in the summer of 82'.
Since 95, I run my own bizniz, proIT i Karlstad AB http://www.proitkarlstad.se (not much there...)

I am from Sweden and English is NOT my primary language, so please excuse any misspelled word.

Please also excuse me if any of my postings appear to be insulting - I will NEVER be insulting on purpose, it must be due to my poor English knowledge.

Experienced in db-design (relational mostly but also network).
I have worked using a few languages from Basic to Cobol different 4GL and now Java.
In later years, I have turned more and more to design and implementation of my design for infrastructure in larger systems from db-design, templates for programming, standards in programming and stuff like that.

Java is getting more and more familiar :-)

Right now (Aug-2001), in the middle of investigating and learning more about J2EE consequences on existing enterprise systems and organizations such as living together with "old" systems, sharing database, training the staff, switching to OO (or almost OO?), using patterns (which ones?).

I intend to sign my postings here with my name but if you CAN find anything useful in my postings - use it!!!!

If you would like to contact me, you can use my company e-mail: mailto:jan@proitkarlstad.se or the email I have at my current customer: mailto:Jan.Nilsson@Pliktverket.se

Most interested in:

J2EE

Patterns

Co-existence between old and new systems and technology

Structure and standards in development

I started the page MigratingToJtwoee to discuss those interests.

That's it for now (Aug 2001)
