''Sir, the JavaMeter detects some small applet activity within a 200 metre radius.''
'' OK, fall back and call for artillery support.''
''Aargh! The applets have got us pinned down and we're being flanked by a dozen servlets.''
''Do you hear that rumbling sound? Oh my god they're deploying EJBs! Nooooo!''
