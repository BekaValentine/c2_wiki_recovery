For some of you who have an itching to fix grammar, spelling, etc.; rather than change other authors' text, how about insert a SicNote next to the alleged problem, along with square brackets? That way you can mark problems without having to change actual text. It's a '''decent compromise''' in my opinion and won't trigger the nasty EditWar''''''s often associated with such edits.

Example:

''The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plane [SicNote: "plain"] according to Dr. Zammo. --Fred''''''Sample''


I thought this page was going to propose the marking of every post with an all-encompassing "[sic]", in order to make the post incorregible in principle, as a desperate measure against GrammarVandal!
