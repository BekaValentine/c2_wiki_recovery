As a shorthand to refer pages in another Wiki, an external Wikipage reference
looks like this: Wiki:WikiPage (e.g. WikiPage referenced from MeatballWiki to WardsWiki).

	* Wiki
	* please add

----
Because WardsWiki is the first of its kind, it has the unique prefix "Wiki".

I don't get it. That syntax doesn't work here. Why should we care what other sites use for off-site references? They should document their stuff there, not here.

I am not sure I like the syntax, anyway. The stuff that comes before the colon should name a protocol, like http or news or ftp. As far as I can tell, you are using it instead to be the name of the site. Isn't this flouting existing conventions and standards? -- DaveHarris

What about dropping the colon and writing WikiWikiPage instead of Wiki:WikiPage? 
The underlying WikiEngine would parse the prefix out and route to the remote WikiEngine accordingly. -- fp

Unless all of the collaborating Wiki Engines conform to the same rules for recognizing links, a prefix won't be sufficient. Classic Wiki, for example, doesn't recognize diacriticals. Also, the engines would some way to map a link name to the URL expected by the target Wiki.
How is Wiki to know that a link to
Foo''''Wiki:WikiPage should map to
"http''''://www.random.org/foowiki?read=WikiPage"?
