Stumbling over RefactorTowardsTheCenterOfThePage in RandomPages I got the idea of formulating a typologie of kinds of WikiMess. 

WikiMess is the generic term for disorder in a wiki.

* WikiChaos - total disorder of all wiki
* RefactorTowardsTheCenterOfThePage - about handling pages grows old and large and unwieldy because being commented on on top and bottom.
* SurfaceRefactoring - about handling pages with multiple blocks of content probably each in ThreadMode or even ThreadMess
* ThreadMess - runaway ThreadMode with disconnected subthreads running in all directions
* InterleavedParallelThreadMode - special case of ditto I guess
* IrrevocableThreadMode - stuck ThreadMode

Minor disorders like those needing RefactorByExtractingToPage, SplitByTopicNotByOpinion, MigrateInlineComment are covered by AcceptableRefactoring.

Dangerously complex, but no mess is NestedThreadMode.
