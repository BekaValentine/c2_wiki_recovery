FeelTheBase is a great utility that can be used as a colorpicker, numberbase converter etc.
FeelTheBase is written by DavidEkholm, this is how the he describe the tool:

	* Have you ever searched for the AsciiCode of some special character or vice versa? 
	* Are you tired of using a calculator to convert numbers between decimal, hexadecimal and binary bases? 
	* Do you want to pick a specific color on screen? 
	* Do you work a lot with IP addresses and net masks? 
	* Do you want to improve your "feel" for how numbers are handled inside the computer? 

If so, you need FeelTheBase. This utility handles numbers in decimal, hexadecimal, binary, text and IP address form simultaneously. A change to any type of number is immediately reflected in its other forms with a mouseclick or return press. It's also a color picker. Grab any color on screen and see it's numeric form.
