I would love to see some SmartPaper like in TheDiamondAge. It would be both like paper and like a computer.

First and foremost, above all else, SmartPaper would have to ''feel'' like hemp paper when I hold it in my hands. If I rest my ink pen on it, the ink dot should grow appropriately. If I draw on it with my pencil, lick my thumb and rub the paper, the pencil marks should smear.

I should be able to wander through my data aimlessly (a'la wiki) or purposefully (a'la a filesystem). Then I should be able to edit it easily.

I should be able to watch the news or a movie on it. 

It should be waterproof, foldable and unbreakable so I can bring it river rafting in case I meet a girl or have a bright idea.

''On the contrary, one of the things that would attract me to SmartPaper would be if when resting my pen on it, ink dots ''didn't'' spread, and if rubbing it with my thumb wouldn't do anything to "pencil" marks at all. Unless, of course, you had it set to "art" mode.''

See: http://www.gyriconmedia.com/SmartPaper.asp for one example of SmartPaper.

I am really attracted to the _true_ reusability of it and the low power consumption. It could very well be what we use for monitors in the near future!
