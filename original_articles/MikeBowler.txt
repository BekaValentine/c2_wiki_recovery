I'm the founder of Gargoyle Software, a Canadian consulting company specializing in improving the development process.  While dabbling in many different technologies, my technical specialities are Java and XML.  On the process side, I specialize in ScrumProcess (I'm a CertifiedScrumMaster) and ExtremeProgramming.

BryanZarnett and I started the TorontoXpUsersGroup and ran it for the first three years before passing it off to LawrenceLudlow.  I'm still involved with the group but am not involved with the day to day organization.
