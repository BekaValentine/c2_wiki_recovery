Previously named Windows Mini Wiki, but discovering another project predates mine, I gave up the claim to the name and declared to rename it as Windows Wiki, aka WW. The next edition will have all code changed to reflect this, and thereafter will be represented to the world as WindowsWiki. -KirkBailey

4/1/07- WW is coming along well. Descending from miniwiki, it is going to be version 1.4.0, and is a nice improvement. Deciding the read warriors out there can give me a tip of it's useful for them, I am releasing it as shareware.

1/5/08 - Complete. Executable self installer is now on the web and available for downloading. 
Try: http://www.freeholdmarketing.com/WW/ and look at the screen capture, then download and try it out.

9/6/09 - Latest edition coming out after labor day. New features, refined CSS which is now a separate page you can play with IF YOU WANT TO. Improved functions. More interesting buried treasure for you to trip over and read and think about. Copyright process completed, offical copyright office paper in frame on the wall over the desk, looks very pretty. Now to figure out how to attract public attention to it, and maybe sell a license to a large commercial user such as the post office or UPS or FedEx...
