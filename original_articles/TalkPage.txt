TalkPage is for HomePage what DiscussionPage is for any other WikiPage.

''This page gives a suggestion for a different way of working on this wiki, which is used elsewhere.''
----
This page is in DocumentMode. The DiscussionPage is here: TalkPageDiscussion
----
'''Explanation:''' The TalkPage concept is to complement the concept of DiscussionPage which suggests to append 'Discussion' to any WikiPage in order to separate DocumentMode of a general WikiPage from ThreadMode of the DiscussionPage. In this light TalkPage is the DiscussionPage of a HomePage.
Since HomePage''''''s are considered a more private space, a page mainly edited by the person under who's name it is, it is also to the discretion of the "owner" of any given HomePage, how they like to handle their MailBox, either as part of their HomePage or as a separate TalkPage. 
----
'''Please do not confuse TalkPage with other concepts like DiscussionPage or NamePage!''' 
* NamePage''''''s are not created by WikiCitizen''''''s of this wiki as their HomePage but '''about''' people of specific interest like AlanTuring. 
* A DiscussionPage created by appending 'Discussion' to the name of your HomePage would indicate not a page to talk '''to you''', but to discuss '''about you''' like you became the subject of a debate.
----
'''Where does it come from?'''
I introduced this concept on 10/2014 shortly after coming to this wiki, on account of my MediaWiki based experience with those TalkPage''''''s. There nearly all WikiPage''''''s got a TalkPage attached to it automatically except for so called SystemMessagePage''''''s. --ManorainjanHolzapfel

'''How to implement':''
* Create a link to your new TalkPage to be on one of the ends of your HomePage, preferably on top, so that you and the visitors to your talk page don't need to scroll.
** format: '''<home_page_name>Talk'''
** Maybe You like to add some words or signs that clarifies for your reader what that means
* Click that link to create your personal TalkPage. 
** Add a BackLink to your HomePage on top of your TalkPage.
** Add CategoryTalkPage at the bottom of your TalkPage.
** Tell Your visitor how you like it, newest on top or bottom. Top is preferred, again because of no scroll.
----
Advantages and disadvantages:
* It is a concept to be used freely on ones own discretion. (which could be seen as disadvantage)
* One has to do it on ones own, gets the possibility but no structural support by any technical implementation. So, how do get people to know about it? When they click on the hopefully provided CategoryHomePage link.
* It helps to prevent that HomePage''''''s get messed up with possibly unsigned comments.
* If you like to search for public discussions http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=Discussion you will not find any personal talk nor documents.
* Nobody needs to make out any sense of the way somebody organised their HomePage. You do not even need to look at it in order to talk to them. So the 'owner' of a HomePage that is complemented by a TalkPage is more free in its form. They do not need to have any consideration for ''talkative'' visitors.
* A TalkPage is an obvious invitation to talk to that WikiCitizen. No need to be shy.
