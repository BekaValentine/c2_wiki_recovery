User Anti-stories are statements made by users, that the thing that you
produce should not do something.  See UserAntiStory.

Contrast with UserStory which defines something that your product should
do for the user.

Compare with a MisuseStory which describes what to do when the user does
something unexpected when trying to get into a UserStory.
