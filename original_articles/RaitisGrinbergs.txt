Raitis Grinbergs is a jack-of-all-trades developer-type. His company even decided not to give him a title.

I am a definite newbie to WikiWikiWeb, but that won't stop me from shooting my mouth off. Fair warning!

I can be reached through ''raitis@raitis.net''. Just don't go looking for a web site... after doing that for a living for a while, I've decided that I'm just as happy without one for the moment.
