SimpleObjectAccessProtocol (SOAP) related to a family of standards designed for the implementation of WebServices. RestInSoap has links to alternatives to using Soap.

DonBox, the father of Soap who now works for MicrosoftCorporation, wrote an article called "Young person's guide .." that discussed the rationale for having Soap. Link is http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0300/soap/default.aspx.

* ''Deriving SOAP'' from http://www.sys-con.com/story/print.cfm?storyid=39286 is another introduction to the need for a protocol like SOAP.


The official W3C information on Soap is located at http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/

If we go beyond basics, there are demands for SOAP to carry binary (opaque) data, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwebsrv/html/infoset_whitepaper.asp. Another important requirement is to have security enhancements. Additional information can be found at http://www.idevnews.com/TipsTricks.asp?ID=124
