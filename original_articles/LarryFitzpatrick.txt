Love the XP ideal. Now I work in C++ (started using C++ when it was "C with Classes"), on NT (with resignation), and wish I could be back using Python. I am looking for ways to support XP in this environment. Already found lots of good stuff here!

I live in the DC area and would love to converse with other locals about XP.
