Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that  happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have  nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent. 

This is a good StartingPoint for people who NeedToKnow.

Also NeedToKnow has been applied in industry and government to proprietary and security matters. One may have been cleared to receive such critical information, but not have as a result of their responsibilities an obvious need for it. This has a potential flaw whereby it may be abused to protect concerns other than those it was intended to protect. In an open Society, those who belong to it may expect (though not actually receive) access to the matters and material belonging to that open Society. As a result of economic Issues, most people in the present Society do not belong to the open Society, resulting in some Key Things not being open To Scrutiny.

As a seeker Of Knowledge, I use the term NeedToKnow to as classification Term. Since I have limited Knowledge, and magnitude of what I NeedToKnow greatly exceeds what I presently Know, I feel the need to come up with a strategy and an apparatus to enlarge the smaller Of The Two. In March of 2008, I began a project to discover, design and utilize a device I call an information Repository, which is basically a list of things Reachable, some of which I can say are Known, but most of which I can say are Not Known. It is by building this repository that I can furnish for use, the device for BecomingCompetent, both in general Knowledge and in specialized Disciplines. Anyone can do this. It is hard Work, but it can yield meaningful Results, which I will attempt to find Out For Myself. I have a lot of catching Up To Do, with a limit imposed out of necessity as to where, how Far Back, and to What Extent, the search will go. -- DonaldNoyes.20080313.1533.m05
