The process of generating "skeleton" code that requires human intervention before it will compile or function properly.

The above does not quite match the definitions I've read.  What I thought Passive Code Generation meant was that it's a one-time, non-repeatable process (such as a wizard).  Just because the process cannot be repeated does not mean the resulting code necessarily requires human intervention before it will function (though it might.  It just means that human intervention will be required in order to make any required changes later.
