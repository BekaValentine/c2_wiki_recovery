My blog is at http://twelves.blogspot.com and my real name is Tim Twelves.
I'm a software developer / engineer / architect with ~ 10 years experience and personal experience.
I'll put something reasonable here at some point, but for now, it's a list of pages I visit and contribute to.

The pages I've contributed to are listed below. I've got to refactor those at some point in time.

* CommonCriteria
* SecurityTarget
* TargetOfEvaluation
* ManagementIssues
* ManagementCycle
* ContemporaryDevelopmentRoles
* QualityControl
* QualityConcerns
* MentorRole
* AgileProcesses
* TechnicalSpecification
* WhatIsaSpecificationAnyway
* SoftwareDeveloper
* SecurityAuthentication
* EngineeringPrinciples
* SoftwareEngineer

Hi Tim, next time you have a chance to work on SecurityTarget, please add CategorySecurity at end of page, and consider modify / improve the contents of CategorySecurity as well. Cheers and DeleteWhenRead -- dl

'''Will do... will leave this as a note to remind me.  I've got to put quite a bit of time into the CommonCriteria pages.  I just need time.''
