A variety of ThreadMode that exists purely for people on Wiki to encourage one another and affirm one another as human beings in some other way. As one refactors, some stuff ''is'' either too soppy or too sloppy and needs to go.  But don't try to refactor the HumanFactor out of Wiki.

'''Drivel:'''

SoppyThreadMode was once widely known by the term '''Drivel'''. That term being controversial, we're searching for kinder words on ThreadsConsideredDrivel.

''That assumes that all controversial terms should not be used.  Please read RedPenObsession and rethink.  No more appropriate term has yet been suggested than drivel, for me.''

Register a polite complaint in RefactoringNotes so that we learn for next time, or by posting or sending a note to the perpetrator asking them to FixYourWiki. 

''Signing does not imply the right to have notification on any changes, even deletions of your text.  For example, I just enjoyed hugely AlistairCockburn's refactoring of my words in MethodOrMethodology.  I'm so glad he didn't feel the need to notify the three other people involved but just got on with it. If he'd had to synchronise with all three of us, in a very different time zone, surely the refactoring would never have happened. -- RichardDrake''

That's one argument to refactor ''and'' archive is all about -- it allows you to try a big refactoring without the danger of really messing it up. If you don't like it later you can put it back, or you or another author can try again. There are a range of choices between forcing your will onto a situation and sitting idly by. -- PhilGoodwin

Everybody needs to vent strong emotions from time to time. Sometimes it's fear, sometimes anger, sometimes awe at the oneness of the universe. Venting is fine. Has to happen. Go ahead. But don't get pissed when someone separates the venting, which was good for you, from the rest of the message, which is good for everyone. This is a FeatureNotaBug. You don't have to edit yourself so strongly on Wiki. You can go ahead and vent without worrying that someone will see it two years later and think you are stupid. The small price you pay is that someone else decides.

''Yes, venting is fine.  HyperVenting is using two or more linked pages to vent. It can be more of a release but may be harder to refactor. HyperVentilating on the other hand is simply dangerous.''

''You can go ahead and vent without worrying that someone will see it two years later and think you are stupid. The small price you pay is that someone else decides.''

I disagree. You should worry very much that someone else will see what you've written two years down the road and think that you are stupid. Someone else should '''absolutely not''' decide for you. What makes them think they know better than you what you mean to say. 

''In my view Wiki gives them full permission to do this at any time. Everyone needs to face this. It's what makes this medium unique. I'd suggest: rejoice in this fact or leave.''

Some stuff is out of bounds and should be deleted as soon as it shows up: abuse, obscenities, things that are too controversial to be discussed rationally, graffiti and vandalism ought to be deleted as soon as they are noticed with a polite note as appropriate. 

''Agreed, except the polite note is very optional.''

Otherwise please write and edit your work as if you are going to be held accountable in the future.

''Agreed, up to a point.  But do not assume that more than one person will ever read it. That person may decide to delete it (for example because it's a point of view already better expressed elsewhere). This has very, very seldom happened but everyone should be aware of the possibility.'' 

And edit the work of others with a light touch.

''No, do everything you can to ImproveSignalAndReadability. That needs some radical editing of much of Wiki.  This takes terrific skill, so consult as much as possible. But be radical.''

If you think it needs more bring that to the attention of the original author.

''Very impractical once the number of authors of a piece of ThreadMode is greater than one, which is kinda normal. This is one reason why so little editing has been done. Much better that every writer faces up to the risk, as above.''

ThreadMode can be broken up into sections. It reads rather well that way actually. It can be moved. It can be refactored and archived or DeletedAndArchived. There are a range of choices, Richard, it may not be as dramatic or fun as being radical, but being careful and respectful is probably more likely to lead to a positive result. -- PhilGoodwin

I for one am not willing to do either. I think that this is wrong and I intend to stay right here and say so. Arguing is hard and it's unpleasant, I don't like it but I'm willing to do it in order to make things better. I invite you to take the option of neither completely agreeing with me nor leaving in a huff. Let's find a way to coexist and be comfortable. We aren't that far apart, we both think that there are messy spots on Wiki and we both want to clean them up. I'm sure that we can find a way for each of us to be able to see what we want to see without having to view what we perceive to be junk. -- PhilGoodwin
