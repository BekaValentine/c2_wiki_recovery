See NullObject.

Sometimes you will not want a NullObject to do nothing at all - just not to do something in particular. Or is this another pattern? -- NikitaBelenki 

You are absolutely right. Very often, NullObjects do something, rather than nothing. They tend to implement "default" behaviour, which is the reason why I tend to refer to this as the DefaultObject pattern. -- AnthonyLauder
