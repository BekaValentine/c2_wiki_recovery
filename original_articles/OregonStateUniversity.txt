Institution of higher education located in Corvallis Oregon; the main science/engineering school in the state.  Desires to be a top-tier engineering instutition--it ain't bad--though a lack of state funding seems to foil these plans.  Also well known for ag programs, including forestry--OSU was once a proud member of the family of "aggies".  (Now its mascot is the beaver.  Ward, please don't be hard on the Beavers on your Wiki--sorry, it had to be said).
