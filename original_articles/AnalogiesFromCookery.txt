One of the NewAnalogiesForSoftware.

Apart from the tech-mainstream uses of "recipe" and "cookbook" as technical terms, there's also:
* Taste EarlyAndOften (if producing a product with many components, such as a French apricot tart, engage in UnitTasting)
* ThreeStarRestaurants has the same connotations to me, negative as well as positive, as ThreeStarProgrammer''''''s
**''Yeah, but what about 4 or 5 star restaurants?'' 
** CapabilityMaturityModel
* ElizabethDavid's FrenchProvincialCooking could be glossed as CookTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork (and a reaction to BigCuisineUpFront)
* If it smells bad, TossIt

Cooking also displays the ultimate in PlanToThrowOneAway and EvolutionaryDelivery, but to a large degree deprecates reuse.
-- FrankCarver

Depends where you draw the analogy. A recipe is reusable - indeed, recipes evolve and fork like software projects, and exhibit their own PatternLanguage. And if you refactor your fridge mercilessly (on the principle of YouArentGonnaEatIt) you can end up with a collection of, uh, stock components which can be used both to solve new instances of familiar problems, and as usefully high-level abstractions for the experimentation process that leads to solving new problems.

Many people of my generation learned to program by typing in listings from magazines - not unlike how many people learn to cook. Today magazines have the programs on CD-ROM. Make one person follow a recipe; take another to a restaurant. Both subsist; only one learns how to cook. -- PeterHartley

A friend in the catering industry told me that really is a people business, because almost ''anyone'' in the supply chain can mess up your product, so you have to make everyone understand what's important. -- SteveFreeman

One can take this too literally and program in ChefLanguage.
