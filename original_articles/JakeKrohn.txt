Always looking for bigger and better things.
 
Programming is a necessary evil.
* You mean for companies, or personally? Regardless, is it inherently evil, or is it fixable? (or were you just confessing that '''your''' programming is evil? Or in need of exorcism?)
 
1. The evil is inherent. In practice, programming rarely lives up to the ideals set for it. Encountering this is a discouraging experience.

2. I like to think I'm one of the good guys.
