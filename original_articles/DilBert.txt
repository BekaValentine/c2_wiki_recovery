WikiName for "Dilbert" which is a comic strip by ScottAdams and distributed in USA by UnitedFeaturesSyndicate, Inc.
----
''Cubicle dwellers sell their souls. At cost.''

Dilbert is an engineer for an unnamed dysfunctional company, with a clueless PointyHairedBoss who picks up every fad that comes by, but understands none. His coworkers are slackers, backstabbers, and paranoids.  His dog, DogBert, is an evil consultant. As of 9 Jan 2003, the latest fad for the PointyHairedBoss is ExtremeProgramming. Should be very painful for DilBert.
