AdamHill (adamhill@pobox.com) is a contract programmer currently working for ARCO Oil and Gas.

We are currently embarked on a multi year training project for Well Control School. We are doing something quite radical:

	1. Building small pieces of information that can be strung together as needed. Tentatively called "nuggets".
	2. Delivering '''the exact same''' training locally and remotely (intranet/web server) via browsers.
	3. Trying to use in as much ExtremeProgramming as I can :-)

I also have worked on a cool multi-user drilling rig using Java, VRML and 4 small Akia computers that can be taken anywhere in the world.
