This is for the metadiscussion about WikiTopics. Since there are no hard and fast rules what should be on this Wiki and what not, there is a need for a lot of discussion and consensus-finding what should be left and what should be removed.

To help newcomers not to start with the same questions which already have been answered several times, all related pages should be made more accessible by linking them to this category.
