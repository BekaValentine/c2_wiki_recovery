Hi all,
my name is Simone, I live in Ferrara (Italy) where I was born on 5 August 1978. I've found this community searching the internet for informations about CeePlusPlus, DesignPattern and things like this, looking for something useful in my everyday job (at http://www.4p-online.com).

I think I'm too inexperienced to be really useful to this community, but I hope, one day, to be as useful to newbies like this community member were to me. Ah, forgive my poor english too!

gee, I'm reading latest RobertMartin book, I'd like very much if my company was able to follow the principles that are exposed on it. One question though.. how am I supposed to test GUI components? this question really puzzles me.
