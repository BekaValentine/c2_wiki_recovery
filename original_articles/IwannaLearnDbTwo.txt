If you have no UnixCulturalAssumption''''''s and are not a MicrosoftSlave, then learn DbTwo instead.

''Why no UnixCulturalAssumption''''''s? It runs on LinuxOs and Aix. Or is it just because the Oracle people are Long''''''Haired''''''Unix''''''Hippies''?

I left out Unix and PC because DbTwo is not the most popular database on these platforms, and also because the roots of DbTwo stay with MainframeComputer, and other implementations will have to match its capabilities over time (e.g. security aspects). -- dl

There are versions of this product for desktop machines, I am not sure whether there are free crippled versions for endusers. I did hear that over time, the desktop version looked more like the BigBlue version.
