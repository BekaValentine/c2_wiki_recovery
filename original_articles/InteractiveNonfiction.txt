As opposed to make-believe (''why?''), interactive non-fiction is the interaction of real-people through an intermediary about real-issues, real-decisions, and reality. This wiki is an example of InteractiveNonfiction. Here, we discuss and debate, conduct dialogue and open for examination and review our thoughts, ideas and knowledge.
