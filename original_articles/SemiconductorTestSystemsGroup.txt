This is the group at Tektronix that built the LT-1000 semiconductor tester.  RikSmoody got the project started on Smalltalk.  WardAndKent introduced a handful of patterns in a crash effort to redirect the effort.  The patterns have been recounted many times in the HistoryOfPatterns starting with an early OOPSLA (http://c2.com/doc/oopsla87.html).

	* WindowPerTask
	* FewPanes
	* StandardPanes
	* ShortMenus
	* NounsAndVerbs

The patterns were presented verbally.  I've only bothered to write them down now that they are so often cited.  Most recently I rewrote them as a series of sketches on an index card ...

I got to present this with one of those nifty TV overhead cameras that could zoom in and fill the screen with the images.  You may notice that ShortMenus also provides the means to change tasks and that StandardPanes was inadvertently left out all together. -- WardCunningham
