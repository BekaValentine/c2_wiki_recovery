Code with many references attributes or methods of another object
can be simplifed by introducing a "With ... End With" block.
This can be particularly effective if a complex expression is repeated
with every reference.

Languages:
	* VbClassic
	* PascalLanguage

Alternatives:
	* Consider IntroduceLocalVariable to evaluate a complex expression in only one place.
	* FeatureEnvy: Consider ExtractMethod and MoveMethod to put the code in the object where the attributes lie.  IntroduceForeignMethod if the target object can't be changed.

Related Refactorings:
	* RefactorEliminateWith if it's too sparsely used, or to remedy the FeatureEnvy smell "With" blocks often emit.

'''[Examples]'''

In VbClassic:
from...
	rsObject.Open ...
	If rsObject.R''''''ecordCount = 0 Then
	  rsObject.A''''''ddNew
	  rsObject!PK = value
	End If
	rsObject!Attr = value

to...
	With rsObject
	  .Open ...
	  If .R''''''ecordCount = 0 Then
	    .A''''''ddNew
	    !PK = value
	  End If
	  !Attr = value
	End With

PascalLanguage:
from...
	emp.name       := "Joe";
	emp.status     := "X";
	emp.bday.month :=    6;
	emp.bday.day   :=   27;
	emp.bday.year  := 1958;
to...
	with emp do
	begin
	  name   := "Joe";
	  status := "X";
	  with bday do
	  begin
	    month :=    6;
	    day   :=   27;
	    year  := 1958;
	  end
	end

Applicability to other languages:
Applies to any language supporting the "with" shorthand.
Examples:  Pascal

-----
The refactoring can be done one step further, by removing the variable completely:

(Example in VbClassic)
from...
	set rst = dbs.T''''''ableDefs("tblWhatEver").O''''''penRecordset(dbOpenTable)
	If not rst.EOF() Then
	  rst.A''''''ddNew
	  rst!PK = value
	  rst.Update
	  rst.Close
	End If
	Set rst = Nothing

to...
	With dbs.T''''''ableDefs("tblWhatEver").O''''''penRecordset(dbOpenTable)
	  If not .EOF() Then
	    .A''''''ddNew
	    !PK = value
	    .Update
	    .Close
	  End If
	End With
