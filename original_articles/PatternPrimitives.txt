The PatternPrimitives page was prompted by the question "What are patterns made of?", it's not a definitive answer. More like a sketch of a beginning of an answer.

The question will strike some as ridiculous, after all a
pattern is an emergent property, irreducible, remove any
part and the pattern vanishes.

Also the whole page brings into question many of the assumptions made by the alexandrine style of formal patterns that has such a history here.

Are the concepts listed above patterns in their own right that we have used so much that we no longer consider them patterns? --LarryPrice

Perhaps all design patterns can be boiled down to selections between two choices:
	* Add indirection to manage flexibility
	* Remove indirection to improve performance

Kinds of indirection:
	* Reification
	* Polymorphism
	* Delegate to method(s)
	* Delegate to object(s)
	* Record and defer
	* Reference indirection
	* Conditionals

Things that can be redirected:
	* Data flow
		* Object references
		* Object creation
	* Control flow
		* Queries
		* Commands

''Very nice classification approach -- which patterns fail to fit anywhere?''

Which patterns describe ''removing'' indirection?

Several of the RefactoringPatterns, such as InlineMethod, remove unnecessary indirection.  Also some OptimizationPattern''''''s   remove indirection to improve performance.

There are some thoughts about this in the pattern detection research field.  There's a paper [1] that uses "fragments" which include "classes, methods, parameters, using relations, inheritance relations, and containment relations."
