Vaporum auto edit 1.0 is a wiki-style web space. Runs off text files and 3 short scripts - display, edit and write.

Is short of some key features - recent changes for instance - but that should be there soon.

Is different from wiki in that you can use html [though gives you short-cuts for breaks, bold and italic]

Am quite pleased with it though, only took a few hours ;)

yours ever
