SatherLanguage was essentially an EiffelLanguage 2.0 subset, which has then evolved and added/modified features, such as ContraVariance, TypeCase and:

''iteration abstraction, higher order routines, object constructors, routine and iter overloading''

...whatever those things are.

Like Eiffel, it can be compiled into C for maximum portability.

''Um, wouldn't iter overloading be like defining the method __iter__() in python?  (as in, a generator method, of course...)''
