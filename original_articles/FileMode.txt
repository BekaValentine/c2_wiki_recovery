As opposed to DocumentMode and ThreadMode pages (see also WikiModes): 

FileMode pages are usually created through the misguided efforts of inexperienced wiki refactorers. 

FileMode pages present a shapeless clump of vaguely related information adhering to no distinction and conveying no consensus. 

FileMode pages often conceal gems that once were pages in their own right, but it takes a patient and determined reader to discover these now. 

FileMode is strongly discouraged on WikiWikiWeb - refactorers take heed.

When you see a page in FileMode it is usually better to fix it and not waste time making yet another WikiBadge for it. FixYourWiki.

AnswerMe please:

The above describes what's wrong with FileMode, and how it comes about---but it doesn't really describe what it is.  I've read this page from top to bottom and I still can't figure out just what makes a FileMode page a FileMode page.

Any examples here on Wiki?

Hopefully not, but you might consider WikiWikiSandBox an example (though it really is AppendMode).
