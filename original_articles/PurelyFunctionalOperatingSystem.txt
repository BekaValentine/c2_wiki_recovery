Purely functional operating systems emphasize DeclarativeProgramming, and avoidance of MutableState and nondeterminism in programming applications. The OS itself may or may not be written in a purely FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.  The most notable examples are GoboLinux and the actively maintained NixOs.

This is an active area of research, although with few practical implementations. Some references (were dead links to citeseer):

The referred articles seem not to be available online. The references to CleanLanguage and Famke (the functionas OS) are broken.
