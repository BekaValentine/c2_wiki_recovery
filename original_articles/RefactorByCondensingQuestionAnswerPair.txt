'''Often you will see a question and answer pair posted in the "thread" of a Page'''.

One could easily refactor by combining the question and answer into a single statement or a single WikiName, followed by one or more statements in the new WikiPage. After this is done, it might be a good idea to move the statement closer to the top of the page, perhaps adding it to the initial description or immediately following it.

Score extra points for integrating the answer into other text on the page.

This can also be used when writing the original answer, preventing the thread from getting ThreadMess''''''ed and needing refactoring in the first place.  Instead of responding to the question, delete it and replace it with the answer.

The person refactoring may wish to retain the signature of the answer (and possibly the question) by adding "contributor(s): " at the end (RefactorWhileRespectingSignatures).

If the person refactoring wishes to ensure that the contributors review the changes, they may try to catch their attention by adding a note and a link on each contributor's page. 

This refactoring comes in two major forms: 
	* Question + Answer => Explanation
	* Statement + Question + Answer => Statement with explanation
