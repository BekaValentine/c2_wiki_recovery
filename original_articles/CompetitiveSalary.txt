Competitive, of course depends on who the company feels it competes with.

When I worked at Chevron, they said, "The top three oil companies."  

At GE, they said, "Upper third of industrial research labs and national labs." The national labs, of course, do not pay nearly as well, in many cases, as more risky industrial jobs.

At CTC, they said, "National medians for similar positions in industry and the government."  Here we're no longer trying be at the front of the pack, but are aiming for the middle.

So, who are you competing with?

A CompetitiveSalary might not be enough for a company to retain its top talent.
