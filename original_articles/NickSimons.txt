Nick has worked on a variety of LowCeremonyMethod''''''s with a variety of Wiki thinkers such as MichaelJackson, TomGilb and RichardDrake since the 1980s.  Most of all he has the annoying habit of delivering working code, on time and within budget.  

As Nick once famously remarked of some noted method colleagues as they expressed yet more disdain for the nastier details of programming: "They think it's ''beneath'' 
them - in fact it's ''beyond'' them"

Other one-liners from Nick that I have appreciated over the years include:

* "I'm not a pedant in the strict sense of the term"
* "Well done, you've taken a small simple problem and broken it down into a large number of more difficult ones"
* "So take your favourite ingredients from a number of methodologies, stir well and cook until half-baked"
* "Better a little increment than a lot of excrement"

And then there's the less polite ones ...

* ''Nick, AreYouThere?''
* ''December 12, 2006; last edited February 16, 2001.''
