''Suggested Pattern for a New WikiCitizen adding to this page: Read it before you write to it.''

I moved some suggestions for WikiWiki that seem to have been taken care of, but still have information value, to WikiWikiSuggestionsResolved. I was pretty conservative, so there are probably more suggestions that should be moved. Maybe we should also have a page WikiWikiSuggestionsDismissed, but it's for Ward to decide what goes there. -- FalkBruegmann

I considered removing the reasons from the suggestions, but felt that was too drastic. -- Someone''''''Else

Oh WikiMaster''''''s, please bless this page with elegant touches, for it has been Thread Bane for many aeons. -- JamesCrook

'''Suggestions that have been implemented already'''

If pointing out that a suggestion has already been done, please mention it here and then delete the question-answer pair after a few months when it is likely to have been read. See also WikiWikiSuggestionsResolved!

* Add <META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX"> on the EditText page... too many Google searches end up on an Edit page. ''However, Google sometimes finds what one wants only on such an Edit page.''
* Change to edit box size. Use: rows=34&cols=120&edit=whatever.
** Now I want it as a cookie. Ward has now made width=100% by default, but I would like a cookie that has the number of rows in it so I don't have to alter the URI every time I go to edit a page.

'''Suggestions that solve a problem that isn't a problem:'''

* More security - Not needed. See WhyWikiWorks.
** Current circumstances suggest that this (WhyWikiWorks) is no longer the case
* Single word WikiNames, e.g. 'Consensus'. -- DaveSmith
** ''We use ReFactor and similar workarounds.''
** There's a suggestion on the page WikiSingleWordProblem. -- AndrewMartin
* Only first occurrence of each 'WikiName' on page shown hyperlinked, others as 'Wiki Name' -- RichardKulisz
** ''If you really must, you can do it by hand.''
* PreviewButton on the editing page -- DavidChess
** ''Or just click 'Save' and let the server do it?''.
* HolyWar - Could we please restore the old WikiBackgroundColor.
* When a WikiName links to an existing page, restore the spaces between its words when rendering the page.

'''WHERE:''' ''Wiki Admin waits for / joins in discussion''

''For the 'Less Concrete Proposals' the ideas would need discussing before / if they will become part of this Wiki. Some of that discussion may happen on the proposers home page, so it is worth looking at these people's home pages for interesting discussions too.''

* Postponement of refactoring until demanded by community - automagically enforced. (WikiRefactoringNotYet, also BalancingReadersWritersAndEditors)
* Technical fix for WikiNamePluralProblem, ''anyone any ideas how?'' -- Stefan Kapusniak (WikiNamePluralProblemTechFix)
* Some scheme that would allow different instances of WikiWikiWeb to be created as people discovered the need (Wiki Instances) ''anyone any ideas how?'' -- RonaldHayden ''for people to use as a possibly paid-for service? see also BrianEwins implemented suggestions on Name spaces for multiple wikis.
* Some cleaner system for InternationalCharacterSets, e.g. based on the Celtic Language Newsgroup Conventions. ''But the parser should understand that umlauts are letters, too. Sh?W?''
* Some solution to LinkRot. ''anyone any suggestions?''.
* Wiki Page Comment Rating -- WillSargent. ''anyone any suggestions how?''.
* Wiki Export Formats -- StephenWynne.
* Mark Content As Thread. The suggested syntax is --xMySignature where x = [0-9] representing the number of days before that contrib would vanish. -- LarryPrice
* Spell checking of page names to avoid Redundent''''''Payges :) -- RussellGold ''needs more detail''
* ''#redirect anotherpage'' (sample use: to help clean up "xxx singular of xxxs" pages.)
* Notify List - users with Home Pages can request e-mails when certain pages change (daily or weekly e-mail). -- AndyPierce
* Can we agree on a wiki acronym convention like writing "CaAcrYagni" instead of "YAGNI". (CaAcrYagni stands for "YAGNI acronym in all caps")?
** Ugh ... that sure is ugly! Perhaps instead any ALLCAPS string longer than (say) three characters could be considered a LinkPattern?

'''Places where ideas are/have been tried out:'''

''AnswerMe:'' Can someone change these to hyperlinks?? Do we need to move this to Wiki''''''Ideas''''''Tried''''''Elsewhere?

* AustinDavid's KWiki does something like this (concatenate several pages for editing, so making refactoring easier) when you ask for the detailed treeview, IIRC.
* DaveHarris's Spike uses a ? before a name to indicate a WikiName and _ in a name in place of spaces.
* MartinPool's PikiPiki links logo gif to RecentChanges page.
* http://ch.twi.tudelft.nl/~mostert/striki/namestruct.pl?WikiWikiSuggestions
for a working prototype (of LikePages) -- JeroenMostert. ''LikePages is now standard. Cool.''
* MeatballWiki has a neat ''#redirect anotherpage'' feature.

'''With apologies, some words of wisdom, taken a bit out of context... -- The''''''Refactorer'''

Wiki's refusal to accept single words as concepts worth explaining often leads to increased precision in naming concepts. Consider replacing AComputer with a DigitalComputer or a PersonalComputer. I recommend using singular names unless the concept is always plural. This can lead to awkward usage, for which I apologize. -- WardCunningham

Don't think the wiki ''heritage'' is being ignored. By studying the server logs, I have determined that WikiReadingHabits are diverse. -- WardCunningham

I don't think it would be good if wiki spent that much energy talking about itself. I'll remove the fluff. -- WardCunningham
----
'''New and unfiled suggestions'''

''Gnomes: please help out by moving suggestions to WikiWikiSuggestionsSimple, WikiWikiSuggestionsMedium and WikiWikiSuggestionsDifficult as appropriate.''

* Timestamp on XChanges pages entries, so I can tell where I left off reading.
* An EditPage checkbox to modify a page anonymously.
* An entry point along the lines of http:shorts.cgi, listing "old pages" (either pages by age, oldest first; or pages older than some cutoff).
* WikiWeb needs to have some kind of summary feature, so lazy users like me don't have to click into each and every article to figure out what it is (a la slashdot). ''LikePages?''
* Change the details of an empty page such that it returns a 404 error (content stays the same though). This would make wiki play nicer with the search engines. For example, http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=rawls+moral+philosophy returns an empty wiki page as its first result.
* WikiTables, like QuickiWiki and TwikiClone do.

''EditHint: Much of the rest of this page might benefit by moving to the proposers' home pages''

'''Wiki Name Inheritance Schemes'''

Some of my wikis provide an inheritance scheme for name scoping. I've explored single-inheritance. I imagine a multiple-inheritance approach would be a win.

One Wiki per subject. New wiki are created with a back-pointer to the wiki from which it was spawned, so we have a tree of namespaces. These are searched in last-to-first order. For Lispers, a name space looks like a Lisp "environment". I define a CommonWiki that has all the usability pages. Individual Wikis inherit the common pages.

-- TomStambaugh

'''Implementation Details'''

A couple of suggestions...in WikiBase you use $&. I don't know which version of Perl you have but there are performance penalties for using that - much better with recent perls (it used to add about 50% to the running time, now its about 10%) - anyway it still helps if you bracket your regexp and use $1 (say) instead.

In my own WikiClone I used [a-z]{3,}: as the protocol pattern - you'll find that (for example) 'https', 'ldap', 'javascript' and 'about' links don't work on this Wiki instance, and the above stops you worrying about the ever growing list of url protocols.

-- BrianEwins

----

'''Caching details'''

It'd be great if some kind of 'Last-Modified:' HTTP-Header could be added to the pages. This would solve most problems with webcaches.

''It's not quite that simple. For one, most web servers don't honor the "If-Modified-Since" HTTP request header for CGIs. And if they did, there's another issue: If you base the last-modified date on the underlying database entry or file, you risk missing other transitions that effect the visual representation of the page, such as an embedded Wiki link transitioning from inactive to active.''

	 :	One method I've thought of implementing in my wiki clone is a system of caching formatted pages to disk ...
		* if the file exists, serve it
		* if it doesn't, build it, save it, serve it
		* if a page gets created, delete all backlink files
		* if a page gets deleted, delete all backlink files
		* if the TextFormattingRules change, then delete all cached pages

	 :	Thus, only the first read of any page incurs the processing expense, and all subsequent reads come straight from disk.

	 :	It's assumed that
		* there are many more ''reads'' than there are ''creates'' or "deletes", even if weighted by the number of back links,
		* ''deleting a file'' is a trivial processor expense,
		* reading a pre-formatted page from disk is less expensive than reading the page from the database and then formatting it.

	 :	Thinking more .. if the wiki in question allows for customizable header/footer per user preferences, then what would be saved to disk would be NakedWiki which gets wrapped with a simpler cgi (still less expense than formatting each time).

''(Is there a page to specifically discuss this idea of caching pre-rendered wiki pages? Perhaps FilesystemBasedWiki?)''

'''Wiki''''''Wiki'''''' email list'''

Set up an email list server for WikiOnWiki and other ephemeral content. Put a link at the bottom of every page that says something like: "Send comments to list" and opens a new mail to the list with the page name as the subject. The link could also be on the edit page. We'd also need a link in order to (un)subscribe to the list, perhaps on RecentChanges.

''It might eliminate a fair amount of noise here. There are certainly conversations that go on that would be better suited to email.''

This is one reason why people should sign what they write, and have an email address on their home page. I've received ''lots'' of email from fellow Wikians this way that has probably prevented quite a lot of noise content on Wiki. -- JohnPassaniti

----
Change the implementation of making FullSearch. Currently, all titles are linked to http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch, which is unfortunate. They should instead be linked to http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?PageName, and this has several reasons:

* The BrowserCache in opera gets messed up. The OperaBrowser does not try to reload the page because it assumes it already has the page in the cache.
* I cannot do a FullSearch from another page about a category. http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?CategoryCategory would be useful. [''Just do http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?search=CategoryCategory.'']
* The usage of the RefererHeader is InMyHumbleOpinion a hack.

I don't have any references ready, but I don't think opera has a bug when caching the page. Furthermore, I think a WebBrowser does not have to send the RefererHeader.

WardCunningham''''''s answer on this on the page WikiWikiSuggestionsResolved is: ''The search uses HTTP_REFERER. If you block this then it won't work. I use this obscure mechanism because it keeps dumb spider software from issuing zillions of searches. -- Ward''

In this case, you should define RobotsDotTxt.

''Didn't work. Email-sniffing spam-feeding spiders ignore RobotsDotTxt. The DenialOfService they caused is what inspired the current FullSearch implementation.''

Here's one I wasn't able to find here already -
A lot of pages are book/movie references without much discussion. It would be nice if they could be collected several to a page, but that would require a WikiName that referenced an anchor in a page of another name. Perhaps a CompoundWikiName would work? -- PeteHardie

----
Being a RecentChangesJunkie, I think the personal home pages (CategoryHomePage) should be filtered out of, or put in a separate block at the end of the quickChange pages. -- AlainRavet
----
Suspend TextFormattingRules in <PRE></PRE> blocks.

 re.sub(r"''(.*)''",r'<I>\1</I>',text)

This python RegularExpression to implement wiki italics is itself mauled in display by Wiki's text formatting. I noticed this kind of thing trying to read some of the code for ShortestWikiContest. -- AndyPierce

''A special syntax for suspending text formatting would perhaps be better.''
----
One that I can think of is integration with the navigation bar in recent builds of MoZilla (back, next and up links). I dont know how they would be applicable, but hey... -- AluoNowu
----
Recognize URLs beginning with 'https' as links (or use the pattern suggested above [a-z]{3,}:) -- AlexChapman
----
Recently (in the last month or so), I've been unable to reach c2.com, after sitting down this afternoon and trying to figure out why, it appears the firewall between here and there sets the "TypeOfService" bits for TCP's SYN packets. There is a firewall between here and c2.com that drops packets with the TypeOfService bits set. As I can reach nearly every other website except c2.com, I presume that it's close to c2.com. I've fixed my end not to set the TypeOfService bits at all when sending to c2.com, but how many other people are having the same problem? -- PerryLorier

Adding accesskeys (http://www.alistapart.com/stories/accesskeys/) to all the different links on a wiki page would be handy. We could then access EditText with Alt-E, QuickDiff with Alt-Q, BackLink''''''s (the title) with Alt-B and the FindPage with Alt-F. There are still a few browsers out there that do not support accesskeys, but they would just ignore the attribute. -- JohannesGijsbers (incorporated comment by VickiKerr)

'''Anchors, inner links, PurpleNumber''''''s etc'''

What I think missing in a Wiki is an easy way to create inner links (anchors).
(<a name="#...">; <a href="#...">) ''For a kludge suggestion, see PageAnchor.''

All inner links should result in a list at the top of the page. This feature is absolutely necessary in creating good access to larger pages!

''My take on this is if a page is long and there's a clear subtopic worthy of an anchor, it's probably time to ExtractPage.''
----
CategoryWiki

I respect most of you old farts, but I understand most of you aren't around any longer. 

Furthermore, this wiki is still very much alive, and we should celebrate that by acknowledging precedent.

By precedent in these terms, I mean, we near to incorporate a date/time stamp into each additional comment produced.

I think at first thought that the benefit of having a time stamp on each subsequent comment far outweighs the possibility that any dildo can produce a comment that is completely irrelevant and may, for dexterity, not be eliminated as is the current, wonderful setup.

As I peruse these snippets of wisdom from the ages, I relate this experience to case law. And as much as I'd love to see some precedents vanish and others thrive, dates can be important in considering the weight of comments and the history of computer science.

I don't want to see a reddit jackass scenario, but I think if this is thrive and prosper and be relevant to future nerds, then we must do this. That is all.
