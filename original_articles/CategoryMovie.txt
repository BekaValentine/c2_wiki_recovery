'''[on naming movie pages on this Wiki]'''

''(No agreement has been reached.)''

"When you add a page about a new movie, please end the title of your page with "Movie" - for example, AiMovie. This makes it easy to search or browse Wiki to find pages that are about movies.

''When you add a page about a new movie, please end the title of your page with "The Movie" - for example, AiTheMovie. This makes it easy to search or browse Wiki to find pages that are about movies.''

Please don't. This encumbers normal writing and references, and can look quite redundant (eg. The''''''Princess''''''Bride''''''The''''''Movie). Not only that, it prevents whimsical reuse of the title within normal sentences (and if you don't believe me you should talk to ThePrincessBride on TheThirteenthFloor). Furthermore, this would also then require separate pages for ''The''''''Book'', forcing the splitting of content onto two pages.

I'd suggest instead that ''The''''''Movie'' be suffixed if (a) the movie title itself can't be formed into a WikiName (eg. AI, Brazil), or (b) the WikiName could be confused for some other thing, not just the movie (eg. MaryPoppins and MaryPoppinsTheMovie [not a great example]).

''I also observe that this technique of adding a category to the title of a page conflates two semantic objects, which is a really bad smell.''

'''[Searching for movies]'''

RE: "Is there a site that allows the search for movie titles?"

* http://movies.yahoo.com/
* http://www.imdb.com
** InternetMovieDataBase - recently I wanted to find out some minor casting in a film. Yahoo's site was useless, IMDB gave the the right answer in two clicks.

QuickQuestions

Is there a site that allows the search for movie titles? I thought there is one with a title similar to "What if they started a war and nobody came to it"? If there is no such engine, but you know the correct title, can you help make the correction in my title?

"Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came?" (1970)

Comedy 
"Tony Curtis stars in this outrageous comedy about three non-com service men who work con games, getting into trouble with the sheriff (Ernest Borgnine) and redneck Tom Ewell. Pretty soon, the minor skirmishes have escalated into an all-out war."
"Capturing Mary" (????)
I just saw this movie on Showtime. Its setting is in the early 20th century 1920's to be exact. The actors that star in this film aren't that popular which made it more convincing for the viewer. its really a charming story about a young middle class woman who works her way up to be one of the most interesting journalists of her time. she has the opportunity to mingle with the elite and thats where she would find her true lover. at first it wasnt one of the romance movies we see on tv nowadays, it was very whimsical and weird at the same time. her lover didnt charm her at first. he was rather blunt and a kind of philosophical man who deweled on societies secrets.
