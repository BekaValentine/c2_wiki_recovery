There's an old IsaacAsimov story, supposedly the foundation of CDMA and its sistern, about how old yiddish ladies all talk at the same time. Well, that's BitTorrent. The more people who join the party, the more bits get chucked around until everyone has the same bits. Maybe they should have called it "grapevine".

Except that it only works when there is spare space on the network. At this moment the estimated completion times are in days. Although I can see plenty of peers who have the data, none are sending me any of it. -- JohnFletcher

''You're just failing to use it correctly. I can trivially saturate my 2M/2M connection with a sufficiently well-seeded connection with any well-sed torrent.''
