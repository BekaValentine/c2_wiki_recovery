BruceSchneier is founder and CTO of Counterpane, an Internet security firm:  http://www.counterpane.com

Author of ''AppliedCryptography'', ''SecretsAndLies'', and ''BeyondFear''. He's a frequent critic of poor security practices. It may appear that his primary focus of criticism is MicrosoftSecurity, but they ''are'' the largest target around. To be fair, he has given them due credit for their good security practices, too.

He has a blog: http://www.schneier.com/blog/

And publishes a free monthly newsletter: http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram.html 
* did he said anything about recent (2004+) progress in WebServicesSecurity? For example, will he still consider SOAP a security risk if it is used within the WS-Security context? DeleteWhenCooked
