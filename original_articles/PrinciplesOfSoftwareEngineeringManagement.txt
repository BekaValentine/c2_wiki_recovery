TomGilb: 'Principles of Software Engineering Management.' Addison-Wesley 1988 [ISBN 0201192462]

In the mid-80s - it was available for at least two years in manuscript form with appalling pictures hand-crafted on Tom's beloved Macintosh, which I first read while working as a consultant at Reuters - this book was revolutionary in proposing three techniques as crucial for successful software engineering:

	* Much wider application of metrics to the development and planning process
	* FaganDefectFreeProcess
	* EvolutionaryDelivery.
