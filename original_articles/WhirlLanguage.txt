Whirl is an EsotericProgrammingLanguage designed with two 'rings', a state space, and an instruction tape. Two simple instructions (1 and 0) will rotate the rings, switch rings, and execute instructions. It has been called a T''''''urningTarpit, and certainly is a TuringTarpit. The language has an LLVM (LowLevelVirtualMachine) compiler. See the site http://www.bigzaphod.org/whirl/ for more on the subject.

To help visualize execution (or write code one instruction at a time), someone has developed a flash implementation of the machine: http://www.bigzaphod.org/whirl/Whirl-1.01.swf 

Given how difficult it is to track them, I'm not sure whether MoreDials (rings) would be a good thing. ;-)
