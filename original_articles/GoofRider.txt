Greetings - may I direct your attention to RealNamesPlease?

Jeff, are you there?  (October 1, 2003 : October 24, 2002)
Probably going to move his page and update signatures soon anyway.

Thanks for the heads-up. Whomever it was.

Note that:
* My real name is VERY COMMON.
* My nickname actually uniquely identify me. (Hint: Try googling my real name, then my nickname, and see what you can find)
* You know my real name already, didn't you?
* Why am I being pointed to RealNamesPlease by people who doesn't even have names at all???
** ''The convention on WardsWiki is to use Real Names or not to sign contributions.''

The reason I use my nickname here is simply just that: It uniquely identify me on the net. Using my nickname, anyone can find EVERYTHING I said on the web. My real name is right there. I have nothing to hide.

''No one's accusing you of hiding.  Pointing you to RealNamesPlease is how the community draws attention to its conventions. You are free to ignore the convention, as you choose.''
