''Bringing Design To Software''

http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0201854910.01._PE_PI_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg
[ISBN 0201854910] From the back cover: ''In this landmark book, TerryWinograd shows how to improve the practice of software design by applying lessons from other areas of design to the creation of software.  The goal is to create software that works -- really works -- because it is both appropriate and effective for the people who use it.''

I am still digesting this book.  It is quite thought provoking (and perhaps a bit controversial).  The book consists of 14 chapters written by different authors (as well as 14 profiles of ideas and products).

Chapter 6 (by Peter Denning and Pamela Dargan) discusses ''Pattern Mapping as a Basis for a Discipline of Design''.

This book is a rare treat... It pays equal respect to the engineer as well as to the designer/artist.
