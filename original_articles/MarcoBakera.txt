I was born in Germany in 1979. In 2000 I started studying ComputerScience and Psychology. I finished my study in 2006. Afterwards I started working both at the UniversityOfDortmund and the UniversityOfPotsdam, developing tools and techniques for formal verification (by FormalMethods and FormalModelChecking) of software systems.
