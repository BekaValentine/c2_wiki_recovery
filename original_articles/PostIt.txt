PostItNotes: TradeName describing a series of [usually] small, light-colored papers that have lightly adhesive strips at the top of the back side.
Post-It Notes are manufactured by 3M / Scotch and considered to be an office supply staple.
The Post-It Note, being self-adhesive, requires no tape to hold it to [computer monitors | walls | doors | desks | windows | etc.] but has a so lightly adhesive backing as to be easy to remove without leaving a residue, thereby leaving all the adhesive on the paper, and thus making the Note somewhat reusable.

Invented by Romi and Michelle, as documented in the movie "Romi And Michelle's High School Reunion". -- JasonGrossman

''PostIt's cannot go without a Wiki.  They are the culmination of 12,000 years of human civilization, period! --FrankPurcell''
