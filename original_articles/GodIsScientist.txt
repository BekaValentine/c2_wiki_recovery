WHAT IF:

GOD is an extra terrestrial scientist who conducts experiments on mere mortals like us. If we go through various religious texts with this concept in mind, we can see that many of the descriptions can easily be mapped into the concept of GOD being an ET scientist conducting experiments.

Well, that's one theory. Problem is that the data supports other interpretations as well.
----
Or what if the universe is a giant program (a la TheMatrix?)
----
I hope that GodIsLove. Well, why do you need this strange theory?

I wanted to know what would happen when one day our scientists discovered that what we consider GOD is basically an extra-terrestrial being much like us but with advanced technology. Our religious base on which we have been standing for a long time will be gone. What will be the impact on us. Even those who believe in non-existence of GOD will be affected. And what will be our reaction when we discover that we are playthings or experimental elements for the ET-GOD. Our pride in ourselves that we can take care of us will be affected when we realize that we can be easily manipulated by their advanced technology. -- VhIndukumar

''This would happen at the discovery of an more advanced alien culture even if it was in no way part of our development''

All these theories abdicate FreeWill, and move the center of power of the universe out of the self and into the farthest most removed agent possible. That's bad for you. -- PhlIp

To fear that theories abdicate FreeWill and to refrain from thinking on them itself shows that one has no FreeWill. The idea is to make people think. FreeWill can not be taken from anyone. People surrender their FreeWill. To avoid a matter because of fear is a proof that one has no FreeWill. -- VhIndukumar

If God is a computer scientist, he seems to have improved his craft over time...

What if God is you and nothing else exists?

''Well then I could tell you to f*ck off, and I'd be the only one offended!''

What if God is the sum of all the WhatIf scenarios possible?

What if God is really the great deceiver tricking us into following him?

What if God sent Jesus to stop organized religions hegemony?

What if God doesn't like us tearing up nature and replacing it with brick idols?

What if one particular religion was actually totally correct - and that religion promoted intolerance of other religions?

What if God really is a scientist - and we are the Tuskegee experiment?
