From the TPJ webpage (wiki-ized):

	 :	 Founded in 1996 by JonOrwant, ThePerlJournal has been the leading publication for and about PerlLanguage programming. From the outset, JonOrwant's goal was to publish a magazine that was educational, entertaining, and intellectually stimulating in its exploration of the craft of PerlLanguage and the craft of programming. TPJ was published as a standalone quarterly magazine until 2001 when it became a quarterly supplement to SysAdminMagazine. Beginning in November 2002, TPJ moved to a reader-supported monthly e-zine format in which subscribers can download issues as PDF documents. TPJ remains committed to JonOrwant's original vision -- a publication for and by PerlLanguage programmers who see fun and beauty in an admittedly quirky little language.
