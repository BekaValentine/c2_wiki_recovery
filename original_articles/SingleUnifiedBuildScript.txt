You want to ensure that your BuildProcess is done in a consistent manner.  You don't want to require or can't enforce that developers to use the same editor or IDE.

'''Therefore'''

Maintain a SingleUnifiedBuildScript.  Use something like a makefile or a ApacheAnt build script to have a common way of building the project.  

'''Examples'''

GNU projects all use AutoConf and makefiles.  For UNIX types in general, this is is probably just an obvious thing.  Any well run OpenSource project will provide a SingleUnifiedBuildScript due to the unenforceability of development environment issue.
