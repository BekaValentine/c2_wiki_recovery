	* '''Must''' have for requirements that are fundamental to the system. Without them the system will be unworkable and useless. The Must Haves define the minimum usable as subset. A DSDM project guarantees to satisfy all the minimum usable subset.
	* '''Should''' have for important requirements for  there is a work-around in the short term and which would normally be classed as very hard  in less time-constrained development, but the system will be useful and usable without them. 
	* '''Could''' have for requirements that can more easily be left out of the increment under development.
	* '''Want''' to have but Won't have this time round for those valuable requirements that can wait till later development takes place.

Upon describing XP to a friend recently, he remarked upon how similar some of the concepts were to DSDM. Not having looked into DSDM, I wasn't in a place to comment. -- StuartBarker

Similar things have been said by my colleagues, however, after further discussion we decided that the similarities are not so profound after all. But I, too, don't really know enough about DSDM to have a firm opinion. -- KeithBraithwaite

Since DSDM Version 4.2, DSDM includes an integration with XP. -- LeonardLouweKooijmans

We should CompareDsdmAndXp.

EvolutionaryDelivery gives DSDM a brief mention in despatches.
