I'm a programmer, currently living in NYC. I recently took a position with a Virginia based company, building web applications, and handling the tech side of things. Before that I did a lot of contract work. One thing I did recently that I'm proud of was to help Anzovin Studios write their Maya plugin, the Setup Machine: http://www.anzovin.com/setupmachine/.

Right now I'm doing a lot of programming in JavaLanguage. I've also done a fair bit of programming in PythonLanguage, CeeLanguage, CeePlusPlus, and some others. About a year ago I started getting pretty serious about LispLanguage, Common Lisp to be precise. I really enjoyed programming in Lisp when I was in school, and at this point I'd rather program in Lisp than anything else. I haven't found a lot of opportunities to do Lisp programming commercially yet, but I do write utilities in Lisp for myself, and I believe that it's a language with a bright future.

I used to play the GameOfGo and the GameOfChess a lot, but in recent years I haven't had much time for them, limiting myself to a bit of play on the internet.
