VbUnitTwo (vbUnit2) is an automated regression TestingFramework for VisualBasic

vbUnit2 became VbUnitThree.
Use VbUnitThree.

But you can use the library and "vbUnit2" GUI interface, for free, forever. Only the "enhanced" functionality of VB IDE integration and "batch" testing are subject to the license. -- JeffGrigg
