I do quite a bit of Unix shell programming for myself in between the sad thing that is a (part time, fortunately) retail job in the US.  I also write a little CeeLanguage and have learned most of the popular portable languages over the 10 plus years since I got my first computer.  Sometimes I even use them.

I spent a  couple years quite involved with LinuxFromScratch and maintained its FAQ.  Now the only public project I maintain is iana-etc, hosted at http://www.sethwklein.net/projects/iana-etc/  although I have various projects percolating that might someday see the light of release.
