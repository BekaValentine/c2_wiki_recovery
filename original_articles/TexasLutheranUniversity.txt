Great place with lots of majors to study.
Note to those interested in ComputerScience : The program is still relativly young.  First course will be in the DeadLanguageFortran.  Also network on campus very primitive, uses "high-end" wireless network cards.  Several servers are slowT (NT) and the internet backbone goes out far too often.

Check it out if you're interested in a San Antionio area campus.
