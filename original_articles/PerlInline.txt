Inline.pm is a Perl module that lets you easily bind various ProgrammingLanguage''''''s to PerlLanguage. Just write a plain old Perl script, but write some of the subroutines in CeeLanguage, some in JavaLanguage and CeePlusPlus, some more in RubyLanguage or PythonLanguage, and a couple in AssemblyLanguage and BrainfuckLanguage for good measure. Then simply run the Perl script like normal.
