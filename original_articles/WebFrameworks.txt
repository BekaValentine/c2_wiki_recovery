Web frameworks:

* RubyOnRails
* SeamFramework
* WebObjects
* SpringFramework
* Struts
* WebWork
* AribaWeb
* AspDotNet
* AspDotNetMvc
* Tapestry
* [under construction]
--------
Of course a very interesting question would be: what is the difference between a webframework an a framework that can be used to build web aplications (the SpringFramework is an example of a general purpose framework that can be used for web development but also much more, Seam or RoR are AFAIK not (Struts certanly is not))

Does anyone know a web framework that is SQL-friendly? In other words does not try to hide SQL but rather embraces it?
*SpringFramework
 
Some (like Ruby's Sinatra) don't dictate an ORM, but see 'Faster applications by using SQL over ORM':
