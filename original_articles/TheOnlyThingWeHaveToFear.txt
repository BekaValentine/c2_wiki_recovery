... is fear itself.

Nice saying, but its broadest interpretation is just plain wrong.  There are plenty of things to fear: cancer, bears, drunk drivers, COBOL...  Whether any of these is worth fearing is up for you to decide.  Remember that fear is not panic (panic is the dark side of fear), and fear can get you to do useful things like get out of the way of a runaway car.

The quote came from President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression.  Here is the quote, in context, from his first inaugural address (http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5057/):

''I am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people impel. This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itselfâ€”nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.''

He was talking about panic.  He was also talking about banking and the economy.  Remember, this was before Federally-insured banks, so fear became a vicious circle: if a bank looked like it might be faltering, its investors would line up to withdraw their money while it was still there (the infamous "run on the bank"), and that would bankrupt the bank.  Literally, fear itself was causing the problems.
