In 1993, KentBeck and GradyBooch called a bunch of people together to "do something with patterns".  A lot of talking was done and then, eventually, the participants (led by KentBeck) decided to walk out to the hillside and use ChristopherAlexander's patterns to design the Center for Collaborative Object-Oriented Development where experts from all sorts of domains would come to work with Expert Object-Oriented Software folks.  During the experience, many had an Epiphany, and the HillsideGroup was formed.
