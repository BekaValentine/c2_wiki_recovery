It was suggested, by an anonymous author, that perhaps a personal wiki should have encryption ability to protect personal information from others. The entries and poorly contrived WikiPage were deleted. There was some confusing talk of using https, but how this relates to a personal wiki exactly I am not sure. However, encryption of a personal wiki is an interesting idea.

the best thing to have is EncryptedWiki

A solution for encryption of a Personal Wiki, may be to use an encrypted container (basically an image of a drive/disk/CD that is mountable as a virtual drive) for your wiki installation. Here are some current freeware on-the-fly-encryption (OTFE) software:
*Dekart Private Disk Light [Free 128-bit AES encryption software- Win95/98/NT/W2k/XP. Can be run without installation  - e.g. from USB drive on any computer] http://www.dekart.com/products/file_disk_encryption/private_disk_light/
*ScramDisk (Win 95/98/ME) [Legendary OTFE software!] http://samsimpson.com/cryptography/scramdisk/
*Encryption for the Masses [e4m] (Windows 95/98/NT/W2k) http://www.samsimpson.com/cryptography/scramdisk/
*TrueCrypt
*CrossCrypt (Win 2000/XP, containers compatible with Linux) http://www.scherrer.cc/crypt/ ( needs Administrator-rights)
*FOTFE (Free OTFE for MS Windows) This one is in early stages of development, but is one to keep an eye on. http://www.freeotfe.org/
