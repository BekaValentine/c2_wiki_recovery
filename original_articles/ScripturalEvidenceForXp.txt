What do you know about ExtremeProgramming?  Would you like to know more?

Here is some evidence from the scriptures that XP is ''true''.  Feel free to add to these, as the Spirit moves you...  :-)

*'''WholeTeam'''
	 :	''Psalm 133:1.''	"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"
	 :	''D&C 38:27.''	"I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine."

*'''PlanningGame'''

*'''SmallReleases'''
	 :	''D&C 64:33.''	"Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.  And out of small things proceedeth that which is great."

*'''CustomerTests'''
	 :	''Abraham 3:25.''	"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them."

*'''SimpleDesign'''
	 :	''Alma 37:6.''	"By small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise."

*'''ReFactoring'''
	 :	''Isaiah 28:10.''	"Line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little."

*'''PairProgramming'''
	 :	''D&C 6:28.''	"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."
	 :	''Mark 6:7.''	"And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two."

*'''IterativeDevelopment'''
	 :	''Genesis 1.''  "And the evening and the morning were the first day....  The second day...."  Etc. Note the review at the end of each iteration: "And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good."
** I wonder if that was a FortyHourWeek?

*'''ContinuousIntegration'''

*'''CollectiveOwnership'''
	 :	''3 Nephi 26:19.''	"And they taught, and did minister one to another; and they had all things common among them, every man dealing justly, one with another."

*'''CodingStandard'''

	 :	''Koran 002:026.''	"GOD does not shy away from citing any kind of allegory, from the tiny mosquito and greater. As for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord." 

*'''SustainablePace'''
	 :	''Mosiah 4:27.''	"It is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength.  And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize."

''Anything from the Bhagivad Gita or other Eastern scripture?  Given the number of EasternWuss''''''es here on Wiki :) (or maybe they've all left), I thought for sure we'd have some passages from Hindu, Buddhist, or Taoist texts by now.  Though see ShuHaRi for some other commentary on this particular topic...''

[Must be because in ZenProgramming it says to "draw some UML and meditate on it" while XpAndUml says to "wash your hands after using UML"]
