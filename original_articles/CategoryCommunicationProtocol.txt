Suggest we create a CategoryCommunicationProtocol. There exists a lot of pages with Protocol forming part of the name, and I think others exist without this name and yet are related to commsprotocol (e.g. WiFi)

Note CategoryC''''''ommunication is a different animal

If accepted as a name, please slot this within CategoryCategory and start attaching relevant pages to it.
