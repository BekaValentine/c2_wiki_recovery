IncrementalDelivery gives you valuable feedback, but deploying software also has its cost. You have to find a balance between the benefits of feedback and the cost of deployment.

The CostOfDeployment includes:

	*Burning cd-roms
	*Marketing the new release
	*Getting it to your customers
	*Installing the software
	*Retraining the users

People have invented lots of ways of reducing these costs. Storing executables on network servers, using ActiveX components, using Java applets, using thin clients.

Reducing the CostOfDeployment allows you to get more feedback through more incremental delivery.
