The book "Software Development on a Leash" by David C. Birmingham, Valerie Haynes Perry (Contributor), Ben Gonzales, Valerie Haynes Perry seems to support the "AlternateHardAndSoftLayers" idea:

From Amazon's Editorial Review:
''"He ties the building blocks together with structural and behavioral metadata, allowing simple, interpreted macros to drive everything from database access, screen layouts and many aspects of software development normally embedded directly into the software program. The rapid deployment effect this creates allows developers to perform simple surgical application changes, or rapid sweeping rework / enhancement - without changing compiled software."''
