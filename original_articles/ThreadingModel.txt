[Models for using threads moved into ThreadingDesign]

The major classifications of threading models I've worked with are:

* Cooperative Threading - Each thread runs until it releases the CPU for other threads to execute.
* Pre-emptive Threading - Threads are given time slices in which to execute.
** Process scheduled ("green threads") - Each process has its own thread scheduler that divides the process's time slice between its threads.
** OS scheduled - The OS gives each thread a time slice.
