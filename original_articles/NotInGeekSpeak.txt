Since what we may specifically, completely and definitely describe today may not be true tomorrow, or the week, or month, or year following, We may out of convenience, abstract what we hear and what say into associative illustrations or images for others to make their own mental associations. 

Being self-taught, then formally educated in programming, I have come to develop an understanding of and an associative language for what is done when one programs. However, I do not GeekSpeak. While I may understand what is meant when Geeks speak one to another concerning the things they know and do, I choose to avoid using the same terms in my own mental and practice associations.

Here, understand what I mean, read some of the "hello world" type explanations in pages on this wiki - like:
* HelloYouInManyProgrammingLanguages
** to the extreme 249 languages:
*** http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world
* ArraySumInManyProgrammingLanguages
* BagSumInManyProgrammingLanguages
* BlocksInManyLanguages
* CategoryInManyProgrammingLanguages
* CounterInManyProgrammingLanguages
* DotProductInManyProgrammingLanguages
* EightQueensInManyProgrammingLanguages
* EveryCombinationInManyProgrammingLanguages
* FizzBuzzInManyProgrammingLanguages
* GenerateBingoCardsInManyProgrammingLanguages
* HelloWorldInManyProgrammingLanguages
* HexDumpInManyProgrammingLanguages
* HomoiconicExampleInManyProgrammingLanguages
* MockingInManyLanguages
* RangeTitlesInManyProgrammingLanguages
* SieveOfEratosthenesInManyProgrammingLanguages
* WardNumberInManyProgrammingLanguages

If you understand and speak many languages, in which do you think?
If you understand and program in many languages, in which do you innovate?

If you are like me, you think, not in language terms, but in MentalAssociationImages, which is totally "not" GeekSpeak.

That is why it is important, when speaking or listening, to be sure to "see what I mean!" and to speak in such a way as to create pictures or stories which your listener can understand because they can "visualize" and associate what you say. 

An understanding confirmation like "Oh you mean like 'xxxx"?" can foster communication and collaboration by this as if saying "I understand, go on".

In a world where the social media has made it possible for us to befriend others who do not share similar backgrounds, but have common interests, it is important to foster understanding and share ideas, if not specific understandings.
