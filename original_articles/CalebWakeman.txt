Yo, I'm a user.  I'm NewHere as of FebruaryThirteen.

I (would like to thing I'd) like to learn more about programming, and lurking around here and talking to/ learning from you guys seems like an effective way to improve.  Lurk, lurk.

I'm huge on the idea of non-hierarchical FileSystemAlternatives.  My pet name for it is TagFileSystem, which seems to be KillerFileSystem as TaggedDatabase
