I used to program C++ (StlStyle) almost exclusively. Nowadays I am doing a lot of Python; hope to be able to use some Dolphin Smalltalk some day too. My move towards dynamically typed OO languages is influenced by this wiki and Xp.

I am employeed at In/Out, a company that supplies used computing equipment in Norway and the rest of Europe.
