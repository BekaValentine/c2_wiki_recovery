I'm probably what you might call JustaProgrammer, but recently I've been trying to work out how to program stuff without getting bogged down. I've been looking at ExtremeProgramming: some of the ideas in there seem good, especially the combination of RefactorMercilessly and RelentlessTesting.

I wrote (and still write) rCalc, an OpenSource easy to use symbolic calculator; you can find it at http://rcalc.sourceforge.net/.

I also wrote (a long time ago) gNiall, a stupid program which pretends to be clever. It lives at http://gniall.sourceforge.net/.
