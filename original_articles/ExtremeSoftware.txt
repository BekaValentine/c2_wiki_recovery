A euphemism for ExtremeProgramming.
----
My recollection of history is that ExtremeSoftware actually was the name of version 1.0Beta.  It got renamed because ExtremeProgramming sounds tuffer.  KentBeck likes to sound tuff.  Me too.

And we can't face our fear of being thought to be methodologists, so calling it programming helps on that too.

Yup. Telling a group of programmers, "I'm a methodologist" with a straight face is one of the hardest things I do (along with keeping a straight face and saying "I'm a poet" when someone at a party says, "And what do you do?") --AlistairCockburn (not JustaProgrammer at the moment)
