According to http://samba.anu.edu.au/jitterbug/

	 :	JitterBug is a web based bug tracking system. It was originally developed by the Samba Team to handle bug tracking, problem reports and queries from Samba users. It is now available under the GNU General Public License in the hope that it will be useful for other projects.

	 :	JitterBug operates by receiving bug reports via email or a web form. Authenticated users can then reply to the message, move it between different categories or add notes to it. In some ways JitterBug is like a communal web based email system. This web page is itself a JitterBug page. You can get an idea of what JitterBug can do by playing with the various links and buttons.
