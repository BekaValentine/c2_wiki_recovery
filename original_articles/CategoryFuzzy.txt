This set of pages is a WalledGarden. If you are one of the people who uses these pages, read WalledGarden and consider the issues raised there, and note that extreme cases are considered to be WikiSquatting and are likely to get deleted.

If you think these FuzzyCommunity pages are a WalledGarden, why don't you help make them not a WalledGarden?

Could someone explain to me how MeatballWiki now has all these pages, character for character? While I agree they are better placed there, I do want to make sure people understand the ethical and legal considerations of moving people's writing from one website to another. I certainly don't think moving material off site without permission from the authors is legitimate. I know this wasn't sought, as I wasn't asked to move my writing (not that I would have objected). -- SunirShah, Editor of MeatballWiki
