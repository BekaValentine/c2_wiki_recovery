We are looking for ideas, suggestions and stories about entrepreneurship. 

This wiki is a gateway to http://entrepreneur.swiki.net [to original writer: this link deoes not work] We invite you to visit and to participate in the Current Discussion, or add a page on a related topic. The swiki also contains links to e-mail and to the personal web site of the moderator, http://www.jbv.com. At that site, visit the Entrepreneurship University page (content-rich), and the Library page (links to some excellent resources). 

I am new to wikis, and the purpose of the swiki is to apply the wiki concept to the ongoing discussion of entrepreneurship (etp) basics and new approaches. I teach etp at the college level, and have to try new approaches to stay ahead of some pretty savvy young adults. I am very interested in success stories related to the use of blogs and wikis.

We look forward to your joining our conversation.
