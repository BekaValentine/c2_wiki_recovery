As a second book on Go for a western beginner, this is not a bad choice.  In the spirit of ShuHaRi, this book addresses the ''shu'' phase of learning, but as one learns more about the game one would discard (ShuHaRi's ''ha'') the simplistic rules of EZ Go and embrace a more holistic view of the game.  BruceWilcox also gives an entertaining lecture on his theories. -- IanOsgood
