I'd LOVE to get together with others here in Florida (preferably South Florida--near Boca Raton) to discuss patterns. I just 'discovered' them a month ago and I'm bursting (and feeling rather like a geek for feeling glee from the situation [smile]). If anyone is interested, please contact me at jmcvay@bigfoot.com

Ooh, ooh, me too!!  I can't believe there was a tampa patterns group!
Let's reform it, shall we?  Or perhaps we could have an online study
group.  I'm looking into that currently.  Any interest in either thing?
