I've been hovering around the technical edge of computing for far too long; sitting a little uneasily between the classifications, 'user' and 'programmer'.

I'd like to collaborate with others to help find ways of using technology more effectively. At the same time I want to avoid becoming a specialist.

I'm attracted by the aesthetic simplicity and the philosophy behind the design of this site; but at the same time I have a tendency to be pulled towards perfectionism and the feeling that I want what I produce to completed. Tendencies which I probably need to cure.
