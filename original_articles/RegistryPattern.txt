A registry is a global association from keys to objects, allowing the objects to be reached from anywhere. It involves two methods: one that takes a key and an object and add objects to the registry and one that takes a key and returns the object for the key. It's similar to the MultitonPattern, but doesn't restrict instances to only those in the registry.
