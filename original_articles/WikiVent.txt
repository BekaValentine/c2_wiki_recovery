Just the name of an IdeaFragment: a RealLife Wiki Event (WikiVent) where WikiCitizen''''''s can meet in real life.

(LocalWikiConnections like the DresdenWikiConnection could support this idea.)

Any ideas about the type of conversation that will take place at such a WikiVent?
WikiNames in every sentence?
A collective MentalStateCalledFlow?
----
Here are some ideas ...OK

Everybody has to say one sentence with at least one WikiName. This is done in round robin style. Players drops out when they fail to find a WikiName or when they use a WikiName twice. The winner will become a WikiMaster.

There will be a WiFi Connection so the WikiPage''''''s mentioned can be edited instantly. Many new Pages will be created.

The group adopts pages which they regularly review and discuss in meetings (ActivitiesForBoringMeetings). Then, with this insight, they refactor the pages over the following month. The goal is to keep adopted pages both tidy and healthy.
