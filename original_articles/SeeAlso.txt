SeeAlso is the WikiName for a document section used to list pages that readers interested in the current page may want to ''see also''. A SeeAlso section is usually placed at the bottom of a page just before the categories (see WikiCategories) section, or at the end of the OpeningStatement if the page has one.

'''NOTE:''' It is '''not''' a good idea to label this section with the WikiName that defines it. SeeAlso is '''not''' a WikiBadge. Using it as such draws attention to this definition page instead of the actual pages of interest. This page should only be referenced when talking ''about'' a SeeAlso section, not to create one.

Cannonical forms for structuring a SeeAlso section include:

* "See ''P''''''ageOne'', ''P''''''ageTwo'', ''etc''
* "See also: ''Page''''''One'' [, ''Page''''''Two'']"
* "See: ''Page''''''One'' [, ''Page''''''Two'']"
* Or as a labeled or un-labelled, bulleted list of the relevant topics

If you arrived here by pressing a SeeAlso link that was used to indicate related pages, please consider going back and replacing the reference with one of these forms. References to SeeAlso can be left on pages where it is referenced as a subject.

The SeeAlso document section is often redundant. If the referenced page's topic is similar to the topic of the current page (e.g. AppropriateWikiTopics, OnTopic), consider merging the pages. If they're not, try integrating the reference in the page body to show how the concepts are related. A SeeAlso section is only necessary if you can't do either of the above, like on OneMinuteWiki.

At the end of a page, "See also" is redundant. Presumably, the reader has already read the page, so "See" would work just as well. Elsewhere in a page, the distinction matters; "See also" introduces links to additional information, whereas a bare "See" acts as a redirect (that is, "read the linked page instead of the current page").

Why not use LatentSemanticIndexing techniques to automatically generate the SeeAlso for each WikiPage?
