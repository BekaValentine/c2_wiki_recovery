'Catalog' is a technical term in the PatternCommunity. A list of patterns is called a catalog. The DesignPatternsCatalog page should probably be restored. (RestoreMe.) Or see CategoryPattern.

''The old content seems to have been moved without loss to DesignPatternsRoadMap, and that consists of very little content, so it would be more to the point to just come up with new substantive content.''

I don't remember whether the old DesignPatternsCatalog page had good content. It seems that the most useful content for a catalog/roadmap of DesignPatterns at the moment is on the CategoryPattern page.

*I don't see much difference in the old versions of this page:

Thanks for the research. So it appears that the old DesignPatternsCatalog page was pretty worthless, as is the new DesignPatternsRoadMap. I suppose both pages should be deleted. Or both pages could be kept just to direct the reader to CategoryPattern, since that's where the good content is nowadays.
