Java native interfaces are wrappers for C and C++ code via
a standard API. Microsoft has a competing standard called
Raw Native Interfaces, and Java 1.0 has yet another way to
do it.

From http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jni/spec/intro.html
* JNI interface itself is binary-compatible with COM. We use the same jump table structure and calling convention that COM does. This means that, as soon as cross-platform support for COM is available, the JNI can become a COM interface to the Java VM. 
** ''Is it up to the individual firm to implement the "cross-platform support"?''
