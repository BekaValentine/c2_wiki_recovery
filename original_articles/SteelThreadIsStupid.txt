"Steel thread" is a term used in BEA circles to mean DesignPrototype. Like "bean", it is a stupid, meaningless term (see BeansConsideredHarmful).  -- RandyStafford

However, it's already a useful term with the obvious meaning - for example, see http://www.compacc.com/moreinfo.cfm?Product_ID=261.

''Note to whoever deleted this content before, claiming it was "pointless" - it's not pointless. If we software developers are to understand each other in conversation, then we need to use IntentionRevealingNames. SteelThread is not intention revealing. DesignPrototype is.''

Respectfully disagree. Calling the term 'stupid' doesn't gain anything; the simple statement that 'StealThread' = 'DesignPrototype' + 'BEA version' is sufficient. Otherwise, I'm forced to concede that 'WilliamUnderwood' is stupid, because it doesn't in and of itself mean 'male human'. Could there be value in making a SteelThread page that states that this is a version of a design prototype?
