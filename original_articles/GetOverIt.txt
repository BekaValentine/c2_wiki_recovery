EditHint:  Can we build a PatternForm or AntiPattern-form document here?

''GetOverIt is a very common ''anti-''pattern in software...''

'''Forces:'''

''Especially stubborn programmers who don't want to add a new feature or fix a bug and they just claim "GetOverIt" to their customers and such.''

'''Resulting Context:'''

''And it is funny.''

'''Known Uses:''' 

''Similarly, GetOverIt is humorously used a lot in this wiki when a new feature is requested for C2 wiki, and security requests. We're told to GetOverIt because C2 wiki is great.''

''GetOverIt is a very common pattern in software.. especially stubborn programmers who don't want to add a new feature or fix a bug and they just claim "GetOverIt" to their customers and such. Similarly, GetOverIt is humorously used a lot in this wiki when a new feature is requested for C2 wiki, and security requests. We're told to GetOverIt because C2 wiki is great.  And it is funny. What's your problem? Put this back or I'll hit you over the head with a pillow.  Instead of deleting the page - please make the page apply to software more (rather than just deleting it, what the eff is your problem?).  If this silly behavior continues, wait - now I get it. It's '''extreme programming''' and '''refactor mercilessly''' that's gotten into you hasn't it.  People on this wiki, are irrational, illogical, and quite extreme. Please - don't edit things using extreme programming tactics - it does not work.''

The page deleted was basically the same as one declared off topic 20030904 (between the double horizontal rules:
-- DonaldNoyes.20080430.0131.m05

''Why don't you be creative instead of putting redundant information about how things were deleted, when they will be deleted, why they are deleted,  etc.? Is it that hard to think up some software related GetOverIt examples? Here you go:''

* Software not working for you today? GetOverIt
* Don't like how the people are talking on the C2 Wiki? GetOverIt
* Bugs not fixed in the program you are running? GetOverIt
* Don't like your developer team member's coding styles? GetOverIt
* Find your pointy haired boss annoying? GetOverIt
* Don't get paid enough as a programmer? GetOverIt
* Don't like how WikiSucks? GetOverIt.
* Anyone not like the fact that RecentChanges is not showing UserName? GetOverIt
* GrammarVandal ticking you off? GetOverIt
* C2 Wiki is outdated software that never gets updated with new better features? GetOverIt


''So please delete the nonsense on this page about how GetOverIt doesn't apply to software, and contribute to the points above. Oh yeah, and regarding this page... you poor little twinkies: GetOverIt.''

Species extinctions, global warming, the destruction of Yellowstone and Alaskan preserves? GetOverIt. 
A new arms race, staging coups against democracies while propping up dictators, selling out US security for Saudi oil? GetOverIt. 
An underresourced war against the wrong dictatorship based on fictitious evidence, ignoring world opinion and violating international law? GetOverIt! 
Hung up by the usage of an American on an American Wiki of terms you describe as containing an AmericanCulturalAssumption. GetOverIt! Realize that ItDepends. 

Quit yer snivellin, kid. It's the NewWorldOrder, son. Get used to it, boy. It's the way it is, so stop whining. Nothing you can do will make any difference. GetOverIt.

It you feel what exists between the double lines is OnTopic, or contributes value as a page, or has something to do with the mission of this wiki, then retain it. Otherwise in a day or two I'll remove it.
