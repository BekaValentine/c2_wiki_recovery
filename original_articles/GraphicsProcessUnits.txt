GraphicsProcessUnits (GPUs) used to be just that, microprocessors to ease the load on the main microprocessor by doing some of the computation for the display. As they evolved to do that they became powerful parallel processors. These processors are now being made available for general purpose use as GeneralPurposeGraphicsProcessUnits (GPGPUs).
