'''Context:'''

The signature is part of the message, but also less important than the content itself.  It's often the same from one message to another, and deeply-nested messages look ugly when repeated signatures are redundantly quoted.

The solution must work in plain text, and feel natural to people new to email.

'''Solution:'''

Mark the start of the signature as described above, and follow with whatever you like within the SixLineSigLimit.

'''Resulting Context:'''

Smart user agents (e.g. mutt) can do nice things such as showing signatures in a different color, and more importantly truncating them when replying.

The solution is so small and discreet that many people don't realize there is a convention here at all.
