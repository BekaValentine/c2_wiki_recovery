QeTest (more properly QETest, but I wasn't sure what Wiki would do with that) is a Java-based testing framework, focusing first on providing functionality to quality engineers writing AcceptanceTest''''''s and the like but also suitable for UnitTest''''''ing.

See documentation at http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/test/. It's currently used and supported by the Xalan-J team for automated testing, but the basic org.apache.qetest package is completely generic and suitable as-is for use with other products.
