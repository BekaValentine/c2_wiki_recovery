'''IF you find yourself'''

Designing a display to support exploration and discovery of patterns in complex multi-attribute, multi-dimensional and/or time-varying data

''for example''
	* e1: predicting the direction of stock prices from depth of market stock data [Nesbitt and Barrass 2002] http://www.icad.org/websiteV2.0/Conferences/ICAD2002/proceedings/51_KeithNesbitt.pdf
	* e2: analyzing high dimensional data sets [Hermann and Ritter 2002] http://www.icad.org/websiteV2.0/Conferences/ICAD2002/proceedings/23_Thomas_Hermann_CSO.pdf
	* e3: exploring patterns in spectral oceanography data [Sturm 2002] http://www.icad.org/websiteV2.0/Conferences/ICAD2002/proceedings/07_BobSturm.pdf
''with the problem that''
	 :	it is difficult to perceive higher level information about relations between attributes in conventional graphs and impossible to perceive patterns in tables of data values
''entailing forces''
	* f1: the need to perceive global information about the entire data set
	* f2: the need to perceive intermediate level information about relations between attributes as they vary over time
	* f3: the need to perceive local level information about how individual attributes vary with time
'''THEN'''

Use a sonification to provide time varying information about multiple attributes

''Apply''
	 :	The primitive level heuristics from Bregmans theory of auditory scene analysis [Bregman 1991] http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/auditory/book.html to map data attributes onto the attributes of auditory streams [Rivenez et al. 2002] http://www.icad.org/websiteV2.0/Conferences/ICAD2002/proceedings/38_MRivenez.pdf
''to construct''
	 :	auditory streams that perceptually group and segregate to reflect higher level relations between attributes
''leading to''
	 :	the capability to explore and find patterns in complex data by listening to it
''and''
	 :	a perceptually structured information soundscape
