I've heard of working from home, and other remote locations in the new economy, but this is really something.  I think my work place may be slowly and surrealistically taking on the elements of a prison.

For those of you who have not seen my work space, it is bordered with a bank of windows.  Past my monitor, I can look out to a three-story atrium, then on to a filtered panel of windows and  vents.  This was great when the atrium was mostly stocked with abstract objects de arte.

In fact, it was once considered exemplary work of Alexandrian design with its n-point natural light sources.  But the most recent tenant of this unique atrium, "Minncor", has implemented a curious twist, the irony of which has not escaped me.  

Minncor (minncor.com) is a rehabilitation service for inmates which employs incarcerated individuals in product development and design.  Contrary to popular belief, the office workers are not themselves convicts; the convicts work from their respective secured institutions. 

I can, however see the result of their work.  I can look out past the products of my own design, past my own workspace walls and window, onto the products of their design.

Recently, Mincorr filled the lobby with a stunning preview of the latest inmate designed and developed prison-issue furniture.  I noticed the minimalist, yet substantial designs were not unlike those employed in my own office furniture.

All of this struck me as kind of freaky and ironic, really, and I couldn't help but pass that little tidbit of an observation on to you all.
