It's probably in one of those links but the following exchange between GeorgeBernardShaw and a young WinstonChurchill is one of my favourites.  Shaw had written a new play which was shortly to open in London.  He wrote to Churchill along the following lines:

"I have pleasure in enclosing two tickets for the opening night for you and a friend - if you have one."

To which Churchill replied:

"I regret that I am not available on the opening night and am returning the tickets.  I would however be grateful for tickets for the second night - if you have one."
