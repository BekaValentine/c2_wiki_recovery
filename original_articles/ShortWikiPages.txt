A short page was marked for deletion, its contents moved to another page, and the former links were redirected. '''(But watch out for DeleteAndSee.)'''

''Is that a good practice? If the link changes, you have to change a whole bunch of references. If you kept a "stub" link in Wiki, you would only have to change it in one spot. IOW, wrap the implementation. It is kind of like referencing variables via memory offsets instead of by name. The offset may change.''

I agree if you have a lot of references, an own page may be useful by itself. But if not, you will get a lot of wiki pages with no useful content. This is more evil.

''I see nothing wrong with short pages, as long as they contain useful info.''

There was no useful info. And even short useful info could be on the page where the first link was. Only if this info is linked on many other pages as well, perhaps then it could be ok this way.

ShortWikiPages can often be merged into larger pages if they have have few BackLink''''''s. This is similar in purpose to the InlineMethod refactoring. Example: D''''''iabloOne and D''''''iabloTwo were short, OffTopic, had cooled, and had few BackLink''''''s. They were inlined into BlizzardEntertainment, which was more OnTopic as an ExtremeProgramming company.
