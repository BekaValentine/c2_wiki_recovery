TheresAlwaysOneEmptyKey is my refrain today. I have been attempting to tidy up some computers running MicrosoftWindows in various flavours. These have something called the registry which has to be tidied up when programs have been deleted and left their loose ends lying around. I have a tool for doing this, which fixes most of the errors but there is always one left which it won't fix. -- JohnFletcher
