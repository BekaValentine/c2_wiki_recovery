A FavLet is simply another name for a BookMarklet.

After Netscape started using Bookmarks as the terminology for saving URLs, Microsoft began using the term Favorites for the same thing, but occasionally mixed it up with the term "Shortcut". Both Bookmarklet and Favlet are a combination of the root word "Bookmark" or "Favorite" with the 'let' suffix used in the term applet.
