I am the managing director of 7N Ltd, the UK subsidiary of the Danish consulting firm 7N A/S.

Previously I spent 5 years at ThoughtWorks.

I was introduced to Wiki by my old supervisor from college SteveFreeman.

And now I am hooked.

''The first one is free ;-)  --SF''

He also introduced me to ExtremeProgramming. And I'm hooked on that too now.

He's obviously a dangerous guy to know :-)
