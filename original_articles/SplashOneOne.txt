SPLASH stands for Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity. 
* SPLASH is an annual conference that embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery, and that joins all factions of programming technologies. 
* Since 2010 SPLASH is the umbrella for OOPSLA and Onward!. This year it features a third technical track, Wavefront, designed to publish innovative work closely related to advanced development and production software. 
* SPLASH takes on the notable track record of OOPSLA as a premier forum for software innovation, while broadening the scope of the conference  into new topics beyond objects and new forms of contributions.

The upcoming Splash 2011 Will be held October 22-27, 2011 at Portland Oregon, Details:

Does this name change reflect that fact that OOP is now recognized as one of ''multiple'' tools, paradigms, and techniques useful for software engineering instead of the be-all solution it was once sold as? I'll take it as a 2/3 victory for us "anti-OO" ranters, and grow 30% more arrogant and egotistical because of it. --top

''Agree that the name change is good, but I bet Top uses Gnome, MS Windows, or KDE, which uses OOP or OOP-like GUI objects that pass messages. Without that technology, how would you run your computer? MS Dos? Linux Command Prompt?''

Different paradigms may be good for different things. That's the point: OOP was oversold as the be-all-end-all, and the industry is finally realizing it's not a GoldenHammer, merely '''yet another tool''' in the tool-box. OOP has worked fairly well for GUI's and some packaged libraries, but that doesn't mean it's the best for everything. (I still don't think it's the best we can do as far as GUI's, but that's another topic.) -t
