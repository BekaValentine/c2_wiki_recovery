The Lucida Modeling Environment is an object oriented, meta programming language, implemented inside a GemStone server.
The 'language', however, has no syntax because it is not programed using text editors.

Lucida is an object model of object oriented languages themselves. It has objects that represent many of the constructs of OO like Classes, Selectors, Responsibilities and Expressions. Unlike other modeling environments, however, the implementation for the model can be built in the same environment allowing for extremely rapid prototyping. The result of the modeling exercise is a network of live, executable models.

The environment is rich with meta information that is used to provide proactive assistance to the author. A developer is always presented with a set of pre-filtered, valid options to choose from when building the model or its implementation.

Lucida offers a number of features that are either not available or are poorly supported in the mainstream OO languages. Its ability to provide the combination of these features makes it truly unique. The features include:
	* DynamicBinding
	* Full Static Typing
	* Well regulated MultipleInheritance
	* Slotless architecture (no instance variables need to be defined)
	* Full separation of 'Type' from 'Class'
	* Type Inheritance separate from ImplementationInheritance
	* Polymorphic equivalence of Data and Behavior
	* Ability to define instance specific implementation
	* Ability to inherit behavior from instances

GemStone, as a foundation, provides multi-user support, platform independence, security and DB admin type support.

Forgive me if this reads like an advertisement. It is not my intention to solicit sales through this channel. I have, however, listed the features of this environment in the hopes of attracting debate on
	* GemStone
	* Pure Object Environements
	* Meta Object Programming
	* Making OO Environments easier to use for Business People

In building Lucida, we have used GemStone in a rather different way than most users. I welcome any inquiry regarding GemStone or Lucida.
