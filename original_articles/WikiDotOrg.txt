This is a domain, (wiki.org called here WikiDotOrg)which is owned and hosted by WardCunningham upon which the early instantiation of the SmallestFederatedWiki resides. 

It contains a demonstration of a new, Powerful and Extensible paradigm of OpenWikiPrivatization, begun in late 2011 and being developed and extended through 2012-2013. 
* C2 (WardsWiki) and other WikiDomains may soon be found extended into this proof-of-concept experiment, which is destined to become the NextBigThing to appear upon the Wiki Scene.
