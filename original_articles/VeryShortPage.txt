A VeryShortPage is a page which contains very little information--just a one or two sentence description/definition(s) of the topic (if the content is relevant to the topic at all!).  Most such pages are probably good DeletionCandidate''''''s, as:

* WikiIsNotaDictionary.  Pages which define terms and add little other value probably aren't beneficial.
* WikiIsNotYourBlog.  If you think <politician> is an idiot or <artist> is a hack, stating so on a page all its own isn't beneficial either.
* Any page whose content isn't relevant to its title should be deleted or ReFactor''''''ed.

On the other hand:

* Organic growth implies that large pages grow from small ones; it would be a shame if a possibly-interesting page were snuffed in its infancy on the grounds of being a VeryShortPage.  Deletion on this grounds should only occur after a significant period of no activity.  

* Some pages are necessarily short--pages which refer to resources outside the Wiki; pages which redirect to other pages (to deal with the WikiNamePluralProblem), etc.
