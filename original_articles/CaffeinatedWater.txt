There is a company that makes a product called Edge2-0. It is water with caffeine in it. They recommend using it to brew your coffee. 

Caffeine is bitter. Just what I need. Bitter water.

''Instant water. Just add hot coffee, and stir!''

One brand found in the U.S. is called "Water Joe."

''Illegal in Canada (something about transparent liquids, apparently)''

No Crystal Pepsi, then...

''well, for a while, but no caffeine :)''
