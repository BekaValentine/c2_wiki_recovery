Some would say, The guy who knows TheEvilThatLurksInTheHeartsOfMen.

The Shadow was a popular pulp magazine in the 1930s and 40s; also a popular radio show. He fought all sorts of villains with his two .45 automatic pistols. He wore a black cloak and slouch hat, and was adept at hiding unseen in shadows (hence the name) while gathering information. He had an eerie laugh. His secret identity was Lamont Cranston, millionaire. 

The novels were orginally published as being by Maxwell Grant, a house name for the magazine. The primary author was Walter Gibson.
