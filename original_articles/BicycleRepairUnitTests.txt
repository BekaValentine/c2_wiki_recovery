Describe BicycleRepairUnitTests here erase and archive once they are written and in CVS.

Do they start with:

 #!usr/local/bin/env/python

And continue with:

 import unittest #thank you StevePurcell

I have a strong opinion that the first test should be to start bicyclerepair.py load a testmodule.py and ask bicyclerepair.py for a dictionary of testmodule.py and match that against a predetermined dictionary.

What do you think? -lap

I wrote tests on the basis that it just needed to work.

 #!/usr/bin/python

 import unittest, bicyclerepair, testmodule1

 class bicyclerepairTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
     def RunTest():
         b =  bicyclerepair.bicyclerepair()
         b.load("testmodule1.py")
         #so we've loaded the test data
         d = {
               "class" : "classname"
               "method" : "methodname"
             }
         t = b.export("testmodule1") #ask bicycle repair for a dictionary(nicely)
         for keys() in d:#this isn't it i'm goingto sleep now
