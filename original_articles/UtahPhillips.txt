Quote ''Mr. Natural sez,; ''get the right tool for the job.''  My tools are words, and I have a whole toolbox full.  When I need to do a word-job I always try to reach for just the right tool.  That way I am able to say exactly  what I mean.  If I use a word you don't understand, please don't ask me to dump it for one that you know.  instead, ask me what my word means.  Then you can put it in your toolbox. Then, when you have a word job, you'll have a box full of tools and be able to say exactly what you mean.''
