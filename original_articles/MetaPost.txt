John Hobby's spin-off of MetaFont.  Unlike MetaFont, which produces fonts, MetaPost produces PostScript output, ready to be included in a TeX or LaTex document, or for general use.  MetaFont and MetaPost have identical syntax, but their operator sets are slightly different.  MetaPost has color operators, for example.
