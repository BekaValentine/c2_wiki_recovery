In attempting a simple edit on RefactorApplicationFramework I inadvertently introduced a multitude of whitespace.  It was already there in the text-editing box when I did an EditPage, and I incorrectly assumed the wiki text-processing would eliminate it.  Apologies.  Is there a way to fix it short of manually deleting all the unwanted line-feeds?  ScottJohnston

Cut and paste the edit text into word and use its search and replace to replace all ^p^p with ^p ? AndyMorris

Yah sure, but I'll use emacs, dontcha know :-)  I guess I was fishing around to see if the white-space compaction algorithm was broken/disabled, and maybe that was why all those extra new-lines showed up in the first place.  There was most definitely a difference in the whitespace contents and/or appearance of RefactorApplicationFramework before and after my edit, a difference created by something other than a manual edit.

I've noted that this problem can occur when using the Opera 5.0 web browser to edit Wiki pages, maybe with others as well? --LeonardNorrgard

Mozilla will "helpfully" get rid of wanted whitespace.  For example, if I copy a TAB and paste it, I just get a single space.  If I copy multiple spaces and paste, I get a single space.  Thanks, Mozilla.
