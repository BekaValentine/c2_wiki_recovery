Traveller is a cool RolePlayingGame.

It was space based. You could built starships, join military services, do all kinds of fun stuff.

You did your tour of duties then retired to go on a life of adventure as a kind of mercenary. great stuff!

As I recall, it was possible to have your character die before play started.
