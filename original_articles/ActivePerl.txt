ActivePerl is a distribution of PerlLanguage for Win32, released by the ActiveState corporation. It includes PPM, the Perl Package Manager, which is similar to CPAN in other Perl distributions.

I have had great experiences using ActiveState's ActivePerl and ActivePython distributions and highly recommend them if you need one of these languages in Windows. The ActivePython distribution in particular I find works more smoothly than Python.org's distribution in Windows. -- BrianMcCallister
