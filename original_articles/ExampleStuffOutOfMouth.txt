'''Sample:'''

Some author wrote:

"Can this be half the size by the end of Friday, with just as much signal but twice as readable. I think so. -- RichardDrake"

A second contributor inserted an edit hint in brackets, to take out ambuigity of the phrase, because he thought, some people might understand this as compressing the whole Wiki to half of its size:
 
"Can this ''[page]'' be half the size by the end of Friday, with just as much signal but twice as readable. I think so. -- RichardDrake ''[,fp]'' "

Another author motivated this insert of ''[page]'', why this procedere might be better than emailing the hint to the original author:

A friendly AnonymousDonor, reused this stuff for an ExampleStuffOutOfMouth. Therefore she marked this passage and suggested to delete the word "his" to improve the meaning of the statement. 
Since she intruded in another one's signed message,
she marked it and signed it with AnonymousDonor. Because it was a minor edit hint, she put her signature, prefaced by a comment, in brackets, meant to be deleted by the original author, after consuming the donation:

"''[ You may omit "his" in your statement, because your suggested procedere (to use Wiki communication instead of email) reduces email of both parties. Therefore I put it in brackets. Please don't delete this italized text in brackets and the brackets, normally intended to be erased, because it is a nice '''Example Stuff Out Of Mouth'''. -- AnonymousDonor]''"

Now the simplified example without the comment of AnonymousDonor reads:

".. this way the ''inserting co-author'' consults the original author in public.
He does this in public, because the original author might be involved in heavy work, thus reducing the load of ''[''his'']'' email. On the other hand it might be an auxiliary amendment, hopefully in the sense of the original 
author. -- FridemarPache''[,AnonymousDonor]''"

''The plain text formatted part stems from ExampleStuffInMouth. It is reused for giving this '''Example Stuff Out Of Mouth''', how subtle it can be, if a co-contributor eliminates even a word of the original contributor. -- AnonymousDonor''

'''Discussion:'''

I thought on first sight that this was a joke. But just in case it's not, and it's a great twist, it's from ExampleStuffInMouth.  --RichardDrake

RichardDrake: Thank you for the example and that you factored it out to a new page. I hope that the Tentative Page Name, imbedded in this sample, reduced clerical work for you. I reinsert it in the text to make the whole technique transparent to readers, that didn't have the chance to see the process in action. If I had known that there would be actual interest, I had it written as a PromptingPageName, instead of a Tentative Page Name. -- FridemarPache

'''Call for explanation::'''

''I do not even begin to understand this example, although I thought I understood the ExampleStuffInMouth posting.''

Thank you for giving me a chance to clarify. The above sample now consists of two marked text parts. The first part is the original text, written by the original contributor in plain text.
The second part in italized format is a contribution of a co-contributor, who suggests to eliminate the word "his", because s/he thinks, that it improves the meaning of the contribution.

Please read the above Sample with 
the word "'''his'''" inserted and without the word "'''his'''" inserted. This minor change, in this case ''a suggested delete'', produces slightly different meaning. The Co-contributor "AnonymousDonor" puts his suggested deletion in brackets, to mark it as his/her contribution and comments about it.

So to say: he gets the stuff '''his''' out of the mouth of the original author who had used '''his''' in his original text. As a follow-up I italized the first brackets ''[ ]'' in the above sample, to mark them as inserted by the gentle co-contributor AnonymousDonor.

This example was factored out from another page by some friendly author, so I deleted the trailer, that must have given rise to its unnecessary misunderstanding. -- fp

I restored the deleted page, because it demonstrates some interesting dynamics on Wiki. Instead of deleting, what you don't understand, give the author a chance to explain it. Even my follow-up explanation was deleted! RudenessObjection.  -- FridemarPache

''Sorry, please give Wikiauthors a chance to explain: a sequence of inserts and deletes can turn any text into any other text in this Wiki. That concerns me and perhaps some other authors , who really put a lot of time in their writings. Therefore the discussion of putting words and even characters in and out of the mouth of original authors is a crucial thing in this Wiki. -- fp''

Sorry for deleting both supporting and detracting comments re: restoring the page, but just this once, can we try collaborating on something instead of fighting to, um, save the collaboration? Thanks.

''It's all right. What about collaboration in building a WysiwygWiki. From the sample you might be inspired to implement an Accept Hint Command. The initial author who consumes a Bracketed Delete Hint, clicks into one of the bracketed-fields and selects: '''Accept Hint''', whereupon the italized bracket parts are deleted. Similar mechanism for a Bracketed Insert Hint as described in ExampleStuffInMouth. In the latter case only the surrounding brackets of the insert part are deleted and the bracketed part of the FriendlyPeerContributor in the list of contributors.  -- fp''
