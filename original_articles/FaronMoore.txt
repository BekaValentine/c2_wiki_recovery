Hi, I am a pharmacist and HealthCare software implementation consultant specializing in medication-related software projects. My firm Integrated Healthcare Informatics facilitates other independent contractors in finding work or making a decision to go independent. You can find information about that and me at: http://www.ihinfo.com.

I love physics but I am not a physicist or a mathematician. I'd love to have your help in designing a TimeTravelThoughtExperiment or anything else related to CategoryPhysics.

Do you still care about HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple? GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem is the "in-thing" recently and got tied to the HaltingProblem. This NewKindOfScience gets the MyGodItsFullOfStars response from me. 

I am however interested in whatever material you can share that can be added to XmlExamplesOfGoodUsage. Your industry (healthcare) should have examples, given the investment resources available. -- dl Nov05
