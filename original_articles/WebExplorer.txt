Why did I go to http://www.ibm.com and enter "WebExplorer" into the search field and then not find anything?

I have no idea, but a quick GoogleSearch turned up a link to <http://www.networking.ibm.com/WebExplorer/webhome.htm>. -- DanielBiddle

Typing "Web Explorer" directly in the Address space of IE resulted almost instantly in the presentation of the first of 5.6 million hits. Typing the same in the Google search box resulted in 348 million hits, in little more than 1/8 of a second.  -- 20070427
