As detailed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Management the BPMS or Business Process Management System replaces the clumsy DBMS as the central tool of corporate enterprise.

''I can't tell whether the above is a statement of truth, a shameless expression of religious belief, a PissTake, or a bit of sarcasm.
