A convention in on a thread in RestArchitecturalStyle
is interesting. A series of letters are used as a thread
identifier. From the letters one can tell where a thread
breaks into different threads and what section of text
is replies to what other section of text. All without
italics/bolds/lines/new pages etc.

A severly edited example:

Q: All these words about REST are wasted. Somewhere operation dispatching is happening. Does it really matter where?

A: If scalability to the proportions of "the web" matters, then the short answer is "yes".

AA: Can you explain? 

AAA: Can you explain how REST equates to the location of "operation dispatching"? Have you read the dissertation?

AAAA. Yes i have. 

B. Is it possible that there are two different dimensions of scalability in this discussion? 

BB. But what's the difference?

BBB. The verbs are generic operations, and the genericity matters in this context. What are you looking to clarify?

BBB. Clarfication on how it matters.

BBBB. It may not matter, depending on what you care about.

BBBBB. Filtering requires a common data format and a common filter language. 

C. Universal methods + universal IDs = the Web. 

CC. But remember this is because the semantics of the application are explicitly assumed. 

CCC. The Web *is* a hypertext system. 

CCCC. I'd agree if REST wasn't be proposed as the philospohically correct alternative to SOAP/XLM-RPC in general.
