I was fortunate enough to be a member of the Xerox Learning Research Group during the development of the SmalltalkLanguage, and was involved in several implementations including the Dorado, the Note Taker, and a Norwegian system called the Mycron-2000.  I still wish I could be programming in Smalltalk, but for now Objective-C will have to do :-)  I also was one of the original designers of the Apple Macintosh, responsible for the Finder, the Resource Manager, and other parts of the Mac OS.  A few years at CarnegieMellonUniversity resulted in a CS Ph.D. and the opportunity to meet a lot of tremendous people.

Sometimes, I feel like I know or have met everybody in CS, thanks to my tenures at XeroxParc, CMU, and AppleComputer.  Like the degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon.  If I don't know X, I know someone who does :-)

I think that the wiki is one of the coolest things I've seen in a long time.  Thanks,  WardCunningham!

In case you want to get in touch with me, I'm currently consulting at WildPackets (Bruce.Horn@wildpackets.com) and working on my iFile project (http://www.ingenuitysoftware.com)
