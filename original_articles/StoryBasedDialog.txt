StoryBasedDialog (One of the AlternativesToPositiveDialogue)

A story-based dialog does not explicitly mention ideas. Instead, it implies ideas by talking about real-life past happenings and concrete events. The conclusion is obvious in this type of discussion even though the story does not mention the conclusion. The conclusion does not become a point of argument.

The older I get, the more I admire people who get their point across using stories.

''Is there a story about why that is so? :)''

I'd like to see an example of this in action.  Thanks.  --SamuelFalvo
