Formerly a principal of StepZero, a consulting practice specializing in enterprise software built on Java technology.  My background and experience revolves around object-oriented systems built with Smalltalk, C++, and Java.  Prior to founding StepZero with CarlKovamees I worked at WorldStreet Corporation.  Before that I worked on the Tall Ship "HMS" Rose (http://www.tallshiprose.org) and at IBM in the (now defunct) Object Technology Practice.

In my spare time I manage http://www.tallshiprose.org.
