''Quentin, AreYouThere? OrphanPage, last edit 2003-02-28''

I am a Python programmer with C/C++ background.

I recently worked at Racemi, Inc. (http://www.racemi.com) where we used wikis to write design docs, use cases, test cases, status reports.

Wiki subsumed other documentation modes like kudzu, but never overtook the marketing/windoze types.
