A WikiPage that hasn't been touched in a loooooong time. Just ''since before the millennium'' won't do. ;) Think ''old'', like, erm... 95-98. (Wiki originated in March, 1995.)

If you come across one such, and have a pressing need to edit, recording the date of the last edit seems to be a traditional homage to things archaic.

For those who would be more inclined to reflect on the irony of applying such terms as "old" or "archaic" to words whose ink, had they been so written, would barely have had time to change color - try to think in terms of a "digital historical record" and what fraction of that record's total duration is covered by a mere three to six years.
