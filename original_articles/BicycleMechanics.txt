This term is used to describe innovators due to Orville and Wilbur Wright 

They were pragmatists who converted vision to reality. While others thought about it, proposed its possibility, made sketches and even some tried in converting their dreams, the Wrights succeeded and were recognized for their success and are popularly credited with the first american flight. Every age needs those who not only think it can be, but also move on to make it real. Who as Picard says in nearly every episode "Engage" - who move beyond experimentation into engagement, innovation, and implementation.

Also the Wright Brothers were organized; they tested their work.  They built their own wind tunnels, and they discovered that the tables others were using for propeller and lift were incorrect.  They thought things through; Realizing the critical factor of steering, they worked on it until they solved it.  While rivals were barely getting off the ground, the Wrights were exhibiting their ability to bank, turn, do figure-eights, and for increasing longer periods of time.
