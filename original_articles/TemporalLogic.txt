I just wrote the link TemporalLogic elsewhere, and then double-checked what was over here, and was surprised to see that this page does not describe the formal subject of a mathematical logic of time relationships. This paragraph is a placeholder; I'll add some notes about formal temporal logic later. (meanwhile: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic )

I've never heard of the informal usage described below, whereas "temporal logic" as a field of math has been around for a couple decades.

----
TemporalLogic: What was true yesterday is not necessarily true tomorrow.

This concept is necessary when the organization you are working in changes hats, spots, and deck chairs every 6 months or so as each new management fad sweeps with a clean broom. The long term project that last month was targeted at cutting costs is now increasing revenue / market share / public goodwill.

All sorts of other kinds of logic exist.

Audience Logic: What is true when speaking to one audience is not true when speaking to another. The less offensive way to say this is that the message must be tailored to suit the listener. Post-graduate scientists and primary school children do not get the same talk when inspecting a radio telescope. Neither do Managers, Board members, and technicians.

Is Newton's Law of motion a Law or a computationally convenient approximation?
