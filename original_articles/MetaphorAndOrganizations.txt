MetaphorAndOrganizations is a collection of essays edited by David Grant and Cliff Oswick. ISBN: 0803976291

As I use metaphors a lot in workshops on change and re-engineering, I loved this book. It shows the important role of metaphor in the creation of new theories (here for organization) and the interpretation of existing theories.

One of the important aspect of metaphor consists in recognizing that when focussing on a domain through metaphor, we create "partial truths" and constructive falsehoods (GarethMorgan). This inherent falsity encourages a healthy scepticism.

I loved most the contributions of GarethMorgan (Is there anything more to be said?) and Robert Chia (Metaphors and Metaphorization in Organizational Analysis: Thinking beyond the thinkable.
