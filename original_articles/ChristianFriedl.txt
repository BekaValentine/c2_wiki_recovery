One hack of a hacker. :-)

I live and work in Vienna, Austria.

To my big dismay, most of my days are spent with PhpLanguage, and have been for almost a decade now. But then again, we're all our moneybag's whore, ain't we?

Apart from that, I am a CertifiedScrumMaster and have scrummed for some time, but it turns out I'm way better at coding than at managing after all.
