Struggling programmer, often young, who is (typically) looking at a fragment of code for the very first time, has never before seen the language, development environment, or problem domain before, and will probably never see it again.

For example, summer hires or interns who sign on to do "easy" work such as "please add the appropriate keyboard mnemonics to our menu system" are often LowlyPaidNovice(s).
