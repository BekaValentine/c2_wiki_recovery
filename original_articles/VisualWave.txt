VisualWave (part of VisualWorksSmalltalk ) translates windowspecs into HTML forms. It uses a HTML look policy to perform this magic. The response to the HTML form is then fired in sequence to all the interested parties (controllers) once the user response to the form. 

It reminds me of my 3270 days... An other interesting product is Route 1. A different beast. Window specs are translated to Java Applets and the Applet then performs a more peer to peer collection task for you.DINKY
