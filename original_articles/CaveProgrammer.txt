Hunkered down in my basement with my old IBM 709...
----
Cuddled in between the bookshelvs in my personal compscilab over an obsolete ibm 166 Mhz pc with a stack of manuals to the left, paper to the right, a towering stack of stuff on the crt in front of me, now cold coffee (gotta go fix that sad fact) and Critter's iconical presence on the shelf to the right (critter is my server on the other side of town. The representative thereof is a plush little monkey). -- KirkBailey (click for personal page and links to some of the products of my personal cave)

Is this a ProgrammerStereotype or is that really you?

Its a stereotype grounded firmly in reality. I fit this perfectly every so often -- namely when I'm writing a first implementation prior to handing it off (I often implement the "one to throw away" on my own). But this form of existence is awful and I try my best to keep my folks from getting too hairy themselves. Its impossible to sustain; eventually you start to suck at ''everything'', not just coding. --CraigEverett
