As in: ''Generic-America'' (derogatory).  Have you ever noticed that when you travel, you can wake up in the morning, look out of your hotel window and you can't tell where the hell you are?  So you climb into your equally generic looking mid-sized rental car and start driving in hopes of seeing a "Johnsonville Drycleaners" or something that tells you where you are.  Oh look, here's something familiar -- W''''''alMart,
Fazolli's ''(whatever that is)'', Petsmart, Michael's, Circuit City, Barnes and Noble, and Starbuck's.  Welcome home my friend, you're in Generica!  Travel in the U.S. is boring and mostly a waste of money.  Just drive around your town a few times, throw the $400 airfare our your window and sleep in your own comfortable bed.  The only real beauty left lies in Nature and a few decaying architectual remains... ho hum.  Frapaccino any one?

This is why, whenever I travel, I look for local breweries, wineries, and barbecue joints. You don't get the same in any two places. (That, and I like beer, wine, and barbecue.)

''Right on.  My wife and I always try to stay at B&B's and Inns for a bit more of the'' unexpected. ''Of course, we avoid chain restaurants etc. if possible too.''

{The variation found is generally per-shop rather than per-region. Thus, a distinction should be made between variety of places and the grouping characteristics of such variety. Many shops/houses with the same style are probably not that common. I guess what I am trying to say is that you find variety "close-up", not from the road.}

That's what I like about Canada. It's pretty different no matter where you go, even within one province. -- SunirShah
