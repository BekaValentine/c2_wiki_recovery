I am a Kiwi (from New Zealand). I used to work full time as a Computer 
Consultant/Programmer, and I have a degree in Electrical and Electronic 
Engineering, and a Master's degree in Technology.


For the last few years I have taken a break from work and I have been 
traveling, seeing the world. I had the opportunity open up with what seemed 
like (at the time), a bad situation, but as the saying goes, maybe that 
dark cloud has a silver lining. It may not have been silver, but it has 
been amazing and not at all what I expected, and I have learnt a tremendous 
amount (of course not all of that are things that I would have wanted 
to learn, but life is life ;-).

Before I started traveling, I did my Master's thesis (while working full-time) that has the practical (and some theory) at WhyEdit http://www.YEdit.com/

At the beginning of 2004 YEdit was re-written and split up into easier to read sections.
