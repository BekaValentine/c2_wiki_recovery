CeePlusPlusOneWhy (sorry for the name, is there a better one?)

C++1y which is a working name for what is now C++14.

This is a new standard for CeePlusPlus to take it beyond CeePlusPlusEleven.

Some implementation is available already see

* http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx1y.html for GnuCpp (version 4.9.0)
* http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html for Clang (CeeLanguageFamilyFrontEnd) (versions 3.4 and 3.5)

'''Literal Constants'''

Some literal constants have been moved into a namespace. This can cause mysterious problems with existing code breaking.

Example:

   auto val = 1.0i
This defines a complex number to be '''i'''. It now needs the following:

  #include <complex>
  using namespace std::literals::complex_literals;
Otherwise there is a compiler error.

For more information see http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3779.pdf

Tested using Clang 3.5 svn and libc++ svn with -std=c++1y, December 2013
