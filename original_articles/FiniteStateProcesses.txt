FSP is a process specification language based closely on CommunicatingSequentialProcesses.

http://www-dse.doc.ic.ac.uk/concurrency/

Minor differences from CSP are:
* alphabets are inferred
* support for indexing
* processes can be parameterised.

An FSP program is equivalent to a LabelledTransitionSystem. An analyser for these systems that takes FSP programs as input is available from the above URL.
