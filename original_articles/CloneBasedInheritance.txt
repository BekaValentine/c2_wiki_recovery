In CloneBasedInheritance, one clones a master or parent object to "inherit" its properties. This tends to mirror the biological approach to inheritance. For all intents and purposes, the cloned object acts identical to the parent (until changed). There is no distinction between class and object here.

Whether actual executable code is copied or merely references to the code copied for methods depends on the language.
