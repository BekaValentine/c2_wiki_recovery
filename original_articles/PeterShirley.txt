mid-2002: JustaProgrammer at Washington Mutual. What was left of the old Keystroke team was "acquired" along with our product a few months back.

May 2004: Still at WaMu, working on... well, whatever I'm asked to work on. Pitch in here, lend a hand there. Busy and having fun, what more could I ask for?

September 2008: Left WaMu in October 2007, now working for HCL, a large Indian technology company.

November 2013: Gracious, how time flies. Earlier this year HCL sold my division to Linedata, a French company. I think all three parties (my division, HCL, and Linedata) found the change a positive one; it seems a good one to me. Closer to home, my wife and I moved from Seattle to Boise in September of this year -- also a good move, apart from the new distance we must travel to see the friends that we miss.
