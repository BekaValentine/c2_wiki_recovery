(ISBN: 1591394449) Does''''''IT''''''Matter? "Does IT Matter?" is the name of a controversial book that suggests a rethink on the BusinessValue of IT (Information Technology).
----
The author, Nicholas Carr, started with the controversies in his 2003 HBR article called "IT does not matter".

One of the chapters "The Universal Strategy Solvent", has a subtitle called "The IT Infrastructure's Corrosive Effect on Traditional Advantages". I do not have resources to buy the book, but can understand that escalating costs and rapid obsolescence derail multi-year infrastructure projects.

In the BusinessProcessManagement book "The Third Wave", the authors made this observation
* ''Once embedded in a computer program, the IT department owns the process - forever...Give ownership of the business process management back to the business people''

In some companies, EnterpriseResourcePlanning software is acquired precisely for that reason, to bring "unruly" users to using standard processes, as cost of customization can be really high. Having standard processes means more opportunities for BusinessProcessOutsourcing later on.

* DoesItMatter? :) Sorry for the pun. Seriously, although it can be annoying clicking on a link and come to this page, and subsequently finding unexpected contents, this kind of thing will happen anyway due to AccidentalLinking, which is actually a desired "feature" of wiki. It makes wiki more like real life, where chance occurrences have more influence on life's outcomes than people admit.
* If there is a serious concern by the WikiCommunity, I suggest use of a WikiPedia approach to disambiguation. I would suggest letting the original creator of the page decide.
