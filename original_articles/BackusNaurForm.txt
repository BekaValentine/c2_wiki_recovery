Backus-Naur Form (BNF, also known as Backus-Naur Notation) is the name of many closely related MetaLanguage''''''s for describing the syntax of a ProgrammingLanguage.  Long used with many variations, there is now an ISO standard called Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).  The InternetEngineeringTaskForce also has its own standard extension to BNF, Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF), which most of its format/protocol standards use to specify syntax in their respective RFCs.

BNF was developed by JohnBackus and/or PeterNaur. Its first major use was to describe the syntax of AlgolSixty.
