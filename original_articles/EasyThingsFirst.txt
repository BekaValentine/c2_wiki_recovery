Instead of WorstThingsFirst or EasiestThingFirstHardestSecond, simply do EasyThingsFirst.

The idea is that solving the easiest things first, you will get hindsight on how to do the second easiest, and so on. Usually complicated problems are complicated because we don't know the easy things. Complicated problems are made up of simple things, only too many of them.

Or when in doubt of which is the easiest of all, JustDoIt.
