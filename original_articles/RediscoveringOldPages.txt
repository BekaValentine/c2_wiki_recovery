Spam here on WardsWiki acts as a sort of RandomPages, except that it demands attention from those who care. It brings to our attention pages that might otherwise be forgotten and cycles them up into RecentChanges, where more people get to see them.

Ah, there is '''''something''''' good about the amount of spam we're seeing.

''Actually, I was thinking something along the same lines. The only sad thing is that it destroys the last genuine modification date. There's something very nice about finding a page that hasn't been modified in two, three or maybe even five years.''

Agreed - the same is true of pages having categories put on them.

I think of any process that touches old pages as "turning the compost".
* spam removal
* categorization
* fixing spelling mistakes
* fixing BrokenLink''''''s
* resurrecting old conversations
This only really makes a difference to RecentChangesJunkie''''''s. There are many other ways for WikiGnome''''''s to dig beneath the tip of the WikiIceberg, such as RandomPages, WantedPages, and ReallyValuablePages. They also look at random searches and BackLink''''''s.
