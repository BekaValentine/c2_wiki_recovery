This one probably came from the fact that the Puritans, coming over to a rocky Cape Cod (in Massachusetts, in the UnitedStates), had to work quite hard to survive.  They were also driven from behind by Calvinist religions of predestination (either you're saved or you're not, and you must be perfect; if you have the urge to not be perfect, you must not show it or otherwise you have not been saved).
