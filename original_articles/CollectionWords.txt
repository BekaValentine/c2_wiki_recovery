Within the class of Compound words and Simple words is found a set of words which refer to Collections. These I call CollectionWords (to make a WikiWord of it and to express it as a C''''''ollectionWord itself, I add the final "s" which I call the F''''''inalSchar.

I am thinking that there are many S''''''impleWords and C''''''ompoundWords (notice again the F''''''inalSchar) which can be further separated and grouped so as to fall in a G''''''roupWithCommonCharacteristics.

They fall under several types:
* S''''''impleWords which indicate a collection through their meaning (usually as a type)
** animal
** plant
** meeting
** reunion
** crowd
** audience
** group
** screened (differentiated)(as those who have passed some fitness tests or have documents indicating such (membership, credit-worthy, passed through detection devices, etc.))
* S''''''impleWords for C''''''ollectionContainers
** collection
** array
** tuple
** list
** hash
** database
** library
** numbes
** type
* S''''''impleWords with an added F''''''inalSchar (usually but not always a noun).
** friends
** programmers
** actions
** procedures
** contents
* C''''''ompoundWords
** dashed-words (S''''''impleWords separated by a "-"
** O''''''therWords which are delimited by special characters
** What we here call WikiWords [type U''''''pperCaseChar followed by any number of type L''''''owerCaseChar followed by the same again and perhaps again and again)
** H''''''yperWords (Words which have a S''''''pecialAppearance (underlined, tinted, or both) and have an E''''''mbeddedHyperlink)
** Other Special C''''''ompoundContructionWords which include numbers and other characters
