BrettNeumeier is a programmer. He tries to be Pragmatic, with indifferent success, and tries to do worthwhile and productive things on his own time, with less success.

He is awed by Wiki and many of its contributors. He derives a great deal of amusement from the fact that the WikiWeb's automated SpellChecker flags "Wiki" as a probable misspelling.
