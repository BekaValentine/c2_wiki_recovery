* Windows NT Server 4.0 for Netware Administrators (out of print) was for many the definitive work, both comprehensive and eminently readable.
* PC Hardware in a Nutshell, now being revised, gives in-depth coverage essential for the DIY mobo to system enthusiast, or anyone wanting to keep informed about hardware components.
