Yet another TomLehrer song parody (of ''It Makes a Fellow Proud to be a Soldier'', for those not familiar with his discography)

 The heart of everyone in this department swells with pride
 For the land's elite, the dregs of which, are coding at his side
 For the fascinating processes and procedures that we fight
 And the strange and buggy software that we're called upon to write
 
 Now Frank, he is a GrayBeard who wrote programs for BigBlue
 He ''clearly'' knows more about programming than either me or you
 He thinks that GUIs are a bunch of hype
 He longs for punchcards and teletype
 It makes a fellow proud to be a coder
 
 Johnson is a process guy who comes from JPL
 He's never written a line of code, I guess it's just as well
 His designs are clearly perfect, he cries
 (Implementation's left as an exercise)
 It makes a fellow proud to be a coder

 After Charles got through MS training, he
 Was certified in everything DotNet
 But his next project, see
 Is using EJB
 They haven't had the heart to tell him yet...

 Prasad is a new college hire, with energy to match
 He thinks that we should redesign the enterprise from scratch
 "Give me coffee and pizza", he says
 "And I'll have it done in a couple of days"
 It makes a fellow proud to be a coder
 
 Wei-ling is the solitary woman on our team
 And the single guys are all in love with her, it seems
 But they have no chance of getting near
 She's dating a doctor, or so I hear
 It makes a fellow proud to be a coder
 
 Steven is a hacker, who once had to do hard time
 For breaking into Citibank (though he didn't steal a dime)
 He never comments or tests his code
 "If it compiles, it's ready to load!"
 It makes a fellow proud to be a coder

 Our manager is the bitter, broken type
 Passed over for promotion years ago
 He's counting down the days
 'Til he can slink away
 (Assuming that they don't first let him go!)
 
 Richard was a Cobol man, who knew Admiral Grace
 But his resume's outdated, and he hasn't kept the pace
 A senior analyst back in his day
 Now he writes scripts in VBA
 It makes a fellow proud to be
 As an undergrad I vowed to be
 What luck to be allowed to be a co-o-o-o-der! (is it five yet?)
