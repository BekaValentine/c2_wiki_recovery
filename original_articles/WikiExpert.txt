Here's an idea:  make a Web site, like a wiki inasmuch as it can be modified by anyone, but instead of semantic links it has yes/no questions.  Each question is either allowed at any point, a terminal point on the site, or an intermediate question only accessible under certain conditions.

Users would be able to edit or modify any question's content, like a wiki page, but also decide what previous questions' answers are required for it to be presented.

Possible applications:
	* A search engine of some sort, where the terminal nodes contain links to things.
	* A game of 20 questions.
	* A really specific, picky personals site.
	* An experiment in conversational ArtificialIntelligence, of sorts, watching what happens when humans let the computer dictate the conversation.

The reason this page is called WikiExpert is because this might be a neat way to make a general-purpose ExpertSystem.
