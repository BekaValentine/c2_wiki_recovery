I'm a Ph.D. student in numerical mathematics at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TheNetherlands, part of Europe for the geographically challenged).

As such, I write and rewrite lots of toy programs. Any opinions I have on designing large pieces of software are most likely false.

E-mail me at mailto:stephanh@win.tue.nl, but only if you really want to... My ''real'' homepage is at http://www.win.tue.nl/~stephanh.

Stephan - I like your spoof of the LinuxPerceptionProblems page. Of course, it is important to realize that they were only talking about ''perceptions'' there, and it was rude of you to intrude with facts. I hope you've learned your lesson. Also, please don't mire technical debates with talk of religion, especially when your critics bring up religion first. After all, talk of religion only mires the discussion. :) -- SteveHowell
