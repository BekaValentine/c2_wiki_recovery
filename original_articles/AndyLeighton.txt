Senior developer for Thomas Cook Retail.

New project on the horizon, for which I hope to use as many ExtremeProgrammingPractices as I can get away with.  More information and progress reports on this will appear when things get going.

So far I have had luke-warm responses from some of the other programmers when I mentioned writing user tests before coding and refactoring.  
This may be due to their background and lack of experience in the field, or it may be due to the language they use PowerBuilder.

I guess I am going to have to lead by example by doing some ExtremeProgrammingForOne and hope they notice how much more fun it is.

I also hope that I will have time to investigate how to apply ExtremeProgramming to PowerBuilder which might also be of interest to people who do VisualBasic as well.

I have also set up a wiki at work, however I am the only person using it at the moment.
