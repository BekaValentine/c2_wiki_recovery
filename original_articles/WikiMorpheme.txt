Have any of these ever been lost? It could be a socio-linguistic question of some magnitude. 

I ask because I'm sure I created this page once upon a time - probably straight from HotPotatoes (and isn't that a nice phrase, while we're into morphemes). If my memory serves me correctly I described WardCunningham's evident excitement about the idea of morphemes within WikiName''''''s over coffee in Portland in 1999. I always liked to think that LikePages arose in small part from that conversation. If you can find that account for me elsewhere on Wiki I'd be eternally grateful. (Eternally could of course be an exaggeration, depending on your worldview. But we should probably let the offending morpheme pass, given all else.)

This all arose because of the idea of MorphemeSwitch, which is a key pattern on Wiki. Or it was in my day, as they say. -- RichardDrake
