Sounds like Wiki can make communication more available for a workplace situation. However, I am so right brained that any type of coding gets in the way of my global conceptualizing.  I will read further and try to get this implemented for a large department (if suitable).  Any tips or suggestions. Need to know more? 

I have spent a junior year abroad program in Denmark with Scandinavian Seminar. I am now a graphics specialist/designer.
