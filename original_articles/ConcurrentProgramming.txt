Extracted from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ugrad/FBS-Article.htm -- A concurrent program consists of a collection of sequential processes whose execution is interleaved; the interleaving is the result of choices made by a scheduler and is not under programmer control. Lots of execution interleavings are possible, making testing of all but trivial concurrent programs infeasible.
