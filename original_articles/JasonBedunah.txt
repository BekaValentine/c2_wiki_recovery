ExtremeProgrammer converted from the RUP world. Made the jump to management and actually LOVE it.

Going to write a cool book one of these days.

Also interested in DirectResponseMarketing, ConsumerPsychology and CopyWriting and do that on the side in my spare time. My trusty writing pen (ads in magazines and sales letters) has created nearly $750,000 for my client in the last 6 months... (as of 11/4/2004)
