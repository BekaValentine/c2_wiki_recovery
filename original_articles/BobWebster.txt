BobWebster will have all he can do filling in his own page without worrying about writing one for RossKowalski to boot.  

I fell into Ward's Wiki a few weeks ago while searching for some info on Scheme hoping to use LispMe on PalmOs. Having recently read WeavingTheWeb, I thought the Wiki to be just what the doctor ordered.  But RossKowalski is right.  PublicEducation, at least where I teach, is not about to allow much Wiki-ing.

I have some concerns about mucking up a professional programmer's Wiki with the concerns of a professional educator.  But not enough concern to keep me from asking about HabitsOfMind for professional programmers. Can they be taught, or at least, fostered?

Hey! I really like the way this Wiki shows the corrections vs. the original, colors and all. Pretty slick!

What do you mean by "Ward's Wiki"?
