'''Q:''' If cgi/ doesn't work and cgi-bin/ does, isn't that a problem on the server side?

'''A:''' Yes. The server needs to read/write cookies for the whole c2.com domain (and any subdomains).

'''Q:''' Is the UserName cookie system secure?

'''A:''' No. Using a UserName is entirely optional and is not meant as a form of login. There is no validation. It is easy for anyone to enter another's name, but it's rude.  GrammarVandal rudely spoofs UserName''''''s on a regular basis, and the consequence is the GrammarVandal/SharkBot EditWar. The UserName cookie is thus no longer safe to use until a real authentication system is put into place.

'''Q:''' Why would I want to be identified?

'''A:''' Several reasons:
* To make connections both to ideas and to people.
* To show responsibility for changes.
* To claim ownership of particular text so others don't change one's words without permission (discounting spelling and grammar corrections, etc.).
* Courtesy, egotism, provocation -- many other reasons both valid and invalid. Just ask around.

'''Q:''' WhyDoesMyUserNameDisappear?

'''A:''' There are several possible reasons, some of which have to do with the way your browser handles cookies. (MozillaFirefox users see the UserName page.) If you are using a cookie cleaner or session-only cookie manager your UserName will disappear every time you exit your browser. Also, your UserName will disappear once the cookie has expired.

'''Q:''' My cookie expires December 31, 2004. Then what?

'''A:''' All old UserName cookies expired December 31, 2004. c2.com does not make use of expired cookies, your own browser probably deletes them, and your UserName disappears. Fresh cookies were instituted in early 2005. Have c2.com set a fresh cookie for your UserName.

'''Q:''' How can I tell if I have a UserName before I save an edit and check RecentChanges?

'''A:''' Go to http:wikiOptions to set the UserName cookie for paths under http://c2.com/cgi. Most browsers let you view cookies; on Safari it is in Preferences > Security > Show Cookies.
