LothieBelle is currently Mimi Herrmann. However, she's got too many damn names:

	* Mary-Ursula Herrmann
	* Mimi Herrmann
	* Mimi Garnett
	* Mimi Carpenter
	* Mary U. Carpenter

Mary U. Herrmann is currently her legal name (though Mimi is the name she goes by). She's decided that this is it and she's never changing it again. By contrast, she's been known as "Lothie" for 33 years, the last 27 of those on the Net. The "Belle" part is because she's also known as "La Belle Dame Sans Merci" in certain circles, so "Lothie Belle" is just a shortening of the two.

Am I making sense yet? What I'm trying to say is don't tell me to use my real name; Lothie (or Lothie Belle) *is* my real name. See also TorneWuff.

On to the particulars! Lothie is (currently) a network security analyst. She has two cats, two Lionhead rabbits, two adult daughters from her first marriage and a twelve year old stepson. Oh, and a very cute husband. She's poly, kinky, into Anime, fiber art, and jewelry making, and loves to learn new stuff. Her web site, http://www.lothie.com/ , has its own Wiki. She's currently learning Ruby.

Oh, also she plays a little guitar, sings, sells Avon, and writes.
