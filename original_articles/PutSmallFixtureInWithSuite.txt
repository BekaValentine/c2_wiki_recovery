When using VBUnit sometimes its a bit awkward creating suites that only run one fixture, or your suite takes a while to run and you only want to run one fixture, PutSmallFixtureInWithSuite --

If you add this class to your templates folder you can create a new test with just one file.

Start Small''''''Test.cls ---

 Option Explicit
 
 Implements ISuite
 Implements IFixture
 
 Private m_assert As IAssert
 
 'Implement IFixtureFrame if you need to do complex initialization once for all tests
 'Don't do anything expensive in Class_Initialize or Class_Terminate!
 'Implements IFixtureFrame
 
 Private Function ISuite_Suite() As ITest
   
   Dim suite As New Test''''''Suite
   suite.Suite''''''Name = Type''''''Name(Me)
   
   suite.Add''''''Fixture Me
   
   Set ISuite_Suite = suite
 End Function
 
 'Setup and Tear''''''Down will be called before and after each test method
 Private Sub IFixture_Setup(assert As IAssert)
   Set m_assert = assert
   m_assert.Enable''''''Print''''''Msg
   m_assert.Set''''''Severity vbUnit_Assertion, vbunit_Suite
 End Sub
 
 Private Sub IFixture_TearDown()
 End Sub
 
 Public Sub Test''''''Plus''''''Works()
   m_assert.Longs''''''Equal 6, 2+3, "Check Addition works"       
 End Sub

End Small''''''Test.cls ---
