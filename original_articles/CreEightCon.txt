A conference of creative talent in film, video, music, advertising and sometimes interactive media. By attending these conferences I've learned that creativity (in their context) is going out on a limb with someone else's money in a way that will only work out well if the general public loves it. Screen writers and computer programmers don't count.

''Well, obviously. If any old person could claim to be "creative" merely by virtue of taking part in strenuous acts of creation requiring years of training and experience to do well, what would the world come to? You'd end up with people at that conference that didn't wear black! Some of them might even have OrdinarySmallTownHaircuts.''

Don't misunderstand the conference. These aren't the people who wear black. These are the people who actually do have talent and choose to do expensive things with it. Consider Nike. The guy who moved production overseas wouldn't grok cre8con. The guy who coined "just do it" would. You don't have to be either to appreciate what they do. 

''I decided to find a working gif this morning because I remembered how Ward had recommended this. It sounds an inspiring event.''

''creativity (in their context) is going out on a limb with someone else's money in a way that will only work out well if the general public loves it.''

That sounds mightly like what a lot of us software types do for a living, doesn't it? Why then would it be that ''computer programmers don't count'' ?

''Because humility is sometimes good?''

Sometimes it is. Wouldn't our industry be improved in certain respects if we did more often treat what we do as a creative activity (with all the baggage that word brings with it)
