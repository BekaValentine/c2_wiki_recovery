''We're not building a dog house here, we are including processes which will result in UsefulUseableUsed Systems.'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20140609
----
In building systems for use, we involve at least these four processes:
* Anaylyzing and establishment of Required Features
* Planning the System
* Designing and Programming the Systems
* Implementing Ease of Use and Change Management

For Dynamic-Systems, the processes listed above may be repeated due to changing environments and UseCases

Generation of deliverables in each of the processes require cooperative collaboration between planners and implementers with continual feedback from the using community.
