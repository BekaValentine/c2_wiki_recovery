Today, November 5, 2000, NationalPublicRadio ran a 15-minute story by Alex Van Oss on the impact of architecture on our lives. It featured ChristopherAlexander and others. I'm not much of a note taker, but this is what I got.

* Winson Churchill -- first we shape our building, then they shape us
* William Whyte -- measured conversations
* Fred Kent -- ProjectForPublicSpaces
* Roger Lewis -- 2000 year history ... classical architecture ... Vitruvius' commodity, firmness, delight
* Matheu Masca 
* ChristopherAlexander -- light two sides, site repair -- contracts, building, design, management.	
* Peter Wadel -- Tudor Place artist in residence

All Things Considered: 

''In the late 1970s, Christopher Alexander became an icon in the architecture world with his book, A Pattern Language. In it, he argued for injecting personal, emotional and spiritual qualities into manmade structures, streets and cities. 
Alexander's book challenged the architectural establishment and derided much that's been built over the past century as "deadly." ''
