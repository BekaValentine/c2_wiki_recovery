Currently I am developing a novel approach to programming, ConceptOrientedProgramming (COP), and a new data model, ConceptOrientedModel (COM).

'''I obtained the following major results:''' 

'''[2003-Present]''' Keywords: Programming paradigms, Data modelling paradigms, System analysis and design

* I have been developing a new programming paradigm, ConceptOrientedProgramming (COP): http://conceptoriented.org/wiki/Concept-oriented_programming 
** a new programming construct ConceptInCop is proposed which generalizes conventional classes: http://conceptoriented.org/wiki/Concept_(concept-oriented_programming) 
** it generalizes ObjectOrientedProgramming 
** it is an alternative to AspectOrientedProgramming 

* I have been developing a new data modelling paradigm, ConceptOrientedModel (COM): http://conceptoriented.org/wiki/Concept-oriented_model 
** it is based on order relation for describing data semantics 
** nested partially ordered sets is a formal basis for the model 

'''[1999-2006]''' Keywords: Data mining, Knowledge discovery in databases, rule induction 

* I developed a novel approach to (dependence) rule induction with the following properties:
** rule interestingness is defined as a difference between real probability and expected probability (degree of surprise)
** an efficient method for finding an upper bound for this measure of interestingness was proposed (support quota) which allows us to avoid exhaustive search 

* I developed a novel approach to fuzzy rule induction

* I developed and implemented a data mining system SPIN!: http://conceptoriented.org/savinov/spin/index.html 
** it has a plug-in architecture so that new components can be easily added 
** it can use EJBs for running (data mining) algorithms 
** it is written in Java 

'''[1989-1999]''' Keywords: Expert systems, Artificial intelligence, Fuzzy knowledge representation and inference

* I developed a novel approach to fuzzy knowledge representation and inference with the following properties: http://conceptoriented.org/savinov/fmda.html: 
** it is analogous to classical CNF and DNF
** it is based on so called sectioned matrixes
** it uses a new operation of fuzzy resolution: http://conceptoriented.org/savinov/fresol.html 
* I implemented this formal approach in an expert system shell EDIP which was then used to create several working expert systems 
** it is written in C++ for Windows 3.x
