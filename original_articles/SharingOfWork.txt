One of the things common to success is the SharingOfWork. From the gathering of the nets in fishing to the give and take sawing using the two-handled saw to drop large trees, work sharing has been used to good effect. In ExtremeProgramming this is present in the use of PairProgramming. Experience has shown that a SecondSetOfEyes often discovers very quickly the faults and shortcomings of a ProducedArtifact. Particularly useful, the SharingOfWork allows the production of artifacts larger, more complete, and composed in a far more complex form, than that possible by a SoloWorker. 

It might be said that with the SharingOfWork, Civilization began. When one has proceeded far enough up the NeedsTriangle, one can begin to produce artifacts for community or social use. 

It is also one of the basic tenets of the Wiki, that the page (ProducedArtifact) is improved, extended via Edits, Forward and BackLinks, and by deletion and correction into becoming a UsefulArtifact.
