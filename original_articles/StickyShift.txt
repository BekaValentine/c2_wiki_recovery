Sticky Shift is the phenomenon that ChrisWatson first indentified in the year 2001 in which he found that he consistently and repeatedly capitalized incorrectly the same word over and over again.

ChrisWatson is currently going through rehab to rid himself of this phenomenon.

''Is this related to WikiNameInRealLifeSyndrome? If so, is the rehab helping?''

Nope, things are not improving at all. -- ChrisWatson

I HaveThisPattern. Sortof. Whenever I mistype words, I find I have ''correctly'' typed a ''different'' word by accident, sometimes one that I intended to type later in the sentence, but more often a consistent word-for-word replacement. My keyboard is slippy in the Freudian sense.

''I can type about 40 words per minute, and I rarely hunt for the correct key to press. But recently I find myself, as you have, typing a total incorrect word such as 'the' instead of 'a'. Umm -- Chris Watson''

I HaveThisPattern too, except I tend to Capitalize all Nouns. I guess it comes from five years of German in High School...

Me too (or perhaps ME too....). There's also the transposition of 2 letters. -- PeteHardie

When I was nine years old, I chose the handle "Big Ben", to be ironic and abbreviative, in that order. But I typed it "BIg Ben" so often that I made that the official capitalization. And this was in 1987, before k.d. lang and widespread Unix access made case-sensitivity "hip". -- NickBensema ''tell that to e.e. cummings.''

I also have a quirk about spelling; utilizing capital letters inappropriately, such as TikTOK. [''Your quirk, or hitting Caps Lock by mistake?'']

HMMM

Were you disappointed? You should have looked for TOYota, HOnda or datSUN.
