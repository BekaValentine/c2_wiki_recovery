Hello - I use wikis for my online classes that simulate online organizations where students "work". The whole websites of these organizations are in twiki, as well as all the student collaboration and project areas. Student tasks include improving the organization. See http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/TWikiSuccessStoryOfTecnologicoDeMonterrey. Has any of you used wikis for class work? I'd be interested to hear about it - mailto:jicaza@gmail.com, http://copernico.mty.itesm.mx/~jicaza
