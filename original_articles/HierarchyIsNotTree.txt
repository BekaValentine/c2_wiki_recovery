Perhaps it needs a careful reading to be sure, but this implies that "hieararchy" and "tree" are something different:

''Why does this surprise you? Other than trees, hierarchies are commonly represented by lattices and other partially ordered sets.''

It means different things in different contexts.

The article never mentions trees, so how can it say anything about them?
