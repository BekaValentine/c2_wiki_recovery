FuzzyPartitions are common office space dividers, often covered with a nappy fabric.

The fabric used to cover the FuzzyPartitions is great for using thumb tacks to put up bits of paper, but you can't easily affix a picture hanger to hold your signed Robert Bateman print.

Given that OfficeCubicles are often constucted with FuzzyPartitions, any employee working while in their cubicle may actually be using FuzzyLogic or FuzzyThinking.
