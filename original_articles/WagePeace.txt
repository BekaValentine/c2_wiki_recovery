Wage Peace by Judyth Hill
	 :	Wage peace with your breath.
	 :	Breathe in firemen and rubble,
	 :	breathe out whole buildings.
	 :	Breathe in terrorists and breathe out
	 :	sleeping children and freshly mown fields.
	 :	Breathe in confusion and breathe out maple trees.
	 :	Breathe in the fallen and
	 :	breathe out lifelong friendships intact.
	 :	Wage peace with your listening:
	 :	hearing sirens, pray loud.
	 :	Remember your tools:
	 :	flower seeds, clothespins, clean rivers.
	 :	Make soup.
	 :	Play music, learn the word for thank you in three
	 :	languages.
	 :	Learn to knit, and make a hat.
	 :	Think of chaos as dancing raspberries,
	 :	imagine grief as the outbreath of beauty
	 :	or the gesture of fish.
	 :	Swim for the other side.
	 :	Wage peace.
	 :	Never has the world seemed so fresh and precious.
	 :	Have a cup of tea and rejoice.
	 :	Act as if armistice has already arrived.
	 :	Don't wait another minute.
