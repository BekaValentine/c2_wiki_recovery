The Envy Version of SUnit requires special considerations:
I'd like to get feedback on the following:
	* Do you prefer one application with a GUI, or two applications - one with GUI and the other with the TestCase stuff?

''I prefer two separate applications. Otherwise, it's more work to instrument a headless image with TestCase''''''s. You would have to load the SUnit application, which requires a lot of GUI support applications, and strip all the unnecessary GUI stuff for packaging. Also, if you want to use your own GUI, or run the SUnit test cases from TestMentor, you don't need the TestRunner or TestModel or whatever it is called. For maintaining SUnit, it should be easier to make the SUnit kernel ANSI compatible and portable without modifications if it is a separate application in ENVY. -- JoachimGeidel''
