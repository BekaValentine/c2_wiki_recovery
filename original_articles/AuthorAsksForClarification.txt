... at the end of the formal review input of a
WritersWorkshop, the author may be anxious about
some of the things that were said.  Until now,
the author has been a FlyOnTheWall, but we can't
have a SafeSetting unless the author is given a
chance to speak (beyond just reading the work as in
AuthorReadsTheWork).

'''Not all reviewer comments stand alone.'''

In a WritersWorkshop, reviewers are providing comments
on-the-fly, comments that may not fully articulate the
reviewer's rationale.

'''Reviewer comments can be ambiguous, confusing, or'''
'''unclear in many ways.'''

It doesn't serve the author (and the work) well if the
author leaves before the reviewers clarify their comments.

'''Therefore:'''

'''The AuthorAsksForClarification after the'''
'''moderator calls an end to the formal comments.'''

Note that this is ''not'' an opportunity for the
author to clarify his or her position with the
reviewers, since the pattern must stand on its own.
The information flows from the reviewers to the author,
not vice versa.

If authors disagree with any reviewer conclusions or
remarks, they should take them away from
the writer's workshop in silence.  Such disagreement
or remarks provide information for the author, information
the author can use to clarify the pattern on the next
iteration.  By mutual agreement, the author and reviewer
can discuss deeper issues (and, particularly, technical
issues) in the afterglow of the workshop.

'''*  *  *'''

This brings the ceremony to closure and ties up all the
formal loose ends.  Further patterns, like ThankTheAuthor,
provide more complete emotional closure.
The author can now take the
feedback and iterate further on the pattern, making
SelectiveChanges. 

'''NEXT:'''  ThankTheAuthor
