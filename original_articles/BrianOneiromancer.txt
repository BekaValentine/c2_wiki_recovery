Brian chooses to keep his last name private, as a matter of simple internet policy.  He initially appeared on this Wiki with the name P''''''rinceOfStories, before being aware of the RealNamesPlease directive, and proceeded to discuss the pros and cons of this policy at length on RealNamesPlease discussion.  This name was the compromise measure reached, to allow Wiki users to know his real first name and prevent confusion between the PenName P''''''rinceOfStories and the ExtremeProgramming concept of UserStory.

OK, so right now I'm very new here, and just decided I would make myself a name. Usually I go by Oneiromancer, but since I've realized WikiWiki links depend on multi-word combinations, I decided to use my alternate PenName which 
is yet another name for NeilGaiman's TheSandman. I'm playing a bit here, and maybe I'll try and come back and make this a more formal description of myself later, but feel free to destroy the page if it violates the principles of WikiWiki in some way. I'll survive. My e-mail is oneiromancer@caffei.net and I have a philosophically inclined WebLog / WebJournal / WhateverTheHellYouWantToCallIt online at http://0neiros.scribble.nu/?e=all

Aww, heck, and here I thought this was gonna be a page about an XP system design god. Actually, I quite like the title in that [XP] context. Any takers? -- GarryHamilton

Oh, geez, I just went over this over at meatball when I saw the RealNamesPlease page (or its equivalent, I forget) over there on the RecentChanges page. I thought it was just them and that things were more civilized here... OK, I'll reprint my objections here that I put over there.

Requiring the use of something that LOOKS like a real name is completely useless. I don't use a pseudonym here or elsewhere to hide my identity, and I wish to be totally open, contactable and to have a consistent, non-morphing identity. But I've been using the handle Oneiromancer, or, when that's unavailable, P''''''rinceOfStories, since I was 15, and that's just who I am online. It allows me more consistency to be known this way than by using my birth name,
and what's more, it allows me a layer of protection. Now, I don't much believe in the idea of rampant internet stalkers or anything, but I don't want an employer or someone who thinks I stole their girlfriend or something from "real life" going to find out as much as they can about me and finding everything I ever wrote about online. My online and offline identity are permanently connected, and I'm not saying someone who really wants to can't break from either one to the other one, but it does provide a modicum of insulation, like a firewall, and I don't see any real benefit to the community, its members, or myself, to removing that layer of insulation, or that connection to my history online. My name won't mean anything to you unless you know me personally, which is unlikely, but my pseudonym might. It's a lot more likely in an online community with some common interests to cross paths with someone from elsewhere online then from elsewhere in person.

PS - the "kind-of pseudonym" offered at the top of UsingRealNames is unsatisfactory, because a) I don't want anonymity, I want consistency with my identity elsewhere b) I do change computers and IPs all the time, so not only would I not have consistent identity with myself elsewhere online, but I wouldn't have consistent identity with myself here. I came across WikiWiki by way of c2.com, and maybe if this is unacceptable to you I'll just stick with them, but you need to see the failure of such requirements. I know the well did it, and for a time thrived, but it just doesn't make sense.

Dear P''''''rinceOfStories, IMHO sometimes RNP doesn't seem to make the point and neither do you. The wiki is an open system that needs a set of rules so that people can cooperate fruitfully. These rules are under development and some may be or seem arbitrary. The basic agreement to develop a common culture (of rules and accepted behaviour) is at the very heart of the wiki, because otherwise the wiki won't work. What you and some others (that break RNP) show is a dislike for rules at all. Go to a chess club and tell them that you want to play (fine!) and play to changed rules (why not try?) ... that are much better than the traditional chess rules anyway (f*** off!). So if RNP is the rule in this wiki you should respect this rule if at all possible. If you can't (you may have a valid reason) both sides may agree to give you an exception of RNP (I like rules that have exceptions) but please don't try to make this a philosophical question and change the whole system to fit your special case. 

There are wikis that live without RNP, especially if they are grown with a chat, game or fantasy background. So RNP is an arbitrary decision of the host (initially) and of the community, but it is a decision that won't be changed for single users. But... there is a much more important point with RNP that has little to do with the wiki and nothing to do with imposing rules. It is about the position of the individual in the online community and about how to get synergy from this relationship. Some time ago I wrote a little about this in GoByCar. If you don't feel free, gain your freedom. If you think you need security, try without and experience that all your fears were in vain. If you do, for some reason the wiki community is bound to help you. -- HelmutLeitner

''How does the name have anything to determine the validity of the ideas expressed? The ideas/comments should stand on their own weight.''

Signing your real name doesn't make your contributions more "valid", but it shows that you stand behind your contributions.  It forces you to reconcile your actions here with your actions elsewhere.  For instance, your next potential employer will probably search the web for your name.  If you use your real name here they may find and read your contributions.  By signing your real name you adopt the same responsibility for your words as you would in any other professional setting.  (This opinion comes from someone who has used an online pseudonym since 1981 and has accepted responsibility for becoming known as "the B''''''oogerClub chap".) -- EricHodges
