I'm a programmer at CyrusInnovation.  I've been reading wiki regularly since around November of 2000, but my contributions don't usually go beyond little maintenance tasks--I'm not careful or patient enough to have much luck with major edits.

As of July of 2007, I'm doing ExtremeProgramming full time, and finding it just as good as it sounded. I do mostly Java and Ruby at work, and play with anything else I can get my hands on at home.

You can email me at gmail, where my address is my first and last names with a dot between them.

Thinking a lot lately about ways to combine Wikis and WebLog''''''s.

Moss,

It appeared someone have credited you with the excellent DeletionConventions page. I have not seen you around much after Edit code word implementation. Would like to see you continue here if you are not too affected by controversies in recent months. -- dl

''I'm afraid I can't actually take credit for the DeletionConventions, much as I'd love to be able to, though I guess I did participate a little bit in some of the discussions that led to it. As for my absence from Wiki, it's been due to lack of time rather than fear of controversy. Just finished moving to a new job in a new city, and hoping that now I'll be able to find more time to participate. --MossCollum''
