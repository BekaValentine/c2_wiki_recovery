'''What books does everyone have in their personal libraries, and what are their publishers?'''

''What a bizarre question. As if you expect it to be a half dozen books, rather than a number much too long to list. You'd be very sorry if all us bibliophiles answered you literally.''

(Doesn't this belong @ /.?) I didn't expect complete answers. I didn't even completely answer my own question! The ''intent'' was to think about how one's collection gathered, and I also wanted a general survey of some good (and bad) books.  Perhaps the question wasn't worded correctly.

''Some old and recent answers can be found at MyLowestBookshelf.''

Thank You!

''I have seen the ColdWar page and I believe both your views and the other views there have validity, and is useful on this C2 site as a "warring pattern" -- dl''

Could you explain a little bit more? What's a "warring pattern?"

''see TheArtOfWar'' - <ColdWar exists between family members too :)>

''Hello there! I wanted SomethingNew, but it turned out to be a vacuous page. I suggest you delete it.''

Hu?  Your comment is a little vacuous.  Just kidding.  ;)  Could you explain that comment again, since it confuses me?
