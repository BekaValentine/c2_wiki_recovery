	* I wrote the unit testing framework for JavaScript called JsUnit (http://www.jsunit.net)
	* I co-authored a chapter in PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture (Fowler) (http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html)
	* I have a sidebar in PlanningExtremeProgramming (Beck/Fowler) 
	* I wrote a simple video game called JShooter strictly using the principle of test-driven design (http://www.edwardh.com/jshooter/index.html)

Edward is awfully refined for an American. He and RobMee have a description of Evant's IterationTracking process in PlanningExtremeProgramming.
