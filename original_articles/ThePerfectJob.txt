Not sure what to call it, but we need a category that measures the company's value.  What the company makes (or what service it provides) vs the (+/-) benefit of that product service in the world.

There's a company that specializes in products that generally have no negative applications (they make, inter alia, pet-related products - dishes, feeding systems, etc.).  I have no data on what it's like to work there but, all other things being equal, I'd prefer to work for that kind of outfit over a company that publishes or enables porn.

Somewhat less extreme is the difference between, say, gaming companies and coffee distributors.  If you feel that coffee is evil (hey - just kidding guys), you might prefer the gaming company.  If you feel gaming is evil, coffee might be more your cup of tea.

So, what would you call that?  SocialValue?  EthicalFoundation?  IntrinsicSubjectiveness?

I don't understand what the the scale is measuring.  A and E seem to have similar "deal-breaker" meanings (although one is positive and one is negative).  It's not clear to me whether the scale is measuring "how much I like this feature" versus "how much does this feature matter relative to the others".  -- KrisJohnson

Yes, I think A and E are the "When can I start" and "Not on your life" options.  That much is apparent from the scale explanations.  But I think these must be absolute rankings, rather than relative rankings.  Otherwise, you'd need to 'grade them on the curve', and rank them from 1 to n.

I love the way the choices are mnemonic: (A)bsolutely, (B)onus, (C)ould, etc. Kudos to Ryan for the best vote on wiki yet. -- WardCunningham

''(D)on't and (E)wwwww.''

Refactored to AbcdeLikertScale. -- JasonGrossman

The only problem I have with votes on this is that if I someday want to change my responses, I probably won't remember what they all are, since my views will have changed without my realizing it.  So, what should I do - just vote again?

''Sure''
