A multiton is a class that limits instances to those in a single collection. Each multiton instance is associated uniquely with a key; no multiton instance can exist without a key. Furthermore, multiton instances can only be created within the method that retrieves instances. The MultitonPattern is similar to the SingletonPattern, replacing the nullary method that gets an instance with a unary one.

Multiton is a pattern derived from the more general Factory pattern.
