From StockChartChallenge:

This remarkable fast applet (http://anfyteam.com/anj/voxel/anvoxel.html) shows a synthetic landscape, that is dynamically rendered as a fly-by movie. 

The real challenge is now, to extend this voxel engine to a DataMusicVoxelApplet, being attractive for 
	* stock watchers
	* stock analysts
	* music lovers
	* componists
	* Java programmers
	* multimedia artists.

FabioCiucci is the author and owner of this applet, which is, as he writes in his readme, based on a C sourcecode of his friend Andrea "6502" Griffini.

C-source and a DLL, prepared for VB6 voxel experiments, can be found at http://www.ur.co.nz/flyby.htm. I don't know yet, whether this code is related with the code of the above mentioned Andrea "6502" Griffini.

Another java source for voxel software is http://www.lynx.ch/contacts/~/thomasm/voxel/default.html
