Architecture is generally held to be an art, albeit a very public and physical one, that, at its best contributes wonderful buildings to our environment.

However, unlike most of the arts, the Architect has to achieve his art not through his own hands but through the hands of others: the builder and his workmen.

This is a process unknown to the 'Fine Arts', e.g. painting.

To achieve the finished work in shape, material and colour the Architect has also to bring administrative, management and organisational skills not required by the traditional solo artist.

There is nearly always, therefore, some aspect of compromise, defeat, where details, features, sometimes whole aspects of a well-designed work may have to be forgone due to financial or time pressure.

''Unknown to the "Fine Arts"? What about orchestral conductors? Or, for that matter, composers?''

Yep, I was waiting for that one! I guess I was thinking mainly of painting, sculpture, instrumental musicians etc., particularly since it was a minor reflection on a pianist last night that brought this thought to mind.

There are many forms of art that demand collaboration and the compromise that goes along with that. Movies are a prime example, where a work will be in the hands of hundreds of collaborators. Writers have to deal with editors, ''etc''.

Even practitioners of the solitary arts have to compromise with their medium. Your concert pianist uses the piano as a sort of proxy, don't you think?

* No. Does the artist use his eyes as a proxy? Plato's cave.
