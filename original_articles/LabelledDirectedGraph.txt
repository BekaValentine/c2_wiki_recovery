A ''Labelled Directed Graph'' is, as the name suggests, a DirectedGraph whose arrows have labels on them.

''More precisely that is an edge-labelled directed graph. LabelledDirectedGraph more often refers to labelling of vertices.''

As such, an edge-labelled directed graph is an obvious way of representing a FiniteStateMachine, or a graph of references between objects.
