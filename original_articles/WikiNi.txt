'''Wiki Ni'''

Another fork from WakkaWiki a very small and easy to install Wiki:

	* French language support :))
	* Finest users settings.
	* Function Delete, usable by the owner of an orphaned page
	* "Word diff" : which shows word by word, additions and deletions (unique in the WikiEngine world? ''MoinMoin does that too''). 
	* Some improvements: BackLinks, list of users, index of pages...
