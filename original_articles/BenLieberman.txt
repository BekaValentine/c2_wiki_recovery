I am rather new to the world of OO-ness, having picked up much of the technology/philosophy of Objects via books and practical projects that I implemented in my lab (yup, I am a post-science-geek, now a design-geek).

I have found in the several years that I have been developing professionaly, that UseCases are, much like GO or Chess, simple in concept but very difficult in reality.  I hope to investigate some useful strategies and share-and-share-alike with my fellow designers.  I am a firm believer that cooperation is far more efficient than competition, even where money is concerned (hope my boss isn't reading this!).
