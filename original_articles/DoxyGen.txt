"Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, IDL (Corba and Microsoft flavors) and to some extent PHP and C#. Doxygen can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual ... The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code."

For ObjectiveCee, we have AutoDoc and HeaderDoc. The latter ships with ExCode on Panther (MacOsx 10.3). AutoDoc has been around since NextStep/OpenStep.
