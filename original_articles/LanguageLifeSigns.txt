This is just to prime the pump...

Some signs that a language is alive (or dead):

	* Many people are still productively using it to get stuff done
	* Many problems are solvable with the language (but still may be a niche, I suppose)
	* '''M''''''indShare''' - it may not be the best or brightest, but a lot of people know it and use it
	* '''C''''''orporateInvestment''' - vendors are actively supporting it to increase or maintain usage (such as updating features, giving it away, etc.)
	* New programs/systems are written in it.

Now, it may be that JavaIsDead was more of a '''F''''''orwardLookingAssertion''', in which case it would be interesting to look into the factors that change a language's status, such as:

	* Changing set of problems to be solved, lack of interest
	* Loss of '''M''''''indShare''' for whatever reason (reliability, lack of investment, loss of interest)
	* Fierce competition from another language drawing from the same '''M''''''indShare''' pool

Nowadays, the language that spawns the most libraries, wins.
