A graphic editor without ''group select'' is like a
text editor without ''word wrap''.  Here are things
you must consider to do it right...

	* Select
		* Drag from empty space
		* Select items totally enclosed
		* Modifiy by
			* Picks
			* More drags
	* Indicators
		* Color
		* Handles (better)
	* Operations
		* Apply to all selected items
			* Unless bound by constraint
			* Unless inappropriate type
			* Unless multiply grouped (rare)
		* Resize in proportion
			* Calculate in float
			* Round on release
		* Animate
			* Element and selection boxes
			* Floating figures (better)
			* In place figures (best)

Such an Editor Exists - It is called AutoCad - What makes it possible is AutoLisp.
