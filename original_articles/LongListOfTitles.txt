While filling out an application form for a fund-raising relay race we encountered this long list of titles in the drop down box where you would normally type Mr or Ms.

My wife got a laugh out of the first choice, Admiral. Imagine an admiral signing up to race against my son and still insisting to be called Admiral.

I got a laugh out of the compound titles, like Mr & Mrs, for an individual entry form. Look through the list and notice combinations that they omit. For example, they include Prof & Mr, Rev & Mr, but not Senator & Mr. This could be a problem should the Clintons want to apply.

''Missing are "Father and Mrs.", "Sister and Mr.", "Father and Sister", "Father and Rabbi"... ;-)''
