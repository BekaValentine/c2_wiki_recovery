Describe MichaelWilson here.

Hmm.  I could've SWORN I had a MichaelWilson page out here.  

I've been writing code for 30 years and change (not too shabby at 38 if I do say so myself.)  Currently I'm working in finance, with an algorithmic trading team. 

I'll add more in a bit.  But I'm a bit busy at the moment.

 ... 5 minutes later...

I'm pretty sure I just got out of a meeting with MikeHill, though it could be a different Mike Hill. I doubt it.

Currently I'm in the process of moving into a role as an internal AgileProcesses ExtremeProgramming coach.  Never having done any coaching this will no doubt be a bumpy ride.  Any advice you can offer would definitely be appreciated.
