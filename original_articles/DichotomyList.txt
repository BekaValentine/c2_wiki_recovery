First seen in the work of MichaelHill. Divide a piece of paper vertically with a line. Put a heading on each side (picking the headings is part of the art). Now write pairs of words, one on each side of the line. When you have run out of words, read the columns vertically.

Here is a dichotomy list that resulted from the PairOrigami exercise (first you try to follow the incomprehensible iconic instructions alone for 20 minutes, then you pair up with someone and take turns making folds.) The question was, "How did you feel working alone compared with working with a partner?"

 Alone           Pair
 ----------------------------
 Quiet           Conversation
 Uncomfortable   Fun
 Labor           Edification
 Problem         Solution
 Frustrating     Funny
 Stuck           Helping
 Conservative    Liberal
 Unsure          Sure
 Concentrated    Inspired
 Control         Lost
 Incomplete      Complete
 Not done        Done
 Unsure          Confident
 Head            Hands
 Stingy          Sharing
 Boring          Joking
 
Now read down the columns and compare the complete left side with the complete right side.
