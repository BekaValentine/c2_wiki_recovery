HypEdit is just a basic Windows text editor... with an attitude. The "Jump" button on the menubar implements hyperlinks in the text.

To make a hyperlink, put a phrase in brackets, like [Features and Functions].

To use a hyperlink, move your mouse cursor to put it over the text inside the brackets, press CTRL and right-click the mouse to drop the cursor into the link and jump to the linked page.

Interesting, as an editor.
