There are also "seven habits of ExtremeProgramming:"  
	* Pro-active
		* ExtremeProactivity
	* Leadership: notion of goals and vision 
		* ExtremeValues
	* Management: applying goals in everyday job
	* Win/Win: more than consensus!
	* Understand/Be understood: 
		* Communication value
	* Synergize
	* Renewal 
		* TheyreJustRules

Isn't this far too vague? Probably a proponent of BigDesignUpFront would also claim to be pro-active, to exhibit leadership, etc. Moreover, what has "leadership" to do with extreme ''programming''? Extreme ''management'', I can buy that, but programming?

Leadership in the sense of StephenCovey has to do with goal and vision.  ExtremeProgramming has a vision of producing high quality software that fits the end user needs within a minimum amount of time (one of the goals). -- PositiveOne
