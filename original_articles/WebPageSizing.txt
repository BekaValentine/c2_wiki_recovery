When designing web pages or web documents, I find it increasingly difficult to find a unit of measure that works consistently and survives technology changes.

For example, I used to size pages or columns using either pixels or points. Pixels doesn't work well on newer monitors and graphics cards that use increasingly higher numbers. "Points" seems to work horizontally fairly well, but is inconsistent vertically. "Percent" is also problematic in that some people keep their browser small or open URL's directly from their Email viewers. It also doesn't mean much horizontally.

My current "default" approach is use Points horizontally, and try to let the vertical proportions flow automatically. However, some managers still want finer control over vertical sizing (JustMakeItRight) in their requests.

Image sizing is a similar bugaboo. Part of the problem is that current browsers don't interpolate well, but leaving image in native pixel sizing makes them kind of small on newer PC's.
