A very cool movie, IMHO.

Very different than the previous set of movies, both in idea and execution.  Features excellent hair rendering, almost photorealistic.  The lighting has greatly improved.  And the story is absolutely absolutely cute and didn't leave me bored at any part.  (That's an accomplishment, BTW)

There's a short at the beginning that's great, too.

Any other commentary?

They were certainly showing off their hair algorithms (and feathers, in the short).  The humans still look like animated Barbie dolls, though...
