Agile isn't ''a'' methodology. Rather, it aims at expressing the existence of a family of methodologies which, according to the methodologists involved, have a commonality of underlying themes and concerns.

ExtremeProgramming is probably the best-known example of an Agile methodology.

The site only has three pages. It is lovely to look at and easy to read. There is an impressive list of names involved. Here is the first paragraph from their history page


	 :	On February 11-13, 2001, at The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort in the Wasatch mountains of Utah, seventeen people met to talk, ski, relax, and try to find common ground-and of course, to eat. What emerged was the Agile Software Development Alliance. Representatives from Extreme Programming, SCRUM, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, Pragmatic Programming, and others sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes convened.

''So... How does one go about signing up to join? ;)''

Indeed, I would be interested in ''signing up'' and use the manifesto in my future dealings with clients saying ''These are my beliefs and how I like to work, if you disagree then goodbye (you are the weakest link)''. -- ChanningWalton

I think could be useful a list of sites supporting the AgileAlliance, something like AgileUserGroups.
You can also look at the User Groups directory on http://www.agilealliance.com/userGroups/index.
