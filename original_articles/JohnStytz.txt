I became interested in patterns primarily because of my many late night conversations with WilliamGrosso.

My interests lie in Smalltalk, Objective-C, Python, OOD, distributed agents and all kinds of patterns.

Currently, I make my living as a network engineer, but spend my nights writing code.
