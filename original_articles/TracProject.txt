TracProject (http://trac.edgewall.org/) is an enhanced wiki and DefectTracking system for SoftwareDevelopment projects.

Quote from their web site:

''Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development projects. Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project management. Our mission is to help developers write great software while staying out of the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a team's established development process and policies.''

It contains a wiki (TracWiki) and provides an interface to SubVersion.

The references to this are scattered because this is comes under software versioning and also under wiki implementation. This page is a refactoring to provide a central point of reference. -- JohnFletcher
