
The users of the ForthLanguage may be said to share certain cultural attributes. 
The forth culture appears to include a high level of enthusiasm and evangelising about the 
forth language as well as a constant reference to what forth ''could'' do. 

Unfortunately, since the inventors of the ForthLanguage made their living by selling
implementations and applications in Forth, it appears the culture of forth has always 
been highly commercial. For example, in Elizabeth Rathers books about the Forth language,
such as ''The Forth Programmers Handbook'' she refers to her companies (Forth Inc) products
on numerous occasions. She also users the phrase, "refer to your products documentation" many
times throughout her books about forth.
