I met my family in San Francisco for a long weekend. Mostly we rode busses and got to know the neighborhoods. We
spend a day at the Exploratorium and a couple of evenings at Sony's
Metreon. This was my first visit to Metreon, an indoor theme park
with three major exhibits based on Mcaulay's ''The Way Things Work'',
Sendack's ''Where the Wild Things Are'', and Moebius's comics. I was
especially impressed with how these concepts were translated
to attractions. This is all very much about style, the exact opposite of
the Exploratorium, which I thought was in decline. -- WardCunningham

I was disappointed by the Metreon (very much about style over substance). ''The Way Things Work'' features an amusing but very short 3d movie, and a small exhibit of things copied or licensed from the Exploratorium. -- MarcoScheurer
