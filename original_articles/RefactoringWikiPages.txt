'''Delimit conversation '''
	* ''Use signature lines'' to separate thoughts expressed in ThreadMode. Make the signatures part of the paragraph. This works best when thoughts are expressed as a single paragraph. This transformation becomes easier as a page matures and the important ideas become obvious. Use an empty signature      (" -- ") when the author is unknown or wishes to remain anonymous.
	* ''Use horizontal rules'' to separate a multi-paragraph contribution from other contributions. ''Alternative view: use a horizontal rule to indicate a change of topic, not of speaker. This keeps threads together, making it easier to RefactorByExtractingToPage.''
	* ''Use inline comments'' [inside square brackets like this,] for very short editorial comments. Consider rewriting the paragraph to make the addition unnecessary.
	* ''Use Unsigned comments'' that become part of the flow of the page. Other than being offset from signed contributions, unsigned work should blend seamlessly with the page as a whole.

'''Delimit subject'''	
	* ''Use emphasized subtitles'', when the topic of conversation changes ,so that readers can pick out the parts that they are interested in. 
	* ''Move comments to a different page'', if the subject is inconsistent with the title of the page. Try to find an existing page that's appropriate instead of creating new ones. Include a link to it if appropriate. 

	'''Write to the future reader''':	This site has 100 readers for every writer. Compose and organize thoughts for the reader's benefit.

	'''Gentle backlink''':	When one page spawns another it is good practice to write a sentence or two of explanation at the beginning of the new page that cites the old. Use italics when the introduction is tangential to the page as a whole.

	'''Remove inappropriate material''':	 When you see something that clearly does not belong on Wiki just delete it. This is about as strong a statement as you can make on Wiki.

	'''Index using categories''':	 Don't create static index pages that must be updated each time a new page is created that belongs to that index. Instead, use a category so that indexes can be dynamically created and always kept current. If an appropriate category does not exist for the refactored page, create a new one only if there will be other pages referencing the new category. See WikiCategories for more details.

	'''Outline Summary''':	Consider using a bulleted list as a summary of major sections that follow on the page, to act as a mini table of contents - most useful for very long pages. Consider using an outline summary as a proforma template for a TentativeSummary for a ThreadMess.
