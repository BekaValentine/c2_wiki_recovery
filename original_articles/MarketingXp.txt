From CrossingTheXpChasm:

''One possible explanation for our collective frustration is that XP is making the transition from enthusiasts to early adopters. We have been crowing over how cool it is that such a simple set of practices could work, and everybody who could captivated by such a
message has been.''

So, what can we, the XP enthusiasts, do to press ahead with the transition from enthusiasts to early adopters?

Well, how about if we
	1. Actually do XP;
	1. Be successful;
	1. Publish our success?

''This could be a start at a road map for the next steps to take.  Please help by improving it or offering ideas.''

The first one of those is problematic.  There is always ExtremeProgrammingInEnemyTerritory, but it seems to me that the point of this
page is finding ways to get the stakeholders to agree to XP, so that we don't
have to be surreptitious about things.  Every time a group does the three things
mentioned above, it makes it easier for the next group to start with step 1.
For now, though, that first step is difficult.  How do we sell XP as a way to
run projects?

I've been trying to gather and organize information for a "sales pitch" (if
you want to call it that) to use with our clients (my company is a consulting
firm specializing in Java).  I've collected a lot of information about the
advantages of XP, and a fair amount of information about why the approaches
being promoted by the software engineering establishment are misguided.  I'll
try, over the next week or so, to synopsize what I've got so far and put it on
this page.

But all of my arguments now are reasoning from first principles (except for the
success stories of existing XP projects).  Does anyone know of sources for
statistics about software projects in general?  I'd love to see statistics on 
the success rate and cost of projects run with, say, RUP, and how that compares
with similar statistics about software projects in general.  I have guesses 
about the findings, but it would be nice to see the numbers.  (I know, they're
hard to measure, and RUP is new, etc.) -- GlennVanderburg
