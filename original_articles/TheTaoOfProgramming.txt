A humorous... though mysteriously insightful book filled with analogies into the art of programming.

An abridged online version is available http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/tao-of-programming.html

Are there any ''annotated'' versions of the text around?

A master was explaining the nature of Tao of to one of his novices,
``The Tao is embodied in all software -- regardless of how
insignificant,'' said the master.
 
``Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?'' asked the novice.
 
``It is,'' came the reply.
 
``Is the Tao in a video game?'' continued the novice.
 
``It is even in a video game,'' said the master.
 
``And is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer?''
 
The master coughed and shifted his position slightly. ``The lesson
is over for today,'' he said.

I much prefer the original version.  The abridged and revised versions seem to loose
the yoga or artistic impact of the Tao.  I'd like to copy the content here to preserve it.
I do feel that any developer who is serious about development should become an artist.

The Tao of Programming can help reach enlightenment and allow the developer become an artist.

My review of this book: You aren't gonna need it. I read this Once and Only Once, then recycled it mercilessly.
