Hi!  I've been building software in Smalltalk since 1988.  I chose Smalltalk for use in developing a soup to nuts shop floor control system.  We built this system which was continually developed even as people were using it (changing the engine while driving the car).

I've also been involved in other interesting Smalltalk projects like:
- A CNC machining simulator
- A popular version of BASIC (see LibertyBasicIsWrittenInSmalltalk)
- A prototype system for scheduling and verifying fissionable materials in the Former Soviet Union
- Software for Frontline Labor Management (see http://www.kronos.com)
- The open source Smalltalk called Squeak
