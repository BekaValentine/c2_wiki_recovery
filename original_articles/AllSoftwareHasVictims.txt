All Software Has Victims? I thought only military software had victims? No, every use of software advantages someone and disadvantages someone or something else. Prove otherwise, if you think you can:

''This is true for the use of anything. So why pick on software?''

Minesweeper. I would love to hear a disadvantage or an advantage to that, that doesn't apply to everyone.
Easy:
     Advantage for the actual user -> Fun, if that's what you want to call it.
     Disadvantage for whoever pays the user -> wasted work-time.

''Really... I didn't realize I was being paid at home... I guess I should send them a bill, eh?''
