JeffNelson is into computers and education.  Since 2000, he has been using, improving and promoting wiki as a tool for learning, teaching and collaboration.  --JohnDeBruyn (June 16, 2002)  

See WikiEducationalUses for more about wiki as a tool for learning, teaching and collaboration online.  

I'm pretty proud of this semester's project--a departmental site using
Pwiki.  http://www.ugruenglish.uaeu.ac.ae

My colleagues who have participated in the site project are sold on Wikis
now.   The ease of collaboration is a huge benefit.  

In the future, I want to add educational plugins to the wiki--maybe things
like classroom scheduling, interfaces to a student records database,
student progress recording... etc.

Anyone who's interested in developing a free computing curriculum online, please check out my wiki at http://itp.innoved.org/wiki/freecourse.  I've recently added student objectives for each major section of the course, and would appreciate any feedback.  
Best regards, Jeff Nelson
