''The Demon-Haunted World: Science As a Candle in the Dark''

''I feel that the book has reasoning flaws in it as bad as those of some of the "believers" he was trying to debunk. For example, he dismissed alien autopsy claims in part because the reported tools were "too bulky" for a society capable of interstellar flight. That is almost like someone from 1800 seeing bits of our future, and saying that "any civilization capable going to the moon would have solved cancer by then." Maybe those bulky instruments had 1000 different functions. I am not saying there is good evidence for alien abductions, but don't dismiss them using speculative logic, or else you ruin the credibility of skeptics in general.'' -- top
