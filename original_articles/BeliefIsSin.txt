All belief is sin. Including this one. Every time you fail to admit that you don't know, you commit a sin. 

We see this in computer programming all the time, though we generally think of our beliefs there as bugs. "The program will do X" and instead it does Y means there's a bug.

We begin life in a state of perfect ambiguity. We make theories about what's going on and test them by empiricism and agreement. But sometimes we're taught the theory, "some theories don't need to be tested". The original sin is accepting this theory without testing it.

That an empirical test of a theory implies that that theory will be true in the future is itself nothing but a belief.
