A project to add a Sound Blaster emulation to NT DOS boxes. This allows old DOS programs to play sound just like they used to. It routes the sound to any Windows-compatible sound card, or can save it to disk.

The author hopes he can also add an emulated VesaBios to NT DOS boxes.

The project page used to be at http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~vromas/vdmsound/. Now see http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdmsound/.

Most people now use DosBox for this sort of thing.
