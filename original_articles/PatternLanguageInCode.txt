Ever write a script to graph the length of class names in your CodeBase?  With the widespread adoption of patterns, I have seen the numbers skyrocket.  In my own code, the range is [3, 16], mode 8.
Since patterns, collegues' code base: range [3, 71], mode 14. Rubbish!

''Are long names tiring your fingers?  Two solutions:''

* ''Eat more carbohydrates.''
* ''Get an IDE with auto-complete''

''Long names are a good thing, enabled by bigger screens, better editors and higher calorie intake.''

[It takes me 10 extra seconds to write a long name (including wondering if the length is pointing to a problem with the code), it can take me hours to figure out what the dev of 3 years ago meant by CMNGVerMn]
