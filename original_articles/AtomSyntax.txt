AtomSyntax is a blog syndication and API standard and competes with RssFeeds. The standard took form on the Pie wiki, http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage.

''TimBray wrote to IETF, in 2004, that the work is finishing and should consider winding down.'' See http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/11/AtomInnovation

''Most current draft is at http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-format-11.txt''
* IETF has now (Aug05) approved the "proposed standard" (as much as that org will go about support for std), but eWeek reported there were disagreemnts to the last whether portions of the proposal should be "core" vs "extensions". See http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1849427,00.asp

The http://www.intertwingly.net web site is run by Sam Ruby. 

To be exact, the standard hasn't yet taken form, and not all the work is being done on the wiki itself. It would appear that they often use mailing lists ( http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/index.html) to have chatty discussions, and then focus the wiki work on writing authoritative documents. An interesting model to consider.

Supposedly the team has picked up experience from work on RssFeeds.

''Some thinks the AtomSyntax is reducing the momentum of RssFeeds.'' See http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/print.php/3334651.
