According to the author, this is specifically about mathematical discourse and not about math, yet the customer reviews on Amazon make it sound like it is an introduction to several fields of math.

Also according to the author, this is a rework (not just an update) to "Mathematics: The Science Of Patterns" (ISBN 0805073442)
