'''Pattern Name:''' CriticalResourceFlow

'''Aliases:''' Get Enough To Eat, Don't Try To Do Too Much

'''Context:''' System functions are working well enough for now. But
new objectives are being considered that will require the use of
dedicated resources that are most likely being used elsewhere.

'''Problem:''' No resources are available to divert to the new
objectives.

'''Forces:''' The current system is probably not using all of
its resources at highest efficiency. The minimum amount of resources
to support existing functions is unknown.

'''Solution:''' Determine the minimum amount of resources required to
sustain the current system as it stands. Locate inefficiencies and wasted
effort so that resources can be diverted to the new objectives. Locate
poor communication, transport, and control channels and upgrade them.
Ensure that current resource flow is operating at maximum efficiency.

'''Resulting Context:''' The new objectives do not create undue stress
and hardship for the system in its current configuration. The slight
(we hope) shuffling that occurred has actually invigorated that system
as a whole, potentially galvanizing it to be ready for the new objectives.

'''Design Rationale:''' Having new objectives is a good idea every now
and then, just for the sake of shaking up the sleepy parts of the system.
It is good practice to find the limits of the system's capabilities so
that unrealistic objectives are avoided. If this is a regular practice,
then when hard times require a new strategy, the system is accustomed
to inspecting itself and adapting.

'''Examples:''' The Corporate Audit Department, Going to the Doctor For
A Checkup before Traveling Internationally, Using a Personal Trainer to get
ready for a Race.
