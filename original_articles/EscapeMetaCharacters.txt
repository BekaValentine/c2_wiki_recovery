Commenting out this subroutine in Ward's original Wiki Script, allows HTML:

 sub EscapeMetaCharacters {
  #s/&/&amp;/g; #s/</&lt;/g;
  #s/>/&gt;/g;
 }

For using JavaScript the print output formatting must be skipped (depending on some condition in the Wikipage text).

Then users would have to be aware of the special semantics that HTML attaches to those symbols. It would arguably make Wiki harder to use, at least for naive users who don't know HTML. ''A JavaScriptEnabledWiki needs this -- fp''

It would also allow people to do weird stuff, like embed Java applets, tables, flashing text, mess with fonts and colours. This is not necessarily what we (or at least Ward) want. A matter of audience targetting. -- DaveHarris

for. -- fp''
