I've survived the comings and goings of many people, and still find this place to be a valuable venue for PeopleProjectsAndPatterns. Since 2002 and earlier, I have participated here and have changed my strategies of participation, several times. While some operate on the Fight, and if I lose, or are banned, leave. Others have after struggling to fit in, found they did not, took off for venues and technologies more to their linking involving people who are more agreeable, in terms of their interests and desires. The ones that survive here, are adaptive in their resolution to make the best of a good thing. 

A positive attitude and an practical approach are requisites to meaningful survival and continued participation and involvement. I call this the '''Stand Still''' approach. 

The Stand Still approach is one which derives the ability to do so by knowing and doing a number of things. What are they?
* Having a good mixture of knowledge, competency and willingness to learn from and through others
* Willing to work in collaboration with others to make this place, and the pages in it, better, more substantive and accurate, and where opinions differ, allowing each to stand upon their own 
* Realize that opinions, notions and ideas expressed here belong to their makers, and do not constitute what "we" as a collective have come to 
* In PositiveDialogue, express, revise and elaborate and sometimes change or reverse our positions in a good spirit of fairness, courtesy and respect
* To take a reflective approach, avoiding heated and polarizing conversations in favor or consideration, thoughtfulness and allowance for correctness or error in any position or approach, whether by self or by others
* Willingness to do research and delve into points not considered or known before. This is a wait-and-see approach, where the "see" part involves investigation, not just observation
* Realization that the collection of pages is a mixture of things considered to b gems and stuff one can ignore or remove from consideration 
* Due to the fact of a strategy of long time commitment, this place has been a cross-roads of people now considered to be SubjectMatterExpert''''''s, and have left in this place a piece of themselves
