jEdit is a programmer's text editor developed by Slava Pestov and others. It is released under the GnuGeneralPublicLicense. It is a very good OpenSource editor (not just for JavaLanguage), that becomes an IDE in conjunction with the available plugins. jEdit requires Java 1.3 or greater.

jEdit has an easy to use interface that resembles that of many other Windows and MacOS text editors.

jEdit is extremely customizable, and has an extensive feature set, that includes, among other things:

* Syntax highlighting for more than 50 file types
* Auto indent with support for intelligent indent in Java, C and Python source
* Search and replace with support for regular expressions, searching in multiple files, and reverse search
* Bracket matching
* Abbreviations
* Multiple clipboards
* Rectangular selection
* Split-window operation
* Word wrap
* Macro recording
* BeanShell scripting
* Folding
* Multiple selection (only in jEdit 3.2 or greater)

However, the feature list doesn't stop there; jEdit also supports plugins which extend the editor's functionality. Plugins currently exist for 
* editing files on FTP servers (and SFTP servers)
* editing files inside zip and tar archives
* browsing Java source
* code completion
* compilation
* one-click compiler error go to
* viewing RSS feeds
* XML completion and validation (XmlSucks less with jEdit :-)
* transforming XML with XSLT
* checking spelling
* bookmarking locations in files
* embedded PythonLanguage interpreter
* getting word definitions from online dictionaries
* VersionControl integration for various systems
* installing macros from an online user-contributed repository
and much more.

Plugins can be managed from within the editor.
