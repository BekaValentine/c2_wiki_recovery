I like FreeSoftware and its superset, OpenSource.

I want to know how ExtremeProgramming and the Open Source software development model (AKA the Bazaar model) fit. Are they so different there will never be common ground? If both of them are the way of the future (as I suspect), then at some point someone will come up with a way for the two to coexist, and even complement each other. 

Actually, GerritRiessen makes some interesting comments on this topic on the OpenSource page and on CorporateOpenSource. Our in depth discussion on this topic can be found at CombiningOpenSourceAndXp.

I rambled on FundingOpenSource about a way to fund OpenSource projects.

In case you were wondering:  ''No, I don't shop at the CrackPotteryBarn, and stop asking me that!''

A CrackPotteryBarn is where Crack Pots shop, ie their equivalent of the popular PotteryBarn. To date, the CrackPotteryBarn does not offer catalogs, but I will keep you posted.
