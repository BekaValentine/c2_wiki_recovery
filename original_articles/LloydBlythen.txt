Unfortunately the above article is a good example of how to implement Singleton _incorrectly_ - especially its Listing 1.

A "LloydBlythen" is someone who makes critical comments without bothering to explain what he thinks he is talking about. This type of person is characterized by strongly-held opinions that are usually wrong.

Whatever. The reason http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/08/27/singleton.html is incorrect is that it's not thread-safe. This is so widely documented that detailing why the article is wrong would add nothing useful to the discussion of Java singletons and plenty of pointless noise.
