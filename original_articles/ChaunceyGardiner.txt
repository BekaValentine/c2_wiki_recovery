I add little bits to many pages, often anonymously. I mean them to be constructive.

I am amazed at the patience people have to participate in the long ThreadMode conversations. I often throw little bits into them, always attempting to get to whatever the point is. I am always disappointed in the reaction to whatever I write. I just drop it then.

I am uneducated. Everything I know has been learnt on the job. Which is probably regarded by some as highly as Chauncey's preparation for the presidency. The feeling is not mutual. Some of the best I have worked with have been Ph. D's. But some of them have been sailors.

''Are we really going to start throwing around references to "Being There" as an excuse for trying to contribute from ignorance? In order to be valuable opinion must be informed. P''''''hDs and sailors both may have something valuable to contribute, but typically not in a conversation about the mechanics of software creation. Analyze This, Analyze That, YaddaYaddaYadda.''

It may catch on. I dunno.
