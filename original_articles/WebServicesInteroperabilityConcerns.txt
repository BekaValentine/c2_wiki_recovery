WebServicesInteroperabilityConcerns deal with a range of issues that need to be resolved for the realization of promises of WebServices.

As at early 2005, the foremost consideration is security related, including IdentityM''''''anagement schemes and privacy issues.

There are three forces at work. 
* MicrosoftCorporation has its DotNetPassport who is being displaced by federated solutions like ActiveDirectoryFederationServices (ADFS).
* WebServicesFederation standardization work done through WebServicesInteroperabilityOrganization (dominated by MicrosoftCorporation and IbmCorporation).
* SunMicrosystems led LibertyAlliance, which IbmCorporation signed on in late 2004 as well, and which was rejected by MicrosoftCorporation.

However it is said to have numerous bugs, ambiguities, and incompletely implemented features that have not helped with heterogeneous environment service integration.
