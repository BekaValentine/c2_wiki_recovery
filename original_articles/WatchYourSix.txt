''Watch Your Six'' is the term used by military aviators of which CoverYourAss (CYA) is the civilian analog. I put it in as a euphemism for such things as CYA, which is the motivation for things like PearlHarborFile(s). The issue is that when you are directed to do stupid things, you need to be sure that the system isn't setting you up as the fall guy. GetItInWriting is probably one of the related ideas. BlowingTheWhistle is a nice strategy, but tends to shorten your employment and make you unemployable to boot. So the next best thing is to make it obviously dangerous to make you the fall-guy so that such predators will search elsewhere for targets. If this sounds cynical, I've got a lot of experience watching the unscrupulous prey on the unwary. CaveatEmptor is good advice in all domains. -- RaySchneider
