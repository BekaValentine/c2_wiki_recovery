Chris is the Chief Technology Officer of WebCriteria, Inc.

The WebCriteria product development team is trying to go extreme, so
Chris is exploring XP. So far, he's been happy with the process; the
wiki pages are great! Also, he thanks everyone for their generous
doses of time to explain (and re-explain) the XP way.
