To give is to receive..

This is something I realized around the time I started getting tired of toys. At Christmas Eve, the biggest present was not the box of CDs or whatever that I received. It was to see the joy and appreciation in the faces of those I care about.

Material gifts, of course, are rarely a cause of much happiness. The term "giving is receiving" is most of all about helping out. To give of yourself. Best of all, perhaps, to help out with emotional problems. Few things are as gratifying as someone showing her gratitude of having you as a friend.

Isn't that rather selfish, giving just so that you can extract some petty pleasurable emotion from the experience? IronyWarning - I'm not actually being sarcastic, though. ''See DefinitionOfSelfishness.''

Aren't most people able to discern when someone is helping them out of genuine care as opposed to selfish reasons?
