Before sprint one, find out if you are in an agile project at all.
Here is a few indicators that you are not:

* '''Someone has a CASE tool installed on thier workstation'''. If someone is modelling the system using UML diagrams there is a good chance you are in a waterfall project, not an agile project. Agile projects do not have an analysis phase but relies on the principle of WalkingSkeleton and does not attempt to build reusable frameworks according to the YAGNI (YouAintGonnaNeedIt) principle. If you are going to do analysis, do that! Don't attempt to do structured modelling and agile style development at the same time.
* '''Internal deadlines'''. Using internal deadlines without actually delivering a fully integrated release to the customer is a sure sign that you are in a waterfall project. Internal deadlines are rarely taken seriously. If the customer has a V-model view of the project, use the V-model to get customer approvals. Use frequent internal releases to FailGracefully.
