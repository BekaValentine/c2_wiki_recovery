6DoKB is a spoof of the phrase ''SixDegreesOfSeparation'' which was popularized by the play of the same name written by John Guare. The play explains that everyone is six handshakes away from anyone in the world. The play in turn is influenced by the SmallWorld theory.

''Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'' posits that every movie actor can be connected to Kevin Bacon in 6 movies or less. The Game is played where one player thinks of an actor or actress. The other player makes the connections back to Kevin Bacon. Simple, yes, but oddly compelling.
An example:

''''Q:'''' tom cruise

''''A:'''' 

	kevin bacon
	


If you're not good at coming up with the answers, you can play this game at http://www.cs.virginia.edu/oracle/
which reports

''The Oracle says: Humphrey Bogart  has a Bacon number of 2.''

	1.	''Humphrey Bogart was in Wagons Roll at Night, The (1941) with Eddie Albert''
	1.	''Eddie Albert was in Big Picture, The (1989) with Kevin Bacon''

See?! The Oracle wins! He gets a point for a more elegant solution. Unfortunately, the Oracle is probably some sort of high-powered computer database. It's better when you're playing with drunken idiots. Had the Oracle actually been a drunken idiot, he would be considered a very good player.

This is my 6DoKB:

	1. SeanOleary was in "Remote Control" (an MTV TV show) with (former SNL comedian) Colin Quinn.
	1. Colin Quinn was in "Married to the Mob" with Oliver Platt

According to TheTippingPoint, KevinBacon is not the best-connected actor in movies. That title goes to RodSteiger.
