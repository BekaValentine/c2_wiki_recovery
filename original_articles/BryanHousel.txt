I am a freelance consultant in the New York City area, specializing in Law Manager - a software platform for building large-scale legal information management systems. The software is used by many of the biggest government, corporate, and legal organizations in the world. Over the past 10 years, I have worked with many of these clients to design, develop, and maintain their Law Manager systems.

Currently, I am working with Citigroup on various projects involving their two Law Manager systems. I am also actively involved in the Law Manager User's Group, and maintain the group's online presence at http://www.lawmanager.info. I can be contacted at mailto:bryan@7thposition.com.
