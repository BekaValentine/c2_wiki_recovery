I'm back to working in Glasgow again...as a Senior Java Developer for a large Government organization.

Bizarrely, my first task in the new job involves writing a lot of PythonLanguage as part of a rules engine.

After more than 3 years away from Python, I'm amazed how easy it is to go back to writing PythonLanguage, it's like I've never been away (well...except for all the new things), in fairness I've tracked ZopeApplicationServer during that time, and written a fair amount of Python :)
