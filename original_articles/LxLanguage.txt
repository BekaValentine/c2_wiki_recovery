The LX programming language is a general-purpose, compiled programming language, described in more details at http://mozart-dev.sf.net/lx.html. Its feature set is expected to be a superset of that of CeePlusPlus. It is designed with advanced programming techniques in mind, such as TemplateMetaprogramming, StlStyle and OnReflection.

There is an early LX compiler being developed under the GPL. It's by no mean finished, although it does compile HelloWorld.
