http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1565923928.01._PE_PIdp,7,-26_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg O'Reilly's ''JavaScript: The Definitive Guide,'' ISBN 1565923928.  Very comprehensive book on the JavaScript programming language.

Yet another book from O'Reilly with a random animal on the cover; this one a Rhino. 

Note--the RhinoInterpreter for JavaScript that comes with MozillaBrowser is (reportedly) named after the cover of this book; ''not'' the other way around.  

''Version 4 is a nearly-complete rewrite from version 3 I hear.''
