In ''WaltzingWithBears'', TomDeMarco and TimothyLister identify the five most common software project risks in their experience. 

They are:

	'''inherent schedule flaw''':	that some flaw in the schedule setting practice will result in an agreement to work to an unreachable goal

	'''FeatureCreep''':	that changes and additions to the requirements will push the project over budget and schedule

	'''employee turnover''':	that key staff leaving the company during the project will push up the budget and project duration

	'''ambiguous specification''':	that a breakdown in communication at the specification stage leads to an ambiguous and unsuitable contract

	'''poor productivity''':	that a failure to accurately estimate a team's performance will lead to project overrun
