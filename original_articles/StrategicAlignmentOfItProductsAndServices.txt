StrategicAlignmentOfItProductsAndServices is a StrategicManagement concern for the ItManager, necessary to keep the entire department focused on BusinessValue. 

Whilst BalancingRiskAndBusinessValue occur at all levels, including SoftwareDeveloper''''''s, success in dealing with strategic alignment issues earn credibility for an inhouse IT function.

The three most important contributors to achieving good alignment was identified in a 2004 Deloitte survey (source at http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/itlead/2004/0329itlead2.html). These include:
* Develop agreement for the Role of IT  (e.g. business leader, business partner, service provider, IT entrepreneur)
* Provide mechanism for setting investment priorities though IT Asset categorization.
* Develop and deliver based on agreed IT plan.

'''Internal: BusinessProcessManagement considerations'''

One mechanism to achieve better alignment is to map existing IT processes against an appropriate reference model (e.g.CapabilityMaturityModel). The advantage of using this pattern is the relative ease at which a roadmap for improvement can be deviced. This is invaluable for project definition and funding purposes. There are downsides to using this approach, lack of implementation experience of management and project staff could impact investment returns and credibility.
