A lurker of this site for some time...I find it inspirational and a good 
place to look for information involving design topics.

Also, the fascination of this site revolves around how well people play
together here.  I know there are occasional editing fights and such, but for 
the most part the people on this WikiServer are very respectful.  Quite a bit
different from the Internet as a whole.

I have started writing yet another wiki clone.  I have written the grammar using javacc and I want to mimic the wiki syntax of this site.  However things like mismatching quote like

'''heh''''

is a lot tougher than I originally thought.  Without some of these problems the grammar matches things okay.
