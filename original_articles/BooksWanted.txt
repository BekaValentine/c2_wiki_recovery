I recently wanted a book that I thought someone here on the Wiki might have and be willing to part with. There was nowhere then to put the request, so I thought I'd create one. While there are plenty of web-sites to hunt for second-hand or out-of-print books, or even new books, (WhereToBuyBooks) this is an attempt to hook up people who have books they no longer need or want with people who are willing, even eager, to take them off their hands.

You might also try putting up your request on BookShelved.
