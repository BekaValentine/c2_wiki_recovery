Our technological society is missing it's InformationStructure''''''s. By this I mean that we do not have data structures appropriate to the storage of RealInformation. The upshot of this is that real information is not TechnoScalable. By technoscalable I mean that we have an area which does not improve with technological improvements. Real information system improvement gets left behind as technology advances.

Here are some of the results of MissingInformationStructure''''''s:
* games - no real information structures means no technological improvements in ArtificialIntelligence. ArtificialIntelligence is based on real information. Without real information structures, artificial intelligence theory improves but the implementation lags. games end up migrating to first person shooters. they have great graphics, movement, 3D, and haptics since data can handle these things well. But other improvement to games do not happen because game rules are RealInformation. So is how to use them.
* Job Hunting and Hiring - knowing who to hire or where to hunt is real information. We can not build proper talent clearing houses because talent especially is real information. Certain jobs need certain talents, and certain people have them, but matching the two up in an automated fashion becomes impossible when we do not have real information structures to hold the information. So job hunting becomes the domain of IndirectRepresentationalPackages, such as skill sets. Skill sets stand in for talent, and our system becomes ossified be cause they really do not address the talents, but without being able to work directly with talents we become afraid. IndirectRepresentationalPackages, such as skill sets, become a signature for a set of talents and we learn by rote and intuition what each of them means in terms of talents.
* Recycling - only commodities/materials can be recycled. The actual things they are made into can not be because understanding what an object is good for is real information and without real information we can not tell who can use it or where it can be useful. So we live in a disposable society where things get thrown away, and only materials like paper or glass or metal can be recycled.
* Search and data mining - search becomes centralized into a few companies because using data for search requires much more ex[pertise than using real information. The same thing goes with data mining. Data mining using data is much harder than data mining using real information. So rather than having most people being able to do it, we end up with a professional few who know how to find information using data by doing the conversion in their head and building a system. The problem with having gthe conversion in their heads is that their head are not TechnoScalable.

''Nice rant with some allusions to possible good points, but to be convincing you need to present evidence.  I'm afraid the best grade I can give it is a D-''

I hope to provide evidence at some point. Right now I'm just trying to get the list completed. Once we have a complete list then hopefully those items that can have evidence for them can be identified and expanded upon.
