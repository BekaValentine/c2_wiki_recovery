I am an organizational consultant researching the emotional roots of creativity in group and individual life. For a living I go into organizations and help to resolve the dilemmas that people get into when they try to work together. Usually I work in the London, UK, area.

BruceAnderson comes sailing with me, and we solve the world's problems together.
