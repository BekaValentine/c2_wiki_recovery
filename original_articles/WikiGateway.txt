WikiGateway is a library of functions which allows you to act as a client to a wiki website, executing operations like getPage, putPage, and getRecentChanges. WikiGateway translates your requests into the idiosyncratic HTML form interfaces of various popular wiki servers. The wiki which you are accessing doesn't have to know about WikiGateway; it sees you as just another user. Basically, WikiGateway does Wiki I/O and import/export.

It can be used either as a library module (PerlLanguage, PythonLanguage), as a CommandLine program ("wikiclient") or as a web service (Atom or XmlRpc).

'''Current Status'''

Supported WikiEngines (so far):

* MoinMoin
* UseMod
* OddMuse

Contributions to make it work with other wikis are welcome. 

Supported interfaces (for the 4 operations getPage, putPage, getRecentChanges, getAllPages):

* PerlLanguage API
* PythonLanguage API
* CommandLine
* AtomSyntax
* XmlRpcWikiInterface

There is partial support for more advanced functionality, such as looking at page histories (i.e., in the Perl and Python APIs).

Right now I'm in the middle of rewriting the core functions (which were in Perl) in Python. The new Python architecture (mostly done in CVS, but not released yet) makes it easier for contributors to write "drivers" for different types of WikiEngine''''''s.

'''Potential applications'''

* Movement of content between different wikis
* RSS export & RSS aggregators
* UnifiedRecentChanges
* FilteredRecentChanges, SubscribedChanges, and similar wiki features (which can now be implemented on the client side rather than as part of the wiki server's code)
* PersonalPrivateWiki and PersonalPublicWiki
* WikiClient (and WikiServer) 
** Things like TouchGraphWikiBrowser. 
** RefactoringBrowser
* WikiWindow
* WikiFatClient
* WikiSync
