Currently JustaStudent full-time, currently studying Software development 'in the large' and the design and writing of applications in C++, along with the fresher-level course 'You, your Computer, and the Net', all with the OpenUniversity.  Previously I studied OO Analysis & Design, Smalltalk coding, and Social Science.

Author of an (at the time) ground-breaking methodology for ensuring BenefitsRealization from projects, which I'd be happy to share with the wikizens if anyone's interested in that sort of thing.  Given the number of TheDevelopmentWasaSuccessItsJustTheProjectTheyBinned stories I've read here in the past couple of days, perhaps it might be useful.
