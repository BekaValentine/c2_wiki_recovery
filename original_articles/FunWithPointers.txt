FunWithPointers is a game where the user tries to use pointers (numbers that represent machine addresses) without doing any of the following:

* Dereferencing the NULL pointer
* Losing track of a memory location that contains allocated memory ("leaking" memory)
* Writing to memory that you shouldn't be via off-by-one (or some other number) errors
