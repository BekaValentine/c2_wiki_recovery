Similar to AnonymousDonor, except that the applier of the label doesn't know or cannot reassuringly determine the authorship. In general, the author themselves will put AnonymousDonor, while other parties may declare existing text from UnknownDonor to avoid "putting words" in the original author's mouth. It may seem trivial to make such a distinction, but misunderstandings have a tendency to trigger flamewars.
