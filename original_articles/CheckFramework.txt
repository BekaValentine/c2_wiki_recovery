Check is a TestingFramework for CeeLanguage. It features a simple interface for defining UnitTest''''''s, putting little in the way of the developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation faults or other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within source code editors and IDEs.
