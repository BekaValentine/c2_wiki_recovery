'''Reviews of: WardsOriginalWikiEngine'''

	* WikiEngineReviewWardsOriginalWikiOne -- Major Version 1 

	* WikiEngineReviewWardsOriginalWikiFourOne -- Version 4.1 (''Software'' to be distributed with TheWikiWay as open source.)

I will create a "template" for the 4.1 review by copying the review of major version 1 and italicizing all comments, after a period of time to allow further comment on the review of major version 1.

THIS REVIEW IS NEITHER COMPLETE NOR CORRECT AT THIS TIME! -- But has been substantially improved, I hope.  After a period of time to allow comments, I will delete this note.
