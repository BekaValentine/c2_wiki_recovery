Typically used in server suites or web applications, the Front Controller consolidates all request handling by channeling requests through a single handler object. This object can carry out common behavior, such as security checking. The handler then dispatches to command (or action) objects for behavior particular to a request.

JakartaStruts is a good example of an implementation.
