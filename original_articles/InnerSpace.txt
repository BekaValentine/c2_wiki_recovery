For people with ChristianCulturalAssumption, this is a verse related to this topic

''Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:''

''Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation''
