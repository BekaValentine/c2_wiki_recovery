Influential film director. He directed Psycho and NorthByNorthwest amongst others.

Hidden away in each of his films is a cameo appearance. He may be seen in a group picture, walking past in the streets, winding a clock... Usually when the scene is busy. Leads to a great game of ''Find the Hitch''.

A lot of his movies employed a device called a McGuffin (or M''''''acGuffin) which is simply something that moves the plot along, but has no meaning other than that.
