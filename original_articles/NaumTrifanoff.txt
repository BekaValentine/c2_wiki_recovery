Why do my pages get deleted? That's the big negative about WikiWeb - if deleters visit more frequently than non-deleters...

''which pages? They may have been deleted if they were test pages, or due to WikiSpringCleaning. -- LayneThomas''

It would probably help if you put more here than just links. A page with just links will typically be treated as WikiSpam. Put something here about yourself. -- DanielSheppard

''I did have more posted at one point, but it was rudely deleted, and I'm hesitant about posting it again, though the fact these words are still here now offers some solace.''

A lot of people ask this question, and it's hard to give a definitive answer in any single case without seeing the original pages. I'm not saying this happened in your case, but what often happens is this. Someone discovers wiki, comes along and creates a few pages, sometimes more than a few, about things that are not directly related to programming, not directly related to projects, are special interests of theirs, and are not connected to the rest of this wiki. Such pages are usually deleted fairly quickly, because this wiki is generally, although not exclusively, about people, projects and patterns.

If what you say is relevant to the wiki's topics, it will usually get woven in and stay. If it's not obviously related, it will often get deleted quickly, particularly if you create several pages at once.

Someone's home page is usually regarded as their own space, although even that gets abused at times.
