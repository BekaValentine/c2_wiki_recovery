I don't know, it looks like a collection of hemi-spheres and cylinders to me.  I suppose the cylinders are a form of degenerate cone, but cylinder is a more specific and appropriate classification.  -- ChrisHines

I used to watch the show regularly as a kid (in syndication; I'm nowhere near that old) and as I recall there were two different versions of the CoS: one actually conical, and the other collection-of-hemispheres-and-cylinders that you saw. I presume that the change was made partway through the series; maybe the writers decided that it was funnier if the CoS were not actually conical. Or maybe it started out non-conical and they decided the irony was lost on the audience. Who knows (''not I''). -- KarlKnechtel
