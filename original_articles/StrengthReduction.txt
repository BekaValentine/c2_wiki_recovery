Simplified: Replacing '*' with repeated '+'. 

Examples:
* Moving calculation of loop-invariant expressions out of the loop.
* Replacing a multiplication with a loop index with repeated addition of the factor.

Often done automatically by a compiler (at least partly). This is often limited by SideEffect''''''s.
