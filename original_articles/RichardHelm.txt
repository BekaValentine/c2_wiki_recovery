I am currently with The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in Sydney, Australia.
There, I am involved in doing IT Strategy and IT transformational projects for major companies.
A far cry from my days at IBM Research.

I am also one of the GangOfFour. Co-author of DesignPatternsBook, which, to my surprise, is still selling well.

This book was born into existence at a BOF, "Towards an Architecture Handbook" run by BruceAnderson at OOPSLA'90. There, ErichGamma and I first met and realized that we had common ideas about what was important when writing reusable OO software. Erich and I were later joined by JohnVlissides and RalphJohnson to complete the GangOfFour and eventually the book.

2005-July-30:
ACM's Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN) recently awarded the 2005 Programming Languages Achievement Award to Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (known as the 'Gang of Four') for their creation of 'Design Patterns' (see DesignPatterns for the news and links).
