Has somebody here already made some experience with it:

It could be an alternative to PaypalStorefrontWiki, lurking in the grass as: http://code.google.com/p/google-checkout-java-sdk/source/browse/wiki/Storefront.wiki

This is an interesting opportunity for WikiEntrepreneurs, since 

* the transaction costs of GoogleCheck appear to undercut the transaction costs of its rival Paypal.
* GoogleCheck is currently (May2009) only available to US/British users

So it could serve as a Workaround to fill in the gap.
