Dynamic Webcam SDK is a browser plugin which enables users to acquire an image from a webcam, edit and then upload/save it to a database, web server or local disk. Also, it can capture a live video stream into a container and grab a snapshot to be exported to a file/binary.

The library is based on the DirectShow API and works with all USB video device class (UVC) and WIA compatible webcams. Computers with Windows XP SP2 and later have UVC support built in, which allows for easy interconnectivity between webcams and computers.

Dynamic Webcam SDK comes with 2 editions for different browsers: ActiveX Edition (working with Internet Explorer) and Plugin Edition (working with Firefox and Chrome).
