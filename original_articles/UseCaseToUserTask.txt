Gonna Play a game here. Assume there are three roles:
	* User
	* Customer
	* Developer
Assume further that the User and Customer decide on a collection of UseCase''''''s that define the User's experience with the AtmMachine. These UseCase''''''s will be documented in Alistair Cockburn's "Fully Dressed" format - see "Writing Effective Use Cases" for a more-than-complete description. For our samples, see the UseCase''''''s at UseAtmMachine, WithdrawCashFromAtm and LogonToAtmSystem...

Then assume that the Customer is going to turn around and deliver UserStory''''''s to the Developer. Question: what do these UserStory'''''' look like? Start a list at AtmUserStoriesAndTasks

Finally, the Developer will break the UserStory''''''s into EngineeringTask''''''s. What do these look like? These are also at AtmUserStoriesAndTasks

''The title of this page suggests there might be such a thing as a "UserTask"...''

I named the page before I remembered it was actually called an EngineeringTask on this forum. So the name of this page could be "Use Case to Engineering Task" - but it isn't  --Dan  ;-)
