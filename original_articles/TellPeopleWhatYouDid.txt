How do you TellPeopleWhatYouDid ? -- the issue is to do it without appearing to be HoggingTheCredit or BraggingTooMuch -- any ideas? One way of course is to CelebrateYourAccomplishment. --RaySchneider

I often give kind of a report of what I did when working too long on my own (happens). I get little feedback about my work but I guess it is well received. This is not so much reporting about the large accomplishments (those will get noticed anyway:-) but about daily progress and the like. 

'''Yepper.''' I keep a daily log of whatever work I am doing for a client as long as I am billing. Those daily entries help in creating the weekly report, and eventually, the project wrap-up. Isn't this what professionals are supposed to do anyway?

Probably. But nobody seems to tell you or take notice of it even if you don't (in my case at least).
