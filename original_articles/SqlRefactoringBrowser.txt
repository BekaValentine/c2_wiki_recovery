Using the techniques described on AdvancedFactoring our team of 500 development staff have spent 18 months producing a system with approximately 11,000 StoredProcedures. We have successfully avoided the perils of the FatMiddleArchitecture and replaced them with a FatBottomedArchitecture. ''(Not to mention avoiding the FatHeadedArchitecture...)''

Obviously there's a lot of duplication in our logically siloed StoredProcedures. We're considering ReFactoring them but have seen no tools to do this. Anyone got a SqlRefactoringBrowser?
