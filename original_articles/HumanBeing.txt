'''Important Facts''' about '''HumanBeing''''''s'''

----
''' A HumanBeing can only be programmed interactively.'''

As a system element, a HumanBeing has a variety of strengths and weaknesses, when designing a system you should take this into account.
* HumanBeing''''''s can excel at extracting patterns from noisy data sets. ''However, they can easily generate FalsePositive''''''s, finding patterns where none exist.''
* HumanBeing''''''s can provide instructions at critical decision points in cases where most components would fail silently. However, HumanBeing''''''s can fail to react where automated systems would function well.
* HumanBeing''''''s must have a relatively constant stream of data about the state of the rest of the system; be careful if their datastreams are too bland - they can start to behave erratically.
* HumanBeing''''''s communicate more easily if supported by broadband communication infrastructure. On this text-based Wiki, the missing body language part gives rise to a lot of misunderstandings.
* HumanBeing''''''s communicate most efficiently when they can touch each other.
* HumanBeing''''''s don't like to work as slaves to masters.
* HumanBeing''''''s are annoyed if they feel themselves used as tools.
* HumanBeing''''''s always exist as part of a group of HumanBeing''''''s.  

'''A HumanBeing is always instantiated outside the system.'''
	 :	What usually happens is that '''ROOT''' creates a new account and one or more HumanBeing''''''s begins to use it. Some systems have suggested that '''ROOT''' may actually be a HumanBeing but this concept-tree is of such low-probability that it can safely be dismissed.

A HumanBeing may be reading this, You-Who-Can-Pass-the-TuringTest might see it, but it is known that a HumanBeing can occasionally read DataStreams in transit.

''"[HumanBeing''''''s are said by some to be] ape-descended life forms... so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea." -- DouglasAdams, HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy''

My take on it: HumanBeing''''''s are instantiated outside the system at random times and will act onto the system in unpredicted ways.  It is however possible to analyse the behavior of a Group Of HumanBeing''''''s and one should take that into account when designing the system. -- ViktorRosenfeld

From MrAristotle: A HumanBeing is a two-legged Animal that laughs.
