''Types and Programming Languages'' (ISBN:0262162091) by BenjaminPierce.  Quite simply the most comprehensive work on TypeTheory that currently exists today.  Highly technical, and likely a bit difficult for laymen to grasp, but covers the subject in great depth and breadth.  Contains lots of important introductory material, such as a thorough introduction to the LambdaCalculus.
