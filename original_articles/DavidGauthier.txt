Hi... 

I graduated from CarnegieMellonUniversity, where I majored in ComputerScience and CognitiveScience.  I once did a co-op at LucentTechnologies where I learned a lot of things about software development in a non-academic setting.  

I used to work at MercuryInteractive, which acquired my employer KintanaInc, formerly called ChainLinkTechnologies, a Java software development company in Sunnyvale, California.  I have become the TechnicalSpecializationManager for the development group, and am responsible for improving the skills of our Technical Design, Tech Design and Implementation Processes, and making things nicer for our TechnicalLead''''''s in general.

Now I work for CaslonAndCompany working on a high performance platform for digital print solutions.
