	December 6, 2001	 :	I've enjoyed using Ward's Wiki so much! Now I'm helping out with PhpWiki at SourceForge, check it out.

''Things to do''
	Update links to my homepage
	self = refactor(self.life) #RefactorMyLife

''About Me''
	 :	MyMyersBriggsTypeIs INxP (INFP formerly INTP)

	 :	Sometimes I actually write my own code. My FearOfReinventingTheWheel often keeps me searching for existing free code far longer than it (likely) would have taken to reinvent. However, I would rather conclude that current search tools and code-sharing software are grossly inadequate than to admit to having writer's block. Perhaps the study of patterns will help me to write 'adequate' code-sharing software.

	 :	Voraciously studying metaphysics and quantum mechanics as a hobby. Unfortunately, according to the HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple, it turns out that a universally complete understanding of ''both'' metaphysics ''and'' quantum mechanics is not possible by a single individual-- it's either one or the other, but never both at the same time. ;-)

	 :	I have a background in mechanical engineering which I enjoy, but somehow I'm now doing The''''''Computer''''''Thing instead.

Hi Carsten, you may want to update your APSL comments in the Wikipedia's Mac OS X history. The OSI and FSF both endorse the 2.0 version of the APSL as a valid license (OSD-certified and "free software" respectively), and say it is okay to use software under their license. The FSF doesn't recommend using the APSL for code you write, but neither does Apple.
