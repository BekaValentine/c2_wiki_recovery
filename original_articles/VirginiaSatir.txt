Virginia Satir has composed a list of behaviors that help a person "deal in a relatively competent and precise way with the world". She says that such persons will 

	* be clear when they deal with others
	* be aware of their own thoughts and feelings
	* be able to see and hear what is outside themselves
	* behave toward other people as separate from themselves and unique
	* treat differentness as an opportunity to learn and explore, rather than as a threat or a signal for conflict
	* deal with persons and situtations in their context, in terms of how it is rather than how they wish it were or expect it to be
	* accept responsibility for what they feel, think, hear, and see, rather than denying it or attributing it to others
	* have open techniques for giving, receiving, and checking meaning with others
