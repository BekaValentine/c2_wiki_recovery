The GrammarVandal - is he still alive? Or is this site just being mangled by an unattended software process running on some box somewhere, while he rots in a box in the ground?

I don't know which creeps me out more, the idea of him being dead or the idea of him still being alive and obsessed with WardsWiki.

Strange. This page was created just ''before'' something mangled a lot of lisp pages (removing parts and partly adding character sequences. All edits come from nycmspsrvz3ts432-dmz.mycingular.net.

''Oh, gee -- somebody or something trashing Lisp pages? That's just too damn bad, ain't it? Perhaps somebody or something is getting tired of all the Lisp posing on this board. Whatever.''

"Board"? "Posing"? You must be new around here.

{{GV is not normally tech-topic-hostile that I remember, other than targeting a topic because it's popular or recent. Some of the Lisp messages suggest a different Lisp Vandal.}}

Well, if GV were to restrict his bad behavior to Lisp pages on this board I might not object too strenuously. I think the Lispers and GV deserve one another. <cough>

[Really?  What do you mean by that?]
