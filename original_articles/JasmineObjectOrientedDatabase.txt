Jasmine is an object-oriented database codeveloped by Fujitsu and Computer Associates.

Free evaluation versions are available from http://www.cai.com/products/jasmine.htm

Some hints and tips:

Rather than thinking "I want to persist my objects", an easier way is to think "database" but "relational" has been replaced by "object-oriented".

Methods execute on the server.
