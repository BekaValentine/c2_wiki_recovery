I like small keyboards (I currently use a Happy Hacking Lite 2), and this one looks intriguing. Does anyone here have experience with it? -- DanMuller

''I have two of these keyboards, one at work, one at home. The home keyboard replaced a Happy Hacking Lite. My main reason for switching was that I wanted to use the Dvorak layout, and switching the layout in hardware is easier to deal with. The vertical layout took a bit of time to get used to, but it's quite comfortable. -- LarryColeman''
