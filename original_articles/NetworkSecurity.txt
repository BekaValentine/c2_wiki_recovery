Anyone putting a computer on a network needs to have some understanding of NetworkSecurity. SecurityIsHard. First management needs to be made aware of the potential problems (easier than it used to be) and needs to say the magic words "IwannaLearnComputerSecurity"; then effective SecurityManagement can begin.

''' IpV6 security, gain some and lose some'''

IPv6 includes the IpSec suite of security protocols developed by the IETF (InternetEngineeringTaskForce).

OTOH, an unauthorised IPV6 router connected into the network using a wireless mechanism can attempt to ''redefine itself as the default router''

Perhaps the biggest drawback of using IpV6 scheme is that 2004 software (e.g. ICF FireWall from MicrosoftCorporation) cannot work (e.g. filtering ) on Ipv6 traffic.
