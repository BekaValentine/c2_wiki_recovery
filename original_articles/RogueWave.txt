Rogue Wave Software is a leading provider of C++ and Java reusable, cross-platform software parts and tools. 

Founded in 1989, Rogue Wave is a pioneer in the field of reusable software parts. We released the first commercial C++ class library, Math.h++, and quickly followed that with Tools.h++. Over the years we have continued to hone our expertise and expand our product line, and now we offer a wide variety of software parts and code generators that reduce the need for our clients to write original code for their object-oriented applications.

Wasn't Glockenspiel's C++ Windows library released in 1988 or early 1989? I remember using it in June of 1989. Wouldn't that make it the first commercial C++ class library? -- KyleBrown

Dunno. The explicit claim made on their corporate page is "We shipped the first commercial C++ class library, Math.h++, in 1989."

Who here has a bunch of old JournalOfObjectOrientedProgramming or DrDobbsJournal issues? Look through the 1988 and 1989 issues and see if you can resolve this burning question :) -- KyleBrown

Never mind the history - is the Rogue Wave Tools.h++ any good?
----
I think so, it probably has the best string class I've seen. If your looking for simple containers, look to STL though. -- IraCooper

''As a previous user of RogueWave's Tools.h++ among other libraries, do people see them losing their business as compiler vendors like Microsoft become more STL compliant? For instance, the STL in Visual Studio DotNet is 100% compliant and fixes most of the STL problems that lurk in VC++ 6.0.'' -- sg

Tools.h++ was excellent. We used it heavily in writing telecomm applications including in multithreaded applications in the late 90's. -- RonPerrella

We released Glockenspiel CommonView in 1988, and it was definitely the first "commercial" C++ library available. What's more, we can lay claim to having the first ever working C++ program on windows, which was a version of the Microsoft Windows Cardfile application built on a prototype CommonView library. We were way ahead of the posse on this one... Microsoft took another three years to catch up themselves, and that was only after they poached Glockenspiel's compiler architect to do the job for them.

RogueWave used to offer object-relational mapping product called Metro, but it's entered obsolescence.
