Seems like a jolly good idea!

Hopefully the name is self explanatory - extending the text-based world of Wiki by allowing users to draw pictures.

Experimental plugin for JspWiki at http://dannyayers.com/2003/08/jspwiki/whiteboard.htm 

Anyone know of others?
''Yes, twiki.org has this fully implemented: http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/TWikiDrawPlugin''
''Yes, SnipSnap.org has this too http://snipsnap.org''

'''What Should it Do?'''

IMO, a bit more than just freehand, but not so much that it takes time to learn...

* Multi-user drawing (obviously)
* freehand lines
* multiple colours
* text tool
* straight line tool
* simple shapes - squares, ellipses etc
* (ambitious?) - text tool labels as WikiCase sensitive hyperlinks
* pasting images (through upload)

''Doesn't MoinMoin have a drawing feature?''

MoinMoin uses the Twiki drawing plugin.

There are many collected notes on WikiWhiteboard at: http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/WikiWhiteboard

Have a look at http://tethys.croydon.ac.uk/democircle.nsf where we have a jave whiteboard as part of a wiki environment. Each whiteboard need a wiki title and you can use the text slot to add wiki links or create new pages.
