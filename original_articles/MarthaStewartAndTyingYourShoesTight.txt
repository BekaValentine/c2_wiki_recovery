''It's funny, but while watching MarthaStewart tie up a roast she had just rolled up, I noticed that in tying the knot, she added an extra wrap around in the bottom part of the knot '' DoingStuff.DonaldNoyes.20140826

I had a problem that this might just solve - since the idea was that the knot would be tight and would not come undone.

My shoes have a tendency for the bow to come undone! No matter how tight I tie the bow. 
* Perhaps I could try the first part, (the extra wrap under of the lace in the bottom part of the bow) when I tied the bow.
** I tried it, and ItWorks !! - it holds as fast as if I had tied a knot instead of a bow!
* I never tie a bow any other way now 

How it works:
* the lace is crossed, and the left side is tucked under and is brought up over the lace coming from the right side.
** in a normal bow this is when the bow is made in the upper part.
** in this special bow, the left lace is once again wrapped under and is grasped by the right hand and the right lace, now in the left hand is then pulled tightly to the left and the right side tightly to the right. You will note that in this process, you do not have to worry about it loosening while you complete the bows, which you also pull tightly. 
** done, complete, and it will not come undone. 

Try this simple thing and see if it works for you.
