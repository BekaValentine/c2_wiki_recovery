CategoryLearningMethods

There are a set of related pages linked through the DreyfusModel and ShuHaRi which discuss the stages of learning by an individual. I have found more than I first thought by following some links. I have also widened it to includs some pages on expertise as that is a product of learning. -- JohnFletcher

There are some related categories e.g. CategoryCommunication, CategoryEducation.

There are also some pages from way back with interesting reflections which have never had a category.
