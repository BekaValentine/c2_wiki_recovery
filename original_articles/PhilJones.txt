Which wiki and what page would you like to get requests/comments etc on SdiDesk? You will have a larger audience (more work) if you gather your feedback via WardsWiki

I monitor both, although the explicit SdiDesk wiki more often. I don't think I should be cluttering up WardsWiki with all the details. But I hope the page on SdiDesk attracts more people to SdiDesk.
