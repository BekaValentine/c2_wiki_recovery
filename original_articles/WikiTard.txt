GV (GrammarVandal), AKA: GV-tard.

An individual who has an insatiable apatite for that ever fascinating quest "does the refrigerator light really turn on and off when the door is opened and closed?", and has applied this to Wiki.  To become "I just don't understand how the WikiCommunity can revert my changes like magic" and "boy, that SharkBot sure works slick!".  So, the end result is that the refrigerator door hinges and latch get worn out from the ever checking, and so too does the WikiCommunity and the SharkBot become weary.
