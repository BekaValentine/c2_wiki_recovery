PeWi is a seven line PerlLanguage WikiClone from the author of WyPy, written for ShortestWikiContest.

	* Working code: http://infomesh.net/200X/pewi/pewi.pl.txt

Documentation and so on coming within a day or so: the author just spent all night learning Perl, coding the wiki, and then testing it. Quick instructions:

	0. make a /pewi/ directory
	0. upload pewi as w.cgi
	0. chmod 755 w.cgi and make sure that the script can write to /pewi/
	0. visit /pewi/w?e=HomePage to start creating.

"{" starts a list, "@ " starts a list item, "}" closes a list. Double line break for paragraphs. Links work as normal. -- SeanPalmer

'''Acknowledgements''': Cody "d8uv" Woodard (name), Robin Berjon ("return"), Morbus Iff (a handful of hacks), Casey West (use of CGI vars), Nicholas Clark ($^I hack), Daniel Biddle (syntax note).

''Tried it, can't make it work. I started apache, installed the script in more than one place, made directories, everything I would usually do to make a cgi script work. Would you care to supply more complete instructions?''
