A phrase I've started using... these are patterns that allow the group to sleep at night, go home and not worry, that keep the people happy.  EarlyAndRegularDelivery, AutomatedRegressionTest, and ContinuousRoundTrip are three that come to mind immediately. --AlistairCockburn

The phrase reminds me of BobRoss' "Happy little trees". ''- so see also HappyLittlePatterns?'' ''':)'''
