A technology to be shipped in MacOsx 10.4 Tiger, aiding RapidApplicationDevelopment, particularly in the creation of PersistentObjects:

Core Data is promised to include:
* A SqLite database server distributed with MacOsx
* An API to create bindings between objects and persistent counterparts in the SQLite database
* An API to store these bound data objects as XML, as a "binary format", or in a SQLite database

(all of this sounds a bit like CocoaBindings for data)

Expect integration with AppleSpotlight.
