Until our spamming friend finds a new plaything, NewRecentChanges (at http://c2.com/cgi/RecentChanges) will frequently be cluttered with his attempts to annoy us.  That seems to be the case whether the SharkBot deletes his pages or not.  In order to reduce the annoyance, I have created an alternative NewRecentChanges at:

http://shark.armchair.mb.ca/~dave/wardswiki/   

The format is rather different, as it's been hastily crafted from existing code.  However, the content is the same except the spammed pages do not appear and heavily edited pages show only the first and most recent edits.

Deleting either of the above links is an EditWar.
