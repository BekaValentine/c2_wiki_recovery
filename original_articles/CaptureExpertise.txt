This wiki can be characterized as a body of literature in which the Expertise of the community is captured. 

The methods employed must contribute to the capturing of what later readers will find useful and informative. While many pages are the creation of a single author, many pages are the result of interactions and dialogue which grow the page and because of community involvement, becomes more that it would be otherwise. It captures best when the subject is considered a work in progress, where each contribution builds on that which has gone before and provides additional insight or information. Each contributor should consider the information added as contributory to subject and where side issues or other views develop, the making of a link to a page dealing with the side issue or alternative views. This contributes to coherence and logical consistancy within the page. 

Expertise is best captured by illustrative examples of WhatWorks. The ReallyValuablePages within this wiki exhibit such characteristics.
