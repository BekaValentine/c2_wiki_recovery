I first discovered this Wiki about a year ago. Since then, wikis have come to dominate my life. I've even managed to infect my friends with the WikiBug.

I'm a programmer by vocation and avocation. Mostly I write stuff in the DelphiLanguage, but I'm learning the SmalltalkLanguage in my spare time. And I'm starting to really hate the relative inadequacies of Delphi as compared to Smalltalk. Among other things: manifest typing, file-based source code, almost complete lack of reflection, the general hackish feel of ObjectPascal, lack of garbage collection, all the wonderful issues you have to keep track of if you want to use interfaces.

I now keep several wikis, including a RolePlayingGame wiki describing the world of the Vorician Empire, as played in by my friends & I.

I was born in South Africa, and I currently work for LShift, in London, U.K.
