'''Please Don't Delete Wiki!!!'''

I thought yesterday of a page called WikiMining viz. being able to extract information about a new topic by looking at the pages on a topic. In recent times I have done this for FunctionalProgramming, GraphTheory and StandardTemplateLibrary, all topics I wanted to know about and could do a BootStrap into them, starting with Wiki. When I am doing that I am searching into the richness of this data in ways the original authors may not have forseen. -- JohnFletcher
