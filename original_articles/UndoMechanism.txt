A means whereby, something which has been '''Done''', can be '''Un Done'''.

On this wiki in particular,
mis-guided edits can be "undone" by clicking "Edit"
and then "EditCopy".
See MoreAboutBackupCopies for details.

If there are TwoMinorEdits (such as on WikiFarms), the data is lost. ( Or is it ? )
