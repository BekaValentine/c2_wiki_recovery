JerryArchibald retired from IBM Research in early 1993. He now has his own business (SysOs):

 Putnam Valley, New York  10579
I'm now a consulting gypsy and follow contracts wherever they lead. I work in Smalltalk, UML, and Java (all flavors, all tools, all platforms). Software hobbies include messing with Squeak and Smalltalk Express. 

At the moment, I am trying revive some old work (anyone remember the External Structure) from 70's research and apply it to UML and Java.
