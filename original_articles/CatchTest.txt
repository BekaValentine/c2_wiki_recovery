''"I would also humbly submit that CATCH (http://catch-lib.net) has a place too. It, too, is header-only, using modern C++ (but not *too* modern) and with no external dependencies (beyond C++98's stdlib). It has a number of other features that differentiate it - such as it's natural expression syntax, isolated sections (that reduce, or eliminate, the need for sections) and free form test naming."'' -- PhilNash [quoted from LinkedIn comments by JeffGrigg]
