Widely considered an oxymoron, especially regarding larger military organizations.

From my (extremely limited) experience of military contexts, it seems that whenever the words "military intelligence" are spoken in conversation someone reflexively makes the "oxymoron" joke. It seems less like a joke than a ritual gesture to avoid tempting Fate.

Having some exposure to what is termed "MilitaryIntelligence", I view such references as being used by uninformed individuals who have no idea of what the word "Intelligence" in this context means. Intelligence when gathered and used in this sense is not limited to use by the military, or by governments, but is also used by individuals, corporations and other organizations to help them survive in their own environments.  -- DonaldNoyes
