A place to put your name / IP if you don't care about being anonymous but don't use a UserName cookie for any reason. As this list is unlikely to become very long, I've put the name first; extra IP addresses may be added inline.

Don't list anybody other than yourself (an exception may be made for WikiVandal''''''s).

Alphabetically:
* DaveVoorhis - host86-145-161-49.range86-145.btcentralplus.com (dynamic, likely to change), *.derby.ac.uk
* ElizabethWiethoff - pool nyc east.verizon.net

Great idea. I keep a list in my Mac''''''Journal, but a public list is friendlier and verifies my own list. -- Eliz

A quick way to determine your IP (assuming firewalls and proxies don't obscure it): http://www.whatismyip.com/.

Of course, if a firewall or proxy is obscuring your IP; that obscured IP is what WikiWiki's servers will see, and what will show up in QuickChanges, RecentPosts, and the like. 'Tis what firewalls and proxies do. :)
