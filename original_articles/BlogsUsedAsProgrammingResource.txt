''Some blogs contain material which can become useful resources when organized properly in a framework '' DonaldNoyes.ThinkingOutLoud.20121118.20121201

While many Blogs contain tidbits of information generated by random experiences, others are specifically targeted at a subject or topic, and when the blogger is a accomplished person or a SubjectMatterExpert, their blogs can serve as serious resources for an individual. When the resource is included in a frame or frames used in FederatingYourInternet or similar technology, navigation within a topic or subject is greatly enhanced. They can be further integrated as integrated federations to form encompassing topics or subjects
