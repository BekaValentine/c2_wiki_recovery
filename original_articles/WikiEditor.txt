I looked at his page and it looks like a lot of flailing. Also, if you look at http://www.dannyg.com/ref/jsquickref.html, you might begin to ask why you want to do this. If your bonehead users learned how to type, they can learn wikimarkup. Interoperability issues make this JavaScript stuff seem a little silly.

Funny, I always thought the idea of a wiki was to make adding content simple enough that you didn't have to worry about fluff like wysiwyg. IMHO the markup should be unobtrusive enough that you can read the content even before it is formatted. So what exactly does a wysiwyg editor add (unless you are moving away from wiki and more towards cms)?
