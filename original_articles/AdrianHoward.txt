Passionate about creating great software. AgileLanguage evangelist. AgileSoftwareDevelopment fanatic. TestDrivenDesign bigot. UserExperienceDesign advocate.

Currently most enthusiastic about Ruby, and integrating UserExperienceDesign with AgileSoftwareDevelopment.
Love finding ways to put people and new technology together.

Still hopes that the LispLanguage and SmalltalkLanguage will take over the world :-) Likes the PerlLanguage (which is nowhere near as bad as some people say :-) and wrote PerlTestClass amongst other things.

Used to work with PhilJones many moons ago.
