LinuxChix is an informal, volunteer-run online community where women and men
with various levels of expertise discuss Linux-related technology
and issues of gender and computing.

Most activity occurs on three mailing lists with different areas of
focus (technical, issues-based and social).  A number of regional
chapters exist which facilitate RealWorld meetings and events.

A wiki is being considered for the LinuxChix web site.

Those interested in encouraging more women in computing fields should take a look at the HOWTO, written by LinuxChix members:
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Encourage-Women-Linux-HOWTO/index.html

lots of food for thought, for men and women.

Thank you VERY MUCH for the HOWTO! I felt much better after reading this! (The only thing I don't completely agree with is about women "cussing," but then I'm not comfortable with anyone using obscenities. I don't think it shows strength, earthiness or anything positive.)

But let that pass -- overall this is a wonderful document! -- Websafe.
