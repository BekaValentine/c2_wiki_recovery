Hi,

In my professional life I serve as the founder of the Project/Open Open-Source Project-ERP (checkout http://www.project-open.com/ for details, http://ptdemo.dnsalias.com/ and http://pcdemo.dnsalias.com/ for an online demo system).

In my personal life I'm interested in distributed systems, server architecture and knowledge representation. For more information about me, please see my personal pages at http://www.fraber.de/. Also, checkout http://www.od-tools.com/.

I'm interested in patterns ever since I have been in parallel programming, where the FarmPattern, the PipelinePattern and some other relatively static structures are dominating the computational infrastructures.
