A ''homogeneous container'' is a container which can only contain objects of the same type.  Lists in HaskellLanguage, for example, are homogeneous--you can have lists of integers, lists of booleans, lists of characters, etc.... but you cannot have a list whose first element is an integer, whose second element is a character, etc. Arrays in C are also homogeneous. Compare HeterogeneousContainer.
