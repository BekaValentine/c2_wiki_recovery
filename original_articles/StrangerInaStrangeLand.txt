Contains the following quote which could be used in a discussion about computer consciousness: "He eternally ''was'' the action he had taken at cusp".  

Essentially, a definition of self based on the reflection that absence of self is equivalent to absence of actions carried out by self and vice versa.  

The relevance to computer consciousness is that a computer program empowered to act at cusp is at some fundamental level equivalent to a human being.

(Cusp as used in the novel is a moment at which a choice is presented and the future course of history diverges based on the action taken.)
