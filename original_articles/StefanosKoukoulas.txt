Hello guys and gals!

Ok from now on let's conform to the rules:) So, only English, since using greeklish has caused a lot of debate as you will see below :)))

I am an MSc student in computer networks.My interests include a lot of areas of technology, such as computer networks, programming, web programming, computer engineering, telecommunications, security... Furthermore, I am a very sociable and open-minded person with interest in sports, internet, politics etc.

I am working on my final project at the moment.It is about deploying a grid application. U've never heard of the term 'grid' before, have u?
Well, u'd better get used to it because the grid is the future! Like internet has changed the way information is exchanged radically, grid will bring the revolution on how resources are exchanged among hosts and organizations in the internet. For a quick start on grid, read the 'grid bible': The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure (Edited by Ian Foster and Carl Kesselman).

By the way, does anyone have any idea about Tomcat? -- Stefanos

Hi Stefanos!
Wow, cool stuff what you are writing about the 'grid'! I think we ll all have to learn more about it in the future! Keep up the good job with the project :) By the way have you been around london a lot? Nothing like the parliament-tower bridge, 'queen walk', especially during the spring and summer time with the happy surrounding of good friends...

Hi S! 
Seems u know london a lot.This is true.London is excellent in spring and summer, especially because of its great parks where u can sit for hours even the hottest days of the summer, as the trees cover the sun. If u want a good friend for a walk around london feel free to invite me..I think I can keep good company:)

I guess you can't speak Greek... but how do you know that this is Greek? I am impressed... well done! Actually, I write in Greek so that I can communicate with my girlfriend and nobody else understands (hehe..)

I think you can write in every language using English characters. In particular, this is called greeklish and is very widely used in Greece:)
