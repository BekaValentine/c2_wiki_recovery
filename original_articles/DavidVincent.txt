a Developer/Operator at http://codelegal.com.au

I got interested in TestCentredDevelopment in the late nineties.  If I recall correctly, I discovered RecursiveMakeConsideredHarmful and then the AeGis configuration manager.  Around then I learned about ExtremeProgramming.  Since then I have tried to apply it and related things, with varying success.  

I got interested in HardwareDevelopment including AnalogElectronics in primary school.  In the 7th grade I discovered DigitalElectronics and soon after that SoftwareDevelopment and perhaps became a CompulsiveProgrammer.  

I try not to give up.

I have worked on systems to:

* render PageDescription''''''s (in languages like PostScript) for hard copy and test, and support some Agile-ish development of the renderers and test infrastructure, including AeGis
* support project governance, with ExtremeProgramming
* publish sea charts for mariners on paper and CD-ROM
* simulate the bridge of a ship (to educate mariners)
* massage national statistics
* control a TasmanTurtle and other robot-like thingies
* look after small business data
