Erwin Schroedinger (1887-1961) Was a major contributor to modern QuantumMechanics (basically our "state of art" model for atoms and molecules) and gave it the final wave mechanics "Schroedinger's Equation" form. He is commonly known for a ThoughtExperiment referred to as SchroedingersCat. His achievements are comparable to Einstein's contributions to physics and in fact the two were good friends.

Schroedinger is commonly known amongst physicists as the originator of the use of wave mechanics for Quantum Mechanics. Schroedinger was building on work performed by De Broglie which observed a  wave like nature in the electron. Heisenberg, Born and and others used matrix mathematics. Both approaches are mathematically equivalent but allow different approaches to solving problems. This was very important in the time before digital computers.

He's dead? Are you sure? Really really sure?
