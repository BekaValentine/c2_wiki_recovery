I've been programming computers since I was five years old, starting with AppleSoft Basic on an AppleIi GS. I'm at my happiest when my hands are in the code. (The job market in recent years has gotten me a bit depressed.) I'm a ComputerScience senior at the University of Oklahoma, graduating in 12/2004. I've got some anecdotes about my programming history on FirstLanguageLearned.

''Interesting name.  Is it your RealName?''
