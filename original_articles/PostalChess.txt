A GameOfChess played through the postal service:
Each player has their own board and pieces, and you mail moves to each other.

GoingPostal: ''(If you lose, you can fly into a rage and kill your opponent.)''

There are two ways to resign in chess. You can take your king and lay it down long-wise, or you can pick it up and hurl it at your opponent. Guess which one is preferred in tournament play?

PostalChess is significantly different from WikiChess. Consider this your WikiChess invitation.
