As of April 2004, I am starting my master's thesis on GO at UC Santa Cruz. I am trying to look at the GNU GO 3.4 code and see if I can improve it. If you have comments on games played with GNU GO 3.4, please leave your comments here or contact me. Send me a saved SGF file on your game with GNU GO 3.4 would be great.
