Hello, hello!  The first visitor of 1998!  

I'm a developer with Cambridge Technology Partners (http://www.ctp.com), doing object oriented web work.  I can be reached at mailto:prando@ctp.com.

The idea behind this site is fantastic.  I'm suprised no one's done it before (as far as I know).  Seems to me that this is very true to VannevarBush's original MemexVision.
