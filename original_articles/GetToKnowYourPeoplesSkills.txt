It would be great if managers could achieve this without making several expensive mistakes in the process.

There is an AntiPattern to this:

Many ''managers'' don't have this skill. This often leads to downward spirals. Someone is placed in an assignment they are unsuited for. They are miserable, don't do well, and a transfer is viewed as a reward, so they are stuck there. Depending on the situation, the victim may remain in misery, get fired, change jobs, or even summon the effort to do well and get something else to work on. If this last happens, then the manager can say, "We really turned him around."

How can you know if your people are really up to the assigned task?

	1 Ask him. Let him explain why he thinks he is ready. What he will do and how.
	1 Let him estimate the effort. Multiply by his individual velocity.
	1 Let others estimate the effort. Multiply by their respective individual velocity.
	1 Adjust the tasks so that this task gets done on time by the individual whose total time is lower.
	1 Once the iteration is finished, allow the TaskDatabase to recalculate relative speeds. It is funny how people tend to estimate better the next time. Just because they feel that they are professional. External incentives do not work.
