Organizing information in any category scheme is a high-pressure task. 

Organization of Information can be
* Organization by Classification - grooping stuff according to mutually related classifications
* Organization by Operations and Procedures - Associations which are about the handling and processing of your information
* Organization in the placement and locales of information together with strategies for Storing and Recalling
* Some information may belong to a grouping called TheOtherThings
