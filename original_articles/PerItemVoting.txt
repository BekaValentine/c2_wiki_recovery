The idea of '''per-item voting''' is to extend the WikiWay so that one can find the WikiGems through the roughage. It is a companion to UserRanking.

The basic idea is that each user's [(quasi-)atomic] contribution is subject to a single +/-1 vote (like ThumbsUp) from the community. These affect visibility of items by specifying an ordering. But one must be careful to avoid "positive" reinforcement feedback loops (where the top keeps getting seen and voted more by vice of user's attention).

Ultimately, this alone one be enough to scale indefinitely large. One needs a ThreeDimensionalVisualizationModel.

This tends to hide unpopular ideas or good ideas that came from unpopular people. Do we want a wiki to represent the consensus, or poke holes in the status-quo?

''Only true when there is not also UserRanking.''
