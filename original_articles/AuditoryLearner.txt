An auditory learner is a person who learns by hearing or by reading text. A VisualLearner learns by watching or by graphics is also closely related to VisualLearner's style. Each person has a dominant learning style. It is the mode in which they learn most easily. Learning by doing by muscle movement or perhaps by GuiActionTrace is closely related to a KinestheticLearner's style. --JonGrover
