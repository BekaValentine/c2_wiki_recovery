Well, here it is, the ubiquitous HomePage.

Guess if I'm going to play well with others, I want to make myself available for comment. I'm unsure if I trust the whole '''delete it if the spirit moves you'' approach to wiki, but I'm intrigued. Leave questions and comments here.

Helpful information about JoeYoung:
	* Not my real name, it refers to a "mighty" large monkey. Ok, maybe there is some resemblance. What's in a name, anyway?

''Well, around here we like to see RealNamesPlease.''

Curiously, there does not seem to be a consensus on this. I understand the nature of the ''suggestion'', but prefer to retain a level a anonymity. I could post in a totally anonymous fashion (for example, the comment I am responding to), but I want to held responsible for what I say. Having a "username" seems to me to be a logical middle ground.

Skills, interests, etc.
	* Oracle DBA
	* Programmer extraordinaire, you name the language and I've used it or can learn it in a week. Current favorites include Java, Javascript, and VBScript.
	* XML and XSLT. This is a truly fun technology. All the little bits on information I constantly refer to have managed to find their way to XML at some point.
	* Web design. I've used the powertools, hate them. Plain text editors remain my development tool of choice.
	* OOP. This goes along with Java, one of the best toys for OOP.  Currently we store data in databases and talk to them with SQL. More and more, we'll be talking to data objects. Though I believe there will still be an RDBMS on the back end, there won't need to be.
	* EverQuest. Hmm, I'm afraid to use double caps, but there it is. A profoundly addictive game.
	* Eishin-Ryu Iaijutsu. At the risk of sounding like a total geek, here is my current martial art. Oh well, I guess that's kind of geeky too; deal.
	
More to come and edits planed as I worry out this curiously archaic markup.

Wow, the AddYourName mechanism is pretty cludgy for a technically oriented site. (Sorry, couldn't help myself. :) )
