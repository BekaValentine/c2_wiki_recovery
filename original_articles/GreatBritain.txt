From AreYouBeingServed:
	* Miss Brahms: If Britain's so great how come we've got inflation, and taxes, and all that?
	* Capt. Peacock: I'll tell you what's great about Britain, Miss Brahms. It's the only country that isn't semidetached! ''Er, Australia? New Zealand? Sri Lanka?'' [Go tell Captain Peacock or the BBC.]

''I believe the origin of the '''Great''' in GreatBritain solely refers to size, not power, standard of living or anything. When Britain was ruled by the Duke of Normandy, the French referred to Brittany as "Little Britain" and Britain as "Big Britain". Grand Britannia got translated to "Great Britain".''  Which is just as well:  I don't think we'd get away with referring to it as Grand Britain!

Makes sense. Great and Lesser in toponyms usually refers to size.
