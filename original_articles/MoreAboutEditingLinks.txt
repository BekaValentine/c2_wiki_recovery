Words that look like Web URLs are automatically made into in-place hyperlinks.  Any text that begins
  '''http: '''
  '''ftp: '''   or
  '''mailto: '''
will link to or mail to the specified address.  The address is everything up to the next white-space or UnusualUrlPunctuation.  For example...
* mailto:ward@c2.com which I read daily when not traveling, or see
* http://c2.com/~ward/ for my personal page
* http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?WikiWikiWeb
