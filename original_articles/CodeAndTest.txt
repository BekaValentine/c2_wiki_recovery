The natural, unsophisticated approach to software development used by most new developers never exposed to notions of methodology.  The software equivalent of "trial and error".  Basically, to use this approach you think in code.  You create something, then execute it to see if it's what you meant.  (See also CodeAndFix.)

In practice, this is usually CodeAndDemo.  The difference:
	* A demo is usually NOT automated, and requires a human to check the output.
	* A test is usually scripted, and/or automated with automated verification.
