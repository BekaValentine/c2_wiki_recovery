I work as XP-developer and project manager (or rather coach, by XP-measures) at Kartena AB (formerly Geosition) in Gothenburg, Sweden. I am very enthusiastic about XP, that, in my opinion, is the only development method that I have encountered that is pragmatic enough to work, at least for smaller projects.

In fall of 2002 I held my first XP seminar at a company with about 15 employees here in Gothenburg, Sweden. They embraced it, and are now a full-fledged XP-team.

Since then I have held one more seminar, and if you are interested in XP and are thinking of applying it at your company, contact me and I will help you get started. References are available upon request.
