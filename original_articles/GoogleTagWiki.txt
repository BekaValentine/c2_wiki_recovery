A pure GoogleTagWiki is defined as a "thin" WikiEngine, where 
* the handling of local links is left to the Google Search Engine. 
* each WikiWord becomes a "Wiki Tag" with an option box. An arbitrary subset of option boxes can be checked, allowing complex queries.

As Wards Wiki is populated by a lot of programmers of Wikiengines, there is a good chance, that we soon see a peer, who offers such an engine. Should there be already such a solution, this would reduce unnecessary parallel work.

(I just read that as "... wiki is polluted by a lot of programmers ..."  Hmm.)
*''Hahahaha!  No, the author wrote "Wiki is '''populated''' by a lot of programmers".''
