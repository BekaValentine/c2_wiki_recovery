Seven "cardinal" sins, not so bad in and of themselves but which could lead you to more serious things.

 Sin        Punishment in Hell                        Animal      Color       ''Dwarf''   ''Castaway''      ''Holiday''

 Pride      broken on the wheel                       Horse       Violet      ''Doc''     ''Professor''     ''4th of July''
 Envy       put in freezing water                     Dog         Green       ''Dopey''   ''Mary Ann''      ''St Patrick's Day''
 Anger      dismembered alive                         Bear        Red         ''Grumpy''  ''Skipper''       ''Halloween''
 Sloth      thrown in snake pits                      Goat        Light Blue  ''Sleepy''  ''Lovey''         ''Daylight Savings''
 Greed      put in cauldrons of boiling oil           Frog        Yellow      ''Sneezy''  ''Mr. Howell''    ''Christmas''
 Gluttony   forced to eat rats, toads, and snakes     Pig         Orange      ''Happy''   ''Gilligan''      ''Thanksgiving''
 Lust       smothered in fire and brimstone           Cow         Blue        ''Bashful'' ''Ginger''        ''Valentine's Day''

''What about the sin of sitting around thinking about what's going to happen to folks you dislike in hell?''

Such could be motivated by any of the above.

Whereas the seven heavenly virtues are faith, hope, charity, fortitude, justice, temperance, prudence. 

What are the rewards in Heaven for the SevenHeavenlyVirtues?

It is traditional in the Catholic church to refer to the "Seven Deadly Sins", and the "Seven Cardinal Virtues".
----
Actually, in Christian scripture, "the wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23); all sins tend toward death and are thus deadly.
These are the "Seven Capital Sins", from the Latin caput, "head".  These are classically considered the headwaters of
all other sins.

''What do people think about '''Apathy''' and '''SelfDeceit''', are these not as big as at least Gluttony?''

I think one could make an argument that '''apathy''' is the root of '''sloth''' and that '''SelfDeceit''' may be a special case of '''pride'''.  

And '''Gluttony''' seems a little soft as far as great sins of man go ... but then again, '''Unbridled Consumption''' is a pretty ugly thing in any form.

{Yeah, gluttony isn't just about eating too much.  It's also about SUV drivers.}
