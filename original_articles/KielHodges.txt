I work as a developer for a buzzword-compliant Internet startup called VerticalOne (Java, EnterpriseJavaBeans, XML).

I was previously at Bass Hotels & Resorts. Projects there included:

	* Data-moving and -massaging applications written in Perl.
	* Supporting a hotel inspection system written in PowerBuilder.
	* Changes and fixes to an association membership system written in VB (was VB3, now VB 5 with a little Java thrown in).
	* A batch script scheduler for Windows NT (and Unix, in theory) written in Java.

That experience taught me that:
	* Perl is OK.
	* Java is really cool.
	* PowerBuilder is pretty lame.
	* VisualBasic is terrible and should be wiped from the face of the earth. YMMV :->

Over the years, I've also wound my way through PL/I, lots of assembler, C, C++, Rexx, Forth and several others. Recently I've been learning a bit of Smalltalk, though I don't have an immediate application for it. It brought back fond memories of working in a ''truly interactive'' programming environment. Great!

Besides computers and software, my interests include BirdWatching, TaiChi, ConversationalTopology and my family.

Hi Kiel, I made a small change to your code at YouReallyArentGonnaNeedThis I think this most effective
	try {
	        ...
	} catch (Internal''''''Error e) {
  	        throw new Internal''''''Error();
	}
