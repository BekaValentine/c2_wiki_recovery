The standard array type in ComAutomation.
----
'''Of note:'''

	* An entire API exists for creating, reading, and manipulating SafeArray''s''
	* SafeArray''''''s are allocated on the global heap.
	* SafeArray''''''s can be kept alive via a reference counting mechanism much like ComComponent''s''
	* SafeArray''''''s can be multi-dimensional


ToDo: go into more detail about how SafeArray''''''s are allocated and passed around in the ComponentObjectModel

whats the damn holdup
