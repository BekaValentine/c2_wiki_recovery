''Lars, Why are you removing your signature on so many pages? Is it related to GrammarVandal targeting of your sig?''

Like others, and due to the nature of a wiki, LO doesn't seem to use his signature any more, due to the wiki causing continual confusions, mis-attributions, editing and injections into original words, false IP address assumptions from RecentChanges, misquotes, Grammar Vandals, etc.

Deletion of the LO page shall be respected.
