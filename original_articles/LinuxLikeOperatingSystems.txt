EricRaymond used to say that linux was a unix like operating system.  Then the owners of Unix tried to bully him, so he switched to saying that unix was a linux-like operating system.  In this day and age, this seems to make more sense to average people anyway.  I mention unix, they have no clue what I'm talking about.  I mention linux and they have a vague idea.  

In December 2001 ScottMcNealy called Solaris "our implementation of Linux". (http://www.zdnet.com/eweek/stories/general/0,11011,2662720,00.html)
