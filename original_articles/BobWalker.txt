Way back in June of '96 Bob began a new job as a Software Engineer at GemStone Systems, Inc (located in Beaverton Oregon) after completing a stint at FPL and doing many years of OO development at Chubb & Son Inc.

Before becoming a bit-twiddler he worked for a long time in technical theater. Lighting and scenic design, stage electrician/carpentry. Really fun stuff! If you're interested, he'll bend yer ear on it for hours!  It was those computer controlled lighting systems that got him interested in computer technology.

After a stretch at WebMD in 1999/2000 where he was the Technical Director for the first release of http://health.excite.com, and then building some Program Management practices into the chaos, Bob returned to GemStone where he has since been consulting in both GemStone Smalltalk and Java.

Prior to the Great Layoff of '09, Bob was keeping the MagLev Ruby project glued together at GemStone. Bob landed on his feet in Atlanta, where he's currently serving as a GemStone Smalltalk contributor to the ICE Trading Platform at IntercontinentalExchange.

Every now and then he checks in here to update this blurb.
