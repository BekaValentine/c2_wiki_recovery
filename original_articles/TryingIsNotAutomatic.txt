''First of all, do we not automatically try to achieve multiple goals?''

Automation is being deployed to a much higher level than in time past. While machines and Computers can be made to act automatically given certain inputs and interfaces, human beings do not act "automatically". 

''Human beings do act "automatically". If they didn't, they wouldn't act at all. No external entity triggered them to act.''

They depend upon TrainingExperienceAndEducation to be able to react to events and to be prepared for FuturePossibilities. One thing humans are not is Automatons. They can and do react irrationally, emotionally and unexpectedly. 

''That doesn't mean they aren't automatons.''

Effort in an endeavor, especially those with which one has never before been encountered, are not automatic. If one is to be successful in dealing with things, one must purposefully act. This is not automatic, or predominant in humans. Often, the opposite of action is employed. When faced with dilemmas, one often postpones, avoids, or ignores. This can be observed especially among those whose job it is to face such dilemmas. Problems are not easy to deal with and do not have obvious and easy answers. 

TryingIsNotAutomatic, it is rather a decision to employ effort and apply resources to that which is our job or responsibility. 

We need for more humans to "Try" to succeed in facing the challenges of the present age. It will never be "Automatic".
