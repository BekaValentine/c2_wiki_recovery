Karen worked for RetailAspect. I believe she is from Ireland. Yes she really is from Ireland.

Some years ago, it appears she was part of a company that was being coached by KentBeck. I don't know whether she is still at Retail Aspects. Karen later worked for Charles Schwab until May 2011, when, like a Boojum, she softly and silently vanished away.

Retail Aspects is now part of or has become EvantSolutions.
