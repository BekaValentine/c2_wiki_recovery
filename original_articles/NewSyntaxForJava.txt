So the idea is that Java is very powerful language (threads, RMI, excellent libraries), but it has some old (C-like) syntax.
Let us define a new Pythonish syntax for Java which could challenge C# / Python / Ruby / VB-Script ;-).



for example:

 if p > 1 : 
    do-something
    and-something-more
 else (p <= 1): 
    do-something else


<=>

 if (p > 1) {
  do-something;
  and-something-more;
 }
 else {
  assert (p <= 1);
  do-something-else;
 }

Soon I'll have time to present some more detailed approach, but:

1. Python syntax also have some problems and language-depenencies.

2. Jython is much slower.

3. Writing Python with Java classes ignores uniformity and elegancy which are most important. There is a collision between Java style and thinking vs. Python's.

4. Java has a good uniform thinking. The cross-cutting concerns of the language are well built.

Java is a good language and only a candidate. Let's develop a very clean syntax, improve/optimize it, and only then wave it onto a language. Syntax for syntax that is best at clearity and elegancy.
There some theoretically possible implementations like: JSE at http://www.ai.mit.edu/~jrb/jse/index.htm

Please do not expect c/c++ programmers to learn things from the unix world because it's so bloody cryptic. When I see Perl and PHP I SHUDDER!

It's time we start writing code and API's that are readable and understandable!!   ''Here is your lollypop''
