If the PaperPrototype is a slide show then the ''StaticScreens prototype''
is a slide show that runs on a computer with convincing visuals but no interactivity.  Imagine taking snap-shots of a sequence of Windows95 screens as you perform a function and then playing it back.  It has the virtue of being dynamic while the PaperPrototype is static (ironic the names) because it is like a motion picture of the interactivity ... totally canned! --RaySchneider
