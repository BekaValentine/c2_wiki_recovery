I happened to be rereading some of the old traffic about the BackStack approach to managing wiki content, and the idea of creating a RecentReads page occurred to me. It seems blindingly obvious, is there some reason it won't work?

The idea is to maintain RecentReads precisely like RecentChanges, but using the load, rather than store, operation to trigger each entry.

I think I'll try it on my own Wiki's and see how it feels.

''I think you mean http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RecentPages.''
