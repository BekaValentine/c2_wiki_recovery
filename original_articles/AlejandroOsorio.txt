2005-07-02 Hey, looking up my name with some browser, I ran into this page which, long ago, I created.  Cool!  Now, from some time now I own my own web page, so if you want to know more about me, just go to http:www.maoo.biz (It's in spanish, though).

2002-09-12 Last time I edited this page, as follows:

"Hi, wiki world.

From this moment on, I declare myself a new participant of this virtual space. Let's see what comes out of my experience in here.

BTW, and as it's usual in my lifestyle, this page will evolve with time, with no hurry at all. I'm a fervent believer in non-pressured-processes. So try not to get pissed off if there's nothing else to read about me for the moment."
