'''Context:'''

You are building a large complex system which will have many bits of code much of which depends on one another.  You are defining one of MultipleArchitectureViews.

'''Problem:'''

How do you explain the dynamic aspects of the system behavior?

'''Forces:'''

	* It may be hard to understand how a particular piece of software interacts with the rest of the system without having a higher level view. 
	* The DeliveryView of the architecture does not describe the dynamic behavior of the system.



'''Solution:'''

Define a of system interaction view of your system architecture. This TypeModel describes the key objects that exist in the system at runtime and how they interact to produce the overall system behavior. An InteractionDiagram is a good way to describe the interactions between the components.  At the highest level, the components may be the BusinessArchitecture and the TechnicalArchitecture.
