AccuRev was originally founded in 1998 by Damon Poole and associates to provide consulting services to development organizations, particularly those using ClearCase (now part of the IBM Rational suite) who required better process support. AccuRev began shipping commercial software products in 2002 to address the limitations of branch and label software change and configuration management (SCCM) tools with an innovative stream-based architecture and process-centric SCCM product that shares the company name.  see http://www.accurev.com .  Many of the people at the AccuRev company came from a ClearCase background, including its VP of Development, David Jabs, one of the original creators of ClearCase.

Some interesting features:

	* Temporal database which guarantees historical reproducability
	* Efficient network protocol (especially in comparison to ClearCase)
	* Atomic transactions
	* Stream browser technology: graphical representation of development streams and branching topology (See http://www.accurev.com/streambrowser.html)
	* Nice EclipseIde plugin
	* Integrated issue-tracking system
	* Replication for geographically distant teams

AccuWork Issue Tracking (See http://www.accurev.com/issue-tracking.html)
Issue-based and feature-based development are considered best practices in software engineering. With AccuWork, the integrated issue-tracking software included in AccuRev Enterprise, teams can easily create and manage issues, and keep track of the code changes associated with an issue. 
 
Advanced Merge Tracking (See http://www.accurev.com/merge-tracking.html)
File merges are a common and often time-consuming activity in parallel software development. With AccuRev Advanced Merge Tracking, determining which files require merges – and performing the actual merge - is easy. AccuRev Streams assure that the full history of all files participating in a merge is tracked, so that complex merges can be understood at a glance. 

Change Packages (See http://www.accurev.com/change-packages.html)
AccuRev Change Packages are the key to issue-based development and requirements traceability. By creating logical groupings of code changes, Change Packages allow developers and managers to work at the process level, not just at the code level. 

Crosslinks and Symbolic Links (http://www.accurev.com/cross-links-symbolic-links.html)
Component reuse is critical to efficient software development. AccuRev Crosslinks and Symbolic links enable teams to share pre-built components and 3rd party libraries without the need to store these artifacts in multiple locations. 

History Annotation View (http://www.accurev.com/histroy-annotation.html)
The innovative History Annotation view provides developers with a fully annotated view of any source file. Users can view historic versions of files just by dragging the Version Slider. This enables quick comparisons and helps improve the efficiency of code reviews. 

 
Private Workspaces (http://www.accurev.com/private-versioning.html)
By providing fully version controlled private workspaces, AccuRev enables developers to isolate their in-progress code from others without the need to create a separate branch. Developers can perform local check-ins to keep their code safe in the AccuRev repository, and then promote it for inclusion in builds and other automated development processes. 

Security (http://www.accurev.com/security.html)
Enterprises need secure software products, especially when dealing with critical intellectual property such as source code. AccuRev provides enterprise-class security via secure authentication, access control lists for streams and depots, and custom triggers to fine-tune security policy.

Snapshots (http://www.accurev.com/snapshots.html)
Tagging a build is time consuming and costly in legacy SCM systems. With AccuRev Snapshots, code lines can be “labeled” instantaneously to uniquely identify any code line and allow for reproducing builds in the future. This is critical for processes such as continuous integration that require frequent builds from identifiable code lines. 

StreamBrowser (See http://www.accurev.com/streambrowser.html)
The AccuRev StreamBrowser brings the power of streams to the desktop by enabling users to visualize and manage their development process in an easy-to-use platform-independent interface. With simple click, drag and drop operations, users can create and modify streams, merge code between streams, view and port issues between streams, and more. 

Stream Filters
Managing a complex development process with a large number of code lines and releases can be challenging. With AccuRev Stream Filters, users can tailor their view of the AccuRev Stream hierarchy to see just those streams that are of interest to them improving productivity and scalability. 

TimeSafe Architecture & Sarbanes Oxley
Unlike legacy SCM systems, where it is easy to remove code, AccuRev employs the TimeSafe® Architecture. By utilizing an append-only database and atomic transactions, AccuRev assures that a consistent and immutable audit trail is preserved for all operations. This makes audits and regulatory compliance fact-based and safe. 

Version Control
AccuRev SCM includes an advanced version control solution that delivers both core version control functionality plus sophisticated graphical configuration and codeline management. The AccuRev Stream architecture enables developers to safely version in-progress code and store it in private workspaces, or share it with other team members. 

Web Interface
With highly distributed teams, wireless laptops and telecommuting pervasive in the world today, the AccuRev Web User Interface helps remote users gain the power of AccuRev via a standard web browser. Users can browse streams, perform code reviews and even download copies of source files from anywhere on the globe.
