AtLarge is a term used to describe the collective group of "members" of the ICANN@Large program (http://members.icann.org), which currently elects 5 people to the board of Directors of ICANN. These 5 people are from 5 distinct regions of the globe, divided by ICANN to keep regional diversity among board members.



ICANN has tried to kill the AtLarge so it is trying to reform at http://www.icannatlarge.com

''The nascent concept of the body politic of the entire universe. The single governing organization over every living particle on the surface of any planet anywhere who learned to bang the rocks together.''

Is there any justification at all for regions within ICANN policies ?
