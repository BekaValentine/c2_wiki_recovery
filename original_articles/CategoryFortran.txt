''It is interesting that there are 350 pages which contain the word Fortran in different spellings, but only a very few in CategoryFortran.''

A search has found a few pages to add to this category. Many of the mentions are incidental in some other discussions. Some remarks use the phrase ''dusty deck'' to describe Fortran, e.g. one on WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode.
