I've taken some time off from the workplace to be a full-time Mom for a while. See pictures of my son here: http://www.mulveyfamily.com/~ben

Previously, I was a software developer (using Visual C++ and MFC) who worked at Ormec Systems (http://www.ormec.com/) and Dakota Software (http://www.dakotasoft.com/). During that period, I spent some of my time and energy helping folks out on the Microsoft newsgroups (http://communities.microsoft.com/newsgroups/), and was nominated as a Microsoft MVP (http://support.microsoft.com/support/mvp/) for Visual C++.
