** ''Carnegie Mellon University computer scientists have designed a way to safely use multiple programming languages within the same program, enabling programmers to use the language most appropriate for each function while guarding against code injection attacks â€” one of the most severe security threats in Web applications today.''
** ''A research group led by JonathanAldrich, associate professor in the InstituteForSoftwareResearch (ISR), is developing a programming language called Wyvern that makes it possible to construct programs using a variety of targeted, domain-specific languages, such as SQL for querying databases or HTML for constructing Web pages, as sublanguages, rather than writing the entire program using a general purpose language.''
