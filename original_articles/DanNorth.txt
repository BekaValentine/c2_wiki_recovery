Dan North is a coach and programmer with ThoughtWorks. He likes XP because it is indoor work with no heavy lifting. Well ok, some heavy lifting. And sometimes it's outdoors. Ok, he doesn't know why he likes XP. Except that it works.

'''Currently excited about:'''

	* Enablement: how do non-agile organisations become agile?
	* What does agile mean outside of software, in the wider business context? Does it always come back to the values?
	* InversionOfControl - I keep hearing about it, I keep nearly understanding it. Nearly.
