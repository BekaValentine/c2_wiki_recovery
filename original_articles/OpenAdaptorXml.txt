From JeffGrigg:

"Looking at OpenAdaptor. I've been looking for something like this. But I was hoping for an XML solution. Hmmm... Maybe I'll make one."

OpenAdaptor is thoroughly XML-based ''at the edges,'' -- messages in and out are formatted in XML. We've felt for a long time the need to push XML deeper into the middle of the product. One of the benefits we hoped to get from open sourcing was to involve developers in other organizations in extending the product. And, happily, just this sort of work is already emerging from the openadaptor.org community: http://openadaptor.openadaptor.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=121&projectID=34&listId=11. -- BillBarnett

The DataObjects package (which we had before OpenAdaptor development started) is used for internal data messages because it is v lightweight and simple. Libraries like JDOM (which didn't exist until about a year ago and is currently on release 1.0 beta 5) are the most likely candidate for replacement of DataObjects. -- Gary Casey
