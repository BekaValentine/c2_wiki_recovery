HELLO

I am looking for a wiki on beginners' html. Can anyone help?

----
Hi Dave, I have been compiling wikis, and I have not found one on html yet.

check out PublicWikis on the YpsilantiEyeball wiki

''moved from Goate Man.'' Don't ask were I got that Nickname.

Why is there A Question Mark beside Goate Man above?
I am a newbie. Help is wanted!
Hi there!

''The question mark link is because you didn't have an "e" in it, and there is no page yet spelt like that.''
