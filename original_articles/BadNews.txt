The Media is too negative. As a whole, society is too negative. People are generally Good and even BadNews can really be GoodNews.

It all depends where you are standing and what you have invested in.  BadNews for the DotNet framework might be GoodNews for someone who has just spent 5 years mastering J2EE and vice versa.

A huge amount of rage in comp.lang... newsgroups is generated because someone posts some BadNews about your programming environment (because, deep down we are terrified that our skills will become irrelevant) so you lash out and try and prove to yourself it isn't true.

But in general, this sort of BadNews is GoodNews because anyone of any competence (and that is most people) can learn new technical skills at the same level as their old ones and the boundaries of what they can achieve moves forward.
