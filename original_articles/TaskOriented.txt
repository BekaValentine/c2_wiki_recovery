I am High-Task and Low-People oriented.  My wife calls me a natural LoneWolf.  Big social functions are not my CupOfTea.  It takes a lot of emotional energy for me to get to know someone new.  It does not come natually to me, but I've been working on it for a while and am getting better at it.  I've come to realize that ProgrammingMatters only because people matter. -- BrucePennington
