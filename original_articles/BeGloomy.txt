This is the Yin to the Yang of BeCheerful.

I'm a pessimist, so things always turn out better than I expect.

I expect someone will delete this, as it is unquestionably OffTopic.  Why did I create it?  Because I used BeGloomy as a WikiWord on my WikiHomePage and I got tired of seeing the question mark.  I'm very sorry, I should know better, and I won't do it again.  I will say HailWiki three times and go to bed.
