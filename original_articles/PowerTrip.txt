Like how certain people behave here on WikiWiki.  They get on this PowerTrip thing, and think that they are this wiki's almighty ruler and everyone must bow-down to their will.

* Do you mean some people here insist on having EditorialControl over pages (including insistence in repeated creation or deletion)? Please be more specific so we can either support or refute your feelings?
