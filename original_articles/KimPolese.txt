According to http://www.sunworld.com/sunworldonline/swol-07-1995/swol-07-java-2.html Kim Polese is "senior product manager of Java and HotJava". This article is still pointed to by the official Sun history, pointed to by JavaHistory. It ''is'' clearly marked Sun World of July 1995. It's still up there on the Web. It's a fast moving industry we're in isn't it?

Does anyone know which start up Kim Polese is at nowadays?
