From memory (I was taught this 20 years ago now).

The Systems Method (and this may not even be the right name!) involves the following steps
 Determine objectives
 Identify alternatives
 Evaluate and select solution
 Implement solution
 Monitor and review
What I see a lot of is problem definition, based around identifying the symptoms rather than identifying and reviewing the objectives.  Sometimes being clear about the objectives eliminates the problem entirely.
