A commonly found problem. (That was difficult, wasn't it?)

A CommonProblem often masquerades as an AntiPattern, I believe.

The giveaway is that in a CommonProblem the bad situation is described as the ''problem'', in a true AntiPattern it is described as the ''supposed solution''

I see some so-called AntiPattern''''''s where the description is just a problem statement, and when I try to reformulate the description into the AntiPatternTemplate I'm really struggling, because they just don't seem to fit. For example:
	* CornCob
	* BoatAnchor
	* TheGrandOldDukeOfYork
