To some people, the term "agile" implies the opposite of "not agile". I wonder how accepting the business and software development communities would be of the term "alternative" instead?

I'm considering updating our web site and marketing materials to describe our process as being "alternative". Any others considering this?

BTW- AlistairCockburn has already touched on this topic in an excellent paper at http://www.agilealliance.com/articles/articles/ACcitj0102.pdf
