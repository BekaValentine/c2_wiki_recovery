You would think that Hypertext would have fairly recent origin, like say the 60s or 70s. But think again. Hypertext is thought by some to have originated in 1945.  

From VannevarBush's 1945 essay "AsWeMayThink":

	 :	Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important.

Vannevar Bush introduces a concept for handling the rapidly developing information developed during the 2nd World War in the period following it.  His description of the "memex" is amazingly similar to a modern microcomputer and the process he describes for navigation is the forerunner of the modern "browser" (see MemexVision).
