A RubyLanguage WikiEngine.

Features:
* Dependencies are included (.tar.gz version) or managed by the packaging service (RubyGems or RPA). Works with the embedded Ruby WEBrick webserver or with your application as a CGI.

* Wiki packaging. The wiki can be packaged in a portable format that can then be loaded into another Ruwiki instance.
* Authenticatable. Currently implements only GForge-based authentication (internal authentication is not yet started).
* Reference tracking.
* Custom markup code that integrates a lot of HTML. Textile and Markdown to follow.
* Internationalization and localization: BracketStyle WikiWord''''''s in any language, multiple interfaces.
* Three default style templates, easy to add new style templates -- all CSS.
