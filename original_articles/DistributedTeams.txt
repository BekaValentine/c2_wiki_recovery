A distributed (or "dispersed") team is a collection of individuals that work together on a project, each sitting in their own homes. The problems are not quite the same as outsourcing (where conventional teams are separated); or the kind of TeleCommuting where an individual is working from home, but their colleagues are in an office.

There's a website about dispersed team patterns: http://www.fastnloose.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/dad ''[BrokenLink 2006-10-05]'', and about a '''series of workshops''' on the topic.

The topic is also called "DispersedWorking" (using "Dispersed" to distinguish separation of the programmers from separation of the target software).
