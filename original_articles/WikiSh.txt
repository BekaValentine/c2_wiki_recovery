WikiSh is yet another Wiki clone. There are hundreds of clones available written in different programming languages, - mostly written in Perl, PHP and Java. There are even Wiki clones written in the programming language Brainfuck and wiki clones for the famous text editors Emacs and Vim.

The WikiSh is one tiny shell script, using only /bin/sh commands, bin-utils like cat, cut, tr, and sed/awk helpers. It can be used as CGI and as simple commandline tool, as well. Due to its low ram footprint, it can run on the smallest systems. The performance is sufficient. 

So why another clone when there is good software already? Answer: WikiSh is written in /bin/sh (BourneShell) and plain Awk. It is small, it is fast, it is easy and it runs on any Unix machine, even embedded systems (the WikiSh website is running on an embedded system).

Not that there is much need for this, I have to admit, cumbersome approach, but I like getting things done the unusual way.
