HaHaOnlySerious way of describing the common problem that a quickly done version of a library or utility will often have many of the errors and false starts that have been taken out of existing code.

An example is WritingYourOwnParser instead of using either a ParserGenerator or a RegularExpression or two.

Related to the value of LegacyCode versus RewriteCodeFromScratch.
