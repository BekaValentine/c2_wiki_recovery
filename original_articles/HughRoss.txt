Astrophysicist. Head of Reasons to Believe. visit them at http://www.reasons.org.

Believes that everything in science backs up the Biblical version of creation, from the Big Bang forward.
His book, "The Genesis Question" is about this subject.

You can read various articles on issues or listen to his debates with atheists.

What I like about this guy is that he bases everything he does on science and the evidence. He says if a person has a truth claim, the claim must be testable. Let's test it and see if it stands up to scrutiny.
