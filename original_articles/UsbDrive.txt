In 2013, small disk drives of very high capacity (1 to 3 Terabytes) are available which use the USB connections available on computers and other electronic equipment having USB connections.  

* ''Not to be confused with Thumb Drives?''

* Indeed.  This page refers to SSDs or portable hard drives with spinning platters, using so little power that they can be powered by the computer or other device into which they are plugged.

* ''A Thumb Drive is a SSD.''

* True in the sense that SSD means Solid State Drive. However, SSD almost invariably refers to 2.5" and 3.5" hard drive form factors, which do not include thumb drives.

Currently (20130508) a device with the capacity of 2 Tb can be purchased at W''''''alMart for $120. The may be secured elsewhere for greater and lesser costs, but for convenience, the PriceIsRight if you are PressedAndHurried.

The device is very small ( 3 x 4.5 x 0.5 inches (shirt pocket size) )

They are often used either to provide additional storage, archived storage, or for portability and convenient use on several computers or LargeScreenTvs with usb inputs at differing locations. Take your data stuff with you and use with affordable and flexible convenience.

Nothing beats the bandwidth of an SUV stuffed with thumb drives...

''Except a 16-wheeler stuffed with thumb drives''

... and a mighty good memory about what stuff was on which thumb drive! -- I prefer the kind of organization and searching capabilities I can have in a 2Tb pocket size UsbPowered hard-drive (one that spins and hums - letting me know with its little led that it is active and doing stuff. (That's nearly 500 2Gb thumb drives, costing eight to ten times as much )), and it uses only one usb connector!
