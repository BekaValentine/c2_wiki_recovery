I was introduced to Smalltalk at IBM, relatively late in the game, around 1989.  I became the technical lead on the Celestica DACS project but eventually decided I'd had enough of Big Blue, so I left before the awards were handed out.

I did the high-priced Smalltalk consultant thing for a few years.  I got tired of being paid top dollar to have my advice ignored so I started a product company.  Maybe financially a dumb move, but at least I keep my sanity.

My partners and I set out to develop the ultimate OO programming environment (kind of like the great American novel, eh?).  As of today, we've got our first customer's application running in our environment, the LucidaModelingEnvironment.

Well, the product business isn't so lucrative, but that tiny spark of a chance of success is better than being burnt at the stake as an object purist in the OO consultant wars.

Anyhow, I've been using GemStone, VisualWorks and Envy for most of a decade, and I enjoy a good OO debate.

I added the link to DavidBrownAsWell. Maybe the content of this page should moved to, say, DavidBrownAtLucida, and this page should be left with links to the two pages with a brief description of which is which?

(I'm interested in how Wiki deals with name collisions from a theoretical point of view.)
