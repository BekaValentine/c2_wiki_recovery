As shown in the page StatusString, UgLy can be used to display or denote status.

It also can be used in other ways:
* TwoClicks and you are there
* UgLy as sub or super scripts linking to a FootnotePage (wikis allowing html) or as WikiWord prefixes or suffixes as in UgLy.FindPage

Would someone like to explain what this page is about? Is UgLy with weird CaMeLCaSe some sort of technoical term?
