''There is certainly something disfunctional about the discussion of it. I found the actual book first and then this page, which was an orphan until I adopted it and gave it some links.

This page: http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/queue.html has an implementation of a queue in ErlangLanguage. This includes what is termed the '''Okasaki API''' at the bottom of the page which treats a queue as a list. -- JohnFletcher

I have found a lot of ideas in this book and want to label it as a BookStart for me. -- JohnFletcher
