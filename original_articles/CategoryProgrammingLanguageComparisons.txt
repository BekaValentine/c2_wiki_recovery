I'd like to see the category broadened a bit to include "computer languages" in general. "Programming language" may exclude query languages and markup languages for example (although it's a bit nebulous). I'd suggest "category language comparison", but that may imply spoken languages. "Category Computer Language Comparison"? Suggestions?
