VisualSmalltalk is a Smalltalk product now sold and maintained by Cincom.

It was created by a company called Digitalk which then merged with ParcPlace in 1995. After an unsuccessful project to merge VisualSmalltalk with VisualWorks, called Jigsaw, this product was end of life'd in a notorious 'suicide note' by ParcPlace-Digitalk management. However on the sale of the Smalltalk business to Cincom in 1999 a new point release version called VisualSmalltalk 2000 was released by Cincom. Apart from patches no significant development has been done with this product since then.
