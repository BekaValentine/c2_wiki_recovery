A little PolarBear cub says to his Mommy, "Mommy, am I really a full-blooded polar bear?" 

His Mommy says to him, "Well, I'm a polar bear, and your Daddy is a polar bear, and both my parents were polar bears, and all our friends are polar bears, and I met my grandmother once and she was a polar bear. So you probably are a full-blooded polar bear." 

The little PolarBear cub finds his Daddy and asks, "Daddy, am I really a full-blooded polar bear?" 

His Daddy says to him, "Well, I'm a polar bear, and your Mommy is a polar bear, and both my parents were polar bears, and all our friends are polar bears, and we've always told stories about polar bears. So you probably are a full-blooded polar bear." 

So the little PolarBear cub asks his Daddy, "Daddy, then why is it so F***ING COLD??"
