Those users of WikiWikiWeb who are also users of WikiPedia (and who don't wish to be anonymous about this), add this tag to your HomePage.  Also, sign your name here.

If you have a user account on Wikipedia, leave your user name as well (again, only if you want).  If you ''read'' Wikipedia but don't edit it and don't have an account, you can say so as well.

If you have infoboxes on your Wikipedia home page, consider adding the following template:

 {{User C2}}
