from '''HappinessIs'''

Interested in links that discuss counterpoints to the position promoted by this book (JuneZeroFive)

''Why "counterpoints" but no "points" allowed? Sounds like you have an axe to grind. Why not state the points from the book that you want to argue?''

''From the Amazon description, it clearly is about Tibetan Buddhism in particular, which is just one small, comparatively exotic sliver of the dozens of major branches of Buddhism, many of which, for the record, do not believe in reincarnation.''

''A quote: ''Ricard concludes that Buddhism does provide a "science of the mind" that deals with the "basic mechanisms of happiness and suffering."

''That's a reasonable statement about Buddhism across most of its branches, taking the word "science" loosely (e.g. m-w.com sense 2a ": a department of systematized knowledge as an object of study <the science of theology> b : something (as a sport or technique) that may be studied or learned like systematized knowledge <have it down to a science>." -- DougMerritt''
