More importantly, Larry Smith owns a consulting business that specializes in developing and implementing Expert Systems for many companies.  He is also the author of several books, the most recent of which is called "Beyond the Internet".  He is a fantastic Macroeconomic Forecaster who specializes in the tech sector, as his classes are geared for Math and Engineering students at the UniversityOfWaterloo.  He does not have tenure, since he is more of a guest lecturer, and not an actual professor.

He is infamous among the University's students and faculty for being a networking (in the business sense) and economic forecasting guru, and he gives many talks on these subjects to several student societies and clubs.  He also teaches 4th year and graduate level economic courses, and recently joined the faculty for the MastersBusinessEnterpriseAndTechnology. --JoscelynKleingeld
