Omondo EclipseUML is a visual modeling tool, a EclipseUmlPlugin which natively integrates with Eclipse and CVS.

You can generate code from  your model, or generate a model from your code. Very nice. Go to http://www.omondo.de. 
A free of charge version is only available for Eclipse 2.x

The full version has lots of nice features, but is very expensive (around 2000 Euros).
