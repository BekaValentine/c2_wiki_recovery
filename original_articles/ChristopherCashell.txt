I am Christopher Cashell.

When I'm not getting drawn in by the nifiness of WikiWikiWeb's, I'm usually hanging out on the SorceryNet InternetRelayChat Network (http://www.sorcery.net).

You can find more information than you ever wanted to know about me in my journal, here: http://topher.livejournal.com

I'm also currently acting as a developer for the WikkiTikkiTavi WikiEngine.
