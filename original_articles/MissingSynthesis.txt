What is shown in WikiReductionists debate is a ThesisAntithesisSynthesis pattern, with a yet missing synthesis.

Could this missing synthesis be MultipleViewWiki, ChangeManagementAppliedToWiki? 
We want to converge towards minimalist pages, but we cannot agree to do it synchronously, i.e. in one dimension --time. We need more dimensions to retain alternative treatments of a same ''local'' context. On a map of the conceptual space of Wiki, these should be exclusive of each other, i.e. one should be forced to select a view (even implicitly but with the ability to switch). -- MarcGirod
