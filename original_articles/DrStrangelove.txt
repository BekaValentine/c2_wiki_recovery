DrStrangelove (or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb)

One of the great movies. It's a black comedy about the cold war, and it is filled with numerous memorable scenes and characters.

PeterSellers plays three different characters: the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a satirical version of WernherVonBraun); Colonel Mandrake (the very proper English officer who initially discovers the 'accidental' declaration of war), and the A''''''dlaiStevenson-esque President Merkin Muffley.  He was also the original choice for Major "King" Kong, but experienced problems when trying to develop a Texas accent for the character. After Sellers coincidentally broke his leg, Kubrick was forced to find another actor.

"Heck, I reckon you wouldn't even be human bein's if you didn't have some pretty strong personal feelin's about nuclear combat." -- Major K. Kong

Here's a good quote next time one of your programs has a small bug: "I don't think it's quite fair to condemn a whole program because of a single slip-up." -- General "Buck" Turgidson

"Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room." -- President Muffley (after an argument breaks out therein)

Keep an eye out for a very young JamesEarlJones in one of his first films. He's one of the airmen in the SlimPickens' runaway bomber. Makes up for missing out on the part in ToKillaMockingbird.

A must-see, along with TheMouseThatRoared.
