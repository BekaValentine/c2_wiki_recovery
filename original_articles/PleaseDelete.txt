WikiBadge pointing at the next camel word ... sometimes this won't appear as a link. ''E.g.'' Shattered''''''Facets was a mistake, and so carried a Delete''''''Me badge. ShatteredFacet carried/s a Please''''''Delete pointing at ShatteredFacets (though I hope it has been removed by the time you read this).

The page this badge appears on is not to be deleted.

''I don't understand how this is different from putting D''''''eleteMe on the referenced page. The main use for '''that''' seems to be for allowing the BackLink''''''s to refresh before doing the deletion, or to give someone else a chance to see what's happening.  In other cases, do you think "FailingToDo" is relevant? -- MatthewAstley''
