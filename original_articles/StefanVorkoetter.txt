I'm a software developer in Canada, having worked for Waterloo Maple, Aruna, Navtech ('''not''' the one that does maps for one of the on-line map services), and now Maple again. I've also done custom programming on the side since I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 1989 with an MMath degree in Computer Science. I also produce a commercial product, Moto''''''Calc (http://www.motocalc.com), that I sell to electric model airplane enthusiasts.

I've always been interested in various programming methodologies, language design, and so on. I've been programming in CeeLanguage since 1985, CeePlusPlus since 2000, and have also picked up PascalLanguage, OberonLanguage, DelphiLanguage, PerlLanguage, and a few others along the way. (I first got started in programming in IBM's version of BasicLanguage on the 5100 portable computer, way back in 1976.)

My hobbies include building and flying electric model airplanes, flying real airplanes, and running a horse farm (http://www.bluebirdlane.com) with my wife. I also used to write a monthly column for Quiet''''''Flyer magazine. Many of my hobbies are documented on my home page (http://www.stefanv.com), and many of my Quiet''''''Flyer articles appear there too.
