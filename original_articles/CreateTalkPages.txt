Putting discussion at the bottom has not been shown to be a sufficient solution to guide new readers to where the important bits are.

For a given topic which has gathered attention, create a new page with the word "Talk" appended to the title. This will form a standard way to have debate without the content degenerating.

The creator of the original page should curate the content to keep it all integrated.
