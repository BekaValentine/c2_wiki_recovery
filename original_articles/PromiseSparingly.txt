A lot of people tend to over-promise.  They seem to think that that's what people want to hear and so they give it to them.  Unfortunately they then don't follow through and everyone becomes disappointed with them in time.

If you only promise what you can deliver, and YourWordIsYourBond then you will be respected and counted upon and this will improve your reputation.  --RaySchneider
