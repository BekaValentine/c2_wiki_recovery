A "Lone Gunman" in the world of interactive fiction, Mark is a master at promotion through obscurity.  Although readily available to the world at "http://www.ministryofpeace.com/people/mark/if.html", Mark's games are rarely played and known to most as being obtusely complex.  He IS listed, however, in the "Who's Who" of IF authors.  As in "Who the hell is he?".
