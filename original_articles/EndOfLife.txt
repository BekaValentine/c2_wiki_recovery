Last product in a line.'
The product has reached the 'End Of Life' Status, what also means that support is ending or becoming expensive.

For instance, SunOS 4.1.4 was the EOL version of the SunOS line, since SunOS was being replaced by Solaris.

''I heard a rumor that for the EOL of a car body they run stainless steel plates thru the presses. This ruins & therefor retires the press molds, but it produces a gleaming steel car that needs no paint which they then auction off.''

''I never seen one driving around, though...''

I find this difficult to believe - the sale of replacement sheet metal for damaged vehicles is very profitable for the manufacturers.  ''Sure, but still at ''some'' point they must set an EOL.  I mean, you can't still get OEM sheet metal for '57 Chevies, can you?''

Should also be consistent with the DefinitionOfDeath...
