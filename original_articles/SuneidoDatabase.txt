	* '''not''' SQL, uses a relational algebra query language
	* query language includes select, project, join, left outer join, union, difference, intersect, 
	* integrated with SuneidoLanguage to lower ''impedance'' mismatch, same data types, same language for rules and triggers
	* allows multiple ''candidate'' keys, a single ''primary'' key is not required
	* explicit foreign keys, with cascade or block
	* business rules e.g. for derived fields, may be stored or calculated on demand
	* rules automatically determine dependencies and recalculate when dependencies change
	* standalone or '''client-server''' (tcp/ip)
	* add, update, and delete triggers
	* small footprint (executable is roughly 1mb)
	* concurrency
		* fully isolated transactions with commit and rollback
		* ''optimistic'', timestamp based, multi-version
		* read-only transactions see data ''as-of'' their start time
		* read-only transactions (e.g. long running reports) never conflict with other transactions
	* recovery - database can be rolled back to last consistent state after hardware or software crash
	* ''on-line'' backups - use a single read-only transaction to take a ''snapshot'' of the database
	* database is a single file accessed via virtual memory mapping for fast speed
	* fields and records are variable length
	* fields are dynamically typed (like SuneidoLanguage)
	* fields and indexes can be added and removed at any time without ''rebuilding'' data
	* multiple btree indexes
	* sophisticated cost based query optimizer that rearranges queries, chooses strategies, and selects the best index usage
	* '''open source''' under GPL license
	* sample applications, including a complete accounting system (GL, AR, AP) available
