The Chemical Emergency Planning Wiki was hosted by SeanOleary. It was intended to be a collaborative workspace for all to learn about, share, and improve the state of the art in chemical emergency planning, prevention, response, mitigation, and recovery.

''"A Special ThankYou to WardCunningham, the MoinMoin developers, and all the great collaborators that made me believe that Wiki would work for chemical emergency planning."''

It is crtainly prudent for anyone to know about natural and man-made hazards where they live. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has some Web resources for finding about nearby chemical inventories: http://yosemite.epa.gov/oswer/ceppoweb.nsf/content/chemicalsinyourcommunity.htm?opendocument

Note in these days of heightened anxiety about terrorism, convenient online access to the collected information is not available to the public.
