J. E. Fritz, but people call me Fritz.

I work for a large university.  I'm a betwixt-and-between sort of person, never sure if I'm a system administrator or a developer of tools for system administrators. I wander around with a software glue gun (mostly Perl these days), making sure software systems stay up.
