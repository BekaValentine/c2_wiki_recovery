Myers and Briggs used a scheme of Carl Jung's to develop a personality test used for managerial applications : to analyze managerial style and decision-making. 

Jung suggests that people process data about the world in terms of sense or intuition. They make judgments in terms of thought and feelings. 

Depending on which functions are dominant, he identifies four ways of dealing with the world and shaping one's own reality : empiricists (ST) sensing and thinking their way through life with hard facts and logical analysis, SF arrive at decision through facts but in terms of "what feels right".
IT looks for possibilities inherent in a situation, IF pays more attention to values than facts.

I in Jung is N in MyersBriggs.

Jung was convinced that the human psyche is part of a "collective unconsciousness" that transcends the limits of space and time. Many criticize his work as bordering on the occult. 
Others link his concepts to modern physics, Jung dematerialising the human psyche (he was a friend of Einstein).

Most distinctive in Jung's analysis is his emphasis on the role of "archetypes", which is literally "original patterns". At the most basic level archetypes structure thought (and thus give order to the world).
