"Transparent distribution for Java objects via their interfaces."

See the homepage http://eob.sourceforge.net

Maybe this is the way it should be ... separating interfaces from implementation, what will those clever java guys think of next?

    public interface Quote''''''Service {
        Big''''''Decimal getQuote(String symbol);
    }

    public class Default''''''Quote''''''Service implements Quote''''''Service {
        Big''''''Decimal getQuote(String symbol) {
            // whatever.
        }   
    }

Client side - JNDI lookup and a cast to Quote''''''Service... no remote exception stuff.
