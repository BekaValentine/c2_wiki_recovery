RuleAdherence

* Use GoodStyle.
* Old-timers and newcomers can find it very useful to follow what is given as AdviceToNewcomers.
* Remember that this wiki is a place where ideas are reviewed, so consider all SuggestionsForImprovement.
* Be tolerant of those who have not yet learned the value of rules, and who view rules as unneeded restrictions rather than as agents of freedom and growth.
