AntHill is a build management server that ensures a controlled build process and promotes the sharing of knowledge within an organization. AntHill performs a checkout from the source repository of the latest version of a project before every build and tags the repository with a unique build number after every build. AntHill also automatically updates a project intranet site with artifacts from the latest build. AntHill is an extension to the ApacheAnt project and is compatible with version 1.3 and 1.4 of Ant. AntHill is OpenSource and is released under a Mozilla-like license. 


Ant 1.5.1 is now included in the distribution of Anthill

UrbanCode recently released AnthillPro -  AnthillPro adds to the already robust feature set of the open source version of Anthill. Features like the following make AnthillPro easy to use in heterogeneous environments: 

	* '''Use different JDKs to build different projects.''' Some of your projects may require JDK 1.3 to build, while other should be built using JDK 1.4. With AnthillPro, you can build both projects using one Anthill installation.
	* '''Use different classpaths to build different projects.''' Some projects may require JUnit 3.7, while others may require JUnit 3.8 during the build. Anthill Pro provides fine grained control over the classpath used to build any project.
	* '''Robust support for project dependencies.''' - Rebuild all dependent projects with the latest version of a dependency (similar to Apache Gump). - Use the latest versions of dependencies during a project build. Every project can store its latest artifacts (to be reused by other projects) in Anthill's built-in repository.
	* '''Ability to rebuild any previously built version.'''
