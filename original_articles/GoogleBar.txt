The GoogleBar is a sort of personal toolbar for Netscape 7 & MozillaBrowser, providing access to Google functions much as the Google toolbar for MicrosoftInternetExplorer 5+ does, but developed independently of Google. See http://googlebar.mozdev.org/releases.html for release info. 

Contrast with GoogleToolbar.

''Allegedly also has SpyWare functions - can anyone comment?''

I came across this page quite randomly, but to answer the question of whether the Googlebar for Mozilla has spyware features, the answer is no; I've worked on and followed the project along with a handful of other people for a number of years and never seen anything like that put in (the spyware abilities of Google Inc's IE version are limited to pagerank sending the url of every page visited to Google, but the independent mozilla version has not implemented pagerank for legal reasons). If you'd like to look through, the toolbar is 100% open source and all files are available on our website under "source code".
