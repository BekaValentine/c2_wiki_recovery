Don was looking through these web page on Patterns, 
and found 
the discussion of the LinearShuffle algorithm.  
He remarked ...

  It is not hard to write a linear shuffle which produces 
  every possible ordering with an equal probability 
  (assuming a good random number generator).  

and went on to offer the C code to do it.

Don, by the way, is the son of DaveDodson, my mentor.
