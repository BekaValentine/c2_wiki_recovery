TwikiClone has 'variable syntax' (perhaps the same thing as MoinMoin 'macros'?) for inserting generated content into pages.  The list automation comes by way of the search function, which performs a search and formats the result.  I've used this to create pages which automatically include lists of relevant nodes.  Our 'Seattle Office' node has an automatically-updated list of folks who work in Seattle.  Our OfficeLocations list has a list of nodes which refer to office locations.  This function is a little like MediaWiki's curly brace message inclusion feature, but richer, since the reference is updated on demand.
