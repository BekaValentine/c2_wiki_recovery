EmailAddressProtection prevents automated software from harvesting email addresses out of a wiki. When a user requests a page, he/she is shown partially garbled email addresses.

This feature allows users to add their email address to a page without having to fear being overloaded with spam because their email is now publicly available.

Upon clicking on such an address (or on EditThisPage) the user sees a page requesting him/her to check a box and click okay. This verifies that the user is indeed human.

An email address harvester will, however, take the fake email addresses that appear on the page, and even generate some more when it opens a special link on that page. This might seriously mess up a spammers email addressbook, reducing the spammer's efficiency.
