P.S. 

A good introduction to some object-oriented concepts and terms may be found in the publications section of Object Mentor's web site that contains many very good papers by Robert Martin:
  http://www.objectmentor.com

There were some questions about patterns and frameworks.
There are a number of papers available on the "hillside" site at:
  http://www.hillside.net/patterns/papers/
There is a lot of good stuff there but, for starters, you may find these
worthwhile:
	* Jim Coplien:
		* "Software Design Patterns: Common Questions and Answers"

	* Ralph Johnson:
		* "Documenting Frameworks Using Patterns"

	* Kent Beck, Ralph Johnson:
		* "Patterns Generate Architectures"
