The Scrum Study Group Registry (http://scrums.org) is a program of the ScrumAlliance that provides a listing of local study groups for the ScrumProcess, as well as web space and email lists for those groups, and guidance on how to create, organize, and run a successful study group.

There's a Wiki for Study Group leaders and members at http://wiki.scrums.org
