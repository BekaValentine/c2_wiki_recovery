Much has changed since Feb02 when the page was created. For example, in late 04 a product called "Globe''''''Trotter Fusion" has capabilities to connect to various WirelessNetwork''''''s, ThirdGeneration (3G), GeneralPacketRadioService (GSM/GPRS), WiFi, etc. Give it another couple years and one can expect affordable BroadbandWirelessAccess addons to emerge.

In mid 05, the above is already superseded by another product; see http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2005/06/13/sony_ericsson_gc99/.
