You have just subscribed to a mailing list and are receiving messages from existing participants. You want begin participating in the various discussions but you don't know when it's the right time to jump in:

	* You're eager to post your first message to the mailing list.
	* You don't want to jump into the discussion out of context.
	* You like what you see and have established a topical interest.
	* You want to gain credibility with others on the list.

If the list has an archive of previous messages, you could go and read through the archives to try and catch up on what's  already been said. However, either you don't know about the archives, or you don't want to wait to read them before adding your own thoughts into the discussion.

You think you may have some valuable insight to add but you don't know what has already been said in the mailing list and you don't want to make a fool or yourself by posting something that turns out to be wrong, unrelated, or that has already been discussed in great detail. Even if you are very knowledgeable about the subject under discussion, there may still have been previous messages that, had you read them, would drastically alter your view of what is or is not an appropriate response. Reasons for this might involve not only familiarity of what was said, but also of who said it, and why.

'''Therefore:'''

Lurk for about one month or so before posting regularly to a newly subscribed mailing list. If the list is archived, familiarize yourself with the contents of the past month or two before posting. If you simply can't make yourself wait, try replying ''privately'' to a few people's messages (and maybe ask if there is an archive or FAQ for the list while you're at it). That way, if you end up saying something embarrassing at least you did so privately instead of publicly.

Sometimes a message will explicitly ask people to introduce themselves or to give their opinions or feedback  on something. It is typically okay to respond to those (though you might preface your post by mentioning you are a new subscriber). A ''very brief'' message stating you are a new subscriber and asking if there's an FAQ and where it is also acceptable most of the time. But attempting to jump into the middle of a thread, or start up a brand new thread or line of questioning is probably ill-advised unless you're more familiar with the thread's context/background, some of the list's frequent posters, and with the list's FAQ (if it has one).

This gives you time to become better acquainted with the tone and style of the list and to observe what is and is not commonly accepted behavior and commentary. It also gives you a chance to learn whom to watch out for if the list has one or more particularly acerbic/volatile posters.
