Test::Class (http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Class) is a PerlLanguage xUnit TestingFramework. Unlike PerlUnit Test::Class is built on top of Perl's standard PerlTap based testing framework.

An example test class:

  { package MoneyTest;
    use base 'Test::Class';
    use Test::More;
    
    my ( $chf_12, $chf_14, $usd_28 );
    
    sub make_fixtures : Test( setup ) {
        $chf_12 = Money->new( CHF => 12 );
        $chf_14 = Money->new( CHF => 14 );
        $usd_28 = Money->new( USD => 28 );
    }
        
    sub simple_add : Test {
      is_deeply( $chf_12+$chf_14, Money->new( CHF => 26 ) );
    }
    
    sub money_bag : Test {
      is_deeply( $chf_12+$usd_28+$chf_14, Money->new( CHF=>26, USD=>28 ) );
    }
  }

An example test suite:

  use MoneyTest;
  Test::Class->runtests;
  
which would send the following PerlTap output to STDOUT:

  1..2
  ok 1 - money bag
  ok 2 - simple add

(assuming all the tests pass :-)
