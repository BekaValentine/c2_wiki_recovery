A LinkingWord is slightly different from a Hyperlink in that it may represent not a single site, page, or presentation, but a specific subject, or treatment as topic, subtopic or subpage used as an associatedIdea link, or classification.

First used as a substitute for the ill-defined WikiBadge, which has been useful but not well received.

One characteristic of a LinkingWord which makes it different from a normal hyperlink is that it is meant to be used to assemble a group of pages which is more narrowly defined than the more general Category. It might be characterized as a specialInterestClassification constrasted with the generalInterestClassification.
