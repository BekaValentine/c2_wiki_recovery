If you don't like shortening things, making things take up less space, then don't use Acronyms at all. Whenever you are tempted to use them, resist, spell the thing out:
* Instead of using ANSI, use the words that make it up (if you can remember them correctly)

For those who think that Acronyms as links are UgLy, you might attempt making a long Wiki page name. 

But for some of us, Acronyms and forms of abbreviations are very useful, primarily for the reason that they are short, often because they are easy to remember, and sometimes because they are trademarks. But the one characteristic admired above all is that AcronymsAreConcise. 

Shortly the founder and sponsor of this wiki will be adding a book and another Acronym for us to use: FIT.  It is my understanding that it will be available about June 2005.
