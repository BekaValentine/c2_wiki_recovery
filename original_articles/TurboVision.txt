TurboVision is a DOS-based GUI library that Borland developed for Turbo Pascal and Turbo C++.  It can also be used in DOS boxes in Windows. The object and event models are complete enough to be practical, but simpler than the Microsoft designs -- thus easier and quicker to program.

Using newer Pascal compilers such as VirtualPascal (http://www.vpascal.com/news.php), TurboVision code can be compiled in 32-bit mode for 32-bit Windows or OS/2 environments.

The C++ version was released into public domain and is now being developed and distributed under GNU GeneralPublicLicense at http://tvision.sourceforge.net/ .
