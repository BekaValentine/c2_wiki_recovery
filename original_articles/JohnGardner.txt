I am a Management Consultant with a background in Internet Architecture. My first exposure to Smalltalk was in 1984 with the Digitalk Smalltalk/V product. I shifted my focus back to UNIX/C, then SQL, then Java and now I'm revisiting Smalltalk. 

My current interest in Smalltalk is to be able to create prototypes of various architectures (including business processes). I've also introduced patterns into our company (DMR Consulting Group, Inc.) from an architectural perspective.

I like the CRC Cards approach for design, since I typically work with small teams in a JRP/JAD environment. Besides building a catalog of E-Commerce patterns and consulting to clients, I'm currently working on a CRC Modeling Tool which will support what I call an OO/BPR perspective. 

OO/BPR is a technique based upon CRC Cards which focuses upon both business and technology objects and their collaborations. This technique is used in conjunction with a modified version of function points to speed the estimation of project size.
