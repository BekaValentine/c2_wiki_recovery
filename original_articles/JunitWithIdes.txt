In which IDEs does JUnit integrate better, and how better? --RonJeffries

Seems like these links belong here (rather than just the main JUnit page): --DavidRees

	* JunitWithForte - It's easy to use JUnit with Sun's ForteForJava.
	* JunitWithIntellij - Basic but more than adequate - great stacktrace hyperlinks in text mode!
	* JunitWithNetBeans - Support now exists (version 3.3.0 and upwards), it's slick, easy and intuitive.
	* JunitWithKawa - You can run JUnit tests from the KawaIde. (If you really have to.)
	* JunitWithMicrosoftTools - There are some problems using JUnit with Microsoft's SDK 2.01 (implements JDK 1.1.4).
	* JunitWithJbuilder - You can run JUnit tests from BorlandJbuilder.
	* JunitWithVisualAge - Basic support for VisualAge is including in JUnit distribution. See link for gotchas and thoughts.
	* JunitWithEmacs
	* JunitWithEclipse - Sweet, in my opinion.

From what I have seen adding a JUnit command can be done in any IDE that allows you to add custom commands.  Some IDE's have API's which allow for manipulation of the editor. -- ErikMeade
