ScottWalters is in awe of WikiWikiWeb's powers as is ScottWaltersTwo who was surprised 
to find he had done everything listed in Scott's resume! :-) Must be Thursday, I always find
Thursdays are hard to handle.

You may find my homepage at http://www.slowass.net/phaedrus and my resume 
at http://illogics.org. My projects are all ongoing and in various states of
disrepair. Multi User Dungeon, http://www.weehours.net, certainly makes that
list.
Most of my paid work now days is for http://www.pariyatti.com.

I'm working on PerlPatternsRepository. Under no circumstance should you
attempt to abbreviate due to linear namespace constraints.

The Perl Design Patterns Wiki is at 
http://wiki.slowass.net/?PerlDesignPatterns. Enjoy.

Forgive the shameless self-linking. If I were interesting, I wouldn't be
hiding in the corner, venturing out only for periodic refills.
