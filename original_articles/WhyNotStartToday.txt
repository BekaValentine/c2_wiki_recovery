History records the words of many who said it couldn't be done.  

It is easier to say: 

* I can't do that now, I am too busy.
* It's too big a task, too much work, and not worth the effort.
* Not now, I'll get to it someday.
* I don't want to do all that preliminary stuff -- the planning, research, the validation, the testing -- I want to get to the fun part right away.

than to say:

* I can do it! 
* I should do it! 
* WhyNotStartToday? 

There are ideas and dreams of things to be done; I have them, you have them. What does it take to make it happen? To be honest, most people say quietly to themselves the words "It can't be done", or "its just to much work" and then just go about their business. It's so much easier to give up on a dream than to make it a reality. 

There's always tomorrow! Sure!

'It's so much easier to give up on a dream than to make it a reality.'

I agree with WhyNotStartToday, but this sentence doesn't seem to reflect the actual reasoning or at least not the actual feeling about NotDoingItNow. To me the reasoning goes more like:

'It's so much easier to let the dream stay a dream, than to discover its harsh reality.'

or more completely:

''It's so much easier to give up on your dream, than to discover how much will be involved in making it real and then committing oneself to that involvement.''
