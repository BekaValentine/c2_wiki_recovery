TidBITS is the oldest continuously running Macintosh online publication. It's one of the best part of the Web if you ask me. But I'm just a happy reader. I'm sure that Adam would describe TidBITS more carefully. 

Yes. But I still appreciate the description above. TidBITS is a free, weekly, electronic newsletter that reports on and analyzes topics of interest to the Macintosh and Internet communities.
