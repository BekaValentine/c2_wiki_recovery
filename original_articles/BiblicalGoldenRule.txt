Treat others as you want to be treated. (New Testament version)
(So... I'm setting an example for you to follow?)

The traditional Jewish version is less prescriptive:
''Do not treat others as you would not have others treat you''
(So... let's not be schmuks, and let's all get through this thing.  OK?)

This rule dates back to Confucius, who managed to reduce it to a single word: Reciprocity.

The hidden assumption, is that the other has the same values system (and therefore wants to be treated the way you want to be treated).  There are many levels to this.
