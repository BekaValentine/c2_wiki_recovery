The flip side of OurWordsNotYours.

I prefer this expression of the idea; OurWordsNotYours sounds a bit confrontational, whereas OurWordsNotMine is selfless (in a vaguely zen sense). -- TomAnderson

It fits the tradition exposed in the Wiki Community, where everyone can participate, but no one can own the expressions offered in a Wiki Exchange. My words and your words have a ring of finality, and can be uncompromising, whereas our words can have a different tone, expressed in the WikiNow.
