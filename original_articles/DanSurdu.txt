One year ago, October 1998, I thought I know something about OOP and especially Smalltalk. Then I've met these guys, DildarMarhas and FrancisTownsend, they made me change my mind. Working with them I got a deep understanding of what Smalltalk is and not only. I had to run fast to catch up with them and somehow I hope I did it well.

This is my way to ThankYou to all of you !
