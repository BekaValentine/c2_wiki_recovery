Deuteranomaly, or is the most common type of so called ColorBlindness. Specifically it is not blindness to any color but a weakness to green. Like most people, they have three channels but their green channel is sifted towards red. This can cause dark green to appear back, red-green color on background combinations to jump out less and reduces distinctions between small hue differences in the red-yellow-green region, but also provdes an advantage in distinguishing shades of yellow, tan and khaki. http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=2202
