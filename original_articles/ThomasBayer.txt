I'm a Programmer working at OsmoticWeb (http://www.osmoticweb.com). My interests are:

	* WebServices
	* REST
	* SemanticWeb and RDF
	* Ruby
	* J2EE architecture 

More about XML and Web Services you can find at my Weblog http://www.thomas-bayer.com

Currently I started a RESTful Web Service at SourceForge. It's a Web Service enabler for relational databases. A List of tables, tables and entities are exposed as REST Web Service. Relations can be followed by XLink. See (http://sqlrest.sourceforge.net/) for more.
