Where has extreme programming failed?

First, what's failure?
	* Team is 'essentially' doing XP practices
	* It's past the release planning game (we're not talking about infeasible projects)
	* Preferably it's had a couple iterations or more

One failure might be: "the software was never able to be brought to a releasable state"; another might be "we started the practices but couldn't sustain them".

I've heard plenty of theoretical arguments about where XP is "out of its zone" e.g., large team, life at risk, distributed team, etc. How about some projects that ''should'' have succeeded but didn't?

See also DefinitionOfProjectFailure, XpFailures

While ExtremeProgrammingFailures and XpFailures may seem like redundant pages, it seems that this page discusses failure to use XP properly, whereas XpFailures highlights projects that used XP but failed.

''Those are genuinely distinct concepts, so they need genuinely distinct names.''

XpFailedProjects, XpFailure. Prune these pages.

Need to split into these areas:

Tried to do XP but didn't do it very well.  No fault of XP that it wasn't whole heartedly applied. (FailedToImplementXp, maybe)

Diligently did XP but the project failed anyway.  Shows a shortcoming of XP. (WhereXpFails, perhaps)
