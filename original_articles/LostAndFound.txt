* I cannot find a topic that listed features of programming languages as if a language could be "designed by filling in a form".
** It sounds like you're looking for either KeyLanguageFeature''''''s or InstantLanguageForm. It's worth noting that FindPage is a useful resource.
** ''That's it! Thanks. Strangely, Bing didn't find it: "site:c2.com instant language form". Seems they don't index titles anymore.''

* I'm looking for a topic something like "sharing objects is difficult" or "inter-app type sharing". It was a long debate.
**''Something like CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing ?''
** That's it! Thanks! But now I forgot why I wanted it :-) I did try searching "Shar", but it returned too many results and that one never clicked during the scan. I need tools to compensate for my tired eyes.
**''Something like glasses?''
** No. They only focus the image, they don't help one read faster or more accurately. I never did have FastEyes, but my brain is losing the ability even further.

* I'm looking for a topic that modeled neurons using relational tables. It gave sample schemas. I tried 25 different Google searches and got nothing. 
** Update: It looks like somebody (perhaps me?) moved it to to TheAdjunct under BrainSchema. Is it okay with WikiZens to move it back? At least my sense of semi-sanity is restored because I knew it existed somewhere with 99.9% confidence.

''Have you looked through CategoryCategory?  Might be something there that might help jog your memory.''

Too many results.
