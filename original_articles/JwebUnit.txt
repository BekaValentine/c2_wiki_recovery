''"jWebUnit is a Java framework that facilitates creation of acceptance tests for web applications. It evolved from a project where we were using HttpUnit and JUnit to create acceptance tests. As the tests were being written, they were continuously refactored to remove duplication and other bad smells in the test code. jWebUnit is the result of these refactorings."''
