Wiki is a great collaboration system, but its UserInterface is primarily text mark-up, which is quick to evolve but slow to learn.  Is the WikiEssence to evolve or is it to create a great system for collaboration?  

If effective collaboration is the goal, then it is worthwhile to explore alternate user interfaces.  Anything can be accomplished with a simple text editor, a powerful markup language, and a dedicated community, but what about the newbies?  More interested in the subject matter than the process, perhaps AlternateWikiInterfaces are a good idea.
