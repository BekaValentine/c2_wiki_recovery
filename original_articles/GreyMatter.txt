Grey Matter is a web site app for blogging and comments. It will allow multiple users provided they are set up by admin.

From GreyMatter's Web site (http://noahgrey.com/greysoft/):

	 :	Greymatter is the original OpenSource WebLogging and journal software. With fully-integrated comments, searching, file uploading and image handling, completely customisable output through  dozens of templates and variables, multiple author support, and many other features�while having  perhaps the simplest installation process and easiest-to-use interface of any program offering this level of functionality�Greymatter permanently raised the bar for weblogging and journaling,  and it remains the program of choice for tens of thousands of people around the world.
