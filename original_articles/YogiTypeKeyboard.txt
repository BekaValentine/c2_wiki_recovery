The YogiType seems to be a vertical keyboard with integrated thumb controlled mouse (and scroll wheel on the other thumb)

Apparently developed in the Netherlands, you type behind the keyboard and there's 
a led for every key on the side facing you that lights up when the key is pressed.

Marketing claims that it improves posture, reduced RSI, etc.
