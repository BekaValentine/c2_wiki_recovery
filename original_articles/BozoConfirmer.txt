A quick and easy-to-use dialog that informs the user that a particular information source is a certifiable bozo. The BozoConfirmer is often driven by the BozoBit, sometimes with hardware support. It is most commonly comprised of a message containing something like "This speaker is a Bozo", and a single "OK" button, although variants containing radio buttons and confidence measures have been reported.

It often appears, in virtual form, during long meetings. Some sources suggest that it occurs more frequently in the presence of upper-level management. Anecdotal reports indicate that shared and concurrent forms of the BozoConfirmer may occur, but these have not been confirmed and may be simply an UrbanLegend.
