Stereotypes are one of extensibility mechanisms in Unified Modeling Language (UML). They are an inbuilt mechanism for logically extending or altering the meaning, display and syntax of a model element.

Graphically, a stereotype is rendered as a name enclosed by guillemets and placed above the name of another element. In some cases the stereotype causes the element to be drawn differently.
