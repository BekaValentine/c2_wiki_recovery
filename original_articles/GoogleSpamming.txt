Google Spammers especially utilize link titles (anchors) for keyword spamming. Wiki's create link titles and parse URL's automatically, so this is very convenient for a spammer. Blogs generally have the ability to insert HTML or hyperlinks into a "comment" post, so search engine spammers use this to increase link popularity and keyword popularity for their web site.
