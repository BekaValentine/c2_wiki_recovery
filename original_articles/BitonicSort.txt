Bitonic sort is an unusual sorting algorithm that has O(n log^n) time complexity. The algorithm is a bit complicated, sorting the input into "bitonic" sequences (roughly speaking, shaped like "\/" or "/\") sections. Its principle advantage is the ease with which it can be implemented on simple highly-parallel processers like GPUs.
