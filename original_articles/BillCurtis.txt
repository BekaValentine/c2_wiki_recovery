I am a programmer, currently living in Oakland, California.  

I have been writing software professionally for about 6 years, a bit longer if you count side work I did while a student.

I do a lot of Java as of late.  I used to do a lot of C, a fair amount of Perl, and a bit of C++.

I am looking for a guy name Jon Peto, who used to live in Northampton, Massachusetts.  If anyone knows him, please let him know.  Nothing urgent, I just want to say hi and find out what he is up to.  Thanks!

I can be reached here:  mailto:bill@bren-again.net.
