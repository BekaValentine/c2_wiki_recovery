Welcome to Wiki. Have you seen CategoryRefactoring ?
Currently MegaWampum merely has a couple of bland sentences. If it used to have "awesome" content, perhaps you could attempt to restore it.

["Welcome to Wiki"? Haven't you both been here for about 1.5 years?? MegaWampum doesn't seem to have ever had any non-trivial content, btw. -- dm]

Since 1998, WardsWiki has been teaching PCP to make MegaWampum, and to leave some well-enough pages alone! --PCP
