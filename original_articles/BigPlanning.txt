Approaches to planning on a big scale cannot be successfully executed without involvement of all levels of the enterprise. When the view of any level of the hierarchy is casual or skeptic, it is clear that planning will be dysfunctional. The above sentiment is one which displays such views. The enterprise in which such views exist about making longer term plans, will likely not need to worry about any long term existing.
