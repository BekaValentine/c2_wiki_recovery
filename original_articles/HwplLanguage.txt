HWPL is a HardwareDescriptionLanguage, which has sometimes been compared with FortranLanguage.

As an example of a 4-bit counter:

 MODULE MAIN {.CLK,.RST,.OUT}: BEGIN
   WIRE {.CLK,.RST};
   REGISTER .OUT(#3);
   LATCH .RST SET .OUT TO -0;
   TRIGGER .CLK SET .OUT TO INC(.OUT) WHEN ~.RST;
 END
