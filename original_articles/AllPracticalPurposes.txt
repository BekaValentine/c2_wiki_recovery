A research psychologist is doing an experiment to test human behavior. In the test setup, there is a room with an incredibly attractive, naked, god-like person opposite the door. The test subject enters, and is required to stay still until a bell rings, every five minutes, at which point they can halve the distance to the goal.

The first test subject is a mathematician. When the setup is explained, the mathematician replies, "Oh, this is ZenosParadox, it's impossible for me to actually reach my target. Forget it."

The second test subject is an engineer, who says, "Sure, let's do it." The interviewer mentions ZenosParadox, to which the reply comes, "Yeah, but even so, I can get close enough for all practical purposes."
