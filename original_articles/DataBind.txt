DataBind is a simple O/R mapping layer which uses reflection to persist arbitrary objects to a relational database.  DataBind configurations are stored in XML configuration files.  Any SQL statement can be used and the results can be mapped to any Java object via reflection.  DataBind supports multiple views of the same object, so that, for example, one version of an object could pull all data for the object while another could only fill one or two fields.  Where clauses are defined using Java code.	DataBind is not restricted to RDBMS but could be used to persist to other forms (such as XML) by implementing the Binder interface.
