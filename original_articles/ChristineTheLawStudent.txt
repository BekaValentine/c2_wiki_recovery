 An intelligent law student Christine
 While studying high on caffeine
 Hunched like a toad
 with the Criminal Code
 Which was rife with injustice obscene
 She was working upon its rewrite
 But it put up a good legal fight
 With words some arcane
 Others merely mundane
 But words unlike lawyers
 don't bite.

Speaking of biting lawyers, a guy walks into a bar with an alligator on a leash and says to the bartender, 'You serve lawyers in this bar?'

The bartender looks nervously at the alligator, and says 'Um, yessir, we certainly do.'

'Good', says the guy. 'I'll have a beer, and I'll have a lawyer for my alligator.'
