Finding the correct function in a huge application.

The steps to build this would be:

* build a huge application with a dynamic multilayer menu that can be used programatically in addition to being used as normal by users.
* identify 20-80 concepts that when combined can be used to distinguish/describe each menu item and function in the application.
* use these to construct a 22 characteristic EndemeSet that covers the concepts either with a single or multiple EndemeCharacteristic''''''s.
* identify the EnDeme for each menu item/page/function using the endeme set as a big long list of items.
* either:
**expose the EndemeSet as a search page in which users can construct EnDeme''''''s to search for the functionality
**identify 10000 English words defined by these EnDeme''''''s that can be used to describe what the user wants to find and provide a keyword box
* use the EnDeme provided by the user/keywords to provide a list of reasonable matches and how to get there and/or pop out the correct menu item from the multilayer menu
