Balding chap who likes cats, beer and food.  Makes a bit of a living in the photography line.  Thinks digital stuff is one of the better technologies to have emerged in the world.  Assumes that this is ephemeral, but likes the idea of open sources/access/government.

Circular stuff can be neat too, though some just think that ChocolateIsBetterThanMen.
