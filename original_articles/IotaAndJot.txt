Iota and Jot are two minimal FunctionalProgrammingLanguage''''''s (combinatorial, rather) aiming to be TuringComplete with the minimal number of symbols. Each of them uses only two symbols (Iota: '''i''' and '''*'''; Jot: '''1''' and '''0'''). Jot makes it particularly easy to obtain the GoedelNumbering for a program.
