Please leave the poem as it currently is; it has a charming WabiSabi beauty. If it does get changed, copes of the original are at http://www.rapid-programming.com/wiki/WikiGnomePoem.html (pseudo-wiki) and http://www.rapid-programming.com/wiki/WikiGnomePoem.txt (raw text). ''I felt it had a bit of Lennon going for it.''

''This poem is a great test for one's inner WikiGnome.  I see the errors and misspellings and my fingers just ''itch'' to clean it up!''

And yet you resist, for beauty's sake. You have passed the first test, grasshopper.
