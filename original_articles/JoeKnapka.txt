I was born and raised in Central PA, USA, down the road from Univeristy Park.
Now I live in a hot, humid place (GA, USA), where I write a lot of
software.

My "real" job is as a systems engineer for a transportation consulting
firm. We do things like signal timing and wide-area traffic management
systems. Mostly I work on expert systems and a product that controls
highway message signs. I've been exposed to all kinds of software
work in the course of my employment, from Java GUI work all the way
down to embedded systems.

My firm is currently (Nov-1998) working to establish a rigorous (SEI level 3)
software development process. Growing pains are rampant. We're already
starting to see some benefits, though.

In my spare time, I've written some free software, including a cellular-
automata environment (basically Conway's Life, with a nice GUI and
some other cool features); check it out at <http://www.mindspring.com/~jknapka>.

I also have a number of <<shock>> non-computer-related hobbies, including
mountain biking and a severe addiction to literature of all kinds, but
particularly good SF and early English lit. And recently I started the process of re-wiring my 100-year-old house. Fun city.
so- anyone can add to this
