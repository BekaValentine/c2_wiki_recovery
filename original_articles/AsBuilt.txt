AsBuilt''''''s are blueprints that documents how a building
was built, ''after'' it is "complete".  They document
what seem like silly details at the time:  the placement of pipes
and ducts in walls, the exact locations of joists, etc.

** the Late, Great Professor NiklausWirth called it incremental program building, or something like that

As Alexander admonishes us, we must build systems by
PiecemealGrowth.
Something built by a MasterPlan can never fully 
attain the QualityWithoutaName.  Even
the blueprints for large, complex buildings cannot 
anticipate most design problems.  That means that
blueprints can't be used as maintenance documentation
for the building.
An AsBuilt serves that purpose.
