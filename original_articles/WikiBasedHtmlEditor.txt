Such an editor would allow:
	* downloading some interlinked pages of an online WikiForum
	* editing them offline {using WikiLikeWysiwyg and ease of linkgenerating}
	* uploading the changed pages as bulk

An even better way {IMHO} would be the capability to download the complete WikiForum for the first time and keep it offline uptodate by later partially downloading the pages of RecentChanges.
