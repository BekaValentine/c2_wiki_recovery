Red fish, blue fish, one fish, two fish ...

How can one begin to describe PrologProgrammers here, there or anywhere?
 ? describe(prologProgrammers).
 no.

Perhaps we can simply list ourselves in a fashion that is self documenting.

	* VicBancroft
	* AalbertTorsius (Well, I used to while on university, I still really love it but :( I'm not payed to do it.)
	* some guy (Written and deployed prolog in a live, commercial system. I just love the conciseness and power of Prolog.)
	* IvanStojic (Wrote Prolog for cash, taught high school and college people about Prolog)

How about, "They are too lazy to implement the solution themselves, so only want to supply the criteria to the machine and have the machine figure out how to actually carry it out." :-)

''Hmm, sounds like they're on to something there ...''

Well, I for one have been guilty at times of spending more effort trying to automate something rather than just buck up and do it by hand.

''Quite. But if someone else had spent the effort to automate it before, you might not have to do it by hand.''
