mailto:cc2.9.cspamgarrod@mamber.net, Chris Garrod is a retired geek, one of TheHumbleProgrammer''''''s,
and was the Minister of Networks at the Institute for Geophysics and Planetary Physics
http://igpp.ucsd.edu/
He wandered in here in late March of Y2K and after he Corrected''''''Typo''''''s successfully, he became hooked on wiki.
Later that year, the OperatingSystem PlanNineFromBellLabs was released as OpenSource!
Both vie for his attention.
Plan9 often gets the lion's share.

20090822 several of the http://ckg.ucsd.edu/ links below are BrokenLink''''''s due to some conflicts at my former workplace.
Resolution is still not on schedule.
Chris is working to resolve both conflicts.

If you haven't looked at ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap yet, you haven't learned why most of us are here.
It may have kept me from many of my (more than) tangential pages that are not as extreme.

I once resurrected my wiki from a disastrous deletion by a now retired CowOrker.
Most of MyWiki came back online at http://ckg.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/ChrisGarrod, but then I was laid off into retirement, and still lack a website that is online all the time.

20070912 My wiki's most recent upgrade is that it now does TabDelimitedTables,
simply by treating every line with tabs in it to be part of a table.
If a line has the same number of tabs, it's part of the same table.
Look at http://ckg.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/ChrisGarrod?MacMagic, which is the raw /usr/share/file/magic from MacOsX 10.4.10, I did no massaging at all, it's sprinkled with tables and other stuff that ought to look better with a <pre> but did not need it.
Other manufactured tables are at: http://ckg.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/ChrisGarrod?SansNetBlock or 
http://ckg.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/ChrisGarrod?EarthQuakes
or http://ckg.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/ChrisGarrod?RsyncSummaryMonday

You may wonder what the cryptic looking numbers above are.
It's a pattern I have been using since the late 1990s, and with it I am y10k compliant! See http://ckg.ucsd.edu/~garrod/y10k/ -- BrokenLink 

I prefer this format over ISO 8601:1988 since it has less punctuation, and can be parsed as a single number: 20061005.22070807 especially in a 64 bit environment.

I have designed a new pattern, which is as uniquely recognizable as my DateStamp''''''s above:
see if you can guess what this is: 32.82541nw117.22279 ??

''Not a bad pattern at all. It is a geographic coordinate, so precise that I was able to determine the precise location to be a home of an identifiable married couple. The Internet does not provide much privacy.''

My wife probably thinks that it's too precise. Don't tell her. She surfs elsewhere.

---- Your comments are welcomed and occasionally responded to: WikiMailBox
20070302
I did a bunch of refactoring - or just turning blue of DateAndDarwen -- I haven't read them yet, I'm just getting ready to. Other comments are welcome. My refactoring fingers are tyros.
 8/2/2007 = 0.001993
 8-2-07 = -1
 8-2-2007 = -2001
With those delimiters, computers Do''''''The''''''Math. 20070802.2110 ckg

20070808: 8-8-2007=2000 (Of y2k fame) 8-8-07=-7 8-8/7=0 8/8/2007=0.0004982
Tonight JamesGosling lamented the CalendarApi and the complexities that historians demand.
I think my DateStamps are good enough for anything in the UnixEpoch and perhaps another API needs to be invented.

20070817 Computers '''do the math''' when they see delimiters like '''-''' and '''/'''
 8/17/07 = 0.067227
 8/17/2007 = 0.0002344
 8-17-07 = -16
 8-17-2007 = -2016
20080119 another example
 1/19/2008 = 0.0000262
 1-19-08	= -27
 1-19-2008 = -2026
20080209 another example
 2/9/2008 = .0001106
 2-9-2008 = -2015
 2/9/08 = 0.02777777... -- isn't it curious that many often keep the leading zero on the year?
 2-9-08 = -15
 20080328 Do the math: just home from Europe: 28/3=9.33333.....	3/28=0.1071428...
 20080808 BeijingOlympics 8/8/08=0.125 8-8-08=-8 8/8/2008=0.000498
 20080905 Convert Fahrenheit to Centigrade with these 9/5=1.8 5/9=0.55...
 2008-11-07=1990
 2008/11/7=26.078
 11/7/08=0.1964..
 8/11/08=0.09090909... a repeating decimal and a palindromic date if you drop the 0
 2009/1/30 = 66.966...	2009-01-30 = 1978
 2009/07/01 = 287	2009-07-01 = 2001 ArthurC.Clarke isn't that a spooky thing for it to be?
 2009/11/26 = 7.024	2009-11-26 = 1972 Happy Thanksgiving
 2009/12/09 = 18.6 = 2009/09/12
 2010/7/4 = 71.79	2010-7-4 = 1999	7/4/10 = 0.175
 20100704 = 2^5 * 13 * 211 * 229
 July2010 has 4 PrimeDays: 20100709 20100713 20100719 and 20100721 
Let's stop letting computers '''do the math''' when that's not what we intend.
It is a '''pattern''' -- YyyyMmDd.HhMmSs: a point in NonRelativisticTime -- after all, and that's why many of us came here. 
Or what the rest of us are learning still...

20131023 I have a new home computer!  
Moby replaces Minnie.
2013/10/23 = 15.4846

From another pattern: 33nw117 -- LatLon

20100718.094	new wireless network connection being rerouted and built at home.

20101003 ChrisGarrod tried to put this into HelloWorldInManyProgrammingLanguages, but that page kept being reverted by computing-technology.derby.ac.uk. What a deterrent to editing. In my ten years at this wiki, this is the first time my changes have been attacked by a robot.
RecentChanges discourages me from participation here.
HelloWorld in Scala is discussed in several steps on this page: http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/steps.html
 println("Hello, world, from a script!")
----
Chris, the spoofing is so widespread that most regulars don't use the UserName at all. Thank you for the contribution on CliffordAlgebra. I try very hard to concentrate on making some contribution here and ignore as much as possible of the noise. -- JohnFletcher
----
Chris, I have put your contribution of HelloWorld for ScalaLanguage back into HelloWorldInManyProgrammingLanguages in the hope that it will stay there this time. I have not signed it - you may care to do so. My interest in ScalaLanguage has been aroused by the new page DeprecatingTheObserverPattern. -- JohnFletcher
----
Your comments are welcome here, please add them near the bottom. Correct spelling everywhere.
Please annotate your comments with your RealNamesPlease and a DateStamp YyyyMmDd, Thanks!

2013/11/17 = 10.764705 
Slash tells the computer to divide.  

2013-11-17 = 1985
Dash means to subtract.

20131117 Who knew that this DateStamp was a PrimeNumber?  
My mother died this morning.  
Mourning.
Move along, these are not the droids you are looking for...

----
20140113
Dash means subtract:
2014-01-13 = 2000
Slash means divide:
2014/1/13=154.92
1/13/14=0.0055
----
* Chris, did You see my question here?:  http://wikiindex.org/User_talk:ChrisGarrod --ManorainjanHolzapfel 15.10.2014 (now, what will the computer do with dots? ;-)

20141026 not till today.  Looking into it now... Happy Halloween.  Dots?  First dot represents end of integer, decimal portion continues ... second dot breaks the lexer, ends the number, acts like an end of sentence, and perhaps another integer continues.  Your above may lex like:  15.10 and 2014 -- at least you recognized that the 2 was the MostSignificantDigit.

 2014-10-26 = 1978 that was a good year.
 2014/10/26 = 7.75...
 10/26/2014 = 2e-5
 10/26/14     = 0.275
