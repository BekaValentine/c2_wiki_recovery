Reactive Demand Programming (RDP) is a new declarative model of programming with bi-directional, reactive dataflow, continuous demand-driven SideEffect''''''s to control a MultiAgentSystem. RDP is, at essence, a fusion of ObjectOriented and eventless FunctionalReactiveProgramming, where MessagePassing is replaced by an FRP control signal with a corresponding FRP response. RDP was conceived in April 2010 by David Barbour, and has developed considerably since. 

This page contained a discussion from a time when RDP was still very immature, so has been cleared to avoid confusion with RDP as it exists now. A blog to explain and promote RDP is now available at (http://awelonblue.wordpress.com).
