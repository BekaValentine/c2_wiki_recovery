A CodeMasterpiece is a real-world example of the best possible kind of software source code to perform a non-trivial task.  Note that a code masterpiece does not imply a great or even decent user interface; see UserExperienceMasterpiece for that.

The definition is necessarily subjective; it would be nice to see individual thoughts on the matter, as well as some consensus on what software is generally considered to be a masterpiece.
