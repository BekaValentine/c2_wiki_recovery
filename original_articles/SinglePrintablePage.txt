'' An old-fashioned type-written page using Pica type was from TopToBottom 66 lines - '' DoingStuff.DonaldNoyes.20141020

 Using this arbitrary size for a style in a WikiPageWritingConcept might be a GoodThing
  for certain of the pages I write here and perhaps for others as well
  particularly those acting as summaries and condensations - such as 
   my own HomePage : DonaldNoyes - Initiated as a practice 20141020
   
 The scheme
  would limit the number of lines included within a page to be about 50 (plus or minus a few)
 This would enable 
  the PrintingOnPaper of the particular page suitable for insertion in a book
  ThreeRingNotebook - for easy and quick reference and the addition of new notes ( DontLoseGoodIdeas )

 Some pages, often serving only as a battle-ground for Rants and Edit-Wars, 
  can grow
   to a length
    not convenient for WikiReading, and also
    difficult to edit and compose using the participants own edit-and-composition medium
   they become unreadable and very difficult to reduce to EasilyRememberedConcepts
 It would be much more likely that pages would be read and understood as ThoughtsIdeasNotions
  if kept short
  and named with IntentionRevealingNames
