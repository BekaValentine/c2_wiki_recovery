JimCoplien gave a talk on the NatureOfOrder to the ChicagoPatternsGroup in August of 1997. BradAppleton took notes on this talk - about 8-10 pages worth - and made them available at http://www.enteract.com/~bradapp/docs/NoNoO.html

Just so people know, this is simply the result of me transcribing notes from someone else talking. I wasn't always able to "keep up" very well, particularly during the description of said properties. Cope was moving through most of them pretty quickly and I did my best, but I don't want people to take the above as any kind of authoritative definition. RichardGabriel has a much nicer set of notes and more extensive presentation on this stuff (I saw him give it at ChiliPLOP'98). --BradAppleton
