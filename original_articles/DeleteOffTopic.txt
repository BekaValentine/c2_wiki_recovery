Hi there!

You've probably come here from a recently created page whose text may soon be deleted, or has already been replaced with this message.

If you created the page, we are sorry, but your content doesn't appear to fit within the topics of this wiki, namely PeopleProjectsAndPatterns in SoftwareDevelopment. Please understand that we mean no harm in deleting your page. In fact, we'd be delighted to have you contribute some on topic pages. Please read WelcomeVisitors for more information about this wiki.

While your content may not fit in here, there are many other PublicWikiForums available. Have a look through the list at PublicWikiForumsCategorized and see if there's an existing wiki that will fit your needs.

Failing that, there are many, many WikiEngines available with which you can run your own wiki. See RunningYourOwnWikiFaq.

If you wish to access the content of the page you created, it can still be accessed for a short time at http://c2.com/wiki/history/'''Name''''''Of''''''Page'''/

Once you've read this page, it would be appreciated if you finished the deletion by replacing the text ''D''''''eleteOffTopic'' with the text ''delete'' on your off topic page.
----
If you're not the person who created the page, please wait at least a full day before seconding this deletion, so that the original poster will have time to see this message. Also consider using DeleteOffTopic yourself when deleting off topic pages; it keeps Wiki a welcoming environment for newcomers who are unfamiliar with the wiki social norms.
