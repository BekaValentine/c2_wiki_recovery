Ahti Kare expect that Ward Cunningham have not known, what he has created, what you can see if jou read his book the Wiki Way.

You have perhaps hear the slogan ''NOKIA connect people''. It's really do so in Finland. It is almost impossible to see a person who don't keep the telephone on his or her ear. But this is only the network. The Wiki is much more, it is ''online database'' as Ward Cunningham says, people can save imformation and make quaries to database. When this is possible for everybody in the whole world, we can proclaim that the Wiki has created ''collective memory'' and the database characterizes ''the knowledge or the herodity of the whole world''. If we look to the future, we can see and imagine some tendencies. The database expands enormous, that is why, we must arrange information by association and at the same time we are processing the information in our brains. So we can say that we have beside of the collective memory, ''collective braincapacity''.
