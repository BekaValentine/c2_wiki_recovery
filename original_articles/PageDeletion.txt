Learn about HowToDeletePages and WhenToDeletePages, but don't DisagreeByDeleting.

----
I would suggest unless we are dealing with spam, or pages created by personalities not previously known to the community, that we consider:
* use IsThisPageOk / IsThisOffTopicPageOk to propose delete of pages, but give time for debate / negotiation. Then consider using the DeleteThisPageSomeTime or DeletedUnlessDefended tags first.
* use RealName when initiating a delete for another person to second
* wait at least one or two days before seconding a delete, it gives a chance for the creator to MoveItElsewhere, other people to disagree with the person initiating the delete, and perhaps time for negotiating differences, etc
** if you are concerned about the delete rolling off recent changes, then it is only a small price to pay to note elsewhere to followup on the page a few days later.
** if the page being deleted is very controversial, meaning strong objections by otherwise reasonable community members, then wait at least a week, or just leave it in the limbo status.
** deleting pages without removing (and fixing) all BackLink''''''s first is  a serious oversight.
