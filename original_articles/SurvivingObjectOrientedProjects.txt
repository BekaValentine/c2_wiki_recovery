* Managing OO project is mostly like managing non-OO projects, even though OO design is completely different....
* Develop in increments, down to running, tested code....  
* Find and fix failing ideas.... 
* Build a habit of delivering.... 
* Stay away from C++ for IT projects...

Amazon's "instant recommendations" service

A good book - even for programmers. --Michael Binzen

Interesting little note about the efficacy of advertising I recently learned.  Amazon highlighted the book for about 3 days on its Computers & Internet page, with a nice review.... the book instantly started selling, eclipsing even UmlDistilled for a few hours or a day.  It jumped to Amazon's top 100 of computer books (#47) that week.  Wow! Did I feel great, loved, rich, famous, etc., etc.  Then the great webby spotlight of fame moved on to its next target, having given me my 3 days of glory.  And now life is back to normal (sure is dark around here).  Quite the experience, exilarating and humbling, in quick succession. -- AlistairCockburn

"Stay away from C++ for IT projects" caught my eye. I know neither CeeLanguage nor CeePlusPlus, but may be forced to learn a little as I am learning DistributedInternetArchitecture and wanting to create some server components. If not C++, what language, VbClassic?

''The best choice depends on your context, of course. What Alistair says is that it is never C++. Bear in mind that the book was written at the time when it was a debatable subject. By now, I would think, it should be pretty obvious to anyone that Java or C#, if not necessarily the best choice, is better for IT apps than C++ in almost all cases. Or do you have a different opinion?''
-- AlexeyVerkhovsky

HorsesForCourses, surely? A lot of people use a mixture of technologies. We use C++, Java, C#, Python, OCaml, Excel and so on. Each has different strengths and weaknesses. Saying "X is better than Y" in the absense of context doesn't convey much information to me.

''As it says, the context is "writing an IT application".''

Now all we have to do is define (constrain) "IT application".

''If your Uncle Fred writes it as a weekend hobby, it's not an "IT application".''
