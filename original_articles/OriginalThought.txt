"''Oh if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now.''" -- BobDylan - ''Brownsville Girl''

This is a very heterological page.

The quote given reinforces that notion! 

''Grelling's paradox'' - Some words refer to themselves: the word ‘short’ is short, and the word ‘common’ is common. Other words do not: the word ‘long’ is not long, and the word ‘banana’ is not a banana. Call these latter words ‘heterological’. Then the question arises: is the word ‘heterological’ itself heterological? It is if it is not, and is not if it is. This is one of the family of semantic paradoxes.
