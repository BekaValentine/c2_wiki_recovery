''In reaction to Microsoft announcing "XP" product line'':

What does that mean to the term XP? Will they have a trademark on it? Will we have to find another name? --HaskoHeinecke

''So, "XP" as they mean it stands for '''eXPerience.'''  Hmmm...''

Hey guys -- '''We''' are the newcomers to the "Extreme" party. There were "Extreme" sports, ExtremeSkateboarding, ExtremeCooking, Extreme everything ... long before there was "ExtremeProgramming". Let's not get so arrogant that we think Microsoft is pointing at US when they choose a name -- we should be so lucky! -- TomStambaugh

That wasn't my point. ''We'' never claimed a trademark on the term, which Microsoft may well choose to do. And they might want to enforce it upon ''us'' consultants, coaches, trainers, authors, etc. while nobody did this to "Extreme" sports, yet. Besides, this is not about the term "Extreme" but about the acronym "XP". --hh

Why don't we just get a trademark on XP as 'a name for a software development methodology'? If MS doesn't have the trademark yet, the XP community certainly has precedent. -- RobHarwood

''The prior art doctrine only applies to patents, not trademarks.'' -- nobody

It's always a matter of money. I don't know how the contesting stage works, but I'll bet it costs money. If you've already got the trademark things are generally a lot easier. -- anon


MS grabbed the following trademarks on January 19, 2001:
 "Microsoft Office XP"
 "Office XP"
 "Windows XP"
Used singularly, "XP" is currently being used in describing jewelry, water squirting toys, building materials, computer peripherals, nutritional supplements, and a medical apparatus. (reference http://www.uspto.gov).

Perhaps Addison Wesley (XP publisher) is in the best position to trademark the XP graphic and contextual use?  I'm not privy to the publishing arrangement between Kent and AW.  --MichaelLeach (not a lawyer :-)

In Norway, there is a new line of no-name brand products called XP (how can a no-name brand have a brand name?).  I have a bag of XP Cornflakes next to my computer at home.  -- JohannesBrodwall
