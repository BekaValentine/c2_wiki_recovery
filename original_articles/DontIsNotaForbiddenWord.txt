Don't is not a forbidden word. (Don't be afraid to use it.)

There are a number of pages which use this word which can be categorized into groups.

This page can be a way of identifying such without creating a category (which was my first impulse). 

While the use of the word "don't" (and other such prohibitive words) sometimes results in generating flame wars, it often has a desired effect in getting at the truth from the truthseekers on different sides. Each expresses solid reasons for their opinions. Of the several pages which fit this category, only a small minority can be classified as flame bait. The majority are those which point out that something doesn't work at all, or is not as good as something else preferred by its author and those who are sympathetic. Often, the question is generated in people's minds, "If it doesn't, then what does and why? These questions over time receive answers. 

Fortunately for us, the majority of the contributions within this wiki are positive, contributory, collaborative, helpful, thoughtful, honest and factual. If you would investigate the use of Dont in WikiPage names, you will probably find the majority are composed of statements of the form: verbDontVerb - where the presenter is offering alternative and often superior ways of accomplishing an objective. While these pages can generate controversy, they usually present honest differences of opinion based on facts and are usually very helpful to those readers who are looking for better ways to do things. 

Another group, having its own page: NounsDontVerb consist of pages where the statement is of a form which clarifies the place of the Noun in the activity described by the verb. As in ArchitectsDontCode. Pages like this are helpful in establishing functionality and clarity.

Perhaps we should change the name of this page to the equivalent imperative DontDontDont (Don't tell people "Don't say Don't").  

''And then the counterarguments should be on the page DontDontDontNot.''
