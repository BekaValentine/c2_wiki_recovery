Hi!
I'm a programmer living in Italy. I am employed as IT Consultant, and I started to work with Java in February 2000. Now, I am experienced in designing middle-tier components and developing server-side technologies. 

I like coding, and exchanging knowledge through internet communities like usenet, jguru and others. I am co-founder - with BrunoBossola and other people - of the JUG Torino located at http://www.jugtorino.it (we are proud of it! :-))

I think WikiWikiWeb is wonderful!

JUG Torino has its wiki now! http://www.jugtorino.it/
