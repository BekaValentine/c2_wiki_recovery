''At Alice's Restaurant... except for Alice.''

Also author of the quaint Motorcycle Song:
        I don't want a pickle,
        Just want to ride on my motorsickle.
        And I don't want a tickle,
        'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorsickle.
        And I don't want to die,
        Just want to ride on my motorcy...cle.
