Refers to Session EnterpriseJavaBeans that maintain no conversational state with the client. Since StatelessSessionBeans have no state (per client), each of them are essentially identical so a small pool of identical StatelessSessionBeans can be used to service a large number of clients.

Contrast with StatefulSessionBean and EntityBean.
