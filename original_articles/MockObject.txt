TimMackinnon, SteveFreeman and PhilipCraig presented a paper at XP2000 on the topic of MockObject''''''s. Similar in idea to stubs (see: MockStubShunt), mock objects take stubs to an extreme and are used to set and verify expectations on interactions with model code. We found that this approach to unit testing has the side effect of making your code conform more to the LawOfDemeter.

A Mock Object
	1 is easily created
	1 is easily set up
	1 is quick
	1 is deterministic
	1 has easily caused behaviour
	1 has no direct user interface
	1 is directly queriable

When I first came across this concept, I immediately thought of the scene from the movie ''Twister'' in which the tornado-chasing team deploys into the tornado a series of aerodynamic balls, each containing complex sensors that recorded the inner workings of the tornado and relayed this data back to their computers. Having read more about Mock Objects, this seems to be a nice visualization. At least it helped me. :)

'''Reasons to mock:'''
	1 real object has non-deterministic behavior
	1 real object is difficult to set up
	1 real object has behavior that is hard to cause (e.g., network error) (similar to 1)
	1 real object is slow
	1 real object has (or is) a UI
	1 test needs to query the object, but the queries are not available in the real object (e.g., "was this callback called?") (This needs a MockObject that has *more* stuff than the real object; the other cases usually require a stub that is far smaller than the real object).
	1 real object acts "normal" most of the time, but once a month (or even less often) it does something "exceptional". We want UnitTest''''''s to make sure the rest of the system does the RightThing whether or not the object is acting "normal" or "exceptional". (Is this the same as #2 ?)
	1 real object does not yet exist

'''Discussion'''
''I will take a somewhat contrary position. All except for the final point and point 2 above are valid boundry conditions which must be dealt with. If the real object is non-deterministic find out why. Either fix it or get it fixed. If it is out of scope, have your software deal with it gracefully. Point 3 is a rehash of point 1. Point 4 should not be an issue, just let it run in a test environment over night. Point 5, I have found ways to test GUIs using Nunit, just call the correct methods after creating an object. Point 6 this is more of an integration test than a unit test (you end up testing 2 or more classes), but call the object that creates the call that creates the callback. Integration tests are useful. Point 7 is once again a rehash of points 1 and 3, software *must* deal gracefully with boundry conditions.''

''My fear is that instead of dealing with what the reality of the situation is you end up dealing with what you wish it was. I have frequently dealt with legacy systems where the inputs have been dirty and unexpected, so I have learned *not* to try to force what I think the situation should be onto my software. It has always bitten me in the past. You must test what you have, not what you want. Please take this as advice from someone with scar tissue.'' PedroLopez

The goal here isn't to idealize boundary conditions away by having deterministic behavior. The goal is to cause the boundary conditions '''more''' frequently (e.g. have a network failure every time) to ensure they are tested.

The goal for using these to deal with nondeterministic objects is to feed the program a known value with a known answer in our tests so we can make sure the result under those conditions is correct, and not simply sensible.

'''''The Paper:'''''

Can you include a description here for the benefit of those people without Adobe Acrobat? I could only find a PDF paper on the subject. -- WillSargent

''There's an HTML copy on http://www.mockobjects.com''

I still can't find a good description of what a MockObject is. This page doesn't have enough information for me to have a good idea (although I'm sure everyone on this page agrees that it's a wonderful idea), and the links included on this page don't work. I see ShuntPattern, but that still doesn't tell me very much unless I'm looking at a database. -- WillSargent

''A MockObject is an object created to stand-in for an object that your code will be collaborating with. Your code can call methods on the MockObject, which will deliver canned results. The MockObject can also examine the arguments passed to it, or can deliver the arguments to your test code to be examined.''

From the XpMailingList:

Jim - I am very surprised to hear that you have found that shunts are making
your code hard to read. At XP2000 we presented a paper on MockObject''''''s (which
are the same as stubs/shunts but taken to the extreme) and one of the things
we noticed was that it made our code more readable, and in fact improved the
design of our code as it conformed to the Law of Demeter quite naturally.

One of the other authors of the paper (Steve Freeman) came to visit our team
at Connextra and I left him with two junior programmers to have a look at
the code (which he had never seen before) and 1 hour later he had spotted a
number of improvements and was able to navigate the design fairly easily
with the help of the others. Part of this is XP - however the other part was
that he recognized the mock objects testing/formatting pattern. Although
Steve didn't look at the entire system - because of the isolated testing that
MockObject''''''s encourages he was able to move to totally separate areas of the
system and comment on them.

A new member of our team (second day at work) who had sat with Steve
commented "My god - I feel so stupid, how can a guy walk off the street, and
just pick up our code so easily". When I explained that he understood
MockObject''''''s practice he was very relieved and the next day he was doing the
same thing as Steve, spotting areas for improvement etc.

MockObject''''''s came from our desire to eliminate getters that we were writing
just so that we could test code. Worse still, the getter exposed data types
that were a lot of work to test because they often lost precision (e.g. a
stream or a string). The inner class technique you have hit upon sounds ok -
but we have found that MockObject''''''s and the way they encourage you to compose
objects to write tests make inner class testing unnecessary.

I'm not sure if this is a helpful comment for you - but thought I should chip in.

-----

I recently heard about someone who uses Java's inner classes to provide a testing interface. This seems like a beautiful idea to me since the testing interface can duck around the business rules of the class's PublicInterface. (Java inner classes can modify private instance data within their enclosing class, in case you didn't know.) This seems to me to be a much simpler approach than shunts -- the only drawback is that now your testing interface is inside your production code.

''I HaveThisPattern; see NestedTestCaseClasses for a description.''

I haven't tried this yet, but I'm seriously considering it. The shunt approach is giving people on my team major headaches when I introduce it to them. And even I, who wrote the whole thing, sometimes get confused as to what goes where and how. Definitely a sign of a troubled design!

''I fail to see how this prevents you from having to use shunts/mocks. NestedTestCaseClasses just buy you the ability to access private data. If I have a method that takes an object as a parameter, it doesn't matter if I have access to the private fields of the class that contains that method, I still have to mock out the parameter object that I'm passing in. The mock objects that you are passing in aren't the objects that you are testing, they are the objects that interact with the object that you are testing. -- JavidJamae''

''I agree, sounds like a troubled design, and if you are having trouble mocking elements of it then the tests are telling you that the code smells. Make things simpler - think of different ways to do things. In our experience good code comes from good tests. -- TimMackinnon'' 

One thing that I seem to be discovering, though, is that "the simplest thing that could possibly work" works much better when you have lots of prior design experience. I think that the "simplest thing" will be much more complex for a newbie than for an expert. Witness my botched first attempt at testable design... When I wrote it, I knew it was too complicated, but it truly was the simplest thing I could think of, and that's how I justified it.

''I stumbled across this old email exchange of mine over a year later. How embarrasing! I've since come to rely on the MockObject pattern extensively. It's one of my most powerful tools for testing.

TammoFreese has developed a fascinating small framework called EasyMock which helps to avoid writing mock classes any longer. You simply specify the mock object within your tests, and the framework will generate a dynamic proxy class behind the scenes.

At AbstraktGmbh, ChristianJunghans has developed the MockCreator, a VisualAgeJava tool that generates MockObject''''''s. As of July 2002, the generated code is usable as a MockObject as well as a dummy. MockCreator is GPL/LGPL-licensed and available for Eclipse 2.0, Visual Age 4.0 and Command line usage (for all the other IDEs). Check for details, download and documentation:

Recently, we discovered a change in our code when using TestFirstDesign and MockObject''''''s together. It seemed that we prefer passing objects as method parameters (i.e. mocks) rather than making references to them part of our object state. ''(Re-engineered with JTogether there are less lines.)''

Does anybody know what I mean? Does anybody care? Do you think it's good or bad? -- DierkKoenig

We also have this pattern. Mock objects tend to drive your classes into a highly compositional design with lots of little pieces and lots of interface surface. I generally regard this as a good thing. -- FrankWestphal

Thanks for the help. We feel that our methods become easier to move around, while there is a tendency in them to become "static" ''(we ususually mark them static if they are not using any object state)''. Now, although we have more lightweight classes and more flexible methods, we feel like leaving the OO route. 
Have you had the same effect? How do you deal with this? -- DierkKoenig

We almost always pass in the collaborators into the constructor, so most of our objects are still good OO citizens and centered around an abstraction. -- FrankWestphal

The logical solution. -- DierkKoenig

This very thing came up today in an JUnit/Mock object class that SteveFreeman and I were giving. There's ample anecdotal evidence that using mock objcts leads to more Demeter-ish code. In the class, for instance, we saw a definite move towards the object passing idioms that Frank and Dierk mention. This lead to a vast improvement to the code produced by some developers with relatively little experience. For instance, they had been writing very procedural code, with lots of logic in the methods. Using Mocks seemed to lead them more towards building networks of objects that do the right thing. -- KeithBraithwaite

I find that the mere act of adopting test-first programming pushes the programmer to write better code (not the tests themselves, the mindset of writing the tests first). If the programmer isn't aware of MockObject''''''s, they're not likely to discover them on their own. If they are aware, then MockObject''''''s become a very powerful tool indeed, but the drive to write better code comes from the UnitTest''''''ing, IMHO. I wonder if there's anyway to test that hypothesis... ;-)

----

I've found a side effect of MockObject''''''s is that most of my methods are public, but I have a lot of private protocols between objects.

MockObject is an application of NullObject. -- BobbyWoolf

That's like saying that StrategyPattern and StatePattern are the same thing. The UML diagrams might be the same, but the intentions are different. One major difference between NullObject and MockObject is that NullObject''''''s are typically used in the application, whereas MockObject''''''s are used primarily for testing, and are not typically deployed.

''Furthermore, my MockObject''''''s typically return real values and track the insert/update/delete statements done to them. I would expect a NullObject to always "do nothing" and "return nothing" -- whatever "nothing" may mean in that context. -- JeffGrigg''

Are people mostly using interfaces to implement MockObject''''''s in Java? I'm finding it's less error-prone than simply inheriting from the real object. But whenever I want to add a method I have to change it in three files: the real object, the interface, and the mock object. I wonder if there's a quicker way.

----

Anyone tried writing mock objects in component oriented application servers (COM+, EJB's, WLE/Tuxedo)? Are you also running into trouble with a LawOfDemeter design conflicting with the design requirements for declarative transaction processing (woe unto you who expose transactional objects to others)? Perhaps my troubles are merely a special case of what happens when you wish to unit test ''with'' the underlying logic and DAO layers, but ''without'' the complications of a live database (which you otherwise must set to a known state before every automatic unit test run: quite a maintenance burden). I'd be interested in any ideas on this, as I'm reluctantly moving towards the view that designing for testing with mock objects has a much too adverse design impact on most kinds of distributed systems. Are mock objects only applicable on the very lowest level, within components? -- PontusGagge

It sounds like you are doing integration testing, rather than unit testing. I've found MockObject''''''s to be most useful when testing individual units (classes, or Python modules) in isolation.

----

In some cases, it's not possible to use an interface and extend MockObject. For example, a class I'm writing extends an application server-defined concrete class in order to use some out-of-the-box functionality like logging methods. When running unit tests, I can't use the actual superclass, as it in turn relies on systems that only exist when running in the container. 

So the solution we've come up with is to write our own mock version of the superclass, and define it in a different classpath (the "mock classpath"). In that class, we implement mock versions of the required methods. Then, when we run the tests, we add the mock classpath to the beginning of the classpath, so the mock object stands in for the real object at test time. Does this seem like a valid solution? How have others dealt with this problem?

For example:

  // Generic''''''Service is defined by the application server
  public class Generic''''''Service {
	public void logError(String errorMessage) {
	...
	}
  }

  public class MyCustomS''''''ervice extends Generic''''''Service {
	public void methodBeingTested() {
	// do something
	// log an error
	logError("something went wrong");
	}
  }

  // mock Generic''''''Service class 
  public class Generic''''''Service extends MockObject {
	public void logError(String errorMessage) {}
  }

''Moved from W''''''hichFactory''

This is probably not a great page name, but I'm starting with a specific problem so I'll describe it in a specific way. I hope this can be generalized, later.

----

'''The situation'''

Various low-level bits of code need to share a connection to a database. These bits can get this connection from a static method, a singleton, or a factory method. In any event, they typically have to know the class to call to get this connection.

But, I want to provide a mock connection for testing purposes. If the low-level classes are calling a particular static method, retrieving a particular singleton, or calling a particular factory method, I can't substitute my mock object.

I've thought of a bunch of different things, but I'm not real happy with any of them. I've asked others here, but not gotten anywhere. (They're doing their testing with real database; I want to isolate my testing from that.)

So, how do you approach this problem?

P.S. My current implementation, to get past AnalysisParalysis, is to have a constructor that takes a factory object, for testing, and a default constructor that uses the normal factory object, for ease in the actual application. I think this has a faint CodeSmell.

''I haven't tried MockObject on a DB yet, but here's something off the top of my head. Create a class called Data''''''Base''''''Accessor, which has a static method getDataBase, which returns an object of abstract class Data''''''Base. Create your real Data''''''Base class as a subclass of Data''''''Base, say Real''''''Data''''''Base for lack of context. Create another (MockObject) database class by subclassing Data''''''Base again, say Mock''''''Data''''''Base. The real one works like the real database, the mock one does whatever you tell it to do for the purposes of the test. Some things you might want the mock to do: Count accesses, hold onto the connection string for later comparison, set up a fake query result which you expect the testee to retrieve, etc.''

That's basically what I'm doing. In fact, I'm using the MockObject project to create the Mock''''''Connection to the database (though I'm thinking about looking into EasyMock as an alternative). This is what my Mock''''''Connection''''''Factory returns, whereas the default connection factory returns a real database connection to the real database. It bothers me that I have a constructor in the production code that is only used for testing, not for the production code. But it bothers me less than the alternatives I considered.

''I have this problem as well. The approach I'm playing with right now is to do the test via a custom ClassLoader, so that when the unit under test tries to find the database class the class loader interferes and substitutes your mock class. An example of this technique can be found here: http://www.jroller.com/page/fdiotalevi/20031112.''

See also MockDatabase.

I'm currently using MockObject''''''s extensively to test a transaction framework. I've resolved the 'constructor' problem by using factories reading the appropriate class from a configuration file.
-- MarkAddleman

----

On another Web page, someone stated that it was a smell to create setters just to be able to inject mock objects (and thereby breaking encapsulation). I last did something "smelly" like that, only I used conditional compilation to keep the setter out of the production code. The method is an accessor to a central, company-wide list of projects. I want to be able to replace it only when testing. I'm still confused if this is too smelly or not. Does anyone have an opinion about that? -- WillemBogaerts

What I'd do in that situation is remove the setter since it's only used for testing. Instead I'd encapsulate all uses of the list of projects behind a method getProjects. Then in the test I'd override that method in an anonymous sub-class and use that for testing. See for more info:
*** http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mocktest.html
-- AdewaleOshineye

----

The technique works just as well in a "stateless" application, such as with asp.net pages, as in any other. As long as you write object oriented code, in which objects collaborate to perform application tasks, mock objects are a good design aid.

----

Any experience using an ObjectMother? -- DavidEscala, PeterSchuh

''Yes. A project I worked on started using the ObjectMother pattern quite extensively. After about four months we decided it ws causing more problems than it solved and started refactoring it out. The biggest issue was that it seemed to encourage constructing quite elaborate stand-in object networks (i.e. one ObjectMother called another, called another, etc.). In most cases, these stand-in networks contained mostly unnecessary code to the object-under-test, which made the test cases less clear (i.e the stand-in objects did not implement just the capabilities needed by the objut-under-test, but included considerable extranous code included by the ObjectMother(s)). Our replacement was a hyper-lightweight concept we called PseudoClasses.'' -- GeoffSobering
----
Isn't Mock Objects duplication or parallel hierarchy?

''No. A mock object implements an interface. You typically don't have a hierarchy of interface types.''

Isn't it danger to use Mock Objects in dynamic typing languages?

''No. Quite the opposite. The Mock Objects technique is easier to apply in dynamically typed languages.''

----
Does anyone have any good methods for doing mock objects in C++? It seems that the typical method would be to use a pure virtual base class / interface, and derive both the real implementation and the mock from it. But what if I can't actually use an interface (the code is too low-level and performance critical, I'd incur much wrath if I started adding runtime overhead for something which is just a debug feature).

* ''Just'' a debug feature? NASA engineers have a saying: "test what you ship and ship what you test". It's that attitude that let them rescue the Mars Rover when it crashed.

While I appreciate your input, you've completely missed my point - adding extra overhead is non-negotiable. Other people set the rules, I just have to follow them. Around here virtual functions are frowned upon, templates are banned and exceptions are taboo. Even namespaces are viewed with mistrust (which is particularly odd given that we all know it has no actual runtime overhead).

On further thought it becomes very apparent that we're basically coding in C with operator overloading (and singletons instead of globals, but thats a rant for another day). So I guess my question becomes, how can you do unit testing and/or mocking of legacy code in a procedural language?

* In short, it is not possible to do that. The long answer is simpler: Having too many consatraints on a set of equations make the set to have no possible solution. Maybe you have too many restrictions, so lifting restrictions is perhaps a good way to avoid having no success.

----
Somewhat re-iterating the last question here; I need to use a MockObject, but I'm struggling with the implimentation a bit. Let's say I'm writting a UnitTest for class Monkey. As part of Monkeys operation, it MUST create an instance of class Banana (ignore the poor analogy).  Banana does something which I don't really want to happen during the unit test.

Obviously I need to write a Mock implimentation of Banana, and theres two ways I've tried this:
* Create an interface for Banana, and have Banana and Mock''''''Banana inherit from it: I find this a little smelly because it imposes a vtable on Banana where it is absolutely not required. Further to that it means I have 3 copies of the same interface, this seems to violate OnceAndOnlyOnce.
* Instead of linking against banana.o, link against mockbanana.o which impliments exactly the same functions in stub/mock form. I like this way even less because it imposes Mock''''''Banana on the entire program. In other words Monkey must be tested in isolation from everything else.

The first way appears to be the nicest, however it doesnt work in this situation. Monkey constructs a Banana, not a Mock''''''Banana. Therefore, the only way it could work is if I made a Banana''''''Factory, that would construct either a Banana or a Mock''''''Banana. This is yet more superfluous code to impose on the program, and it also affects the runtime behaviour of Monkey.

Is there a correct way to do this? - MikeAinsworth

''It's difficult with the analogy to see why Monkey should at all be responsible for Banana's construction. If Banana is too "heavy" to be used during a unit test, that would imply to me that it should be inheriting from an interface.  It's a conclusion based off very little information (none) on what Monkey and Banana are actually doing. That being said, worrying about vtables and superfluous code is nonsense. Testable code does not come for free.'' --PatrickMcCormick

I have to create a series of Java unit tests for existing classes (no TDD here yet) and what seems natureal to me is to create mocks by hand by creating an interface and making both the real class and the mock class implement said interface.

Obviously I want the mock class and the unit tests to stay in different jar files than the real code so that I don't release unit tests nor mock objects to the customer. Reasonable so far, isn't it?

The only problem I have is that I need a factory to decide if I'm doing a unit test or I'm running production code, so that whenever said object is instantiated, the appropiate object (real or mock) is instantiated. What I really want to test is another object, this one has to be mocked in order to test the other one (that's the theory of mocks).

The problem I have is that the tests classes have access to the real classes, but the real classes can't have access to unit tests or mock objects. Reasonable, isn't it?

And the real classes have to have access to the factories, which have to have access to both the real and the mock objects. So I'm in a conundrum.
