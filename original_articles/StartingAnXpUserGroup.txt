There is a mailing list for people running XP user groups or thinking of starting one. This is a place to share ideas between user groups.

IDEA:  We've had our user group running for 6 months, and we've had lots of fun.  We've had three "formal" presentations by group members on various subjects, and three sessions that ended up being more in the form of a group discussion Q&A. (All our meetings end up like this anyway). Our meeting next month is different in the following ways:

	* A guest speaker from outside, with long-term experience in XP and OO
	* We've asked everyone to RSVP if they plan to attend
	* We've made a more concerted effort to promote it
	* It's at on a different day of the month and week, and generally considered a bad date (Jan 2 2002).

Now, despite the fact that this was firmed up only 2 days before the holidays began, we've already got RSVPs for about twice the number of users to attend. With about 5 days before the event. I'm not sure which characteristic is the one that is "bringing them in", but I intend to ask at the meeting.

Having a wiki, which is a manifestation of XP or vice versa, is definitely a plus in building a Xp User Group. I had great successes having a few seminars at a university (it's chosen because of the computer accessibility) or somewhere every participant (or every pair) can hold a computer to work on a common problem. I bring a problem, and let two or three XP teams solve it independently at the place. In the middle and at the end of the whole development, we show the others how they designed and share their findings, feelings and etc. Occasional seminars such as this one really help in strengthening the group. -- JuneKim
