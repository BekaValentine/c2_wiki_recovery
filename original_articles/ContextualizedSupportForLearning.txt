The vision of the DynaBook is that the computer can be a tool for composing and experiencing dynamic media, for the goal of learning. Creating the Dynabook was the vision that drove the Xerox PARC Learning Research Group who produced the first object-oriented programming language, Smalltalk, and created the first personal computers. AlanKay first described the Dynabook, and DanIngalls, AdeleGoldberg, TedKaehler, and others tried to realize it.
