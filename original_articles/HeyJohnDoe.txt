Described in ForFree, this is an example of a simple notification scheme for people using a Wiki.  Our good friend John Doe would periodically go to the HeyJohnDoe page, click the title, and see a list of all the pages that have that link.  John Doe can then go to pages he hasn't seen (most browsers track this and show visited links in a different color).

It's a simple idea-- maybe something people are already doing here.

I use this with AtisWiki.

ForFree describes how simple systems often solve unanticipated problems. Unfortunately, search in this wiki has been optimized such that the HeyJohnDoe technique won't provide timely notification. Try again tomorrow or use a simpler wiki.
