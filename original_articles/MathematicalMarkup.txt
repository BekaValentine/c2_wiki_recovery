Refers to a way of marking up mathematical formula.  Several examples out there:

* TeX and LaTex provide excellent mathematical markup
* MathMl.

Might it be useful to add some math support to WardsWiki?  Obviously, using quote marks for italics and bold is something that doesn't scale well.  Entering raw MathMl would be a pain; TeX is probably a better model.

Stuff we would need:

* Fonts:  Roman, ''italics'', script, that stylized font with the letter R when representing the real numbers (what is it called)? ''blackboard font''
* Easy access to greek and Hebrew letters (SIGMA, aleph) [and that means the right fonts]
* Easy access to numerous other mathematical symbols (times, right-turnstyle, subset-of) [and that means the right fonts]
* Support for superscripting and subscripting

A quick and dirty solution: allow LaTeX markup, which is processed on the server and included in the page as an image. This is done on other wikis.
