TeamNavanax (http://www.navanax.org) was an ad hoc collection of people led by RobSartin. The team assisted non-profit organizations in creating and maintaining an accessible web presence. We were initially formed to compete in AirAustin, an event run by KnowbilityInc to create accessible web sites for non-profit organizations. We also worked on creating a small JspCustomTags library to make it easier to produce accessible web sites.
