The advantages of this type of meeting

* Can be called to order almost immediately (allowing for decisions and directions to be changed to meet fast-changing scenarios).
* Provides visibility through face-to-face interaction as well as chat (instant messaging) for all to be heard.
* Gives an ability to relate links and transfer files during sessions.
