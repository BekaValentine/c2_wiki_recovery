Hello Ward...we met briefly several months ago at a Triangle Java User's Group meeting where Ken Auer was presenting!

I was introduced to the concept of a Wiki by Don MacQueen of the Washington Smalltalk User's Group, but haven't actually tried one out until now.

I work for the EDS Raleigh Solution Center, doing a variety of things for enterprise type clients. I have just recently been working on an internet e-commerce application for an RTP pre-IPO company.

Ken's talk has me hooked on the idea of wireless & palm based computing, so I've just been fiddling with Pocket Smalltalk for my Palm.

Let's see where this thread may lead...

Steve
