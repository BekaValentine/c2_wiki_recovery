Regarding debates over the "correct" definition of types, with implications that may apply to other definitions also.

I believe the problem is largely caused by the fact that there are multiple different models a programmer can have in their head to model and/or identify "types". What we bicker over is which model is the "right" or the "best". However, ultimately it's a WetWare issue. Further, a head-model doesn't have to be 100% perfect to be useful in our head. We just need to be aware of the exceptions and fuzzy areas in order to adjust. --top
