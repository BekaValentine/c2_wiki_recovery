Token threaded code represents a true ThreeStarProgramming approach towards the interpretation of Forth or other compiled program representations.  Instead of a vector of addresses, representing an open-ended set of virtual instructions, the virtual instructions supported are closed, and typically restricted to less than 256.  For this reason, token-threaded code is often referred to as ByteCode.
