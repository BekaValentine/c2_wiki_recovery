The musical Cats is based on this book.

Quoted in Ballard's banter to Logan and Jessica in the 1976 movie Logan's Run.

The musical was more than "based on" this book, as least as far as script it concerned. ASAIK (or AKAI remember) only four lines in the whole musical did not come unaltered from the book. -- AndrewCates

The book doesn't have a plot (it is just a collection of poems), whereas the musical does, so I suppose the musical is "based on" the book in that it adds something that the book does not possess. 

Oh, and the song Memory (more than four lines!) is not from the book (though it is based on other poems by T S Eliot).
