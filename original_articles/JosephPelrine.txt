Joseph knows more about ENVY than is good for a person. - KentBeck

----

I've been working with Smalltalk, and various incarnations of ENVY, since ca. 1988. I used to assist Kent Beck on the KalivProject, and focus my interests on RelentlessTesting and FixedPriceXp. I'm currently working on the AsdisFourEver project in Berlin.

In my scarce spare time, I write a bit. I used to write a column for the now deceased Smalltalk Report, and I just finished co-authoring a book on ENVY with AlanKnight and AdrianCho. 

I used to be a professional musician, and have even gigged with Kent (but more about that later ;-). You can reach me at mailto:jpelrine@acm.org.
