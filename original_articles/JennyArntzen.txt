I am an artist and educator currently working on a Master degree in Art Education at the University of British Columbia. I completed my Batchelor of Fine Arts degree at Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design in 2003.

My artist practice is working with portrait processes, the study of multiple perspectives of a subject, from which the portrait arises as a composite view. For example, I just finished a portrait series of a local singer-songwriter. For that series, I actually painted two series in tandem, both from the same source documents, a photograph shoot. One series is the set of paintings done as representationally accurate of the photographs as I am capable of; the other is representationally accurate of the blind contour drawing studies I did of the photographs as a way to start to learn what I was looking at.

This means this portrait is actually comprised of 24 paintings. I still have to do the photodocumentation. I'll get them up onto a website for sharing, soon.

I have a blog, where I am documenting my creative process. It is here:

The index page for my work is here:

I'm also putting on a course in creative process, using ICT (information and communication technology) and the art studio as an integrated experience in creative process and idea development. Here is the link to that course proposal:

That's enough for now.
