A 'craftsmanship coach' is a person on each small team who has the following responsibilities –
*Build a consensus of what technical debt means to the team (it may differ somewhat between teams).
*Measure, understand, and make visible the team’s current technical debt using static analysis tools, investigation, and discussion.
*Track the ongoing accrual of debt and, thru instruction and incentives, minimize it.
*Collaborate with the team to build and execute a plan to pay down existing debts over time in a minimally intrusive way.
