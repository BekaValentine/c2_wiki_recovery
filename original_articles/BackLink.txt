If page A links to page B, then a 'back link' would be a link which goes from page B back to page A.

On this wiki, the title of each page works as a back link. Clicking on the title of any page finds all the pages referring to that page. It works for ''any'' wiki page. E.g. to find all pages that link to ''this'' page, click the title at the top of this page.

'''Before you delete a page, please check the B''''''ackLink''''''s and clean them up to avoid creating broken links. Note, however, that there is a BacklinkLag that should be taken into account.'''

If backlinks aren't working for you, see BackLinksBroken, or fix what is broken about it, or wait for gnome to fix it.
* I have found BackLink does not work quickly enough when I check the links for several pages in a roll (different from BacklinkLag). Solution I have found is to use http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?search='''''PageNameH''''''ere'''''

A real eyeopener for the value of backlinks is

Try adding this to a page that you know has links to it:

 <a href="javascript:window.location='http://www.google.com/search?as_lq=' + window.location.href">Backlink</a>
It's sort of an indirect one-to-many backlink, with Google doing the heavy lifting.
