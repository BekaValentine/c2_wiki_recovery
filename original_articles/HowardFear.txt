Signing work here seems to be the right thing to do, so now that I've actually commented in a page, it seems I should have a personal page.

I've been lurking here for many years.  Long enough to remember when
KentBeck and RonJeffries first started posting about ExtremeProgramming.
My passion is creating superior software development teams - which include
not just the programmers, but the testers, writers, and everyone else
who contributes to great software.

My philosophy is simple, effective software development is a product of
culture, skill, and process at the individual, group, and organizational
levels.  As a manager and a change agent, my role is to facilitate
improving them all..
