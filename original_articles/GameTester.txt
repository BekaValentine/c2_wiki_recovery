So you want to be a game tester? Here are some things to consider:

'''Pros:'''
	* Usually get free dinner if you stay past a certain time.
	* Free food on weekends!
	* You get to play a video game all day, and if you're lucky it's fun
	* Good entry level job, possible opportunity for advancement
	* Deep discounts on certain games ($10 for each title at some places)
	* No dress code. You can wear shorts and a t-shirt to work if you feel like it
	* Satisfaction that you found serious crash bugs so the customer doesn't have to
'''Cons:'''
	* Often have to work weekends
	* 70+ hour work week? Sometimes...
	* Lowest position at a game company
	* Pays only a little better than minimum wage
	* Usually no benefits
	* Usually a short term position
	* You have only small amount of input on the game design
	* Enjoy writing code? You won't be needing that here.
	* Internet Access? Sorry, "security" concerns forbid that.

Anyone else have experiences as a game tester? Good ones? Bad? Anyone ever promoted from GameTester to engineering or production? --BlakeMason
