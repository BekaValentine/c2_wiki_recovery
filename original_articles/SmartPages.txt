Since some wikis do not allow ProgrammingInWiki, and since some times one wants to do more than just read text on a page, provisions are made on most wikis for SmartPages (sometimes called SpecialPages).

These are groups which allow the presentation of material not present directly in the text of the page. 

We already have a certain set of pages which exhibit some of the properties of a S''''''martPage, in that they use linking tokens to facilitate displays which are the result of processing, either here on this wiki, or are references to information which exists, or can be processed at other locations. 

Here is a preliminary list of pages and groups of pages on this wiki, about this wiki, which exhibit some of the properties of SmartPages:
* RecentChanges
* NewRecentChanges
* FindPage
* fullSearch (process used through FindPage)
* EditPage
* LikePages
* BackLinks
* VisualTour
* LastEdited
* Page diffs on edit page
* Pages containing CategoryExternalLink
* Pages containing Images from other sites
* Pages containing references to SisterSites  
* Pages containing references to books via I''''''SBNs
* Pages containing references to Sounds, mediaFiles, Presentations, availableDownloads
* Pages references scripts which do certain useful processes as in finding OrphanPages, shortAndLongPageLists, as well as a comprehensive List of all pages on this wiki
* Pages which mention or provide links to externalScripts which process the forementioned listOfPages and/or other information available here and produce desirable output.

In addition, other wikis add some of the following:
* ForwardLinks
* VisitedPages
* AllPages
* WordLists
* ExternalLinks
