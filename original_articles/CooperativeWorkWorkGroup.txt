We're a group of Masters students at the University of Michigan's School of Information (SI) - class of 2004/5. We're all in a course called "ComputerSupportedCooperativeWork" - or, CSCW - with Gary Olson. We've designed a survey to elicit opinions on various aspects of using wikis to support workgroups. 

////
Survey is now ended. Results and some Wiki discussion on the general topic can be found at WikiInTheWorkplace. 
////


We are:

	*YoonkyoungKang 
	*SalenaMalik
	*JasonGeorge
	*TomAllison

We hope you'll take the survey and then come back to WikiInTheWorkplace to discuss the topic more widely. We welcome any feedback - from survey design to expansion on particular questions to topics we don't seem to be considering that we ought to consider.
