A collection of random musings. Streams of Consciousness. 

It is really rather a ThreadedHeap. Have you never done some "pops" on the thought stack to get back to an earlier point in a discussion - only to connect it with the 'dangling' thought bits later?

''I once gave a talk that started for the first half hour as a ramble through apparently tenuously connected ideas, moving from one thought to another as the inspiration took me.  Then I went back through the stack, making a web of connections from the initial thread of the talk.  That's one of the few talks I've given that got exclusively positive feedback.''

Another related thing that can happen is something like TailRecursion: You talk about topics after topics sometimes seeming to go in detail more and more only to in the end come round to your initial topic. Then effectively all the intermediate topics are dropped from the 'stack'.

For more ramblings look at http://chainofthoughts.com - type in a phrase, adds this phrase to the current "cloud" of ideas. Click an idea/topic, takes you to that page. Words/image associations are dynamic, meaning the more you click words/images, the larger they appear to the next visitor. Similar to TailRecursion, you can "broadstroke" a topic, only to come back later and fill ideas in. As the topic grows, other users are diverted to your host of ideas via a "thought stack" on the right.
