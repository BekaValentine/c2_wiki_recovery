I have observed a WikiWiki AntiPattern that I will call FearOfEditingText.

----

A WikiPage contains an out of date reference or a broken URL. You have updated information or a fix of some sort.

''Therefore...''

You append the correct information to the page in the proper location.

''But...''

You have destroyed the WikiNow. There is rarely any point in keeping bad or out of date information on the WikiWikiWeb.

''Instead...''

Be a GoodWikiCitizen and edit the page to remove the incorrect information and replace it with the correct info. This applies even to signed wiki posts.

{Note: a GoodWikiCitizen does ''not'' delete others' material, but moves it to a holding area of some kind with a linked note at the original spot.}
