An effort to collection and organize
existing patterns of organization and
process into a single pattern language,
from which several smaller languages
might be built.
Building on NormKerth's CaterpillarsFate, WardCunningham's Episodes,
JimCoplien's OrganizationalPatterns,
SteveBerczuk's TelemetryPatterns,
MichaelBeedle's BprPatterns, and others,
this effort will attempt to build a taxonomy
of such work.
