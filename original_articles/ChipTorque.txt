ChipTorque causes RAM chips to pop out of their sockets when too many bits have the same BitSpin.  This is the prime reason for using surface mount technologies in RAM.

This is not the reason to keep a BitBucket next to the computer though. Instead build a rampart - it's surrounds the computer and prevents the RAM chips from escaping.
