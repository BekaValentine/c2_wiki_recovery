The most current meeting info is at http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/ChicagoPatterns/ (BrokenLink)

Some time after May 5th, the "wiki" space at uiuc.edu seems to have given way to the "agora" space. Does anyone know anything more about this?

It seems to have been an artifact of RalphJohnson who had (BrokenLink) a a home page at:
* h''''''ttp://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/johnson/
* http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/directory/directory.php?name=johnson
