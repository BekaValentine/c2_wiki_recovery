Evil PerlLanguage poetry written by LarryWall in 1990. It parsed under Perl 3, but not any more, more's the pity.

It is a pity.  One could argue that being able to write poetry in a programming language, is the sign that that language has "evolved" to a point where you can use natural english to program.  The latter is, of course, impractically difficult to realize, because a lot of english sentences can be ambiguous and lots more depend on context for their meaning.  The poems though, are interesting to read in their own right. -- CarlosNsRodrigues
