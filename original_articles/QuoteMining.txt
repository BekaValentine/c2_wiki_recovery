QuoteMining is the action of browsing current writings on a topic, and looking for quotes which will support a certain point of view. Using this method, almost any position can be supported, by deliberately taking the quote out of context to duplicitously show apparent support of the quoted authorities.

This is usually done using Google. Before the Internet, many have done it by browsing journals, magazines, and books.

Well, some authorities in the field obviously hold a different opinion about quote mining: ''Each and every one of these quotes was accurate and truly reflected the opinions of the authors'' [from http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html]
