DeleteObsolete is a WikiTag for pages whose contents are obsolete. It is hoped that pages marked this way could be left for a week or more before seconded for removal by another person.

The use of this tag also means that any backlinks have been removed. 

Examples:
* discussion of recent events that are now not so recent
* pages about web sites or technologies which no longer exist (but consider historical value, since this wiki is also an InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas)
* WikiOnWiki pages spawned in the heat of discussion but no longer of interest
* OffTopic pages which have been moved elsewhere
