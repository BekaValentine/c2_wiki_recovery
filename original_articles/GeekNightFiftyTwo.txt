It's GeekNight again.

Agenda:

We'll be having a .NET (no-Java) night. 

We'll be working (or talking over free beer/curry) on things like the following:
	* NMock, MegaMock
	* Middlegen's WebApp generator (dot-net edition)
	* PicoContainer.Net

What we will .Not be doing :

	* Reminiscing about Java/Smalltalk/Cobol.
	* Training for newbies (sorry!)

Ring Aslak on 07952889441 to get in.

'''Food'''

Martin reports that Pizza is easily come by in the US. Good pizza too. Thus, given the proximity to brick lane and it being the Curry centre of London, we thought we'd actually avail of this delicacy. Perhaps we may even use the crockery that seem to lie unused in the bottom drawer in the kitchen.

Attendees (and curry preference, and whether bringing laptop/notebook):
