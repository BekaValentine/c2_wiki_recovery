Comeau C/C++ compiler attempts to level the playing field across different platforms and compilers.  It takes CeeLanguage/CeePlusPlus source as input, and outputs different C/C++ source that is customized to the platform/compiler in use.  This way, you can write the code once and not have to worry about portability issues that always come up between different compilers.
