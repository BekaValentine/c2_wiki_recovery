'''WeirdX''' (written in Java, long way to go but suprisingly good performance)

'''WinAxe''' (I use an old version of the commercial WinAxe. Works well.)

'''Hummingbird Communications Exceed'''

'''CygWin XFree86'''  There is a CygWin port of XFree86 4.0. Works for me, and the price is right:
''...and it's easy to install and fast... I guess you can't go past the real thing''

'''Xming'''  Even easier to install, Xming is basically cygwin's xfree, but natively compiled using the MinGw tools.  No external depencies, no cygwin1.dll dependencies, standard installer, compatible with cygwin x clients (which goes without saying, but anyway)

'''XDeep 32'''
