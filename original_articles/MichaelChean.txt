Hi:  I came to this page looking for patterns, and stayed to read about xp, and Smalltalk.  
I currently program for a small legal accounting firm in Glendale, CA.  
I've had enough experience with anti-patterns (both my own and others) to suspect that there must be a better way to design systems, and am gratified to find information about patterns and xp.
