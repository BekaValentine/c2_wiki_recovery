Things at the same temperature can enter resonance, making brainwaves sync. Turning that into voicemail is another problem

Brains are naturally at the same temperature. Things at specific temperatures give off a specific heat pattern. The radiant part - gamma & lessor waves kicked up by hot particals shivering off their heat (to lower their ionic bond quantum steps) exit the brain, carrying excess heat, and warm other brains. That's one of the reasons love works. Therefor, brains transfer their magnetic patterns. These may or may not resemble speech, they merely influence other brains.
