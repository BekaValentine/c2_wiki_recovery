DonKnuth recognized computer programming as an art. But can it be a performance art? Don's own LiterateProgramming produces works too long for public reading. Surely the very act of programming takes too long to maintain an audience's interest. But then, maybe not.

I've been working on a program in my spare time for a couple of months. A handful of friends have watched development progress by visiting a web page devoted to the effort. The page is like a journal of the project except that, in the style of wiki, I haven't kept it chronologically.

If the page is a performance, you've already missed the beginning. But the show isn't over. The project is of a nature that will have me tinkering for months or even years. You're welcome to join us or announce a show of your own. -- WardCunningham

I remember in my younger days making a fancy trace in basic which would spit the trace out to another computer. It was quite facinating watching the code fly by on one screen while a full-screen graphic app ran on the other.
