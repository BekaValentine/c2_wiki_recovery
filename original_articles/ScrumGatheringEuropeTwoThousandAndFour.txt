The Scrum Gathering Europe will take place
between April 20th and April 25th, 2004
in beautiful Vienna, Austria. 

The Scrum Gathering is not a conference, but rather a collaborative event, in which individuals with a common mindset meet to discuss and learn from each other in a family-like atmosphere focused on communication, feedback, and collaboration. The Gathering is for everyone, regardless of organizational type and career path. Sessions will be targeted at software developers, project leaders, IT managers, testers, architects, and coaches. The Scrum Gathering is about transforming business goals through active usage of the Scrum methodology and its related processes.
