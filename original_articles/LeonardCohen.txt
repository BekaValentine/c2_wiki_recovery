Canadian poet born in Montreal in 1934, singer, and writer of sometimes funny sometimes sad songs.

"Famous Blue Raincoat" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. So is "Suzanne." Nice stuff. Sometimes funny. Sometimes sad. 

"Amen. Check out Robert Altman's film "Mc''''Cabe and Mrs. Miller." The soundtrack is all Leonard Cohen."

Totally agree as to "Famous Blue Raincoat," love the lines
 treated my woman to a slice of your life/
 and when she came home she was nobody's wife.
Also love "Suzanne".

"...and as covered by Leonard's former back-up singer, Jennifer Warnes, also very beautiful."
