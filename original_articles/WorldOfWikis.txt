This page is intended to provide an entry point for anyone introduced to Wiki by the work on

WikiInTheWorkplace from the CooperativeWorkWorkGroup 

Feel free to just use this list as a "jumping off point" - or, contribute - learn how at StartingPoints. 

The first few times you work with a Wiki you'll probably want the TextFormattingRules and a link to the WikiWikiSandbox to try them out.

''The following categories of Wiki are created to be filled in - please add links, as appropriate:''

'''The Concept:'''

	* StartingPoints
	* SoYaWannaWikiWiki?
	* WikiForDummies
	* TipsForBeginners

'''Workplace Wikis:'''

	* TWiki (TwikiClone) is a widely-used "industry-strength" wiki.
	* Survey (http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=87711184252) says: 50% of respondents use TWiki in the workplace - quite impressive, but still leaving room for a lot of variety - even beyond the massive amount of customizing available with TWiki.

'''Edu Wikis:'''

	* SqueakWiki
	* For a comprehensive (? probably not, but certainly canonical) list of wiki software, see WikiEngines. For information about software with the WikiNature, see WikiWikiClone.

'''Wide World of Wikis:'''

	* PublicWikiForums
	* http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?TourBusMap
	* WikiPedia

'''A Wiki of Your Own:'''

	* PersonalWiki ''(this is more about using Wiki as a PIM than about hosting your own WikiWikiWeb)''

'''The Wiki Book:'''

	* TheWikiWay (GREAT BOOK - really, really lousy CD... almost all of it (the CD) is available on-line in a usable form)
