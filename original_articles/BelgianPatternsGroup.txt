We like to announce the Belgian Patterns Group. If you are interested in joining a group of professionals who share a common interest in patterns as they apply to software architectures, design and organization, please feel invited to join us.  We meet in Brussels, place to be announced on our mailing list.
Our meetings will be in English. Dutch, French and German speaking welcome -- this is Belgium. 
We will meet once a month in Brussels, meeting place and topic to be announced on our mailing list. 

If you would like to communicate about joining this group or propose a subject contact MartineDevos mailto:mdevos@argo.be or YvesCallewaert mailto: yca at acm.org.

Our mailing list can be found on http://www.egroups.com/group/belgianpatternsgroup/info.html {this link isn't valid anymore as eGroups was apparently acquired by Yahoo Groups}
