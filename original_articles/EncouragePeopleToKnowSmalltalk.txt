You're working on a software project where people make use of
ugly development tool in an ugly way. You can't argue the 
ugliness of the tool and the way because your you have very
different experience. So EncouragePeopleToKnow, in this case
SmalltalkLanguage. Immediate result is more convergent experience and
better communication. Appreciated result is development
of better way to use the tool, or possibly another tool considered.
