Eurocentrism is an idea that made sense best about 1825. It makes sense just like globalism makes today. History moves through micro and macro development phases. These might be described as regional and global development phases. The advancement of civilization was driven most strongly by regional distinctions from 1601 until 1825. In micro development ages, subdivisions within a group make development go faster. Many small groups with close interrelations can compete and the subgroups that survive, having greater capabilities, defeat the others. This idea was prominent in Darwin's day, so it was easy for him to notice the effects of microclimates and isolation on rapid species dispersion. He completely missed the effects of globalization on evolution and we have not yet figured out how large ecosystems or global systems evolve as a whole.

In 1825 Western civilization at the time was at its most regional, divided, and exclusive. Within Western civilization, Europe was predominant. Within Europe, Britain and its empire was predominant. Within Britain, England was predominant. Within England, the nobility and the people of great talent (and especially those who had both) were predominant. They worked in close knit circles and developed science, art, politics, literature, and economics at a pace which seems extraordinary today.
