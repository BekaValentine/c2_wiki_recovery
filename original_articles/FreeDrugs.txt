Here is a list of things you can do to experience drug-like effects without actually taking any. The ways proposed here are (mostly) harmless and free!
* Stay awake for a long time. You will eventually hallucinate. (not so harmless)
* Go jogging. Free endorphin.
* Stand up really fast. You will experience a gentle black-out effect.

Any more suggestions?

* ''MentalStateCalledFlow''
* Sex. Love. Violence. Stroking cats. Eating anything. Not eating anything. Thinking. Breathing ...
* Motorcycling. Performance cars. Rollercoasters.

Ever try sleeping? -- DonaldNoyes

''Hugging appropriate people, napping, sleeping (esp. in flannel sheets and pillows) is also a form of FreeDrugs. Dopamine and oxytocin are released, and many more.''

A free high: Take your dog for a good long walk every day (or at least every other day) and you both will have lighter hearts and feel real fine!
