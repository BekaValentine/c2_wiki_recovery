I'm a mathematician and software developer, working at Incipient, Inc.

I tried to get a SwikiWiki going internally in the fall of 1999 at Avid, but ran into trouble with loss of state when power went down.

I had some fun with WikiForBrainstorming, as a parallel to a live brainstorming session, initialized with whiteboard images and transcribed text. I just couldn't get enough people interested, though.
