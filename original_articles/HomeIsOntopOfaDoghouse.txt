When the stress of life and job gives you that programmer's writer's block, just stop and take a break with this classic work by Schultz.
* This is a great PictureBook for the little ones in your life.
* Amazing ability to make you feel better. Every page brings a smile to your face.
* Causes a warm, tingly feeling all over. It is truly timeless.
* Love what it means in the words and how it never makes me sad, but always happy.
* A sweet book, suitable for any age.

This little book is a whole lot more then just about Snoopy, the most famous dog in the world. This book can remind us of "what a home is" and how "special your/a home is", even when it appears totally otherwise.  How this applies to computer programming, is that if we are honest, we often get that "the grass is greener on the other side of the fence" feeling, especially when we have been working long, hard, unrewarding hours (low pay, crappy conditions, etc.).  A home can be the place you sleep, your normal place of work, a particular type of work, etc.  There really is no place like home, and it is hard to do a good job when your heart is not in it.  Often times we just need a little reminder/nudge of just how lucky we really are.

Imperative to read: WikiIsNotWikipedia

''Yeesh, this page keeps coming back up like a bad dinner.  Why is it here?''

Because some idiot thinks WikiWiki is the right place for it, no matter what the community says. He honestly believes that the WikiWiki is meant to be 49% OffTopic, and he wants the biggest possible slice of that 49% pie, and he believes he's entitled to it because he's been around for ten years. If I were to follow his example, I'd create a few dozen pages for each of my fandoms, such as Dresden Files.

Apparently he's also a tyrant gestapo hypocrite. He has often called a 'gestapo' those who would delete his pages, and yet he keeps deleting the content we include that suggest the page is OffTopic. Should we continue deleting his pages with the same prejudice he deletes the portions he doesn't care for? I think so.

''Tip: To keep a marginal page around, not only should you add programmerly context to it (such as the relationship between Woodstock serving as secretary for Snoopy, and the mighty PenBird), and you should consider signing your work.'' --PhlIp
