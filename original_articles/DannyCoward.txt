'''Warning:''' this software engineer was once mentored by NickSimons.  Treat with all due care.

Thanks Richard. I remember quicky working out that making the tea my true path - but Richard filled my head with ideas and I took a detour. Wishing sometimes working in software was about software a little more...

''Danny must have left Objective just about in time to be replaced with the new teaboy, StuartClayman, who they had to promote to software developer as soon as they tasted the tea he made.'' -- LeighCaldwell

Not entirely true. Danny was also mentored by Stuart to some degree technically. He also memorably mentored Stuart on the diplomatic niceties of consulting in the City of London (at Oracle if I remember correctly) on Stuart's first assignment out of the world of academia. Particularly on the need not to swear too loudly in a client's open plan office on first inspecting the Java code you are being asked to use and improve. They were fun times, even if the tea was consistently bad.
