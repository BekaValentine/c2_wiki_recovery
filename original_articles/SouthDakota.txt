The MountRushmore state.  The CenterOfTheNation state (50 states, not 48, eh?)

Home of the BlackHills (spectacular canyon and Indian burial ground).  CusterStatePark (buffalo preserve). JewelCave. The CrazyHorse monument (largest stone-carved monument).  A dozen Native American reservations.

Watch DancesWithWolves (the four-hour extended version).

Spectacular and lonely.  Quiet and open.  Largest city SiouxFalls has 100,000 people.  Good honest people.  Moderately educated and quite wise.  Feel like they're being left behind.  Should take the advice of the RedMan, and just let everyone else... go.

Go to WallDrug.
