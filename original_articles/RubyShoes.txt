WhyTheLuckyStiff already published puns based on "Ruby Slippers", which that illegal alien terrorist Dorothy used to terrorize the innocent wiccans and imperialist short-people of Oz, until her timely deportation.

So the more-pedestrian version of the pun is a good name for PangoTextLibrary & CairoGraphicsLibrary, with all their methods exposed as Ruboid block closures and option hashes!
