'''Thanks David!'''

Thanks for merging the graphical programming language stuff; that was badly needed. -- DougMerritt

''And lots of other ReFactoring as well. -- ScottJohnson''

Thanks for refactoring some Java, C++, and FeatureCreep pages. -- ElizabethWiethoff

''Still waiting for even a small amount of personal background... And perhaps some thoughts on the ActorsModel page about why it is important to know that everything can be reduced to actors...? -- PaulMorrison''

Hi, David. If you'll take a look at WalledGardens you'll notice that the "Isq" pages were rapidly created and abandoned in June 2004. It seems no one feels like integrating them with the rest of the site, and no one feels like renaming them. That's why I deleted the Isq WalledGarden earlier today. Nevertheless, someone else restored it. And here we are! :-) -- ElizabethWiethoff

'''The Object Browser affair'''

David, thanks for all the refs. What language would you recommend for an ObjectBrowser? I've never wanted to make a language and I'm happy stealing when there's something suitable. -- RK

Ok, I'll bite. I know Ocaml has nice OO facilities, and I know it's very fast. But what's this about it being handy for general purpose systems programming? I'd like to learn more about this. -- dm

David, I am going to use S''''''ildaBe as a launching pad for exploration of the subject of C''''''twoBusinessValue. Please accept my apologies if she is associated with you, my "hijacking is temporary" for purposes of kickstarting urgently needed discussions after the edit war. -- dl 07Apr05
