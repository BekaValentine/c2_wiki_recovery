''I met WolfgangSlany at the WikiposiumZeroFive where he presented his TWiki / XP experiences. He is professor at the Technical University of Graz, uses TWiki for teaching software development using XP for hundreds of students each year organized in teams up to size 12. He uses TWiki for years and his essential message is "Twiki is suuuuuper" for this purpose (for organizing programming development at any scale, respectively). -- HelmutLeitner''
