A quintessentially Australian expression. A slightly more robust version of StuffIt (the curse, not the Mac compression program), about on par with ScrewIt, and distinctly lower in offensiveness than EffYouCeeKay It.

Useful for substituting in WarStories for the incredibly longer string of curse words you really said at the time.

''I've heard this plenty often enough in the UK to be sure that, even if it's quintessentially Australian, it's not exclusively Australian.''

Maybe not - but I think the expression "Bugger this for a joke!" (to show frustration or exasperation) is pretty-much Australian.

The Northern UK idiomatic equivalent is "bugger this for a game of soldiers", not sure why.

There are also SodIt and "sod this for a game of soldiers".  This figures given the common basic meaning...

''And to bring it full-circle, "Sod this for a lark" is an Aussie phrase with the same meaning.''

I thought it was a UK expression. Used on almost every page in the DiscWorld books of TerryPratchett 

''Next you'll be telling me Morpork (an Australian bird) is quintissentially British 'cos Pratchett wrote about it.  I think he may actually have visited Australia once or twice :)''

- '''Morepork'''s are New Zealand birds!

''I think you'll find it's 'Bugger this', or 'Buggeremmilleniumhandandshrimp'. :) Anyway, as stated above,it's quintessentially Australian, not exclusively Australian. Certainly the verb 'bugger' is multicultural.''
