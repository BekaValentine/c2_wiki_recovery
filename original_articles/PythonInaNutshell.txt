ISBN 0596001886. A good reference on PythonLanguage by AlexMartelli. I really like the first 10 chapters. The "feel" of Python is something that the author teaches by example. -- JohnSumsion

''Don't forget -- anything that can be put in a nutshell probably belongs there. '''Hmm.'''''

Know of any nutshell big enough to hold 600 pages?

''There must be one -- the book title says so.''

Hilarious. The book, though, is a good example of "no fluff just stuff".
