JavaBusinessIntegration (JBI) is key to Java based ServiceOrientedArchitecture strategies. 
* a statement made by SunMicrosystems. It has gone thru the JavaCommunityProcess (JSR208) and a Jun04 whitepaper can be seen at http://www.sun.com/software/whitepapers/java/business_int_vision.pdf

''JBI defines a standard container in which components from multiple vendors and various integration technologies can interact.''

But it is not (yet?) supported by major JavaPlatform technologies like WebSphere (from IbmCorporation) nor WebLogic (from BEA). And not relevant for BigIron legacy applications, nor found common grounds with the MicrosoftWay. This observation came from ZapThink.
* It is said IBM not interested in multivendor environments, and BEA wants prominence for its solution built on the OpenSource Beehive that it promotes.

OTOH, supporter include Oracle, SAP, WebMethods, Sonic Software, Novell, etc. See http://xml.coverpages.org/JBI-EarlyReview.html

'''EnterpriseServiceBus relationships'''

ESB''''''DavidChappell was quoted by http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1677386,00.asp article:
* ''"JBI will drive the shape of ESBs much like the EJB  spec helped drive the shape of app servers four to five years ago. In short, JBI will provide to ESB and integration what EJB has provided for app servers and business logic,"''

'''JBI framework'''

''Following taken from an article at http://javaboutique.internet.com/articles/bus_int/''

* JBI proposes to eliminate vendor specific integration solutions by defining a standards based Integration framework. The JBI API proposes to have a Standard environment where integration components from multiple vendors will reside and be offered as services to clients. These components provide specific services, which can be combined to form specific integration solutions. The services provided by the JBI are based on WSDL and web services.

* The key components of the Java Business Integration framework are Service Engines (SE), Binding component (BC) and the Normalized message service (NMS).

An analysis of the Jun05 IONA OpenSource Celtix EnterpriseServiceBus announcement (news at http://www.iona.com/pressroom/2005/20050620.htm) can be seen at http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1829547,00.asp

Since IONA supports it, maybe CorbaComponentModel will be the common ground to interop between worlds.

'''Mappings to the platform people love to hate'''

What products and services does this JBI get mapped to, in Microsoft products and technologies? Would it be BizTalk for MicrosoftIndigo?
