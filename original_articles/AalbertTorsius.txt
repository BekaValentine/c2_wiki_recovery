I enjoy reading, especially CyberPunk and other ScienceFiction.

I believe we should all try to FixOurWiki all the time. When coming across something that isn't as it should be, fix it in passing; it's easy enough.

Aalbert, there are other alternatives to RecentChanges. You can lobby for Ward to allow Colin to restart AutoPcn, that way changes in pages of interest to you will be noted. Another way is to use ImplicitTopics or other similar facilities such as the Example at http://donaldr.noyes.com/NysLte/CategorizedChanges.htm | I noticed Nov05 -- DavidLiu  21Nov05
