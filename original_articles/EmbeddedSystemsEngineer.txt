An EmbeddedSystemsEngineer (see FirmwareEngineer) is somebody who may design hardware and/or software for a system solution. This geek has to know the capabilities of the mechanical, electronic, and software components of the system to arrive at a solution. Embedded systems engineers tend to be cross-disciplinarians just to know enough to see the interactions of all the widgets in a system.
