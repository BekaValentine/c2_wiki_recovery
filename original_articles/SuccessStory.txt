Over the years, I posted several personal practices to Wiki.  When I posted them, I used a pattern form, but it didn't feel right.  The technique I was describing had not yet been UsedThreeTimes.  '''So''' I started copying the example of many Wiki contributers by describing personal practices in the form of stories, instead of in the form of PersonalPattern''''''s or ProtoPattern''''''s.  It turned out to be an improvement.
