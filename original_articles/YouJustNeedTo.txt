YouJustNeedTo is a phrase that if heard at an estimation session should trigger AlarmBells.

I mean, estimating software projects is easy, right?

YouJustNeedTo break the the client's request into UserStories and then break your UserStories into DevelopmentTasks.

The tasks should be easy enough to estimate, between you and your team-mates you've done it all before so generating a nice little ball park estimate should spit out painlessly to the delight of the ProductOwner, and the UserStories should slip effortless into the ProductBacklog where they will be ready for snapping up at a Sprint near you.

I mean, the business just wants to change the copyright notice on the bottom of the webpage. 

What could possibly go wrong?

YouJustNeedTo type 2012 over 1996 right?

Give it a 2 of hearts at PlanningPoker. 

Quote the client 5 minutes.

Wo, wo, wo, wo wo ... Actually ... let's do a SpikeSolution.

... we don't know where the source code is.

... we found it, but it's using a dated framework.

... we upgraded it, but it doesn't build.

... we fixed the bugs, the site builds but we've found the strip on the bottom of the site is hard coded on every page.

... ok include sorted, but really we don't want to do this again so... better use some sort of get-Date method.

... and better write a test (before someone works out you didn't TestFirst)

... no test harness huh?. Ok, install x unit.

... what? the x unit download site is blocked by a firewall.

... hmmmm... better get my own deck of cards... going to hold up the Jack of Diamonds when next asked about this one ...

Going to let the client know it would be cheaper to do fresh build.

I mean it's only a billing system... YouJustNeedTo...
