Peopleware Papers, The: Notes on the Human Side of Software
by Larry L. Constantine (LarryConstantine)
[ISBN 0130601233]
-----
Quite disappointing.  I bought the book hoping to read more about the human aspect of the programming, unfortunately, it feels more like a bunch of shallow rants about software, and few papers actually talk about the human aspects of software except more rants about user interface (perhaps is UI what "Human Side of Software" means).  Shallow mainly because the book is a collection of columns in magazines, thus most are quite short, less than 10 pages.

As an example of his rants, in one chapter (or paper), he blames brainless programmers for creating a point of sales UI which cannot go back and modify fields already enter.  IMO, most likely the blame goes to brainless managers creating brainless requirements in order to push down the price of the system, "Just do the simplest (cheapest) thing, it's ok as long as it can work!".
