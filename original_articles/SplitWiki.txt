I think this wiki needs to be split into computer-related topics and non-computer-related topics, or at least "sanctioned" versus non-sanctioned. Techies obviously need to vent on non-computer topics every now and then, but it is cluttering up the computer and software topics.

Aaah, you must read more grasshopper.. such as MySignalIsYourNoise. The dynamic tension on WardsWiki is one of the things that makes it great. Use the category system (CategoryCategory) to go straight to your favorite tech subject, or perhaps use one of many RoadMaps. -- TheEditor

''Yes, but the side topics could perhaps be explored further if they could grow without harming or crowding out the software engineering topics.''

Not when it turns into ugly, Ever-lasting EditWar''''''s.

SplitWiki by selecting pages that do not require code word to edit. Although I have no interest in discussions in movies, I see it useful to allow CategoryMovie entries editing all the time. This will encourage viewing (and maybe reviewing) contents that have more serious contents.
