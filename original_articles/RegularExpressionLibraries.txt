Many programming languages support regular-expression pattern matching in their syntax and/or standard run-time libraries. The most prominent and widely used flavor of regular expressions is PerlLanguage's: http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/perlre. 

Some languages with built-in RegularExpression support: PerlLanguage, PythonLanguage, RubyLanguage, JavaScript, JavaLanguage (as of v1.4; see http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/1.4regex/), CeeSharp, IoLanguage, VisualBasicDotNet.

'''VBScript''' 

VbScript people get to use a similar language: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/script56/html/vspropattern.asp.

For those languages that don't natively support RegularExpression''''''s, third-party libraries are available to provide the capability: 

	CeeLanguage:	http://www.pcre.org/ -- Perl-compatible RegularExpression''''''s for C 

	XML (ExtensibleMarkupLanguage):	The XmlSchema recommendation adopted a pattern language that is identical to that used in the PerlLanguage (with minor exceptions noted in the recommendation): http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/#regexs. 

	CommonLisp:	Edi Weitz wrote CL-PPCRE, a RegularExpression library for CommonLisp that's compatible with Perl (and just as fast): http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre/. 

	ColdFusion:	DougTeel wrote logicsearch.cfm, "a regex text to SQL searching tag." (paraphrased from DougTeel) 

	CeePlusPlus:	The BoostLibraries contain a regex package BoostXpressive.
