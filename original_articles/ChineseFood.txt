Hello, I just set up this small page for people who love Chinese food.

Yeah, but one hour after reading this page, I wanted to read it again.

It's common knowledge that Chinese food as we know it in America is largely invented in the United States, by Chinese Americans who were trying to make traditional dishes and familiar flavors with ingredients that they could find locally.

It is not common knowledge why the hungry-again-in-one-hour thing happens. I don't notice it, personally, because I'm a snack addict and I'm always hungry.

Last night, I took dinner at a new Chinese-German restaurant - an hour later, I was hungry for power <rimshot>

As a Chinese student in US, I have been to lots of Chinese restaurants around my university, but none of them has got the essence of traditional art of Chinese food.  The flavor has been changed to cater for the American people's preference.  So, I hope someday I can show you around China and have a taste of genuine Chinese food.  But now I have to put up with them, because it is better than dishes I make by myself. :(

Where in the US? In Atlanta, several Chinese people have recommended a few restaurants as being very good, which I assume means very like those in China.  SO there are some - although I have eaten at Chinese restaurants in the hinterlands on Pennsylvania that were Chinese only in their decor.

I've been told that you can get authentic Chinese cuisine in many large cities by finding the local Chinatown. The custom is that the menu is only a list of suggestions; if you want something in particular, odds are they can make it. I say "I've been told" because I haven't done it myself (I'm occidental and happy with American faux Chinese food), but have heard this from several oriental people.

A problem I notice with a lot of Chinese places is that the rice doesn't clump together, so it's not very easy to eat with chopsticks. Or maybe I just don't have l33t chopsticks skillz. -- NickBensema

''You are not supposed to "pick up" the rice with the chopsticks, that's what Japanese do.  You either use a spoon (if your rice come on a dish) or use the chopsticks to "shove" the rice into your mouth (if your rice come in a bowl).  It will be difficult to do either if the rice clump together to much.''
