Andrew Thompson lives in NorthCarolina, works full time, owns a business, and likes computers. In his free time, he hacks away at his personal site http://aktzero.com/ learning about PhpLanguage, ApacheHttpd, and the LinuxOperatingSystem.

'''Wiki Related'''

I've built a PhpLanguage class that implements a few of the WikiPrinciples. I hope to release it as an actual WikiEngine in a few weeks.

I set up a personal Wiki at http://www.e-surf.org/ based on the 1.3.4 version of Phiki from http://ontosys.com/phiki/PhikiWiki. It appears to be a bit dated, but I've hacked the templating so it looks good.

'''Extreme Programming'''

I only discovered ExtremeProgramming by reading about it on this Wiki. While not a great programmer, I am fluent in several languages. (I believe programming is a skill that once learned can be expressed in whatever language adapt it to.) The whole ProgrammerTest''''''s concept is still fuzzy to me.
