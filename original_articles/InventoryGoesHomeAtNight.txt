In WhyLeadersCantLead, WarrenBennis quotes Louis B. Mayer, the head of MGM Studios during Hollywood's golden era, as having once said, "The inventory goes home at night." (p. 86)

In OnBecomingaLeader, WarrenBennis quotes Michael Eisner, the Chairman and CEO of Disney, as having said, "our inventory goes home at night." (p. xiii)

(Maybe Eisner was quoting Mayer. Maybe everyone in Hollywood says that. Maybe Bennis is confused.)

This is a common belief in Hollywood, and should be one in Silicon Valley-style software companies as well. These companies are nothing without their people, and people are the easiest assets to lose. That's what necessitates LeadershipIdeals like CovenantalRelationships and EmPowerment.

I'd also say that in today's high-flex economy, if you don't treat your employees well, someone else will. (See HighFlexSociety.)
