(Note that "PeterDeutsch" usually means L. Peter Deutsch, but another famous PeterDeutsch is Canadian Peter J. Deutsch, creator of Archie; see below.)

----
L. Peter Deutsch (sometimes incorrectly referenced as "Peter L. Deutsch")
wrote or rewrote many of the early virtual 
machines at Xerox (1971-1986). He also redesigned the bytecode
instruction set, rewrote the compiler and reverse compiler,
and was the creator of the ChangeList.  He was an early
and strong proponent of moving the SmalltalkLanguage onto standard
hardware and a standard character set.

While Peter didn't actually invent the trick of pre-compiling ByteCode''''''s to native code, he was the principal designer and implementor of "PS" (PortableSmalltalk), the first modern on-the-fly-compiling virtual machine, and of the native-code compiler in "HPS" HighlyPortableSmalltalk), its retargetable successor.

Peter also wrote "GhostScript", the GNU PostScript 
implementation,  first public release was v1.0 on 1988-08-11. Originally aladdin.com, handed over to http://www.artofcode.com in 2000.

Peter is a reliable source of top-flight 
information about anything Smalltalk or PostScript.


At age 12 was exposed to the legendary MIT Model Railroad club and thereby the TX-0 console.

While in high school, Peter wrote the first interactive Lisp interpreter, which ran on the PDP-1.  It is available at http://simh.trailing-edge.com/software.html and runs on SIMH (http://simh.trailing-edge.com/).

With language creator CalvinMooers, implemented the landmark TracLanguage on a PDP-10 in 1964.

Spent several years at SunMicrosystems in the early 90s.

Some years ago was working on adapting Ghostscript into a DisplayPostscript for Stallman/FSF; I lost track of what happened to that effort.

Peter Deutsch is god (grinning). ''A truly legendary hacker.''

'''Peter J. Deutsch'''

Created Archie (named after "archiver", not comic strip), the first archiver of the Internet, in 1989, well before the WorldWideWeb, with two others (names?) while students at McGill University in Montreal. Widely used and very popular in its time, Archie periodically polled all known ftp servers and indexed a list of their files.

Founded Bunyip Information Systems Inc. in 1992 to commercialize Archie.
