A software generalist, with a goal of simultaneously reaping the respective benefits of Java and Python.

Some of my personal HopeToHaveTimeToDoSomeDays are:

	1 writing an interactive tool for experimenting with unique GeometricTransformations.
	1 creating a general purpose TimeLine editor.
	1 crafting music applications that employ novel and useful visual paradigms. I find great satisfaction in capturing spatial mappings that form in my head, relating abstractions among different media and/or dimensions. Musical constructs and spatial dimensions are one such pair of abstractions. One such paradigm that I have wanted to explore with automated tools (like a custom input device, display device) since I was little, is the 12 hour clock analog of an octave using the chromatic scale.
