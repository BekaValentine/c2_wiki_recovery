Companies tend to hire people that think like they do (for good or bad). Thus, statements such as, "companies I worked for tend to do X", may not extrapolate to preferences of every company. We leave a lot of subtle and not so subtle clues about what tools and style we prefer and how we think in our resumes, interviews, references, social media sites, and referral channels. 

''Wikis can be similar, attracting a certain crowd of people.  For example this wiki originally attracted smalltalker/XP people - but now that a lot of them are dormant and non-active, other relational/formal/imperative/functional lunatics have taken over the wiki ;-)''

Yeah, Viva lunatics!.....I think. --top
