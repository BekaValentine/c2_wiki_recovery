First there was the WaterfallModel.

Then practitioners with an ounce of intellectual integrity noticed, it is not quite that simple. In fact these stages seem to overlap a bit, and the tails seem rather long and at times the amount of stage 1 (analysis) process that is happening actually goes back up again even when we are in coding....

Hmm perhaps the description is wrong.

FuzzilyIterativeSequence is where 

	* more of stage N happens near the start than stage N+1
	* At all times all stages seem to be happening at least a little.
	* There seems to be loopiness in that the amount of Stage N being done can go back up again.

The process is neither interative nor sequential nor rigidly bounded. The all sort of seem to cooperate and assist one another.
