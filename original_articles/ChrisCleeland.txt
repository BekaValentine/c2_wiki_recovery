I currently work with ObjectComputingInc in St. Louis working on a team commercializing TheAceOrb. In past lives (recent and distant), I've worked with IonaTechnologies in Dublin, Catalyst Solutions here in St. Louis, DougSchmidt in his research group, and consulted to Motorola on the Iridium project.  I seem to oscillate between Java & C++, though I seem to be spending a lot of time hacking perl code recently (for better or worse).

I became interested in patterns when DougSchmidt first exposed me to them back in 1995.  Since then I've co-authored some patterns-related papers with him, including ExternalPolymorphism.

I still have a real home page at http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cleeland.

I'm trying to demonstrate creation a new wiki topic for DanGilbertson.
