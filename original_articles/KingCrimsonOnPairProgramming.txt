I remembered this lyric while browsing over on KillYourDarlings:

Title track from the album Three of a Perfect Pair:

 she is susceptible
 he is impossible
 they have their cross to share
 three of a perfect pair...
 he has his contradicting views
 she has her cyclothymic moods
 they make a study in despair
 three of a perfect pair...

 one
 one too many
 schizophrenic tendencies
 keeps it complicated
 keeps it aggravated
 and full of this hopelessness
 what a perfect mess...

It's a great lyric to a great tune, but without Robert Fripp's rhythm and Adrian Belew's lead it loses something in transcription.
