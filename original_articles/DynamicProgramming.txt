Dynamic programming (DP) has quite a different model form than the other types of mathematical programming. Instead of an objective function and constraints, dynamic programming models consist of a collection of equations that describe a sequential decision process.

The process begins in some initial state, the first decision moves it to a second state, and then continues through alternating decisions and states until a final state is reached
