Z is a FormalSpecification notation which can be automatically verified.

The notation is spelled "Z" and pronounced "zed", since it was created at Oxford and based on Zermelo-Fr√§nkel SetTheory.

"zed", pronounced "zed", was also the stream editor on the IBM3084 mainframe at CambridgeUniversity in the 1980's.  It was a lot like SedLanguage, including having a full-screen mode similar to vi.  Some of the processing for my PhD thesis was done in zed.
