TestEnGee (TestNG) is a TestingFramework for JavaLanguage. It is created by CedricBeust and inspired by JavaUnit and EnUnit but introducing some new functionality:

* Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc...)
* Test that your code is multithread safe
* Flexible test configuration
* Support for DataDrivenTesting (with @Data''''''Provider)
* Support for parameters (also objects in parametrized tests)
* Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (EclipseIde, NetBeans, IntellijIdea, ApacheMaven, etc...)
* Embeds BeanShell for further flexibility
* Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies)
* Dependent methods for ApplicationServer testing

TestEnGee is designed to cover all categories of tests:  UnitTest''''''s, FunctionalTest''''''s end-to-end, IntegrationTest''''''s, etc...
