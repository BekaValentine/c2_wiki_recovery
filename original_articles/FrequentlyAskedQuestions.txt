FAQ.  A list of questions, with answers, posted periodically to a Usenet newsgroup.  The questions listed are those routinely posted to the newsgroup by newcomers.  Nowadays many FAQs are available on the WorldWideWeb.

One likely place to look is http://www.faqs.org/

Depending on the topic, FAQs are some of the best sources of information available.  Quantity, not quality dictates the questions, but FAQ maintainers (and others) put extraordinary effort into supplying the answers, routinely beating (e.g.) software companies' own customer support centres.

If you're going to write some documentation, you may as well:
	1. Have something to write about
	2. Have someone to read it
FAQs have both.
