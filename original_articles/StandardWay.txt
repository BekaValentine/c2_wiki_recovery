Most environments suppose a Standard Way of working. Not only programming languages and IDEs, also CASE tools and actually any process.

If you don't do things in the StandardWay, you usually have to invest more resources (money, time, people...).

The StandardWay is a Pattern only in the context of the environment. It is funny that the StandardWay in J2EE is more like an AntiPattern.

Here some examples:
	* Procreation: have sex. Alternate methods (fertilization, e.g.) are more expensive
	* Java: J2EE, in different ways
	* Delphi: in the past, client server using BDE, now there is a new StandardWay
	* Microsoft: use the .NET architecture (''was COM before, ActiveX, OLE, MSF, ... -- StijnSanders'')
	* Rational Case Tools: use RUP
