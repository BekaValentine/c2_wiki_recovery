Peter H. Jones, Handbook of Team Design, Mc Grawhill 1998,  [ISBN 0-07-032880-3]

Sometimes a bit long, with too much repetition to my personal taste, this book does contain a treasure of ideas to design and work with teams. 

I particularly like the emphasis throughout the book on different contexts : 

	* User context
	* Product context
	* Business context
	* System context

Teams working in these different contexts face different forces, so different styles of leadership and facilitation are needed.
The book hands tools from JAD (JointApplicationDevelopment), participatory design, distributed development. The facilitation tools can be used in lots of situations and are adapted for these situations (what leads to above mentioned repetition).
