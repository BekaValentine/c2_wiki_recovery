As a consultant, I started with this project for a new on line tool for a [ insert Fortune 500 company ]'s salespersons.  The problem was while everyone acknowledged that IcouldDoThisInaWeek no one did.  So I did, in a weekend, in javascript.  Understand I was hired due to my knowledge of [ insert BuzzwordCompliant technologies ].  From that point on it took three months to get the testing, legal signoffs, documentation, etc. done and the product in use.
