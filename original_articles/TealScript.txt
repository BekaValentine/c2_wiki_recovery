TealScript is a replacement for PalmGraffiti that allows one to customize the pen strokes. This lets you train it to recognize your personal handwriting better, and also allows you to create your own shorthand symbols.

I always scratch my head momentarily when I hear someone talk about how horrible PalmGraffiti is. Then I remember that I have TealScript. It really does make Grafitti-style input fast and accurate. -- KrisJohnson
