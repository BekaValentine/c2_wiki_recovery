In general, architecture for a network is static. In some situations, functionality is provided depending on network traffic, number of clients/servers, and server volume. If the network topology is incorrect, the network may become ''very'' slow. A MobileAgent can be equipped to increase/decrease system load to balance the system and do much of the adjustment automagically.
