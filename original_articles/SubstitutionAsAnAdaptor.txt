''Useful for Fitting In '' ThinkingOutLoud [DonaldNoyes_20101104_C2_0484]
----
While working on UserStories in the development of ArtifactOrientedProgramming, I considered the notion that while ArtifactNaming in the system was such that the names were not interpreted as single LinkingPatterns by this wiki. The use of the underscore as a separator prevented this. So I am trying to use substituted words which will make them fit this Wiki's conventions.

Thus the Artifact: DonaldNoyes_Project_ArtifactOrientedProgramming_ToDo could be made to fit by creating an alias by substitution of words for the underscores:
* DonaldNoyesOnProjectArtifactOrientedProgrammingToDoList

This can also be reversed to make a WardsWiki Page fit the usage pattern of ArtifactOrientedProgramming by an alias name
* WardsWiki_ArtifactOrientedProgramming 

Another of the characters useful for separation and distinction in ArtifactNaming are those used for enclosure:  (enclosed item) [enclosed item] {enclosed item} <enclosed item> "enclosed item" 'enclosed item' `enclosed item` (etc)

Note the use on the first line of this page of ArtifactNaming of a type Date_Place_Sequence (It is enclosed for illustrative purposes)
The words suggesting a summary phrase on the line are also enclosed, in this case by formatting option italics.
