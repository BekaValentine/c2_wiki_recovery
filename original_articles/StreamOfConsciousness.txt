This is how I browse Wiki - I think of a phrase, then create my own URL, and see if a page is there already... Sometimes I'm disappointed, sometimes I find some real gems. Sometimes I feel like I should put something there, for the next StreamOfConsciousness browser to find.

This is also the name used by writers for an exercise some of them do to alleviate WritersBlock or to help them get their good ideas out on paper.  The idea is to just force yourself to start writing, and not worry about what you're writing or if it is good or bad.  You aren't allowed to stop writing until the good stuff starts to pour out.  I guess you could apply it to creating content in general (presentations, etc)--just start rambling out all the ideas and tidbits you want to express.  Once they are out in the open, you can study them and listen to how they want to be organized in the final product.

Maybe similar to something a child psychologist would use to help kids express buried emotions (I think BruceWillis did this in the movie TheSixthSense?).  --WylieGarvin
