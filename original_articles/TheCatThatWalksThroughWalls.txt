A book by RobertHeinlein that has no story. Instead, it is more of an elaborate PracticalJoke on the reader.

It start with a sane semi-mystery plot. it follows this plot about halfway through the book before suddenly whisking the action away to a different universe and time period. A space station blows up for no apparent reason. The protagonist is killed and revived by DeusExMachina in the space of 2 pages.  His whole reason for getting involved in this "story" is retroactively removed by time travel. And the whole thing ends in a TemporalParadox.

Amusing but not coherent.

''I rather disagree.  I liked this book, but it takes some deep thinking to figure out its meaning, much like most of RobertHeinlein's other books.  -X''
