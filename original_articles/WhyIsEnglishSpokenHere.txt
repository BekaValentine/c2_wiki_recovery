The majority of the pages on this wiki are in English. Here are some of the reasons: 
* Wiki was created in the United States where the predominant language is English.
* The language is understood in most parts of the world, and is in many cases the second if not the first language used for computing, science and technology.
* Wiki attempts to be universal in appeal, and uses the language with the most universal usage, which at present seems to be English.  
* While pages exist in several languages including Spanish, French, Greek, Italian, to name a few, users are encouraged to write in a language which nearly all of the participants can become involved.
* When a page is written in a foreign language, translation utilities do not do justice to the meaning of the page, and as a result the page can not have maximum impact.
* Nobody has presented a good argument for any specific alternative language.
* Everyone's computer has the simple ASCII characters needed for writing English.
