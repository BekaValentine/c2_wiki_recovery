	0 Make www.c2.com/cgi/wiki read-only. That part's easy, just disable wiki?edit.
	0 Create a new blank wiki on c2.com with a charter requiring, say, OpenContent, OpenAuthor, RefactoringDeadline''''''s on ThreadMode, a strict observance of the duties of a GoodWikiCitizen, and dedication to the ideals of MakeSignalNotNoise.
	0 Don't permit wiki?edit on the new wiki from any participant who won't publicly commit themselves to the charter. Use cookies to enforce that.
	0 When someone editing a page on the new wiki references a WikiName that's only present on the old, give them the option of importing the old page on the condition that they will immediately ReFactor it.
	0 (Optional) add WikiPortal capabilities to the new wiki.
	0 (Optional) let the old wiki stay open for participants who won't agree to the new charter.
	0 Wait a year (say) and then DeleteWiki.
