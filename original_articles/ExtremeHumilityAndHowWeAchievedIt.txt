It's an old joke but ... would anybody like to join in helping those less fortunate than ourselves in attaining ExtremeHumility ?

Joking apart, it is surely possible to be very ambitious to achieve great things, to be full of confidence as a team and as individuals, to be aggressive and courageous in the face of great obstacles, yet to have the sense to realise that without humility the best will never come to be.

I think the correct term for this is ''meekness''.  But I guess example is more powerful than words anyhow ...

''Although PaulHudson wrote ExtremeHumility without knowing about it, EwDijkstra wrote an article entitled "TheHumbleProgrammer" in CACM, October 1972.''
