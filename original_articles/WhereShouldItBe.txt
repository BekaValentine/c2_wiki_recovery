Corollary: ''When memory fails, a link on a page can furnish thousands of words (or less) ''

In my workspace (my BuiltHomeOffice), many things are going on at one time and when concentration is not on the  simple thing as "where should I put this so I can find it at an AtArmsLength proximity - or at least - I can roll my chair there proximity", . 

* The Large Screen Tv (Monitor reachable via HDMI) (Media Player - which can play "ElevatorMusic" which I like, or can serve to play InternetVideos from YouTube and elsewhere) is configurable using two different remotes, 1) my UverseRemote, and 2) My Large Screen Tv Remote.
** Bag on chair, hanging on the right side - If I have or put a bag on the left side it will be for temporary, I need to put this Where it should be, an ActOfBecoming)

** At my ZeeLocation

Where to put the remotes, each time, every time can be fixed and preserved for browser-reachability by taking a DigitalPhoto of them where you want them to be, and then filing in My Pictures (the image part of WhereShouldItBe) or other easily clickable place (the linking part of WhereShouldItBe). for me it is the Desktop. When using NysLte, the prefix I use is WsIb: (followed by the ArtifactName).  [See NysLte for information and links]
