Contrary to naive beliefs, HandWaving and statements of faith, previously expressed in TragedyOfTheCommonsCantHappenHere
As of January 2005 WardsWiki succumbed to a crappy mediocrity in the new content being added, whatever valuable content that was created previously doesn't seem to evolve or get improved, updated or anything and is in danger of being further polluted by future edits. 

The RecentChanges is a disaster, a true chemical dump as somebody said. But RecentChanges is not '''the''' problem; the problem is that as the situation stands now, nobody capable seems to be willing to invest the effort to make Wiki a lively place to share knowledge about software engineering. And justly so, because WardsWiki as it stands now is fundamentally broken, being easy prey for wannabes, folks without any scruples, folks looking for an argument, and even well-intentioned ignoramuses.

''Unfortunately, you've just outlined the problems with every method of lots of humans interacting. WardsWiki isn't a special case. In fact, WardsWiki is remarkably informative and un-trollful compared to most of the rest of the Internet. I've learned an incredible amount by reading and posting here, stuff that I probably wouldn't have picked up on my own or from reading random books. Of course it's not perfect, but it's a fantastic resource. Count your blessings.''

* That's one possible attitude. However a different attitude is performance-oriented. If you cannot achieve or you cannot even try to achieve a certain level of performance (or excellence), better not do it at all. That's why I've come with a WikiChangeProposal. It's one possible attempt. I hope that other people may contribute with criticisms, improvements or alternative proposals. Counting the blessings that we got from wiki as it stands now smells like being complacent in mediocrity, or "happy like a pig in the mud".
** Actually, it's one actual attitude. Anyway, what's this about achievement and performance? Wiki isn't a competition. And it doesn't need to be perfect to be worthwhile. The more time we spend lamenting its flaws and wishing it would change, the less time we have to actually learn from it. Nobody is stopping you getting exactly what you want out of Wiki. BlameYourselfFirst.
** ''No, I don't blame myself first unless I want to parade a cheap display of bravado. Nobody's stopping me ? Well, you must be kidding. Nobody's stopping either contributors or gnomes we're just fighting with our own ghosts, and the current persisting problems must be a figment of our imagination.''
** Besides, if you want change, you have to LeadByExample. Telling people what they should do just doesn't work. Stop talking about improving Wiki, and start improving Wiki. People will join in. And guess what? Even if they don't, you'll still make a difference.
**''That's exactly what I'm trying to do, if you don't mind. I'm trying to gather feedback and maybe even support for a WikiChangeProposal, and I'll go from there. Your comment is absolutely gratuitous if not entirely in bad taste.''

I tried to make a proposal for improvement (WikiChangeProposal) but so far haven't got any feedback (not even negative feedback), a further sign that Wiki as a community is quasi-dead. I just do not see how wiki can get better, because BusinessAsUsual does not work, as the year 2004 demonstrated. 

If wiki continues ruining itself, the only sensible solution that I can see is that contributors of valuable content should commit a WikiSuicide (aka WikiMindWipe) by removing any valuable content they contributed so that there is no doubt for future wiki visitors that they can find something valuable here. Leaving valuable content can only help the pirates that hijacked WardsWiki and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. -- CostinCozianu
* Also known as throwing the baby out with the bath water. This sounds like "I'm going to break all my toys because I don't like them anymore, and I don't want the other kids to be able to play with them." Future Wiki visitors have a vast, ever-growing trove of knowledge to learn from. The idea of going through and systematically removing all valuable content is, well, absurd.
* ''What a nice display of wishful thinking . To claim that "future wiki visitors" will have a "vast, ever-growing trove of knowledge", is just BeggingTheQuestion. Who are you to tell that future wiki visitors will not have a vast ever growing chemical dump, they may learn bad things from wiki. As such, every wiki contributor has the option to remove the contributed content for the purpose that it should not be misused in order to give an appearance of legitimacy to the possible chemical dump. It's a perfectly legitimate individual option that has been exercised by past contributors to WardsWiki. In another wiki situation, WhyClublet is abusing the contributions of its past members in spite repeated requests and common sense that those should be deleted. At least Ward promised us that we retain the copyright of our contributions here. So anybody at all that disagrees with the future direction of this wiki is certainly entitled and legitimated to remove his personal contribution from here.''

''By all means, go first.''

Costin I sense the anguish in your statements, and am impressed by the energy you have exhibited in your WikiChangeProposal. I have just (Jan16) came upon it and will certainly take time to think about what people has to say. But can I make a point or two?
* While there is lots of disappointing evidence everywhere, the fact that "ArticleForComments" (a Jan2005 contribution) exist prove that ThereIsHopeYet.
* WikiChangeProposal has been commented by others. So just be patient. Takes time to understand, more to think,...
* FYI I tried to comfort GeorgeBrower. And he then explained the nature of his disappointments and that proved useful food for thought for other WikiZens. So the use of RightWordsAtRightTime can be constructive. BTW his further contributions (after he said hes leaving) let me to learn about important concept of "externalities" (see WikiNoisePollution).
* I feel similar to you at times. Example see section "GoodItManager''''''s do not last" 

Maybe taking a short break will recharge your energy. -- dl

I'm fairly confident future technologies will allow one to "mine" this wiki to better find information and get better summaries.
