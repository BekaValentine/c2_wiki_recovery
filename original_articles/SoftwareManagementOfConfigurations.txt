SCM is management assisted with software tools. Is this a restriction? It is a
self-fulfilling prophecy to answer no. The level of management attainable
through SCM should be unreachable in any other way, inescapable. The reasoning
is that what is allowed by SCM is collaborative management, i.e. management of
complexities beyond the reach of any individual.

The tools do bring restrictions: those related to their idiosyncrasy. E.g.
ClearCase applies only to files (and directories). Files are the atom on which
is built ClearCase genericity. This is a restriction when it comes to
managing a database (or an image, as in typical Smalltalk development
environments).

There is here a paradox, and a circle. Since SCM is tool aided management, its
kind of genericity depends on something specific to the SCM tool. It doesn't
make much sense to speak of generic SCM, abstracting the tool away. At least
doing so would drop us back to pre-SCM management, which is unacceptably
weaker. -- MarcGirod
