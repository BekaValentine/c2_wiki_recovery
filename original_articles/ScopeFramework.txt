"Scope is a framework built around an extensible implementation of the HierarchicalModelViewController (HMVC) pattern similar to the pattern described in HMVC: The layered pattern for developing strong client tiers... Applications developed using Scope are "view-agnostic": a Swing application uses the same infrastructure and patterns as a web application that happens to use XML/XSLT to generate HTML, or a JSP-based application."
