''Systems of Names ''

Objects, Patterns, Wiki and XP.

WardCunningham refers to the above as belonging to a SystemsOfNames in his presentation at OopslaOhFour. A WikiPage, a stack of CrcCard''''''s and DesignPattern''''''s are also referred to as ArtfullyIncompleteSpecification''''''s. 

It makes one stop to think differently about each item mentioned, since they are illustrated as having common characteristics.  

Are there other systems which might be added to either of these groups? Would a computer language qualify? A Class in OO? In what way can names be said to belong to a system?

[Delete eventually]''Did you mean SystemOfNames?''
* No - Four items listed in the second line of the page are separate and distinct systems, They are Systems (plural) of Names (plural).
