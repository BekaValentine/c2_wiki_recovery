A study of the common characteristics of statistical data visualization, with an eye to object-oriented implementation. What is sought is a minimal set of object interfaces that can be used to implement as many types of charts as possible. Wilkinson identifies seven components, or interfaces, involved in transforming a dataset into a visualized graphic.

Implementations of these concepts can be found in the StatisticalPackageForTheSocialSciences system and the ArrLanguage 'ggplot2' library.
