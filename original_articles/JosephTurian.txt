As much as possible I try to tip-toe around the rest of the wiki.

To the kind soul who trampled my dandelions and tampered with my hometext

	 :	please.

Even TheOldEnglishDictionary contains a few BadWords:
	 :	I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.
	 :	(1922 JamesJoyce Ulysses 580)
