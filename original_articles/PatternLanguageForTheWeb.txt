This is the starting page for a pattern language for the web. I'm jump-starting this, but am hoping it will take on a life of its own, in the manner of the Timeless Wiki Way...

Some thoughts:

* Exploring the web should be a mind-expanding, exhilarating experience.
* Each website should contribute a piece of this experience.
* A web pattern language, properly derived, should lead people to naturally create such websites and communities of websites.
* No website is an island. Web patterns should explore individual websites '''and''' how websites can work together to provide a complete experience.
* RobertOrenstein has done some work on an HTML pattern language at 
*** http://www.anamorph.com/docs/patterns/default.html ( BrokenLink )
* Another site that could be mined for web-related patterns is JakobNielsen's Alertbox
*** http://www.nngroup.com/articles/alertbox-200/

To differentiate the web patterns from the programming patterns here:

* It would be good to list the web-based patterns on this page (or on another page dedicated to that purpose).
* We should probably precede the pattern names with 'Web'. So if I were doing this page from scratch, it would be 'WebPatternLanguage'.

Now to start:

* WebKnownAuthor
* WebUniqueContent
* WebEvolvingContent

Are web patterns so different from programming patterns that they need to be segregated by naming convention? 
''Probably not''

Definitely so!
