Hello there. Fellow WikiZen.

I'm Tomi "BGT" Mäntylä from FinlandEurope.

This page is TomiBgtMantyla, because I don't think '�' would be too functional in a link... Someone has confirmed my suspicion and even denoted it as one of the WikiWikiBugs.

I lost my way and ended up here as I was looking for material for my graduation thesis on CollaborativeEditing.

Now I'm trying to find a vacant spot in my time/energy resources to continue with my ideas on the issue. But life is tough.

I work in the Turku Centre for Computer Sciences - TUCS as a Technical Planner / Coordinator.
