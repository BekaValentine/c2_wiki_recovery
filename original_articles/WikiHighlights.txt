WikiHighlights (and ChangeSummary before it) used to attempt to bring to focus some of the more interesting pages on Wiki. However many of us have now learnt the hard way: Wiki links to the pages that it likes in context. 

In fact, important pages form natural "centres" aka NatureOfOrder that are like gravity wells: you'll "fall" into them almost inevitably. Like NewEmptyPage.

So much for "falling into them." I have implemented the shortest path length sort for MeatballWiki, which detects the "centres" of the graph analytically. This is super expensive, so I only generate the page once a day. It lives at http://sunir.org/meatball/path.html. I suspect running the same analysis on WikiWiki's tens of thousands of pages would take a ''very long'' time. -- SunirShah
