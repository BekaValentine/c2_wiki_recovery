As a Strine caught up in a world of Podeans, I'm often surprised, dismayed and astonished by this concept called "respect". Strines maintain respect for one another on principle ("MateShip") and within establish relationships, but have little experience of "respect for the office" or "respect for the institution", and the hierarchies built therefrom. Perhaps needless to say, this can represent a considerable professional handicap.

I've observed that many Podeans don't maintain these last two forms either, but, being raised with them, have developed a wonderful facility with those who maintain them. So this page is about how you go about doing this without disjointing noses and mashing toes. How do you go about HandlingRespect? --PeterMerel
