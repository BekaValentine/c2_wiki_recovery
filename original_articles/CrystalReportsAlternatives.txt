By far the most serious threat to the dominating role of CrystalReports is MicrosoftCorporation SqlReportingServices. It is "free", addresses enterprise printing/reporting needs, has the world's best promotion company behind it....

A financial analysis firm did a survey in Jun2004 and their results suggested users of CrystalReports are receptive to trying out this new product. See http://www.newratings.com/analyst_news/article_431389.html

Only problem is that it is platform dependent and in particular, DotNet dependent

Can report against a variety of data sources, including database, RSS, and spreadsheet. Simple reporting for screen presentation is a breeze. Additionally, Bluyah allows you to generate more than just "reports" from your data source. Export formats include: charts, Google Maps, marquees (for embedding in websites), CSV and XML.
