After dutifully searching, Googling, meditating and browsing, I haven't been able to find pages that I'm looking for.

I vaguely remember someone from the XP community writing about the state of code being 'ready for change' while not anticipating any particular change.  Mechanically, this ready state was achieved through DRY and YAGNI and refactoring but the particular page I'm remembering described the aesthetic of ready state in eastern philosophy terms.  I had thought it was WabiSabi, but I can't find it there.  Does anyone know what I'm talking about?
