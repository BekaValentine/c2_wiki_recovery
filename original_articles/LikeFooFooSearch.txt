KarlKnechtel: Does anyone else HaveThisPattern?

When I'm mentoring, and looking for reference material to give to the student on some subject Foo, I will often open a new browser tab (or window) and AutomaticallyType in "http://c2.com/cgi/like?FooFoo".

Yes! I do that all the time, including about a minute ago. Since GoogleHatesWiki, it works as a crude search.

''Note that as ElizabethWiethoff pointed out on the GoogleHatesWiki page, MSN search still indexes this site.''

Like doesn't work now, but http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=Foo gives a more complete set of pages anyway. -- IanOsgood
