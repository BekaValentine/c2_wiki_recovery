''For UserScreens, consider that some features are mandatory, while others may be made Optional via PersonalizedConfiguration '' DonaldNoyes.DoingStuff.20121202

While working with a program which displays information similar to a WikiPage, I had added a number of auxiliary controls which show associated information which I find useful. During considerations on what features to include or exclude, the notion occurred, What if someone else doesn't want to see all that ''stuff''. As each individual is different, so are their ideas of what is important. The solution: make some features mandatory, (always display) and others Optional being displayed only because they were included in default configuration possibilities by the user in a "configuration screen", or that they may be included (presented) by activation by menu or control buttons. This is presently a considered approach to a program called NysLte2013. It is a process by which LessIsMore is applied.

This can be applied to any software, including software displaying WikiPages, making it far more UsefulUsableUsed.
