JohnCarter's clarification of MurphysLaw

"Things only ever go right so that they may go more spectacularly wrong later."

From this principle, all of life and physics may be deduced.

Basically, order creates a MurphysLaw potential, which like a Quantum Wave Function extends in time and space. The MurphysLaw potential is proportional to the harm and distress it causes to the observers. 

The probability of it collapsing is proportional to the amplitude, normalized over all time and space to sum to 1, i.e., it probably won't collapse into disaster now if it can create a bigger mess later.

This is a fairly old notion which in Victorian times went by the name "This Vale of Sorrows".

''Isn't this also the SecondLawOfThermodynamics?''
