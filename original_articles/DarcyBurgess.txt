'''bio:''' Very new to Wikiland, and hoping to use this tool to help collaborate with players in my ongoing RPG campaign(s).

I'm a Tool and Die Maker by day, with a little family of my own, so I don't get to the computer as often as I'd like.  Hobbies include:
* puttering in my woodshop
* RPGs (obviously), currently in the works
** Star Wars using the Riddle of Steel as an engine.  (Check out http://www.theriddleofsteel.net)
** Sporadic Godlike games (http://www.arcdream.com/godlike)
** Musings on a Sorcerer campaign (http://sorcerer-rpg.com/)
* reading, especially SciFi and WW2 historical
* boardgames, favourites include:
** Europe Engulfed
** Cape Horn
** El Grande
** Age of Steam
** Looking forwad to trying Struggle of Empires

I'm a proud Canadian, and am currently enjoying the first cold snap in the Ottawa Valley!
