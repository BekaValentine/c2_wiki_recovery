From http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~rieger/duploc/ ''(BrokenLink 2005-12-05)'':
	 :	Duploc is a tool to visualize duplicated code. Duploc reads in a number of C++, C or Java source code files and compares them line-by-line using a simple stringmatch comparison function. Lines that match produce a dot in a twodimensional comparison matrix. This matrix can be examined using point-and-click. Additionally, Duploc has a batchmode in which a number of files can be compared offline and a report about dot configurations that were found in the comparison matrices is written into a file.
