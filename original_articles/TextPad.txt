Excellent editor!  Interestingly, it shares many features and functions with UltraEdit, to the point where one wonders which is copying the other.

It's also the closest thing to BbEdit I've seen on a Windows machine. It has a clean interface, good SyntaxColoring. It's usually the first thing I install on a new Windows box (even before WinZip). -- SeanOleary

I've been using it at home on Windows for years, mostly for Java programming, occasionally for raw HTML editing. It's very stable and quick. I really prefer Xemacs for Java coding, but the last time I tried Xemacs for Windows I wasn't happy about it. -- JohnWebber

Its interface has a clarity to aspire to.

''TextPad lacks programmer-oriented bells and whistles, but is an excellent replacement for Notepad.''

While TextPad may lack some language sensitivity, it has excellent programmer-supportive features (like formatting, syntax highlighting, bracket matching, column operations, multi-file search, differencing, etc.) and allows editing and printing in different fonts/point sizes.
