The AstronomersProposalTool is a JavaLanguage application which allows astronomers to consider the scientific feasability of a particular set of observations and/or to plan how those observations are executed. The tool is currently designed to work on the HubbleSpaceTelescope, but could be adapted to work on other telescopes or even multiple telescopes.
