The original RocketScientist. He built the V2 for Hitler, then other missiles for the U. S. Army.

Not only the U.S. Army, but NASA too, all the way up to the Saturn V. He was said to have been knowledgeable about every single system in that huge rocket. A true architect.

TomLehrer wrote a song about von Braun:

  Gather 'round while I sing you of Wernher von Braun,
     a man whose allegiance
     is ruled by expedience.
  Call him a Nazi, he won't even frown --
     "Nazi, Shmazi" says Wernher von Braun.

  Some have harsh words for this man of renown,
     but some say our attitude
     should be one of gratitude --
  Like the widows and cripples in old London town
     who owe their large pensions to Wernher von Braun.

  Don't say that he's hypocritical,
     say rather that he's "apolitical".
  "Once the rockets are up,  who cares where they come down?
     That's not my department" says Wernher von Braun.

And so on. (Used without permission - so sue me.)

Sig seen on Usenet, quote attributed to Wernher Von Braun:
    ''I aim for the moon but sometimes I hit London.''

''in the above the section on von Braun in Germany is missing''

Would this have anything to do with a concentration camp called Dora?
