Many years ago, the folks that picked up your garbage from your house were called Garbage Men.

Not all people working the job were happy to have Garbage in their title. Thus the title SanitationEngineer was born.

The title of SanitationEngineer affords a bit of pride that just isn't available with the title of GarbageMan.

Is having the word Engineer in a title illegal or deceptive? Since the user of the title likely has not gone through four years of university to attain a degree, it can be misleading in this aspect, but it's also in an field where not many folks would really expect the holder to have attained a degree.

What about RecordingEngineer? Perhaps, but it's unlikely that four years of schooling are behind the title.

And, SoftwareEngineer?

Thing is, many localities do not have laws that apply to use of the term "engineer," so it may be technically illegal in some areas, but not in others.

''See ProfessionalEngineer for more.  After all, "engineers" did things like drive locomotives and such long before "engineers" built bridges, chemical plants, circuits, or software systems.''

Another reworked title is Secretary which morphed into ProfessionalAssistant.

In the UK pupils between 11 and 16 years are taught practical skills including cooking and simple carpentry.  While I was at school (60's) they changed the name of the cooking bit from "Cookery" to "Domestic Science".  Then, years after I had left, they changed "Domestic Science" into "Home Economics".  (I think this is actually a tautology as the "eco" bit, in Greek, means "household".)

Just recently I heard from a teaching friend that "Home Economics" in her local council has been re-named "The Management of Life-perpetuating Resources".  I thought this was a joke, but when I said so she brought me the evidence.  The council actually has a person with the job title of "Secondary Schools Advisor (Management of Life-perpetuating Resources)".  RobinWilson
