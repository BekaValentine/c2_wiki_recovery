People interested in learning about Python, but do not have a clue and need help:
* DavidLiu
** ''Clue: Go to a bookstore. Buy a book on Python. Read it.''
** Or save yourself the money and read the excellent: http://diveintopython.org/ (DiveIntoPython doesn't exist anymore. See https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers for a list of tutorials for people who already know how to program)
*SusannahWilliams - I'll do the above things but I also have a question, python is better than VB, I get that, but is it as widely used and will it help me get a job as a programmer or something like that? 
** Hmm. Yes. Although not as widely used as VB, Python will help you get a job as a programmer and more importantly, to like your job as a programmer (which VB will not do).
*** You can work at google. How cool is that? ;-)
*** If by "get me a job as a programmer" you mean that people will see it on your resume and hire you, or that there's a large demand for Python programmers, I have to say I'm sorry but no. On the other hand, Python will make a you a better programmer. And writing code in Python is *fun*, something that VB isn't. If you are fortunate enough to get a job using Python, my congratulations (and envy).

Please add/move/remove yourself to/from the appropriate list!
