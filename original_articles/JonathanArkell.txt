Thanks to the grammar/spelling fairies/gnomes who fix my mistakes!

I have decided that I am actually going to '''USE''' the spellchecker, and stop being a lazy SOB.

'''Lessons Learned'''

Generally, when there is a bunch of wiki-thrashing-around, I have just recently found that it is far easier to let the members of wiki thrash around, and not get involved than to actually try and do something. Duhh. :/ (No good dead goes unpunished. But why can't I get the punishment I want?)

'''WikiIdeaBox'''
This is a place for me to post my wiki-page ideas before putting them "out there". OpenWikiGraphics lived here for months before I decided to give it wings, and watch it fly.

AutoPcnResults Feed Builder:
* poll AutoPcnResults every hour 
* Grab each bullet point, first WikiLink is the feed name
* Wikilinks thereafter are feed Items
** full text of page (lotsa bandwidth charges here)or quickdiff of page
** hyperlinked to page
** Massaged version of the above, with links to quickdiff, color posts, edit page, etc.

'''WikiMailBox'''
Regarding OpenWikiGraphics, there is currently one symbol waiting to join up, so to speak - it currently resides at h''''ttp://www.eit.org.uk/del.gif.

Where does it belong? It is sitting in the main OpenWikiGraphics directory currently.

I suggest moving it to the math2 subdirectory, as it's another symbol used in mathematics.

Done.

Is there a way you could insert the version number of a page in your version of "posts"? 

''Not easily. That would take another HTTP request (not a cheap operation by a long shot) and parsing the Apache Directory Index output. No large task, but not Small either.''

Welcome - kudos for the facility. We should compete to see whether AutoPcn or ColorPosts gets more traffic. Then again, maybe not. <grin>

''D00000d, I dig AutoPcn. In fact, I find the entire concept of external-wiki-apps exceedingly cool. I like the idea of your script reading input from a wiki page, and writing to a different one. That is hella cool. It would be interesting to write a web app that would poll AutoPcnResults and display the AutoPcnResults as RSS. This could allow you to subscribe to your own, and other peoples P''''''cnFeeds. I threw up some ideas about this in my WikiIdeaBox''

I do ''not'' understand RSS - one day I may want someone to explain it to me. I'm a simple mind at heart, er, if you see what I mean ...

''RSS itself is actually simple. Really Simple. ReallySimpleSyndication in fact. The idea is that you provide an RDF XML page (your RSS feed), and people can choose to subscribe to that page. Any time you update your site, your blog, or your whatever, you add an item to the RSS feed. Generally, you can use an off-the-shelf library to generate your rss feed, all you have to be concerned about is what goes on there, and updating the thing. (Generally, RSS feeds are generated through a server-side script.)''

''On the client side, your RSS reader/news aggregator polls the RSS feed every hour (that is the established convention) and displays the results to you.''

''The beauty of RSS is that it is not necessarily a strictly client-side thing. Other websites, portals, and even some wiki-engines can subscribe to rss feeds.''

''Does that help?''

''Update: I guess I should clarify myself a little. I am not proposing you write this P''''''cnFeeds app, but actually just verbalizing a funky idea. I may write it myself... If I ever get the time.''

'''Another ColourRecentPosts Suggestion'''

The light blue of the first entry is less than useful; it doesn't convey how old the most recent post is. You might try setting $lastpost[POST_TIME] in displayPosts() to the current system time, rather than to zero.

Done! Thanks again Mark!
