So far found these web testing tools:
* JwebUnit 
* HttpUnit 
* HtmlUnit 
* SimpleTest

What I would like to test is the functionality of posting a picture to a fotolog like web application.
How to test File Uploading on a Web Application? What's the best way for doing that? Using JwebUnit ? HttpUnit ?  HtmlUnit ? 
I couldn't find any help on other sites. :-(
