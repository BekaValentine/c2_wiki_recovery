DeprecatingTheObserverPattern is the title of a paper written by Ingo Maier, Tiark Rompf, and MartinOdersky in 2010.

Abstract:
	 :	Programming interactive systems by means of the observer pattern is hard and error-prone yet is still the implementation standard in many production environments. We present an approach to gradually deprecate observers in favor of reactive programming abstractions. Several library layers help programmers to smoothly migrate existing code from callbacks to a more declarative programming model. Our central high-level API layer embeds an extensible higher-order data-flow DSL into our host language. This embedding is enabled by a continuation passing style transformation.
