 She's as sweet as Tupelo Honey
 She's an angel of the highest degree.... -- Van Morrison

SyntacticTupeloHoney is like SyntacticSugar, but way more expensive.  So much so in that it represents a great deal of pain (loss of performance, etc.) for modest gains in programmer productivity, for "minor" features, and/or for orthogonality for orthogonality's sake.  Whereas SyntacticSugar can be a good thing, SyntacticTupeloHoney is often an AntiPattern.
