A hyperlinked text editor is a MS Notepad-like text editor in which many of the words are underlined in blue and if you (right) click on them you are taken to a page showing/having hyperlinks to all the places that word is used, and you can (right) click to go to the desired place.  This could be useful for example to see what the definition of a class is or how many times you have overused the word 'really' in your document.

Does anyone know if a hyperlinked text editor exists?  -- JonGrover

The AcmeProgrammingEnvironment is probably flexible enough to do something similar.  Backlink handling is probably just a small matter of programming.

VimTextEditor supports tags where words written |like this| are links that take you to entries *like this*.

The EmacsEditor has the ffap-minor-mode (FindFileAtPointEmacsMode) for visiting files whose pathnames (relative or absolute, or just in the same directory) appear in the text.

And then there's CTAGS and ETAGS for vi and emacs users, which actually does the backlinking you want, but that's limited to C/Java/C++/LISP/whatever source code.
