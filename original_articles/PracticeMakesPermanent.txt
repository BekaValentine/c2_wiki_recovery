When you practice your technique, you make it very consistent.  People often say that PracticeMakesPerfect, but that only applies if what you are practicing is "perfect".  You can spend all day practicing a tennis backhand, but if you have the mechanics wrong, you are going to have a very consistent, very inferior backhand.  Worse, you are now further from improving that backhand.

This is where feedback, in the form of coaching, comes in.  Part of a coach's job is to analyze your technique and keep correcting it until you have it right.  He or she shouldn't let you practice bad technique undisturbed.

Practicing good technique leads to consistently good technique ("perfect").  Practicing bad technique leads to consistently bad technique.

''I think PracticeMakesAutomatic is another important aspect. It means, that something not only becomes permanent (i.e. cannot be/is not forgotten), but becomes routine in a way, that you need not think about it any longer. In the bad backhand example this can very well come out as a negative. One not only needs to think about it, but one even cannot think about it - without practicing the reflection about the process, thus adding another routine layer.''
