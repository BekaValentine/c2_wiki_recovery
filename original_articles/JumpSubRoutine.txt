Statement to call a SubRoutine.

This used to be an assembly statment (called e.g. "JSR" on MotorolaSixtyEightKay) that was given a label that was ''jumped'' to after ''pushing'' the current program location (ProgramPointer) onto the stack.

The matching statement to return to that location at the end of the SubRoutine is ReturnFromSubRoutine (e.g. called "RTS").

''Or daily calisthenics on the Holland VII''

The analogous operations in Intel assembly language are "CALL" and "RET".
