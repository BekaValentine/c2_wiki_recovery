A bad word is one we dread. It can be a swear, or it can be an ordinary word that has additional meaning.

For example...

''Oh.''

This can be a bad word. Even though it isn't one, as defined... it can be very very bad news.

''Really''

That too.

''Huh''

That also.

''Yes''

In some cases.

''What?''

That one also.

''Sh*t''
