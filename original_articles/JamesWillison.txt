Just recently introduced to the world of Wiki.  I must say, it is intriguing.

I am considering the idea of a Wiki for work to create an on-line Standards Document.  I think it would be good to allow the users the ability to add tips & tricks for program use and such to the document. I could then clean up the additions once a week or so (while keeping an archive of pages so they don't get deleted of course).
