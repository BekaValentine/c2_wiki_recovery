Influential ScienceFiction/thriller/horror television program from the late fifties and early sixties, hosted/narrated by Rod Serling. The show featured surprisingly intelligent scripts for the time, of which a number were written by noted ScienceFiction authors of the day.

A few of the episodes reflected on computers and ArtificialIntelligence in various humorous and horrific ways.

In 1958 Rod Serling pitched idea to CBS for anthology series, wrote "The Time Element" (Pearl Harbor) and "The Happy Place" (wherein no one lives over age 60) as proposed pilot. "Time Element" was chosen as pilot and first broadcast Nov 24, 1958. Series debuted October 2, 1959. It was cancelled in 1962, brought back by popular demand in Jan 1963, and ran through 1964.

Interestingly (in the context of this site) Rod Serling won his first Emmy for a show called "Patterns" (he won 3 for TwilightZone also) see http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/6302779529/102-0816496-9891332?v=glance
