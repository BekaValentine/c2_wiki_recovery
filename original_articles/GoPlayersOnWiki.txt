There's quite a bit of interest in Go amongst the folk who attend the ExtremeTuesdayClub

----

Maybe we need to start a ladder?

* PiersCawley plays online most evenings and can usually be found as pdcawley on the KGS server.

* AnthonyLander is just learning...Anyone know of some internet multiuser software to run a ladder?

* PeterMerel plays every chance he gets, which is seldom. About 5 kyu, depending on whose kyu you mean. Pete looks forward to one day being too old to do anything else.

* ChrisGarrod (also in SanDiego) has thought of Go as his favorite game for more than three decades, but he isn't very good, and doesn't play enough. All my computers were bought to try to write a program which would play go.

* PhilGoodwin, FalkBruegmann used to play a bit, never got good at it but loved it nonetheless.

* KeithBraithwaite was never more than a keen student, but started a Go club when he worked in Docklands. This turned out to be educational, as a lot of high (amateur) Dan's from the Japanese banks came along.

* GarethMcCaughan hasn't played for ages. I was never very good; about 11kyu. (Me too, HelmutLeitner) (Me too. But still very interested. Just finding that I need to save the Go part of my brain to do my day job. JasonGrossman)

* DavidHarvey also wishes he had more time, it's hard enough having to satisfy the muses of software and music as it is. Anyone in London UK who'd like a game, just mail me.

* ErikMeade played as a child, and recently has been getting beaten on the Internet Go Server (http://igs.joyjoy.net).

* BillBarnett enjoyed learning the basics, but needs lots more real games to progress.

* DanSchmidt always thought Go looked neat, but didn't get to play until the internet servers popped up. Currently AGA 5 kyu.

* ScottDossey is AGA (American Go Association) 3 kyu. One of these days he may disappear completely. That will mean he's probably somewhere in Asia, dedicating his life to the game.

* BenFinney is in Melbourne, Australia and has burned out most of his friends; they know the rules, they've played a bit, but are no longer interested. Time, again, seems to be the limiting factor. Oh for Imperial sponsorships like in the Edo period!

* ChuckSmith is in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and cannot find opponents, so he can never be good.

* ChrisHyser plays go about as well as he plays basketball and I'm not likely to get called up to the NBA (or the local high school team for that matter) anytime soon. Still love to play both though and can put people in touch with the Fort Collins, Colo go club.

* LaurentBossavit is teaching his son in the hopes of always having an opponent, and one he can stay ahead of. Maybe. ;)

* PaulMillar has just started to play Go, something he's been meaning to do for a long time.

* KarlKnechtel plays on KGS as "Zahlman".

* DavidPlumpton is a beginner who enjoys the game, but prefers the simplest rules possible (area scoring, none of this bent four in the corner is dead stuff).

* AndyPierce plays on IGS as 'paar', currently around 5k.

* ChristophePoucet is a beginner and has tried on IGS a long while back where he was about 25k (Yes, I did say beginner). I would like to find some beginners to practice with.

* BenTremblay played a few times a week, years back ... spent some time on IGS in the 90s ... usually has at least on Go game on his machine ... and firmly intends to get back into it.

* RobinMillette has played for 2-3 years now, mostly with a single partner. We pretty much started at the same level. I've also played a bit on IGS, but that was so long ago I'm not rated there anymore. I just learned about the go/wiki server - that's going to make a few of my friends really happy :)

* BobBockholt learned by playing co-workers during lunch hour for a year or two, plays against his brother when he's available, has played on-line but didn't like it, is a good loser because he has to be.

* TimTwelves stopped playing for a while but is now playing on tuesdays again.

There's quite a lot of Go-playing software about, we'd probably need someone to host a server...
	* Dragon Go Server: http://www.dragongoserver.net/ (this is different from the next two - it's less time based)
	* Internet Go Server: http://www.pandanet.co.jp/English/
	* KGS: http://www.gokgs.com/

Go Playing Software:
	* ManyFacesOfGo - http://www.smart-games.com/manyfaces.html. Rated at anywhere to 10 kyu up to 6 kyu. Costs money, but I would recommend it for anybody still learning as it has tutorials, problems, move suggestions and pro games. -- ChrisHyser

	* GnuGo - http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html. GPL'd version of Go, primarily for use with Unix/Linux but there are versions for Mac and Windows. Console only but web page provides links to graphical and other versions of Go. -- PaulMillar
** ''GnuGo is allegedly comparable in strength to ManyFaces, though I couldn't tell you exactly. Sometimes the newest version of GnuGo seems quite a bit '''weaker''' than the last - the development is a challenge, because tweaking a HeuristicRule to improve handling in some cases invariably breaks others. Or so I'm told. See http://senseis.xmp.net/?GnuGo.''

	* TanGo - http://www.amourtan.com/. Good GPL'd client for Windows, uses GnuGo (supplied with GUI) for play against the computer and allows connection to GoServers. Can also act as a local server as well. -- PaulMillar

	* Oriental Board Game of Go - http://www.zillion.freeuk.com/go/go.html. Free version for Windows. -- PaulMillar

StoneyBallard, a former co-worker of mine, wrote a Go-Manager in Lisp (it didn't attempt to play, it painted a board, knew the rules, and kept score while two humans played) back in 1980 or so. He and I used to play daily during the early eighties. -- TomStambaugh

I hope you guys are all using SenseisLibrary (a Wiki Go site) at http://senseis.xmp.net/. -- JulianDavies
	 :	Seconded as an excellent resource. -- AndyPierce

There will be an Oceania qualifying rounds for the Toyota Denso Cup held in Brisbane during the 2006 Australia day long weekend. And like the previous event held two years ago, professional players will be around for a bit of free tutoring as well. You can have some fun, free quality tee-shirt and more (last time there was a very good dinner at river front venue). Follow the link at http://senseis.xmp.net/?ToyotaDensoCup if you think you deserve a free expense paid trip to Japan as a champion of that hobbyist competition.
