by BrianKernighan, PjPlauger

A much-imitated book that is itself (something of) an imitation of Strunk and White's seminal TheElementsOfStyle.

This is a classic book that takes a very interesting approach to teaching good programming style:

''It teaches using bad coding examples taken from published programming books''

A bit dated, but one of those classics (like DonKnuth's ArtOfComputerProgramming series) that you can still learn something new from.
