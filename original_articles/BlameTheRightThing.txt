Do not make HastyGeneralization, BlameTheRightThing, BeSpecific
blame the language, blame the compiler, blame the framework, blame the methodology, blame the IDE, blame the developer, but blame the thing that actually is causing the problem, or people will start switching precisely those things that were working right.

See BlameTheFrameworkNotTheLanguage  for context.
