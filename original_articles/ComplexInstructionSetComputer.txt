Historically, the opposite of ReducedInstructionSetComputer.

Interestingly enough, the term CISC was (I believe) coined by the RISC camp, and was frequently used as a pejorative for processors with such architectures, including the MotorolaSixtyEightKay and the ExEightySix architecture. The term CISC was never used until there was a RISC architecture in opposition.

Other examples of CISC architectures which were prominent at one point include the Vax.
