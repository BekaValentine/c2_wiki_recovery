Mckoi SQL Database is an SQL (Structured Query Language) Database management system written for the JavaTM platform. Mckoi SQL Database is optimized to run as a client/server database server for multiple clients, however it can also be embedded in an application as a stand-alone database. It is highly multi-threaded and features an extendable object-oriented engine. 

Mckoi SQL Database started as an internal project and has since evolved from its inception in 1998. The main goals of the project are a code base that is simple to maintain and extend, ease of use and administration, robustness, multiple concurrent access, and performance. 

McKoi uses SnapshotIsolation which makes it immune to deadlocking and very fast but comes with the disadvantage that its performance degrades badly in scenarios with multiple concurrent writers.
