When quoting a previous message, don't put your reply above the quote. It is hard for others to understand what you are talking about.

'''Bad''':

   Me too.

   > Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
   > blah blah. Blah blah blah blah.


'''Good''':

   > Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
   > blah blah. Blah blah blah blah.

   Me too.

'''But,'''

Putting short replies beneath or inline with large quotes makes it difficult to notice the replies.  There are cases where putting an important reply first really does make sense.  For example:

   I approve the proposed course of action.
