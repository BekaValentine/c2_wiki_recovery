I am a software architect at SolutionsIQ in Bellevue, WA.  I'm currently working on a business information management system for higher education, and have recently contributed to building an end-to-end database-to-screen application framework in Java.

In my CopiousFreeTime, I work on a distributed organ donor information system for LDT Systems.
