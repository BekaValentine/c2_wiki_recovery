''It is a GoodThing to create systems which do not make older acceptable and functional items unacceptable and non-functional '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20140622
----
It is irritating to update a system only to find that previously operative functions and processes are not allowed to continue to operate cooperatively within the new system as they did within the old system, particularly when their behavior and state is identified by the new system as no longer to be allowed, especially since it had previously the property of "ItWorks".

A perfectly acceptable new system need not have as a prerequisite that it must disallow old ways and means to allow new ways and means, particularly since it can be made to allow conversion and transition.  
----
This is a good reason to begin to develop and perfect user identifiable behaviors and states. Those which do not require and depend upon systems identifiable behaviors and states, and can be made to exclude "collisions" and "exceptions".
