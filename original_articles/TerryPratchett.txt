'''General discussion'''

Terry writes brilliant humorous fantasy. His book The Colour of Magic is on my list of five best fantasy books of all time. -- KentBeck

I second that emotion  -- AlistairCockburn

I agree. What are the other four? -- MartineDevos

See FunnyFantasy for one list.

I prefer "Mort", but agree that Pratchett is great. -- BetsyHanesPerry


"Small Gods" is roaringly funny. -- DaveSmith


I haven't read Hogfather yet, but I can recommend all the other books. They are extremely funny. If you get a chance to read one (or more) do so!

-- RobertPhillips

Hogfather is quite good as well - Pterry has cost me a fair bit in shipping charges for books, since they seem to be so difficult to get here in the 
states.  Gotta run off and get Jingo and the Last Continent...

I don't know if it's my cultural ignorance or what, but the books seem less funny as date of publication increases (this is not meant to be a negative comment - I still find them to be riveting reads and highly recommend them). I laughed out loud at the Colour of Magic and the Light Fantastic, giggled through the ones through Pyramids, and snickered at next few. I'm not sure what this says about anything...

-- BillJamison

This is surprising to me as I find his books the opposite. The Colour of Magic, and The Light Fantastic seemed rather flat when I first read them, and they still do when I go back to them.  Personally I consider Interesting Times and Hogfather to be his best, closely followed by Mort.  And of course being an Australian enjoy The Last Continent. -- AndraeMuys

Someone made the observation years ago on alt.fan.pratchett that people tend to consider the first Pratchett book that they've read as the best. That somewhat holds true in my case - I consider ''Mort'' to be one of Pterry's best.
-- AlexValdez

Fantastic, it's great to see there are like minded individuals out there. I've got 20 of the 22 Discworld novels and they're all hilarious! One for the American audience has to be "Moving Pictures" and any Australians out there may find "The Last Continent" amusing. -- StuartBarker

The language spoken by the Celts in "Soul Music" is Welsh by the way.
("Sioni bydd dda" = Sonny B Goode, "Imp y Celyn" = Bud The Holly,...)

-- some guy

Really, you should read both "Jingo" and "Night Watch", they're really mature writings and have really good cynics about politics.
-- Matteo

'''Good Omens'''

Also check out his collaboration with NeilGaiman, "Good Omens", hands-down the funniest book about the Apocalypse. -- BetsyHanesPerry

Actually, I'd include Good Omens as the hands-down funniest book about the creation, all of human history and the apocalypse all three! -- KyleBrown

"Good Omens" was a great tale of a boy and his dog... SF Site is a great place to find reviews of science fiction and fantasy books. It's led me to several books that I never would have picked up otherwise. -- KatyMulvey

The first Pratchett I read was Equal Rites, which I started reading in a supermarket that happened to have one of those rotatey book stands to the annoyance of my parents who were trying to buy food for us all at the time. I went off and bought CoM & tLF a few weeks later to read them first. While they're not the greatest, they're still good. I don't buy Mr Pratchett's books anymore - I'm waiting for him to stop writing diskworld novels, which frankly started feeling a little tired at about #12...

Good Omens is a nice standalone read.

-- KatieLucas

The Discworld RPG is not by Pratchett alone, but it is 1) very funny 2) a good "behind the scenes" look at the Discworld 3) 
an excellent roleplaying game. -- LorenzoGatti
