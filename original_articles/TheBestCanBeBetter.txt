Even TheBestCanBeBetter.

Thoughts:
* Best is relative. Over time the Best will be unseated if they do not improve.
* Best is often a "subjective" opinion at a point in time. Requirements and sentiments change, the Best can become the Worst overnight.
* Best is an "overall" indicator averaged by many considerations. So the Best may have a long way to go in some aspects.
* Sometimes it is counterproductive to aim to be the Best. There is nothing against to set for improvements to "Personal Best".

''Progression pattern''

	1. Follow the footsteps of the giants
	2. Stay in the shadow of the giants
	3. Climb onto the shoulder of the giants to extend boundaries
	4. Behave like a giant and become a shelter for others

	 :	look to the master,
	 :	follow the master,
	 :	walk with the master,
	 :	see through the master,
	 :	become the master.
