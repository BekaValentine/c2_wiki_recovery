I am a software developer in StockholmSweden, and I am currently writing my master essay, "Pair Programming - the dynamic duo", in which I evaluate the efficiency of PairProgramming.

Almost consistently I have found significant benefits with PairProgramming. Amongst others:

 - The time to develop code decreases
 - PairProgramming has a positive effekt on the error rate in the code 
 - PairProgramming contributes to a increased comfort
 - The transference of knowledge amongst the participants increases
