PatternEnvy is when people try to call something a pattern that really isn't, but they wish it was, for one or more of the following reasons:

* They want the "patterns" buzzword associated with it to increase its attraction and its audience

* They think "patterns are cool and good" and they also think what they've done is cool and good and therefore must be a pattern.

* They think they have a good, reusable solution to a recurring problem, but don't yet understand that the solution needs to recur as well as the problem (its not enough to be reusable, it has to have already been used several times)

* They think they have a recurring solution because they've used it three times, but none of the known uses are at all independent

* They think patterns are recurring physical objects rather than recurring themes on logical or physical objects.

A pattern needs to pass some PatternityTest''''''s before it can rightfully be called a pattern. See PatternsMisconceptions for other misuses and misunderstandings of patterns.

Wow, that was quick!  [In echoing part of what I said in response to someone sarcastically calling COM a pattern on the GangOfFour mailing list] People might tend to associate patterns with physical things out of nature.  In ChristopherAlexander's TheTimelessWayOfBuilding, his patterns cover recurring themes in rooms, buildings, regions, etc. rather than the things themselves.  I equate this with software by thinking of patterns as recurring things that are about components, about objects, or about systems. -- PhilipEskelin
