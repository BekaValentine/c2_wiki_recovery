'''UserName management scheme needed'''

Currently, in Oct05, there is an influx of new people, a result of a more relaxed EditCodeWord setup. I suggest we put a FlyingVisitor stamp on unrecognized people who create UserNames and nothing else that is OnTopic. For others who create UserName and have been recognized (maybe thru IP) to participate in community activities, then we add a CategoryHomePage to the created UserName. If the created UserName represent a recognized name in the computing field, then maybe we add CategoryPerson if it could be of interest.
* If there is a recognized IT person UserName added, we may want to watch the activities related to that name for a few days. If nothing happens we may want stamp it with DeletedButWelcomeToWiki.
* If we do not do anything for a few days, then weeks later it will be hard to guess whether a UserName was created in good faith. A better solution probably exists but I am too tired to think. -- dl
