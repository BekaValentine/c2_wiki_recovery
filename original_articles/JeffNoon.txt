English ScienceFiction author from Manchester.

Best known work is his first (the curse of all authors), ''Vurt'' from 1993.

Jeff's writing stands out because he not only experiments with content (like a lot of SciFiAuthors do); he also experiments with form, without making it irritating or obscuring the content. Examples of this can be found in ''Pixel Juice'' (1998), where several stories segue into the next one, like one would find in music, and where some stories are remixed as poems; and in ''Needle in the Groove'' (2000), which is written as if it were song lyrics.
