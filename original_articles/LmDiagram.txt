The lm-diagram is a diagram that shows what happens when you apply unrestricted grammatical rewriting rules to a stream of input symbols. It was devised during the 1970s by PeriHankey and can be dynamically generated by the LanguageMachine. The diagram is explained at http://languagemachine.sourceforge.net/.
