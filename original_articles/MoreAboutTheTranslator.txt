The translator converts text to html (HyperTextMarkupLanguage). It performs the conversion on-the-fly as each page is read. This lets us...
* Translate based on database state
* Search the full text before translation
A sequence of text substitutions perform the conversion. There are around a dozen TextFormattingRegularExpressions equally divided between...
* Paragraphs
* Lists
* Emphasis
* References
It is from them that we get the TextFormattingRules.

If I may ask, where in WardsOriginalWiki does this occur?
