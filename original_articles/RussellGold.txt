Software Developer working for Oracle on the Oracle Container for Java (OC4J).

Author and maintainer of HttpUnit.

Learned to recognize and think in patterns thanks to talks by HansRohnert, MichaelStal, and WardCunningham at the 1997 SIGS Java Conference.

First attempt at documenting a pattern on Wiki is HelperMethodForInitializations.

Russell, I posted a suggestion at HttpUnit about using this wiki to collect HttpUnitDocumentation.   Please let me know if this idea has any merit before I'm tempted to write docs that don't do anyone any good. :)   thanks, PhilipReed
