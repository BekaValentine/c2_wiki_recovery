
A phrase, when used by marketeers and other technology promoters, usually means "using an (often-crippled) language that nobody has ever heard of, and that nobody likely will ever like, rather than choosing an established language that only some (more likely most) of the people don't like.''

In other words, it's frequently more expedient to inconvenience/annoy everybody equally, rather than delight some segment of the population and annoy the rest.

Applies to NaturalLanguage as well as the computer variety; many of the ConLang''''''s were developed under the premise that many people would be resistant (if not hostile) to using the native language of some other culture (English, French, whatever) as a common tongue.  (Interestingly enough, that worked in India; where English and not any of the local languages, serves as the common tongue).

Often times, attempts to create a LanguageNeutral solution end up ReinventingTheWheel, and doing it poorly.
