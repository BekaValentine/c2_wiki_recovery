It is difficult, but extremely desirable to UseRealExamples when talking about WikiOnWiki. Once an example is cited it becomes one of the ThingsOnWikisMind. Careless editing disregarding the original context can deprive the original citation of any validity. 

'''Therefore,''' preserve old copies of pages if necessary for the meta-conversation. For example,  EgSoftwareCannotBeModeled holds the previous version of SoftwareCannotBeModeled. This way, the main page can continue on improving whilst the meta-conversation has something tangible to work from.

One could use the EditCopy to hold the ''before'' and the top copy ''after'' a refactoring you want to use as an example. Start both versions with the same text saying, in effect, "Immutable, please don't touch" with a link to the differencer for convenience.

'''But,''' this violates ForgiveAndForget. Use sparingly and, if possible, temporarily.
