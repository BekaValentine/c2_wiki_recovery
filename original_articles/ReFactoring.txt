Without changing the functionality of the program, it is possible to improve the code of a program by refactoring.

'''Typical refactoring operations''':
* change the name of a variable
* change the name of a class or structure definition
* change the name of a method or function
* change the type of a variable or class member
* change the name of a parameter in a function/method definition
* convert an inner class to a top-level class definition
* convert inline code into a method or function
etc.

@tunixman: ''if there is no unit test, why should we use refactoring''''''s?''

@bigballofmud BrianFoote: Technically yes, but so is blindfolded brain surgery. 

You unit test guys crack me up. You're like heroin junkies, but funnier.
