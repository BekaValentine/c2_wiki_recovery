Some companies release software by having one the the developers compile the product on their development computer by manually operating an IDE like VisualStudioDotNet.  If they press all the right buttons and have all the components correctly installed, a successful build results and is shipped to customers.  

Level 2 of BuildSystem maturity.  On a special build box a BuildMonkey presses all the right buttons to produce a build, which is then shipped.

Level 3 is including all the needed components, compilers, linkers, headers and libraries in the code repository. Then you have one big build script (Makefile) build it all!

''All of the IDEs I've used for the last 7 years can invoke the same build scripts that produce the production deliverables.  There's only one "right button" to push and it's clearly labeled.''
