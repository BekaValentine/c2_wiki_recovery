Hi! I used the Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT) for 5 years beginning in 1994, and actively beta-tested Robert Masenten's AGiliTy interpreter (see AgiliTy [sic]) and MagxCompiler. I maintained my own home pages for AGT, AGiliTy, and Magx, and offered several suggestions to Mr. Masenten for expanding AGT as it stood at that time.

In March 1997, I began learning GrahamNelson's Inform 6 (see InformLanguage), and I started the "Inform for Dummies" thread on rec.arts.int-fiction in December 1997 (out of sheer desperation, I might add). I took a 2.5 year hiatus from IF beginning in mid-2000. Since then, I've quit using the variants of AGT, and have switched exclusively to programming in Inform.

I am also eternally indebted to LucianSmith (author of "The Edifice," Comp97's 1st place winner) for initiating the InteractiveFictionInformTips page.
	* I asked the desperate query about replicating the "Trinity" intro, and figured out how to (crudely) implement location-sensitive hints like AGT's on the Inform Tips page (at IntFicInformTips). (Thanks for the additional clarification.)
	* I also wanted to know how to implement flags (I now suggest setting the "general" attribute) and timers (a.k.a. "counters," in AGT parlance).
	* I wrote the verbose little summaries entitled "AgtLanguage," "AgiliTy," and "MagxCompiler," as well.
	* My Magx/AGiliTy game "E-MAILBOX" placed 27th out of 34 entries in the 1997 Annual IF Competition.

	* Adam Cadre's June 1998 "Chicken Comp" inspired my first "official" Inform release entitled "POLLO Y CAMINO (Chicken and Road)."  Now being betatested and updated for Release 2.

I submitted updated versions of both of these games for inclusion in Cascade Mountain Publishing's "Millennia Anthology" CD-ROM compiled by Michael Berlyn, but since CMP closed its doors in Spring 2000, the CD won't be materializing. Sorry!
