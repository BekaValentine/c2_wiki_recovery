Since May 1996 I maintain a collection of links about ObjectOrientedProgramming with more than 3200 links. This collection will be further enhanced.

Main topics of the collection are:

	* General Information and Links

	* Distributed Objects, Business Objects, Object Request Brokers, ActiveX/OLE, Corba, JavaBeans/RMI, OpenDoc

	* OOA/OOD Methods and Tools, Diagram Layout

	* Languages, Ada, C++, Delphi, Eiffel, Java, JavaScript, Modula-3, Oberon, Objective-C, Python, Sather, Smalltalk, VBScript, Visual Basic, Visual C++

	* Databases, OO DBMS, OR DBMS, OR Mapping

	* Patterns, Libraries, Frameworks

	* Metrics, Reuse, Testing, Numerics

	* Services and Companies

The collection runs on a server in Heidelberg, Germany. Mirrors are available for faster access from other contries. (URLs of the original site and mirror sites see below).

This collection which you may find interesting might encourage you to add some of your own.
