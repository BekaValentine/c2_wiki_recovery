The NoteWiki is a small vb wiki for desktops looks like it could be easily ported to PocketPc s by recompiling with eVB. Only problem is keeping it synced properly with the desktop version but with ActiveSync and/or some programming even that could be solved. Then you could have a PocketPc WikiAsPim. There is already PalmWiki and NoteStudio.
