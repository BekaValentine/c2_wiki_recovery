In other topics on "quality" it's often pointed out that in general users prefer "more features" over quality (fewer bugs) in the market-place. There seems to be a similar pattern with regard to security: users prefer features and convenience over security, at least "strong" security. They want some security, but will not sacrifice feature for "heavy" security.

Do you agree? Any anecdotes either way?
