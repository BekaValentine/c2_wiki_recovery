A MisFeature is something that is not exactly a formal error in the code or even the design. MisFeatures are intentional features that, even if they work correctly and as designed, are poor features. They are bad ideas. 

A classic example of a 'MisFeature' is the modal dialogs on systems that steal focus mid-keystroke from a foreground application to a background application to notify you that some trivial event has happened with a message along the line of:

"Just Reporting Back that something the junior designer thought was noteworthy has happened. He thought it was important enough to not only interrupt your work immediately, but stop it completely until you attend to this application. You can't do anything until you acknowledge the event. Click OK to continue."

mis•fea•ture : A feature required by your product manager and appropriate for the software's target audience that you personally don't like.
* I'm curious as to whether the "that you personally don't like" is a misplaced modifier or a double entendre.
