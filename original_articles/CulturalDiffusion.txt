Cultural diffusion, was first conceptualized by Alfred L. Kroeber in his 1940 paper Stimulus Diffusion. to describe the spread of cultural items—such as ideas, styles, religions, technologies, languages etc.—between individuals, whether within a single culture or from one culture to another.

Examples are evident in pages such as BritishCulturalAssumption and others which can be found with:

Being that this wiki and others are visited by people who have differing customs and ways of framing their interactions with others who are members or participants, wiki can be a means of sharing cultural items. Fostering understanding and harmony beween their cultural habitations. Travel can also be such an agent, if in travelling, one interacts with the local people with unambiguous sincerity. 

Being active in this wiki and having travelled to many other countries, as well as having been temporarily assigned to a workplace in a country having a great deal of cultural differences, I can attest to the importance of interaction as a means of understanding and useful in widening ones own perspectives.

Sometimes the impact of culture and its artifacts will influence one in significant and harmonious ways. This can be particularly so if one is relating with a positive and adaptive stance, and if one can be inclusive, rather than exclusive in attitude towards different ways of living and reacting to the human environment.
