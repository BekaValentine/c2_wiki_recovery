It's been a while since I've been around WardsWiki, and to be honest I wasn't here long in 
the first place. I do, however, consider it one of the more interesting corners of the web
I've found so far.

Lately I've been teaching myself AspDotNet.  I've developed an interesting little 
Wiki''''''Ish project but I don't generally want to show it to anyone until I've worked on 
it a bit more.

Forgive me if this introduction is a little short; perhaps I'll add more detail in the course
of things.
