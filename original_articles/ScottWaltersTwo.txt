Oddly enough, there was already a Scott Walters ( aka ScottWalters ) on Wiki.

Anyhow, I've decided to be # 2. A masters student at CharlesSturtUniversity, NSW, Australia, I'm currently studying amongst other things online collaboration - hence the interest in Wiki.

Hi ScottWaltersTwo, this is ScottWalters -- pleased to meet you. 
I once joined an Atari Jaguar hacking list with about 30 people on it only to find another
Scott Walters was already active on the list. 
My home Wiki page at http://perldesignpatterns.com/?ScottWalters has a list of other Scott
Walters I've found Googling. 
Welcome to add yourself =)

Cheers!
