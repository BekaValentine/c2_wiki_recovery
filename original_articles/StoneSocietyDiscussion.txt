If SS can keep a secret, StoneSociety can be used non-virtually. There are those who have operated their democratic societies using jars of white and black stones.  --PCP

''I want to see it running. Viable large scale online community structures don't exist yet. The more attempts at a solution the better. The StoneSociety was well thought out, but not yet executed to determine its viability. Besides, my neck is hurting from watching the skies for so long. ;) --ss''

[Sorry to interject yet again. From the StoneSociety page:

	 :	Can you give us some extended StoneSocietyScenarios? that will illustrate just how it will work? I would be particularly interested in seeing examples of multiple simultaneous auctions of different durations, donkey preferences, and attempts by groups to subvert a society. 

	 :	''I'd be very interested in detailed StoneSocietyScenarios? myself, but building a prototype is on the top of my list. I'd be interested in both scenarios of how the thing could work and how it could fail, And I'd be very interested in proposals for Charters. Up for grabs.''

Well, one of the best ways to do this kind of research is to invite an author to write fiction about it. Does anybody remember "Starship Troopers" (the book, of course)? How about "Oath of Fealty"? What about "The Time Machine"? If we can get some SF author interested in doing some fiction based on a StoneSociety we might get a bunch of our what-if infrastructure questions answered.]

So you just need to find a desert island, dump some people on it and test this out... to finance this, set up some cameras and sell Stone Society Survivor
to CBS. With or without the encryptional NomicGame morality enforcer.

''I offer one white stone to anyone who can'' really ''figure out what I'm talking about ;-) --PCP''

Fraternities. That's $500 and a white stone. ;->

''Okay. Frats. That's those buildings off campus with greek letters on them, huh?''

New rule - if you get a white stone back, you get paid a little dinero.

If you look on VotingPatterns/BlackAndWhiteMarbleVote, you will see RogerLipscombe has already written about your little comment months ago. Well, if that is what you meant, of course. If it is, I get one point for the assist (I smashed the appropriate words together on VotingPatterns). -- SunirShah

Imagine your first day of school and your teacher gives out 50 new white and 25 black round styrofoam stones, like river cobbles, an equal number to each kid, and says their long term goal is to keep just the number they got. Then the teacher asks an easy question and the kids vote on which answer they like best, using the stones to ... bet on getting them back when they respond. Stones lost are divided out among the winners. --PCP

''No heck. It would teaching them that voting is good, and if you vote correctly you get your stones back.''

And they would then ''use'' that knowledge instead of ''warehouse'' it.

''But aren't they learning to gamble?''

Yes, and bookkeep, and use laws. So? --PCP

''Interesting, but what if your preferred answer is a losing answer? You penalize individual choice too harshly I think. There should not be a 'correct' vote as such.''

What were they trying to say, and to whom? This same question arises concerning our own societies use of stones.
