Is a wiki an environment for ConstructivistLearning? What are its uses as an educational medium?

''Refactored from the original page text to make a link to ConstructivistLearning and make the question clearer (I don't think PossibleUsesOfWiki was what the original poster meant). Now, as to the question, I have no idea. Off the top of my head, the answer is "it depends on what you do with it". Wiki is a technology for recording and sharing knowledge. It's about as much of a constructivist learning environment as is a bulletin board or a journal.'' --MattChaput
