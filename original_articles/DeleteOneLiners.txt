One way to forestall the imminent EndOfWiki. Delete one line contributions. Most one line contributions are worthless. Me toos, or cheerios, or shut up you clowns. Most could easily be done as edits on the page, but are threaded out of laziness. If anyone cares enough about 'em to get het up, let them either edit or expand.

''What about one line questions?''

I think there's a place for the incisive one line summary, and some of the one-line jokes are worth preserving.

Let's not allow size of a contribution to be the mark of its quality. Think of this, if the deletion of single line statements became more prevelant, and people became more verbose as a result, the single line deletion policy could have the reverse effect of its intention of improving the quality of wiki.

''Therefore: don't delete one liners, recognize them as a potential TextSmell and consider refactoring them there and then. They are short, so shouldn't take much effort to consider refactoring. Possible outcomes of refactoring include (of course) deleting it outright or leaving the damn thing alone.''

One liners are the hallmark of a master of communication, because these individuals can say all that needs to be said in one little sentence just like this.
