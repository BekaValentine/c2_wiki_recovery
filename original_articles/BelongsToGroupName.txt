This is a way which may be used to Group Pages.

I have always thought the CategoryCategory tag was a confusing way to group the Categories pages. I thought at first something like C''''''ategoryList would be better, but it would be ambiquous, since it could also refer to lists in general. Many of the CategoryCategory pages share a grouping characteristic more than they do a category characteristic.

Here is a solution which can be used in wikis, if not in this one:

Tag the page at its bottom with something like:

(for RoadMaps):
* BelongsToRoadmaps
Other possibilities:
* BelongsToTopics
* BelongsToWikiGnomes
* BelongsToXpers

Then when one wishes to discover the members of the group, two clicks will give them.

Another way this tag may be useful is by typing BelongsTo in the Search box:
* [Search]

Belongs To is another way of saying ''Item in NamedCollection''
