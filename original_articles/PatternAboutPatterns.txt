This arose out of the ShieldPattern discussion, where I seemed to find that there were a lot of different ideas about what a ShieldPattern was, and they all seemed to be correct, but at different levels of detail.  So, I put forth that the ShieldPattern was a MetaPattern, but that discussion seemed to be more about a way to discuss patterns better.  Thus, this page.  --PeteHardie
