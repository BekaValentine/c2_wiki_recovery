DrDobbsJournal's professional flamer, formerly the Editor-in-Chief of DDJ.

Responsible for the critically acclaimed quote here: StarBucks.

A soft-spoken, self-effacing, bespectacled gentleman with a top-ten command of irony and an incisive wit.  One of those people for whom "the pen is mightier" is not simply a cliche.
