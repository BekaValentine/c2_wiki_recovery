The poem is accompanied by a comprehensive glossary of Australian slang, without which non-Australians may not understand the poem.

Actually, I doubt the poem is understandable, even with the aid of the glossary, if you didn't grow up surrounded by Australian slang.

For those to whom the poem is accessible, it documents human nature in a comprehensive and unpretentious way.
