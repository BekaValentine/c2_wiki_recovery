Norm was the long time editor of the OOPSLA proceedings.
I begged him to edit for me in 1989, and it worked out
great. His part of the program was no problem at all.

He also gave a great demo of InterMedia at AppleComputer
at around the same time. The MacApp folks were amazed at
what he had done with their (at the time formative) work.
