You are a creative person (well duh, because you are a software developer and a Wiki contributor!)  Since you are creative you also have other creative outlets... you paint, you play music, you write fiction.  So you know about the Muse.

How do you go about ManagingYourMuse?  Or does your Muse manage you?

Why is it necessary to manage a muse?  Well, if you wish to remain a completely WhimsicalPerson then you don't have to manage your muse.  But since a given muse tends to teach you about TheMediumAndItsProperties you need to allocate your (unfortnately, limited amount of) time to a muse long enough to become a bit of a SubjectExpert to acquire sufficient DomainKnowledge.

* KillYourWhimsy
* Be a boring person
* Be efficient at survival skills so you have more time to dedicate to a Muse
* Be poor (restricted funds reduces your whimsy)

*''I have to disagree with that last one, by forcing more creativity and less consumerism being poor can actually boost one's 'Muse'.''
