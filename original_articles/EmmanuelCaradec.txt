I'm a software developer living in Montpellier in France. I'm currently working with networking and gui intensive project. 

I worked in on the video game Tork in the last year. A nice project that had some difficulties to get out. See the review :

I worked on the 3d renderer and the in house collision/physic system. 

I discovered c2 some year ago. I'm now applying TestDrivenDevelopment as much as I can in my work.
