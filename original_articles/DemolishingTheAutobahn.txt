Occasionally, there is a tendency to overlook the merits of a given action in favour of the person perpetrating it.  GoodPeople do not always do GoodThing''''''s, likewise BadPeople do not always do BadThing''''''s.  If one makes a it a habit to PlayTheManNotTheBall, the consequences are many and varied.  GoodThing''''''s attributed to BadPeople may be shot down in flames, and people may get hurt - you may even KillTheHostage.  Similarly, if GoodPeople are allowed to get away with BadThing''''''s, the UnintendedConsequences will be less than pleasant, especially if people realize they have been SleepWalking.

As part of an EgolessWiki, we should avoid ascribing value to a contribution based ''solely'' on the identity of its contributor.  Otherwise we are left with little choice but to demolish 7500 miles of autobahn.
