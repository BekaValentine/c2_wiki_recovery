Became interested in Alexander and Patterns while developing 
a project management system for an Archtiectural firm.  
Patterns seemed to be a good way to organize what we had 
been calling "cliches" without really making any good use 
of them.

Our joint venture with the architects was unexpectedly 
terminated in January when they got into financial difficulty.
We have regrouped with half of that team (5 of us) and are
branching into other domains.  We have a prototype and a 
proposal which we expect to close on within a week or two, 
in the Health Care Outcomes industry.

Our work is primarily in C++, we use MATISSE as our Object
Database, and our major areas of focus are semantic modeling,
platform portability and an architecture that allows user
interfaces to change dynamically, as the underlying model
changes.
