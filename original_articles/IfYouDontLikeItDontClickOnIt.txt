One IanMcDonald, author of BrunoTheBandit, had a curious experience doing a regular Saturday strip for the notorious SluggyFreelance:

A one-sided view of the fate of "Meanwhile, in the Dimension of Pain" appears here:

That slant attempts to blame Ian for the strip's negative response. The fan-boys and -girls who flamed the strip (and who wrote that report) justify their reaction by claiming, for example, Ian indulged in potty-mouth humor, compared to Pete Abrams' sterling erudition.

This is patently absurd in the face of overwhelming evidence. SluggyFreelance named one story, for example, "Torg Potter and the Chamberpot of Secretions."

What really happened was very simple. Everyone has a short list of web sites they visit periodically. People who needed a daily SF fix could not adapt to a slightly different strip each Saturday. In short, they could not prevent themselves from clicking on, and disliking, a web page they already knew they would dislike.

To prove this theory, Pete wrote and inked an MITDP episode. The fan-children flamed it, not realizing that their idol Pete wrote it.
