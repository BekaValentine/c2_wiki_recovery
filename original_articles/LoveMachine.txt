LoveMachine is a StartUp by SecondLife founder PhilipRosedale that wants to apply a new CodingCostModel.

LoveMachine has built an application that is open to the public where they do all their work as a team â€“ the WorkList. By going here, developers can find or suggest tasks that they would like to work on for LoveMachine. The developer can place a bid for each WorkItem that he wants to work on.

The GoldOwner can define so-called runners, who can spend the budget and accept bids. After a bid gets accepted, the developer can start to work and complete the WorkItem. Soon after completion and CodeReview, the developers get InstantGratification and are paid with payment services like PayPal.
