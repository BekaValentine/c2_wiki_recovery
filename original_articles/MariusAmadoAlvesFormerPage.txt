I'm a researcher on Adaptive Hypertext and other things at www.liacc.up.pt

2003


Before I said:

"I am a programmer and a linguist from Portugal.

I work on the DarkSideOfNlp, i.e. working NaturalLanguageProcessing software, and on my thesis Computational Lexicon Engineering, with the New University of Lisbon.

I am revisiting the WikiWeb after a big while. (2000?)

And today again. (2002)"


And before that I seem to have contributed to perfecting the Wiki system:

The searches don't seem to work for some browsers. Try typing "http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=ralph" instead. 

(Note to the Search coder: try "<form action=the_cgi>". This has happened to me. Let me know if it is a pattern.)--MarioAmadoAlves 

I made the change you suggest. Thanks for the tip. -- WardCunningham
