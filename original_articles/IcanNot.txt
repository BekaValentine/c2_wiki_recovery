''A statement of a frame of mind and position on action/inaction. It is derived from skills, beliefs and attitudes '' DoingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20140730

For the unskilled, it is a true and understandable statement. For the skilled, however, its meaning is more complex.

In both cases, it is an attitude arising from inner convictions and beliefs, supported or unsupported by reason. 

It is a common attitude which is exercised regularly. Some use it to state an inner conviction which prohibits them from doing the thing, while others give reasons why no-one can do the thing. 

The statement is also made in collective or impersonal form, as in: We can not, We do not, You can not, You do not, They can not, They do not, It can not, It does not.

It is offered as a reason or excuse for an inactivity, or for lack of progress, or of a lack of understanding the problem.

I've done many things that are "impossible". I find that most often when someone says that something can't be done, they're really expressing their opinion that they don't want to do it or that they don't want it to be done.

I like to say...
'''''"Nothing is impossible; it's only a matter of time and money."'''''
Of course, it may cost so much time and money that you don't want it anymore.
''But that's another issue.''
