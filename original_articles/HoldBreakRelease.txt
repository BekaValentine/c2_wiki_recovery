When approaching a new discipline,

1. First you adhere to the dogma. This teaches you the classical ways, and gives you a good start when in unfamiliar territory.
2. Then you break the dogma. This will rejuvenate the learning process, though it is likely to have some pain.
3. Then you are released from the dogma. You can freely float between neither errant extreme, because you know the effects of either.
