A LinuxDistribution.  More generally RockLinux is a distribution build
kit you can build your own Linux distribution by choosing the software
(packages) you want to include and specifying the compilation
optimization options, the custom GNU configure options etc.

Mostly oriented towards system administrators.  Rock Linux aims to be
easily specialized to many special-purpose targets like single-disk
routers, embedded systems, CD-based, cluster node, etc.

RockLinux is made from scratch, it is not based on other major
distributions like RedHat or DebianGnuLinux.
