IncrementalMethod refers to a programmer who makes a quick change, and does some simple tests of the effect of the change, right away. Since it takes less than five seconds to verify that a form or other element of a program runs as intended, the programmer is more likely to check and improve and check and improve in a very tight iterative loop, lasting less than a few minutes per cycle. Programmers who like to improve and test their applications incrementally often find an InterpretedLanguage, and/or RapidApplicationDevelopment tools help them be more productive.
