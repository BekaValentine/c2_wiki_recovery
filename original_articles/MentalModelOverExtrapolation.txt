We all have a view or MentalModel of various aspects of software or IT or even life (politics, relationships, etc.). However, sometimes we over-extrapolate the universality of this model, projecting it into other people or sometimes even machines, '''without realizing it's not universal''', or not the only possible working or valid mental model. (That is, one of many valid models.) It's a common flaw of human nature. We view the world on our own terms and get frustrated when others don't do the same or don't agree that our preferred model or view is THE RIGHT model. --top
