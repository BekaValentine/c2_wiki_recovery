Most people aren't morning people. So nobody
sees you work or knows what you do. Instead,
everyone notices who stays late at night and
these are the heros. Everyone looks at you
funny when you leave early because they don't
know you started work at 4:30.

''I don't know dude... if you're getting up in the middle of the night to go to work, do you really count as a morning person? ;)''

I HaveThisPattern. I'm a night person, always been a night person. Due to personal scheduling considerations, I had to time-shift in order to get home at a reasonable hour. But then I found that I couldn't get any work done between 8 and 5. So I started coming in to work even earlier, even working from home in the early, early morning. But then it looks like I'm only working a half-day, leaving at 2 or 3. Especially when there's FireFighting going on, the pressure is enormous to stay late--until, like, 5:00--even though my brain is turning into oatmeal from overwork, and I have to admonish myself that even the most critical crisis can wait a few hours for me to get a good night's sleep.
