At the time of writing I am a researcher in the 
computing department at Imperial College [1]
doing a PhD in software composition. The kind of composition I am interested in is the kind that underpins SubjectOrientedProgramming and AspectOrientedProgramming.

I am also an independent consultant in the sense that I have a
company whose name includes the word ''consultants'' [2]. 
Before all this I was a lecturer at De Montfort University [3]
for eight years including two years contracting on a large
O-O project at IBM. When that was over I couldn't wait to
get into full-time research[4]!

I have also been known to Juggle a bit. if you don't believe me,
ask AlistairCockburn.
