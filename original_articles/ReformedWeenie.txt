This page was inspired by Ward's declaration that he was a reformed weenie, and also by my occasional question "What does one do when one realizes one's been an *sshole?" My answer to the second part is "Start a Blog" but a WikiPage is the best I can do between debugging sessions at work.

''Is this a reference to another topic? [Yes. It's a reference to SmugSmalltalkWeenie. -- JasonGrossman] It would be nice to hear some stories of reformed weenies. There may be lessons for those of us who defend our pets with heavy vigor.''

It is my hope that this page will foster SelfAwareness and result in more reformed weenies.
