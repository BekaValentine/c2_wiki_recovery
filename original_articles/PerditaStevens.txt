Actually I've been here many times before August 1998; just haven't got round
to saying so here.

At the moment, I'm mostly interested in systems reengineering patterns -- why not visit 
http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/pxs/reengineering-patterns.html
and see?

If you are interested by Reengineering Patterns take a look at 
http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/patterns/ and do not hesitate to give us feedback.
