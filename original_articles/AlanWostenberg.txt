''A person's a person no matter how small'' -- 
Horton in ''Horton Hears a Who'' by Dr. Seuss [ISBN 0394800788]


Alan provides for his family by means of software engineering. He's been programming for twenty years, the last decade in Smalltalk (Oh, late have I loved thee!). Alan is a Smalltalk developer at Bedrock Software.

He enjoys studying the metaphysical realism of St. Thomas Aquinas and his modern interpreters. As highly compressed structured summaries of live debates, the medieval summae are a model of reasoned debate about complex disputed topics. 

Current interests also include applying ideas in EF Shumacher's classic ''small is beautiful: economics as if people mattered'' ISBN 0-06-091630-3 to software engineering. Lately he's become TestInfected.

Interests in LiterateProgramming, TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign, LightweightDocumentation, LocalityOfReferenceDocumentation, and tracking the fortunes of friends like RandyStafford and StanSilver
