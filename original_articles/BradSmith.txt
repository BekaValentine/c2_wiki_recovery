Describe BradSmith here.

I currently manage a small software development team for a US federal agency in lovely Bend, Oregon. I was recently introduced to ExtremeProgramming via a discussion on the Straight Talking mailing list.

I am an ecologist (scientist not environmentalist) by training with a long background in programming in order to create and/or use the software needed to do any DataAnalysis or modelling.

I have yet to figure out why I ended up managing this development team.
