DelegatorIsDelegationInJava makes Delegation available in the JavaLanguage.

It's an API in native Java so adoption for Java Programmers shouldn't be a problem

It supports full delegation and combines this with java static typing.

It's currently in a proof of concept - stage of development, but I'm doing my masters thesis on the subject (starting feb 2005, ending dec 2005) so improvements should be expected in the near future.

It can be found at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/delegator

If you have any featurerequests / bugreports please let me know so I can incorporate them in my current work.

I'm currently planning on working on
* Performance
* MultiThreading
* Enforcing the java scoping rules / object member access control

Klaas, any chance you could describe what it is you are doing on this? Specifically, what features are missing, why this is a problem, and what you propose to solve the problems?

I looked at the delegation pages and it is all a little vague. I'm hoping you can provide a little clarity by example. --RichardHenderson.

Progress:...
* Delegator couldn't handle Multiple Threads - i.e. would crash - this has been fixed
* A mechanism has been added for monitors in delegation. Note that in a context of delegation objects (which are composed) no longer map to monitors 1 to 1
* Java's access modifiers still pose a problem (though this is now well-documented)
* Exceptions are now passed correctly
* The components which constitute used to leak out (a last twitch of the self-problem) - a solution has been found
