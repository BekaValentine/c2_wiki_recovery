Gentle.NET is a database-independent object persistence framework for .NET written in C#. It features automatic SQL generation and object construction, an advanced caching subsystem, an SQL factory for creating custom queries, a list class for managing 1:n and n:m relations, concurrency control, data binding support, and much, much more.

Gentle supports a wide range of databases and runs under both MS.NET and Mono. Metadata is automatically extracted from the database backend, which minimizes the amount of configuration required.

It is based on ScottAmbler's papers. Supports all major database engines, including Firebird, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server (incl. CE), SQLite and Sybase.
