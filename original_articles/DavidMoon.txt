There are several programmers going by 'David Moon'. David A. Moon is one of the old MitAiLab people. He was involved with the LispMachine and wrote manuals for MacLisp, the LispMachine, and Flavors (an early Lisp ObjectOrientedProgramming system which was a precursor to CommonLispObjectSystem). He also appears in the AiKoans. He later worked on AppleComputer's DylanLanguage (and wrote the book on that too).

''Detailed (or current) information on Moon seems hard to come by. Can anyone help to expand this?''
