Congratulations to those who become more aware that they know less by the day. They have begin to appreciate Einstein's fear of the "increasing circumference of darkness".
* I had a college professor that spoke of knowledge being a white dot surrounded by darkness. As our knowledge grows, the circumference of darkness surrounding it grows as well.
