CompoundWikiWords would be used in procedures executed using a WikiQueryLanguage? (WQL). 

Unimplemented (as yet) in any WikiEngine I know

Possibility Notions: (offered for thinking purposes only, hopefully implementations will follow)

An ExecutableProcessName Followed by a colon, then a WikiWordExpression

To search for pages containing a word in the current wiki:
* Find_Display:PageNames_ContainingWord
To search for pages containing a word in another wiki:
* Find_Display:PageNames_WikiName_ContainingWord

Commands might be assembled into named scripts:
* Search for pages with a given word in a selected wiki
** Find_Listto_PagesFound:PageNames_ContainingWord
* Process the list so as to prepare a page containing a list of found pages as links
** ConvertToHtml:PagesFound
* Save the list page using a given page name
** SaveAs:GivenPagesName
