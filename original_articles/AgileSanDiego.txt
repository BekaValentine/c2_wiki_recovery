Is there a meeting tonight? (The 6th?)

I can't figure this out because the last blog entry at http://www.agilesandiego.org/ is from March. Did y'all disband??

They meet at The Linkery, which is a range-free meats restaurant. The menu literally contains the names of farms the animals came from, such as "Paradise Valley Ranch" or "Somerset County Farms". Etc. They preserve leftover meats as sausages, hence the "link" in the name.

The waitress asked, "How was your pork?" and I said, "I'm going to go home and tell my daughter I got to eat Wilbur from ''Charlotte's Web''."

She was trying to not show how hard she was laughing...
