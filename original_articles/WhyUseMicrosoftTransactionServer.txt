MTS Strengths:

	* Component Transactions - Similar to database transactions, but instead of a transaction encompassing SQL statements, a component transaction encompasses the work of one or more components. MTS provides support for component transactions by monitoring components as they interact with traditional resources such as databases.

	* Transaction Monitoring

	* Object Brokering

	* Resource Pooling

	* Declarative Security

	* Programatic Security

	* Dynamic Load Balancing
