In the past,
we call telephone conversations with AnsweringMachines
PhoneTag
''I left a message on your answering machine''
''You left an answer on my machine''
''AndSoItGoes''
-----
in TimeAndAttentionBrokenEconomy
we are taught about
GeorgeCarlin's CarTagging
Now with the cameras in CellPhones
we can use PhoneTagging 
instead of CarlinsDarts

The magic is in where these photos go!
