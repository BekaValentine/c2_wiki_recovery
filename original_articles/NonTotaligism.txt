A totaligism is a statement that provides every possible answer, and likewise, a NonTotaligism is a statement that doesn't provide every possible answer. -- RobertKausch

''I can't find "totaligism" in the dictionary; could you elaborate? Do you perhaps mean "tautology"?'' -- MikeSmith

OED doesn't have it either. Looks like 'totaligism' a neologism. By the sounds of the above soft definition, I expect that a 'totaligism' would have but one correct answer: 'mu'. English doesn't really have an equivalent word.
