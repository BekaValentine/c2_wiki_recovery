So can you name the people that appear in TheDeadline?

It's been a while, so I will have to reread the book.

Real Person -> Deadline Character

	* Bill Gates -> The Nation's Noble Leader, Himself
	* The Genie (bit character at end) -> Ed Yourdon
	* Belok -> SteveJobs
	* Larry Boheme -> BarryBoehm
	* T. Johns Caperous -> CapersJones
	* Harry Winnipeg -> GeraldWeinberg

JerryWeinberg appears twice, or so TomDeMarco has told him. Harry Winnipeg is the obvious one. Bonus points to whoever can identify Jerry's second appearance.

I don't think I fully agree. Here was my guess (not complete, though).
	* Tompkins: Rick Gee
	* Lahksa, the spy: nobody particular
	* The Nation's Noble Leader: Bill Gates
	* Belok, the Sinister Minister: Steve Balmer
	* Belinda Binda: not sure, perhaps Gerald Weinberg?
	* The eminent Dr. Rizzoli: Victor Basili
	* Ex-General Markov: don't know
	* Abdul Jamid (the model simulation guy): don't know, looked up the book: David Norton
	* Caporous, the numbers man (function points): don't know, not the inventor of fp
	* Dr. Menotti, managing director of MSEI: don't know, who is head of SEI?
	* Aristotle Kenoros: Watts Humphrey (or the Oracle)
	* Boheme, the Guru of Conflict Resolution: Larry Constantine
	* Winnipeg, the consultant: don't know
	* The Great Yordini: Ed Yourdon

Caper Jones is probably right, didn't get this one.

Dirk, what evidence do you have for Abdul Jamid being David Norton? I always thought it's Tarek K. Abdel-Hamid (http://www.nps.navy.mil/tarek.abdel-hamid/NPS_Web_Page/NPS_Home.htm).
