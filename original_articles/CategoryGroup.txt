This category is a catch-all for groups of whatever flavor. Unless there exists a more specific group category tag, a group is labelled with the CategoryGroup tag.

Some groups are specifically interested in GangOfFour patterns, in which case they receive the more specific CategoryPatternsGroup tag. Some groups are specifically interested in ExtremeProgramming, in which case they receive the more specific CategoryXpUsersGroup tag.
