An unrealistic/unpractical goal for the Internet and the world of computers.

"For Your Eyes Only" does not seem to be possible with computers and the Internet.  This is the biggest challenge for now and the future, and if anything undoes the Internet and the world of computers, it will be this "lack of security".  As time goes on, it is clearer and clearer to me that security does not really exist for the Internet and computers.  The more that nations, governments, corporations, individuals, and business in general, insist that there is security, and demand that computers and the Internet be used in this way, the more that time shows us this is simply not the case.
