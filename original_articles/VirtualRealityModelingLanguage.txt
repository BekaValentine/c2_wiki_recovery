'''Virtual Reality Modeling Language'''

	VRML - Pronounced either "vee-are-em-ell" or "VER-mul":	VRML is an abbreviation for Virtual Reality Modeling Language. You might see some references to Virtual Reality Markup Language, which is what VRML was called at the very beginning -- taking its cue from HTML: Hypertext Markup Language -- but it's been several years since people realized that our vision could be and ought to be a good deal bigger than simply marking up text to add on 3D capabilities.
