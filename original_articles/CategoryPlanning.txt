Category Planning consists of pages which identify the specific and particular activities required in the successful conclusion of a project, process or product development. Some believe that such activities are essential and must be employed in the interest of shortening the cycle from the concept to the concrete. 

Some methods attempt the shortening of preliminary planning in favor of incremental just-in-time activities which  correctly identify what steps and processes are required for the next iteration. Success in such attempts is realized when there is a high level of skill and experience of the participants and their having already experienced success in similar settings and scenarios. 

This category identifies concerns thought to be important prior to the beginning of development and design.
