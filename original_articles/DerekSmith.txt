Old, grumpy, generally p*ssed off by the state of the UK and large chunks of the world in general.

Staggered by the greed which drives us to burn ever greater quantities of carbon for energy instead of putting PV (photovoltaic) units on every home because although it would be good for the environment it would be bad for profit.

Really really grieved about the stupid, childish way our councillors and politicians join up in gangs and throw abuse at one another, rather than getting on in a professional manner and running this country for us as they are paid to do.

Mostly grieved that there is very little that I can do about it.

Actively monitoring the internet for tools to network other Meldrew like personalities to give us the voice and power to shape world we all want and want also for our children and grandchildren.
