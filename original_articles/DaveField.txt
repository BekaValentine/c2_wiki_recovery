Hi Everyone,

I'm just getting my feet wet with Wiki and it's really cool!

My biggest interests right now are XHTML, CSS, and General Web Design....and now Wikis! Full time, I am product manager for a large software company.

Part time, I build small sites (see http://www.affordablewebdesign.com), but I am planning to stop soon since it is too much of a headache. 

I'll add more here soon, but for now I'm off to explore the wiki world.
