TheMoreConfidentWins.

The party that is more confident in a negotiation/confrontation/other situation wins.

It is independent whether this confidence comes from boldness, determination, lies, present support or AbsentProxy, better (safer) position, force or else. 

In the end if I believe that the other will not let down I will cede to avoid endangering my position. 

I think all confrontations can be reinterpreted this way. This pattern can also be seen in the animal kingdom: Overawing for displaying potence and solving/avoiding fights.
