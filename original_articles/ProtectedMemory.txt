''Protected memory'' is a mechanism whereby a machine's operating system and hardware prevent unintentional (or malicious) access to regions of memory by programs that are not supposed to access those regions.

Protected memory is considered to be an essential part of a general-purpose multitasking operating system, as it prevents errant processes from reading or writing one another's address spaces or the kernel's address space without following the proper rules.
