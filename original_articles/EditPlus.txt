'''Python tips'''

EditPlus supports PythonLanguage color syntax. The most recent files are at ftp://ftp.editplus.com/files/pyt.zip.

In addition to the color syntax, you should set the output pattern so that you can just click a line on the output window and jump to the line of the file. The output pattern is: 
	File "(.+)", line ([0-9]+)

And you can set the function pattern and you can see the list of all functions (or classes), on which you can click and get there. The function pattern is:
	((def)|(class)) [a-zA-Z_].*[^:]*$
