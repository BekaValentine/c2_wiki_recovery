BusinessModeling does not appear to be within the portfolio of StrategicManagement in many companies, even though all companies have a "Business Model" they rely on, for their continued existence.

One exception seem to be the Finance sector. In the world of Wall Street high finances, lots of physicists are engaged in FinancialModeling.

Many of us would readily concur with the AllAbstractionsLie statement, but to dismiss the utility of something that is obviously flawed can be worse. It is like dismissing weather reports altogether because they are often wrong.

''BusinessModeling may have nothing to do with BusinessSystemsAnalysis''
* The connection between BusinessModeling and BusinessSystemsAnalysis is minor. Quite often a successful BusinessSystemsAnalysis exercise can be performed without BusinessModeling, which is generally taken as an exercise used in BusinessProcessManagement projects, where SystemsThinking skills can help in the creation/modification of BusinessProcess''''''es that are better linked to BusinessValue identified through StrategicManagement initiatives. BusinessSystemsAnalysis is often linked to ApplicationDevelopment initiatives.

Currently the NextBigThing in BusinessModeling is through this BusinessProcessModelingNotation (BPMN) technique, some "visionaries" have been blogging about the demise of BusinessProcessExecutionLanguage in early 2006.

Another technique, with less connection to the realm of Computing, did the ValueStreamMapping (did the ValueStream concept predate VSM technique?).
