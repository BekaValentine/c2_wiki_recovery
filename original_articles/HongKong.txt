A city in southern shores of China, was under British colonial rule until 1997. Now is under the rule of China. The government's homepage is at http://www.info.gov.hk/.

HongKong is a city? I thought it was a small state, with Kowloon being a city?

More precisely, the former British Dependent Territory of Hong Kong (now Hong Kong Special Administration Region) consists of Victoria (known as Hong Kong Island), the Kowloon Peninsula, the New Territories, and a few hundred tiny outlying islands.  The whole place fits within a square ~50km (~<40 miles) each side, with a population of >7M people.
