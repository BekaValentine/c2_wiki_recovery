The GnuHurd is a set of servers running on top of the GNU MachMicrokernel. Together they build the base for the GNU OperatingSystem.

Currently, Debian is only available for GnuLinux, but with DebianGnuHurd we have started to offer the GnuHurd as a development, server and desktop platform, too. However, DebianGnuHurd is not officially released yet, and won't be for some time.

See http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/ for DebianGnuHurd project home page.
