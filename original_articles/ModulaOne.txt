'''Modula''' a.k.a. '''Modula-1''' (the -1 was retroactively applied by some when Modula-2 came out, in order to allow distinguishing the ''family'' of Modula languages, with the first dialect in that family).

One of the WirthLanguages, derived from PascalLanguage.

Please see Wirth (1977): "Modula: A language for modular multiprogramming". ''Software--Practice and experience'', 7:3--35.

It was succeeded by ModulaTwo.
