----------

EricGill was the designer of GillSans and many other TypeFace''''''s. This book contains his thoughts about the relationship of craft and mass production. He champions the humanity-sustaining aspects of craft. That's what makes the book interesting to me. He also has some loony ideas about the future of type, which are fun reading.

''Contrary to popular belief, the face used by London Transport is not by Gill, but by his teacher, EdwardJohnston. Johnston's face was part of the inspiration for Gill Sans, however.'' 

''The face used on British road signs is a fairly standard "european modern" face anglicised by the substitution of a Gill style 'a'.''
