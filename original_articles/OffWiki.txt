This could mean a number of things, some good, some bad.

'''The Good:'''
* Whatever was being done, was being done "not" on Wiki.
* The information was pulled OffWiki.
* An idea was bounced OffWiki to see what others would have to say.
* Not regularly using Wiki of late.

'''The Bad'''
* Now OffWiki, like being "Off" Crack-Cocaine, in that it was an addiction that had to be broken like it was a very bad/unhealthy thing.
* Wiki was having a "bad" (off) day.
* A version of Wiki that is "Off" (crazy).
* The side of WardsWiki that is on the ShadySide.

''Its one backlink is factual: not regularly using Wiki (with no particular overtones).''
* Yes, that is where it came from, and will add to list above.
