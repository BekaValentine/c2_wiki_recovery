'''Don't do this!'''  This wiki is about software, and if you put loads of pages here unrelated to software they are very likely to be summarily deleted.

Read more about this wiki - NewUserPages, WelcomeVisitors - before investing a lot of time here. Also learn the TextFormattingRules.

There are other places to start up your own wiki. If you look, there may even already be one. Wikis thrive most when they stay vaguely OnTopic.

Apart from that, welcome!
