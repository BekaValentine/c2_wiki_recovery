Developer and weblogger from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

For the last few years, I have mostly been doing WebObjects development, but am doing more and more Cocoa programming with Objective-C as well, which I absolutely love.  In December 2002 I started learning Python, and subsequently Zope, CMF, and Plone.  I'm very impressed.  I used to be an advocate of the Frontier development environment, so the ZODB and Python go along well with those interests.

I'm also one of those people that wishes HyperCard was ported to Mac OS X, and heck, why not Windows too?  I still don't know of any other platform / language that made it so easy for young people to pick up GUI programming.
