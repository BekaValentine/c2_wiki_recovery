ArchiWiki - a possible new appellation for this Wiki...

I made this page only to obtain extra attention for this proposition...

No doubt, some people won't like this use of this Wiki, but any better idea about the name of this Wiki can be posted at WardsWiki. 

I would like to now what WardCunningham the master himself thinks about 
* the proposed name 
* the use of page creation to attract some attention and revive discussion.

I also posted this proposition at OtherWardsWikiNameSuggestions. Nice page listing some criteria for name giving. I think "ArchiWiki" meets all of them. -- pj

I just found out (google result) that the appellation is already in use for http://www.archiwiki.de/raeume on wiki on architecture by architects, but archi- as Greek element means already "original" and I don't think that architects can claim the right over the exclusive use of it! -- pj

Besides:

architect - 1563, from M.Fr. architecte, from L. architectus, from Gk. arkhitekton "master builder," from arkhi- "chief" + tekton "builder, carpenter." Architecture also is from 1563. [according to the Online Etymology Dictionary http://www.etymonline.com/a7etym.htm]

I really think we can all grant Ward the title of "master builder" for creating WikiWikiWeb . By the way, I just discovered the webzine: http://www.architechmag.coM/ and I'm still looking for the other possible concurrent use of the archi- prefix. -- pj

Well, use ArcheWiki instead. It's an alternate form of the prefix, and makes the meaning quite clear to me.  Until the recent explanations, I figured this was a joke name somehow referencing Jughead Jones and Co.
