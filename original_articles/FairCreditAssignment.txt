'''Fair-credit assignment''' is about giving personal, '''''named''''' assignment where one has originated something (author-credit in one's ''own'' work) or fair ''re''-presentation when ''another'' has originated something (as in a '''citation'''). In other words, you can't publish someone else's work under ''your'' name without giving a reference.  This is the heart of what CopyRight is supposed to be about.  But see also FairCredit.
