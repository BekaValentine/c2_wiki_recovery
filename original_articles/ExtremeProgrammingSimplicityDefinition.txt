What does "Simplicity" mean from an XP standpoint?
  Fewer classes?
  Fewer methods (consider private & public)?
  Fewer LOC?
  Fewer dependencies?


    'Tis the gift to be simple,
    'tis the gift to be free,
    'tis the gift to come down
    where we ought to be,
    and when we find ourselves in the place just right,
    'twill be in the valley of love and delight.
    When true simplicity is gained
    to bow and to bend we shan't be ashamed,
    to turn, turn, will be our delight
    till by turning, turning we come round right.
