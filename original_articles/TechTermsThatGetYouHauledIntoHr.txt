Serial devices under Unix originally interfaced to Teletypes, abbreviated "tty" (e.g. /dev/tty), and once upon a time fairly universally pronounced "Titty" (both within and without the Unix world, I believe).

Pseudo-ttys (virtual serial devices) are still an important mechanism, although the physical Teletypes are long gone. Do people still say "Pseudo-Titty", or has everyone carefully shifted to the safer "Pseudo-TEE-TEE-WHY"?

''TEE-TEE? WHY?''
