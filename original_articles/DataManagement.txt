DataManagement had been an important priority within the InformationResourceManagement (IRM) mandate. There are processes and methods associated with the discipline that focussed on the lifecyle of data within a company. Some of these were intended to drive infrastructure projects that individual business units in an organization would fail to address.

During its heyday some of the buzz words nd concerns were:
* Corporate Data modeling
* Data ownership governance
* Subject databases
* Master Data Management (MasterDataManagement)
