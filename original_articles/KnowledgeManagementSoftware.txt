Based in the UK, but with offices in FL, CT, NY, CA.

We develop products for, you guessed it, Knowledge Management. We struggled along for while with no development method. Then we went for BigDesignUpFront.

Finally, we saw the light, and we now are committed, at every level of the organisation, to ExtremeProgramming.
