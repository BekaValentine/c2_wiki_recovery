I work at the Motorola PCS Urbana-Champaign Design Center,
where we build operating systems and frameworks for the software platforms
that power Motorola cell phones.

I can be reached electronically as preece at motorola.com.

I am a software architect for our software platforms, working especially on
user interface areas. I also do a lot of work on standards, including representing Motorola
in the CELINUX Forum Architecture Group.

Before coming to Motorola (or, rather, to the Gould Electronics shop that was later
sold to Motorola), I did information
retrieval systems research at the University of Illinois
Coordinated Sciences Lab. 

My PhD work was on information retrieval using 
SpreadingActivationNetworks; it pre-dates the Web, but had some interesting speculation
about web-like retrieval structures..

I come to the Patterns movement with a little PatternSkepticism;
too many people are using "pattern" to mean too many things
for me to feel that there's a foundation for changing the
software world, yet, but I think there's the kernel of an
idea here that could move us towards real engineering.
