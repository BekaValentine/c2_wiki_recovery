Hi Im Andy.  I'm a developer. 

Currently working in iSOFT's Datacentre in Prestwich implementing monitoring solutions with Nagios.

Ive studied Computer Science at The University of Bradford in the UK. 

Never posted on a Wiki before today, but I quite like the content on ExtremeProgramming and TestDrivenDevelopment.  

If only these had been introduced to me whilst I was at uni, Id have had a much easier time of it ! 

ProgrammingLanguages I use / have used
*C# 
*Java 
*Perl 
*Haskell : soley in academia though,  was good for learning things like recursion
