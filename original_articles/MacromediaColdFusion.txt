See AllaireColdFusion.

Macromedia acquired Allaire and its product line, including AllaireColdFusion. The discussion of this product remains under the older name: AllaireColdFusion.

To complicate things further, Adobe has purchased Macromedia.

EditHint: Rename to ColdFusionLanguage or ColdFusionWebFramework because it keeps being purchased to new or different companies. After being bitten twice, I think it is time to chop off branding from the title.
