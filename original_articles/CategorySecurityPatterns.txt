A security pattern describes a particular recurring
security problem that arises in specific contexts, and presents
a well-proven generic scheme for its solution.  Many security patterns are also useful for improving robustness of systems by limiting extraneous capabilities given to recipients.

(Definition taken from http://www.security-patterns.de .) Examples include:

	* FacetPattern
	* CaretakerPattern
	* ProtectionProxy
	* UserPassword
	* PermissionFlags
	* TwoKindsOfCapabilities
	* RevokableCapabilities

At this year's EuroPLoP MarkusSchumacher and EduardoFernandez organized the Focus Group "Thinking about Security Patterns" that can be seen as a kick-off for a joint effort to collect and write security patterns.

There is already a CategorySecurityModel. I suggest we roll them all up into CategorySecurity, and drop riders such as "Patterns", "Models", etc. Let's apply some KISS to our category names. It is not (yet) a big enough topic to divide it into longer sub-names.
