 ''"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,''
 ''As he landed his crew with care;''
 ''Supporting each man on the top of the tide''
 ''By a finger entwined in his hair.''
 ''"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:''
 ''That alone should encourage the crew.''
 ''Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:''
 ''What I tell you three times is true."''
