	1 The means by which contumacious pilgrims may be convinced of the error of their ways. (See StBenedictsRule.)
	1 An example of an entertaining and unexpected -- and therefore durable -- falsehood; the "two stout monks" passage isn't in The Rule of St. Benedict (http://www.osb.org/rb/text/toc.html).

Chapter 28: On Those Who Will Not Amend after Repeated Corrections

	 :	If a sister who has been frequently corrected for some fault, and even excommunicated, does not amend, let a harsher correction be applied, that is, let the punishment of the rod be administered.

	 :	But if she still does not reform or perhaps (which God forbid) even rises up in pride and wants to defend her conduct, then let the Abbess do what a wise physician would do. Having used applications, the ointments of exhortation, the medicines of the Holy Scriptures, finally the cautery of excommunication and of the strokes of the rod, if she sees that her efforts are of no avail, let her apply a still greater remedy, her own prayers and those of all the others, that the Lord, who can do all things may restore health to the sister who is sick.

	 :	But if she is not healed even in this way, then let the Abbess use the knife of amputation, according to the Apostle's words, 
		 :	"Expel the evil one from your midst" (1 Cor. 5:13), 
	 :	and again,
		 :	"If the faithless one departs, let her depart" (1 Cor. 7:15)
	 :	lest one diseased sheep contaminate the whole flock.

Chapter 30: How Boys Are to Be Corrected

	 :	Every age and degree of understanding should have its proper measure of discipline. With regard to boys and adolescents, therefore, or those who cannot understand the seriousness of the penalty of excommunication, whenever such as these are delinquent let them be subjected to severe fasts or brought to terms by harsh beatings, that they may be cured.
