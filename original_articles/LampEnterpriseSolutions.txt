LampEnterpriseSolutions are enterprise class applications (multisite capabilities, if not multi-timezone) running on LampPlatform.

An Aug05 article explored a recent survey that suggested no compelling TOC considerations for Windows to Linux switch, as contrasted to a Unix to Linux switch. The paper asserts "...integration and interoperability issues among the various Linux and open-source distributions and applications was the main roadblock to the uptake of LampEnterpriseSolutions. (Also) the lack of enterprise-level application support and documentation for the aforementioned software packages also is an issue." From http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=100000028WT4

''That article seems to be a little misleading.  See http://news.com.com/a/2100-7344_3-5185069.html where it says, "At companies with 5,000 or fewer users, Linux can save more money than other systems, including Unix and Microsoft's Windows software, said the Boston-based company."''

'' '"Clearly, many people who have Linux like it a lot, but if you propose a wholesale swap to most large companies, you're looking at a significant up-front cost, and many executives are asking why they should do it," said Yankee analyst Laura D''''''iDio, who authored the report.' ''

''Summarizing: If you have a really large company and have already heavily invested in Windows technology, the savings of using Linux may be outweighed by the cost of change.  But I think the report is mostly talking about desktop use, not the server use that LampEnterpriseSolutions talks about.''

''By posting such a misleading statement, DavidLiu appears to be a Microsoft shill attempting to scare people away from open source.  He should get a clue and quit trying to spread FearUncertaintyAndDoubt.''

LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl. It is mostly unix based open sourced software.

''Might want to broaden the "P" to mean Perl/Python/PHP...''

Maybe something like JbossServer to keep the Java people happy that the configuration can indeed be ''Enterprise class''.

'''Platform Maturity'''

Any substantial organization (e.g. government and or listed companies) using LampSolutions at the expense of BigIron? Thanks for links and information provided. -- dl

''LampPlatform is popular but does not scale''
* so claimed an IbmCorporation manager in May05 article, ref http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1130283909;fp;16;fpid;0

OTOH, on OReilly, there are resources claiming PHP does scale. Examples include:
* Jul04 blog at http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5155
* Oct03 at http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/10/15/php_scalability.html

Can both camps be right and that they are referring to different things?
