Here is a page to discuss what is a code ReFactoring operation and what is ReWorking instead.
It is hoped that this will eventually be a fairly complete list of refactoring operations.

As a start:

'''Simple refactoring operations''':
* change the name of a variable
* change the name of a class or structure definition
* change the name of a method or function
* change the type of a variable or class member
* change the name of a parameter in a function/method definition
* change a literal into a variable (or do the reverse).
* increase type strength of a variable or member (or do the reverse).

'''More involved refactoring operations''':
* convert an inner class to a top-level class definition
* convert the users of class into using a class that inherits the first class.
* change to using a different CollectionStructure.
* take an inline chunk of code and turn it into a method or function (or do the reverse, take a method or function and pull its contents in line).
* convert a group of simple hashes/dictionaries with the same keys into a single hash/dictionary with a new class containing members from the old collection structures (or do the reverse, convert a dictionary/hash/list of objects into one collection structure for each member in the object's class, and stop using the class).
* convert a StaticClass into a DynamicClass (or do the reverse, convert a dynamic class into a static class).
* convert a class member into an instance member (or do the reverse, convert an instance member into a class member).
* change an interface into an abstract class (or do the reverse).
* change a for loop into a recursive procedure (or do the reverse).

'''Database centric refactoring operations''':
* move an InlineSqlStatement into a StoredProcedure (or do the reverse).
* move a StoredProcedure into a SqlFunction (or do the reverse).
* change a SQL filter into an application language implemented filter (or do the reverse).

'''DataOriented -> InformationOriented refactoring sequences''':
* DataToInformationRefactoring
