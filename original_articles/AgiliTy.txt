AGiliTy is an interpreter for game files created with Malmberg and Welch's ''Adventure Game Toolkit'' (see AgtLanguage). It is universal in the sense that it understands and interprets most of the many versions of the AGT game file format (unlike the original interpreters, which were only intended to run the game file format associated with them), and also in that it is written in ANSI CeeLanguage, so it should be straightforward to port AGiliTy to other systems.

At present, AGiliTy is available for MsDos, MacOs, LinuxOs, AmigaOperatingSystem, and UnixOs platforms.  

The Official "AGiliTy" Home Page is at:

RobertMasenten has also written a companion "Universal" AGT source code compiler named "Magx" (see MagxCompiler).
