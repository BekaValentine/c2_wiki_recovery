Due to globalization, more IT personnel have heavy accents. If you have a heavy accent (compared to where you are), here are some tips to improve communications:

* Don't speak fast. Slow down when you speak, especially if you are asked to repeat a phrase for clarity.

* Use synonyms for words that are causing difficulty, or find a different way to say the same thing.

* Provide a wider context first. For examaple, say "Who took my candy?" instead of "Who took my licorice?". Use StepwiseRefinement.
   
* Be prepared to spell out the problem words, or perhaps carry a notepad. Some find this undignifying, but sometimes you have to leave your ego at the door if you want to communicate well.

* Practice pronouncing the final consonants of a word. Non-native English speakers often have a hard time with the final consonants. Another common problem is the difference between "R" and "L".
