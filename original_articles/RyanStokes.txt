Ryan came back to sign his name after getting a clone (CvWiki) and modifying it to get better feedback from the molecular biology laboratory he works in (the Utah Genome Center).  It has helped kick-start quite a few initiatives and works well in our research environment, especially considering the pace of change at the Center.  He will be evolving the script he has to allow email notification of diffs between versions to those who sign up for pages; a 'public' tag for each page so that a static version can be put on the web and updated regularly; and he will be adding interfaces to the Center's LIMS system.  http://www.genome.utah.edu/ will hold the link to our Wiki-generated docs RealSoonNow.  Thanks!
