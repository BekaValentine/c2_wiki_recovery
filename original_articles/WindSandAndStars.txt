It's about the early days of flying mail in South America and Europe. But more deeply it's a book about understanding the meaning of human existence.

I re-read this book regularly and I'm always surprised by the new things I find in it.

I should have said that this book is not fiction, rather it is largely autobiographical. Saint Ex was one of those early mail pilots. -- RichieBielak
