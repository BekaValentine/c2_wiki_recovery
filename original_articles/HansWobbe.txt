Thanks to whoever chided as follows (it caused me to reThink my statements.) I will try to rework the original text later. -- Hwo040613

''Recursive'' inclusion means a page includes itself? That surely wouldn't be useful.
* Would a page that inclues a link that refers to an internal anchor be considered an example of recursion.
** A program that calls itself is traditionally considered to be recursive, even if the call is via a different Entry Point.
* A recusive page is useful if it also contains a named anchor AND such a page is included in (more than one other page).
** This can be thought of as a facet of OnceAndOnlyOnce that creates some interesting capabilities. e.g.
*** ...

''I understand that idea, but would call it "nesting" rather than recursion. It's unclear whether it's really useful to provide similar functionality in the template.''

Notes for the next version (with Thanks for the podding!):
* Definitely refer to this as Nesting and not as Recursion. ''(My focus was distracted to 'recursion' since originally I was very concerned that a nested include, referring to a page in a circular manner, would cause a problem. Once I was told this could not happen, I tried it, confirm it worked and then became quite impressed by the effects that could be created this way, the circular include concern stuck in my mind as 'recursion'.''
* I'll develop an example that illustrates the benefits I think I am getting out of this. That will be a valuable step because it will either show me the error of my ways, encourage me to proceed, or (at the very least) become a valued reminder entry in my journal of 'how to avoid premature elation'.
* ...

''original text...''

I agree that, in general, Recursive inclusion is a very bad thing (infinite loop, memory 'pacMan', ... system crash!). EddiesWiki, however, terminates the 'repeated' include when a page calls itself. This makes it possible to have a Table of Includes, the cells of which contain hyperlinks to other pages that themselves include ... etc. The result of this is a series of nested Tables that allow you to edit a deeply Included page once, and have that change appear to ripple up through all of the levels. I suspect that this is hard to understand without an illustration so I will try to cobble something together, but unfortunately won't be able to do so much before the weekend of the 20th. So far, in designing a mock up of a PIM for an associate, the design limitation of the logical table structures, the screen space, and the way Eddies' tables are implemented has kept me from getting into trouble with this relatively unorthodox, but really beneficial (if you hate typing) approach. -- hwo

Useful hints for beginners I learned here:
* ....
* TextFormattingRules
* WikiSocialNorms
* quickDiff's are great, especially when used in conjunction with (the now defunct) AutoPcnResults.
** MoreAboutExtraScripts - other useful capabilities.
* WikiBadges are a way of attracting attention. There are also FAQ pages and Question pages.
** WikiGettingStartedFaq
* QuickChanges are a help if you want to see who and what topics are current.
* HowToDeletePages. It took a while to find this, probably because Engineers only read instructions as a last resort.
* Any WikiGnome (or anyone else with more experience in this community) should feel free to remove any items in this segment of this homePage to any Page better suited.
* StaticMenuForWardsWiki is a great idea! I now use it in many other places too, including access to notes on my intranet wiki and am now considering making much more use of JavaScript.
* This site's relatively [ Zen | spartan ] nature makes the use of its backLinks feature (via the pageName) particularly useful.
* UserName is a good thing to set and to remember to reset (after getting a new computer).

Pages that I have found useful during my initial explorations include:
PeopleIndex, TextFormattingRules, FindPage, ...

Conventions here are a little different than I am used to on the basis of using a version of Php-Wiki, so I am still experimenting...
PeopleIndex, FreeLink: [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeopleIndex], ...

(I have gotten into the habit of making initial notes like this one when I am learning, since I frequently find appreciative audiences and find it very much easier to give these notes to people later, when I have mastered a subject and can no longer easily remember the frustrations faced by a novice.)

* 2007-06-05: Hans, while my position on information that is no longer being worked on remains unchanged (i.e., it should be stored in some form of marked up text that can be viewed in a text editor ''in extremis''), I do have a use for more dynamically changing information. I think you should take a look at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=179054 i.e., Total text Container. The author just added a diagram node so now he has document, multi-sheeted spreadsheet, archive and text object nodes. It is unstable and still being developed but the possibilities are interesting. albertde
** I agree it looks interesting, but I feel its a bit too early for me to get involved with it, given my current commitments. I'll check back next month and see if its a bit more stable.
*** P.S I find a RealName to be more conducive to interactions.
*** -- Hans
*2007-05-13: I think you should update your blurb about TiddlyWiki - it is way out of date. I personally am using Tiddlywiki for my current (aktuell) content and then when things die down (e.g., contract over, taxes done), I move the stuff over to Ryan's WikiServer (yea!) or SdiDesk (for calendar related stuff or when I feel like building a simple mindmap for content.) I have a GemaPad script to convert TiddlyWiki syntax to the other two and then finish off the fancy tables by hand. I am starting to explore TotalText (RTF boo). It is not web-based but is an outline application similar to KeyNote but w/o multiple tabs and with spreadsheet and calendar nodes. albertde
** Thanks for taking the time to post a comment "albertde". One of the reasons that the TiddlyWiki page is out of date is that I really don't think it belongs to any "one" person. I may have been the last person to make a contribution to it, but that is all I've done. The bulk of the content was contributed by others.
*** Feel free to make any updates you think might be helpful.
*** By the way, I found your description of the tools you use interesting. In fact, I'm a fan of WxWikiServer as well, and still use it when I need to create a lot of content in a hurry since I can use my text editor to access its flat files, most efficiently.
** Lately (a 2008-01 update), I find myself making more and more use of TiddlyWiki, especially in conjunction with the TiddlyTools plugins.
