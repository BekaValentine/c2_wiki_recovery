	 :	The key point is taking the advice of KentBeck, act as if the database is easy to change. Relational databases were created to be flexible, so flex them. Kent also advises that when something is very difficult try doing it more often not less. That way you get good at doing it and it won't be hard any longer. Get into the habit of migrating your database often, you will make fewer mistakes not more. -- http://www.extremeprogramming.org/stories/testdb.html
