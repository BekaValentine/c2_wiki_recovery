Just another troublesome, pesky 'noun'. My apologies in advance if I crash into 
anything or anybody on my way to the bottom of the hill.

In a hypertext environment, there is not '''one''' clear starting point. This can be daunting, but for 
me this home page will serve. Elements of planning fascinate me, stumbling onto PatternLanguages has 
motivated me. If this page were represented by a Venn diagram, the left circle would read 'elements of me', 
the right 'elements of pattern language' and the conflux would read EvanDamerow.

Edits to this page are very welcome, both as a way to educate me about the Wiki culture, and on the content of
this page, but please do so with respect. This is a HomePage for and about me, and I would 
like the freedom to represent myself in my own manner. If you make changes, please do so in italics.

change and cultivate new experience will present itself.

	1. Work needs to start now in order to achieve desired results
	1. All processes needed to achieve desired results are not known
	1. All desired results are not known

any attempt at solution?
