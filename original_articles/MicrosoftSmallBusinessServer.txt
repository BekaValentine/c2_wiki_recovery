MicrosoftSmallBusinessServer (SBS) is a suite of tools from MS aimed at the small business. In a recent interview there were comments made where a senior MS manager concurred with the assertion that products such as MicrosoftSmallBusinessServer serve to solidify the company's lead in markets targeted by the LampPlatform.

''I take it to mean the package hit the sweetspot in the balance act between costs, functionality, manageability, etc.''
