by EdwardTufte, ''Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative'', Graphics Press, P.O.Box 430, Cheshire, Connecticut 06410, Call 800-822-2454. [ISBN 0-9613921-2-6].

Edward Tufte's new book, Visual Explanations is about pictures of verbs, the representation of mechanism and motion, process and dynamics, causes and effects, explanation and narrative. ...

Tufte's earlier books on information design dealt with pictures of numbers (TheVisualDisplayOfQuantitativeInformation) and pictures of nouns (EnvisioningInformation). These books are widely regarded as classics.

This one is not as dense as the other two, but is still lovely.

I read this recently - it's the only Tufte I've read so far - and it is the
most beautifully written technical book I've ever had the privilege to read.
One of the things that blew me away was the fact that ''all the illustrations are on the same page as the text that discusses them''.  The next book I read was an O'Reilly book on Web Navigation, and it was very frustrating to have to flip back and forth between screen shots and text.

I've read elsewhere that Tufte publishes his own books because he won't trust publishers to get it right - can anyone confirm or deny this?
