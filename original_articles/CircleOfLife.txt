ExtremeProgrammingInstalled [p. 14] uses the ''circle of life'' to describe how a project can be steered to success:

 Customer:   define value
 Programmer: estimate cost
 Customer:   choose value
 Programmer: build value
 repeat!

In the circle, both customers and programmers learn how value the proposed features actually are, and how difficult they are to build.

The importance of the circle of life lies in the fact that it makes
programmers and customers see that they depend on each other.

The circle of life teaches how one can focus all his/her energy to the central point of it. So this is the way to get best results with best efforts. -- Nidhi Agarwall
