An attempt to create a free WirelessNetwork in SeattleWashington. 
----
''Seattle Wireless started in 2000, and back then it was a simple idea, with huge technical hurdles, high costs and a hard (but novel) sell to the public. Now the technology exists, the hardware is cheap, and all we need are people to realize the dream of a locally grown network. This dream has been realized in many FreeNetworks all over the world, and is not only tested technologically, but has shown to be a sustainable model for cost effective network building.''

It is running MoinMoin. The only Wiki I know that gets SlashDotted on a regular basis.
