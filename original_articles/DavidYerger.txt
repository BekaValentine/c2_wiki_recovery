Started with VisualBasic about 13 years ago;  moved on to MumpsLanguage (the Cach√© dialect specifically).

Lately, I've been dabbling with RubyLanguage, PythonLanguage, and sed.  (Not to knock the above two, just that right now I'm more focused on creating telephony applications rather than telephony databases with client front-ends)
