An IncrementalWiki technique that applies to all kinds of writing:

When you get an idea while you're working on writing another one, jot it down just enough to remember where you were going and move on.

We must harness the creativity or be driven mad by it.

''That's a good quote, I think this is part of how computer's have saved me - they let me record ideas that I can't implement in their totality just yet. Faster than writing, and easier than a typewriter.''

Similar to a literary technique of StreamOfConsciousness.
