Sometimes it is good to have a dictionary.

There is a handy on-line dictionary at http://www.m-w.com/dictionary.htm.

And another at http://www.dictionary.com. This one can be quite useful, as it actually gives definitions from several different dictionaries (including the excellent AmericanHeritageDictionary).

And then there's http://www.wiktionary.org.
