How do you know whether a news report is propaganda or not? Well, you could check to see whether it's on Fox News or not. But too often the newspapers and other TV stations take their news from the same nipple. The easy way to tell is to just look for these buzzwords:

	'''Right''':	as in Right vs Wrong, not Right vs Responsibility or even Right vs Left. Right as in ''right person'', ''right decision'' or ''right belief''.
	'''The American People''':	as in "The American People want ..." or "The American People say ..." or "The American People won't accept ...". On Fox News ''The American People'' == ''Corporate Sponsors''.
	'''Homeland''':	They may as well say ''Fatherland'' and be done with it.
	'''War against''':	where the word following ''against'' is not the name of a country.
	'''Evil''' and '''Bad''':	Especially ''bad man'' and ''bad law''.
	Also '''Good''':	 
	'''Freedom''':	From what? To do what? Freedom to bomb? Freedom to steal? Freedom to dominate? Absolute freedom for some is no freedom at all for others.
	'''Justice''':	except where describing a process of law. Moral justice, economic justice, and justice as revenge are all propaganda.
	'''The Constitution''':	when used in the same sentence as the word ''sacred''. The US Constitution, in its original form (pre civil war, pre FDR, pre Nixon, pre Bush) was a fine document. But its framers intended it at a living document, not a sacred one.
	'''God''':	Faith in God is a very wondeful thing for many people. But God has nothing to do with anything reported on Fox News.
	'''Any means necessary''':	== Any means expedient.

This list is replete with propaganda too.

''Please explain.''

Well it appears to be a voice in the small propaganda war against Fox News...  anyway, if it's off topic, will anyone object to it's summary execution?  Only one way to find out, I suppose...

''I believe it refer to Fox News as an archetype, not as an object. It's also not clear which parts are propaganda - can you point them out?''

''As to its being OffTopic, the SociologyWikiSeedList has pointers to hundreds of similar pages. Will you also delete them? For what reason?''

Me personally? I doubt it. If the SociologyWiki is set up, I expect the gnomes will gradually move (yes, delete from c2.com) those pages you mentioned. Now that it's clear to me that there is a whole tangled puddle of off topic pages - such a large puddle that they have their own category - I will leave them alone. Sorry, I don't have the boundless time and energy for the wiki to DoTheRightThing here. I'll just leave it all for "someone else".

This does raise some interesting ideas for the "world view" part of http://noosphere.org though - ThankYou. -- MatthewAstley

Funny, when I saw the title of this page, I expected to see things like ''EnterpriseJavaBeans'', ''DotNet'', ''WebServices'', ''WriteOnceRunAnywhere'' and the like.
