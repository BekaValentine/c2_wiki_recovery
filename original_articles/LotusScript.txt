LotusScript is a superset of Basic and is nearly identical to VisualBasic. From the LotusNotes help database:

"LotusScript is an embedded, BASIC scripting language with a powerful set of language extensions that enable object-oriented application development within and across Lotus software applications."

''S-E-C-U-R-I-T-Y?''

Your point is? LotusNotes, at least, has a very well thought out security model which is not compromised by having LotusScript around. And I assume you're aware MicrosoftOffice applications have VBA?
