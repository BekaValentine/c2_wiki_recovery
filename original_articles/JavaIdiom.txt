An Idiom is a small, language specific pattern (see IdiomOrPattern) in common use. A JavaIdiom is an idiom for the Java programming language (*DOH* :-)). 

A language Idiom consists of recognizable assemblage of language elements (keywords, types, conditional constructs etc) that appears often in different applications written in that language. Thus it is possible for Idioms to provide superordinate language features that are not present in the language itself.

The JavaIdiom is a recognizable code pattern written in Java. It is described and understood best with the help of a code sample.

See JavaIdioms for a collection of such idioms.
