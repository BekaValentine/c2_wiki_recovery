There's nothing in this movie that hasn't been said on the net so many times that most of us here know it. In fact, there's a lot left out - nothing about methane, ocean acidity, global dimming, or peak oil. Not a word.

And that's good because this isn't a movie for us. It's a movie for the average, ordinary punter, the man and woman in the street who get only what they get from the popular media and don't think more about global warming than they do about, say, Anna Nicole Smith.

There are four points this movie cleverly, gently, but effectively presses home:
* AlGore is a clever, gentle, but effective man
* GlobalWarming is not a theory but a fact
* You can do something about it. 
* And, I almost forgot, a good way to do something about it is to vote.

Like methane, GeorgeBush is conspicuous by his absence throughout most of this movie. Um, that is to say ... hey, where is the GlobalWarmingWiki anyway?
