	This is FAQ-O-Matic, a quick-and-dirty Perl hack (aren't they all?) by Jon Howell. 

	It seems like most FAQ maintainers make a valiant initial effort, then get a life and
	don't have time to keep their FAQs up to date. Also, I often find out a solution to a 
	problem, and feel like I could write a single FAQ answer on it in a few minutes, 
	but where to post it? 

	Thus the FAQ-O-Matic was born. FAQ-O-Matic is a couple sleazy Perl scripts that allow
	people to submit FAQ answers to this database, so it can stay current, with just a tiny 
	bit of work on any one person's part. 

	Yes, a bad guy could come along and wipe out all the FAQ entries. Please don't. But to give the
	good guys some measure of comfort, each submission is stored in an RCS file, so if someone
	does tamper, we can recover the database. Furthermore, version 2 keeps track of who makes
	changes.
