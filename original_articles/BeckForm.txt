This is the patterns form used in SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns by KentBeck.  It's similar to the CompactForm and the PortlandForm, but has its own unique niceties.

The basic format is:

	* Title
	* Context (optional.  May include forward or back references)
	* Problem -- always phrased in the form of a question the reader might have to ask themselves.  For instance "How do I sort a Collection?".  KyleBrown has referred to this as "Jeopardy problem statements"
	* Forces
	* Solution (The solution should include the name of the pattern in some form)
	* Resulting Context (may include forward or back references)

BobbyWoolf, KyleBrown and GregorHohpe are using a modified BeckForm in their messaging patterns work (http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com).
