Don't even bother trying to persuade me of your silly little wrong opinions. I know better than to fall for those old arguments. MyMindIsMadeUp.

Actually brings up the old classification of minds:
* '''OpenMind.''' Can entertain any idea, no matter how ridiculous.
* '''ClosedMind.''' Cannot entertain any new idea, no matter how accurate. (This page.)

Of course, the above two are a FalseDichotomy, because they are not the only two choices. There is also:
* '''ActiveMind.''' Can entertain any ideas that have persuasive evidence -- and only those ideas. Willing to spend considerable effort to get and weigh the evidence -- but once that is done, sticks to what it knows, unless ''new'' evidence comes in. (An '''ActiveMind''' might be made up; it depends on whether the argument is new or old in the judgment of the listener.)
'' (Is ActiveMind the same as SelectivelyOpenMinded )''
* '''InactiveMind.''' Seeks a simple, quick solution to the problem of ideas, and usually chooses to accept-everything ('''OpenMind''') or reject-everything ('''ClosedMind''') rather than having to bother with the effort of considering and weighing evidence.

This introductory line is an expression of those who do not want to think about what is or what is to become.

The mindset disallows the opinions, truly or falsely based, that discomfort their own ''status quo''. When expressed in the wiki, it is a thinly veiled deception - not unlike the closing lines of ''Gone with the Wind''.
