I'm a new guy on the Wiki block, having lurked around here on and off for months.

I just demonstrated the WikiWikiWeb to a colleague and we may use a WikiClone to document some tricky software stuff he has to hand over.

This was all prompted by a half page article on the WikiWikiWeb by GlynMoody in ComputerWeekly magazine in the UK (13 September 2001).

Pleased to meet you.

Peter
