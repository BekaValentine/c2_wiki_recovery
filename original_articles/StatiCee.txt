StatiC language (http://home.comcast.net/~pete.gray/StatiC.htm) is a hybrid language capable of both traditional and FiniteStateMachine constructs.  By default, it uses sort of a hybrid of C, BASIC, and Pascal syntax, but can be told to use C-style syntax with a compiler switch.

FiniteStateMachine in StatiC is structured as follows:

 transition statename
 begin
   condition expression
   causes
     statements
   endcondition
 end
