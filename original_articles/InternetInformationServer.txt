MicroSoft's solution for HTTP/FTP/SMTP on WindowsNtServer, Windows2k, and WindowsXp.

A limited version, known as PersonalWebServer, is available for use on WindowsNtWorkstation and Windows9x.

The three protocols are managed by three independent services that are controlled by a fourth parent service. All run under the inetinfo.exe process. However, individual IsapiExtension''''''s and AspApplication''''''s can be configured to run in their own processes for better FaultIsolation.

	*IIS 4.0 can be installed on WindowsNtServer via the Option Pack 4.0 CD.
	*PersonalWebServer, the WindowsNtWorkstation and Windows9x flavor, can be downloaded from MicroSoft's web site.
	*IIS 5.0 is installed by default as part of several flavors of Windows2k Server.
	*IIS 5.1 is included with WindowsXp Professional (but not with the Home Edition). The non-server version has a few limitations, similar to those of PersonalWebServer, but it is functional enough for use as a web development platform.
