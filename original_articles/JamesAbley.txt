I work in the South of England, previously using VB6 but now using Java full-time (such an improvement!)

I'm a big fan of agile, iterative processes and was trying to introduce decision makers to some of the ideas at a previous employer. 

vbUnitFree was a first attempt at this, which I used as much as possible, along with others in my team. I also wrote an article which resulted in a fair few downloads and some much wanted feedback from the community. It's at 
*** http://www.devx.com/vb/Article/21529/. 

Unfortunately, my enthusiasm about testing didn't seem to infect anyone else there, so I left in search of a place where I'd be happier. 
Sadly ;-) I won't be developing it any more, since I don't touch VB these days. 

So it's destined to be yet another inactive project on sourceforge.
