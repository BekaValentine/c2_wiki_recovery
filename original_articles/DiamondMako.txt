Incredibly cost-effective SymbianOs device. Originally manufactured as the PsionRevoPlus, then licensed by SonicBlue for sale under the Mako label. MSRP for the Revo Plus is $399; meanwhile, the Mako can be had from various US online retailers (e.g. http://www.tigerdirect.com) for '''''99USD'''''. For the $99, you get:

* 16MB RAM
* 36 MHz ARM processor
* SymbianOs ER5 - 32-bit multitasking OS
* Word processor, spreadsheet, database, Web browser, etc
* PC or Mac synchronization
* 480 x 160 touchscreen (reflective backing - ''very'' readable)
* QWERTY alphanumeric keyboard (roughly half-size, not really any good for touch-typing but two-finger typing is quite feasible)
* Available (free download) CeePlusPlus SDK with PC emulator for Windows

Sorry if this sounds like spam (I have no relation with Tiger Direct or Psion or SonicBlue), but I am simply ''in love'' with this thing. -- MikeSmith
