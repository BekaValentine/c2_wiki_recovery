I met WardCunningham in 2002 when he helped the Classroom Connect development team to adopt AgileMethodologies.

I've done web application development for several educational software companies, including Computer Curriculum Corporation, http://britannica.com, Classroom Connect, and http://greatschools.org.

I'm now a mobile developer and co-founder of http://twobitlabs.com.
