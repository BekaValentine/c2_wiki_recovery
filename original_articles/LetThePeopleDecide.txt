It is remarkable that Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin (1807�74) should have said such a thing during the French Revolution, since he was born a number of years after the French Revolution ended. (Actually, the man ''allegedly'' said something of the sort during the February days of the 1848 Revolution.)

TomDeMarco says something similar in Slack (ISBN 0-767907-69-8):
