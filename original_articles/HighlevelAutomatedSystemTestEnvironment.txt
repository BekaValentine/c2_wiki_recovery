The "High-level Automated System Test Environment" -- HASTE:

	 :	"Haste (High-level Automated System Test Environment) represents an approach to system testing that is philosophically consistent with standard XP unit testing practices. Test code runs in the same address space as the application under test, allowing for ready examination of application state. The fundamental Haste abstractions of Story, Step, and StoryBook provide a framework to implement system tests. Utility classes simplify test development. In addition to acting as XP acceptance tests, Haste tests aid source maintenance and extension, and can play an important role in a release process."
