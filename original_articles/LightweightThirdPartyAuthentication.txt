Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) is intended for distributed, multiple application server and machine environments. It supports forwardable credentials and single signon (SSO). LTPA can support security in a distributed environment through cryptography. This supports permits LTPA to encrypt, digitally sign, and securely transmit authentication-related data, and later decrypt and verify the signature.
