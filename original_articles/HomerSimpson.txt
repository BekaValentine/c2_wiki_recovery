From http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F04.html :

''Homer panics a little, running back to his work station.  "Stay calm," he reassures himself, "remember your training."  He reaches for the "Emergency Procedures" manual, and opens it up.  A square has been cut out of most of the pages -- a square big enough to hold a solitary donut.  But Homer finds no donut; all that's left is a piece of paper. Homer reads it.''

"Dear Homer, I. O. U. one emergency donut.  Signed, Homer."

Blast it!  He's always one step ahead.
