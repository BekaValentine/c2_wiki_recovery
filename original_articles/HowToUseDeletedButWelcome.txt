'''Best Practice for D''''''eletedButWelcome'''

	1 If the page seems like a new-user test page, use the D''''''eletedButWelcome tag. Different rules apply to a WikiHomePage though; see AreYouThere instead for our current best-practice.
	1 If a page was deleted with the D''''''eletedButWelcome tag, wait a day before seconding the deletion.
	1 When you visit a D''''''eletedButWelcome page, please check the diff to decide if the original deleter had a valid claim. There are three options:
		* Second the deletion.
		* Restore the EditCopy. (check it by clicking on the last edit date)
		* Leave D''''''eletedButWelcome intact for someone else to delete.
	1 Beware of changing a page from 'deleted' to 'D''''''eletedButWelcome'. This ''will'' delete the page for good, instead of simply making the deletion tag more friendly.

''Moved from the list above, where it says "Beware of changing a page from 'deleted' to 'D''''''eletedButWelcome'":''

The best way to handle the this case would be to:
		1. Restore the original page using the EditCopy. Save the page.
		1. Replace the page with the DeletedButWelcome tag.

''Unfortunately, that won't work. Wiki regards consecutive edits by a single author as a single edit, so the restoration will be washed away by the second step, which will be taken as a "confirm delete" by wiki.''

How about being able to set expiry dates on wiki pages? Then the new user could arrange for their test page to automatically delete itself. -- AndyPierce

I think a day may not be long enough for the original writer to see the DeletedButWelcome tag. How about a week? They may not be in RecentChanges anymore, but one can check the backlinks from DeletedButWelcome to find pages that need to be seconded. -- KrisJohnson
