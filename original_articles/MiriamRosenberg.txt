Miriam met Ward at Microsoft. She thinks wiki is cool.

I'm currently finishing my CS thesis on search engines and data quality.  Once that becomes part of the past, I plan on resuming my French and piano lessons and traveling around the world (Praga?  China?  Who knows?).  Not everything has to be CS related in life!

Miriam studied with me at the university and she is cool. I miss our religious discussions (AurelianoCalvo).
