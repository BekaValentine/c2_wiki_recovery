JohnFarrell says that in "A Few Good Men" (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0104257), when one of the marines broke the ContinuousIntegration build, the CO orders that he be tied to the bed and beaten to death.  I feel appropriately intimidated. -- MartinPool

Strictly speaking, the orders were just to beat him senseless.  The marine's death was accidental.  Of course, any time two large marines are beating a helpless man, accidents tend to happen.
