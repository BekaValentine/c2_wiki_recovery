Refactored mercilessly 20 July 1999.
Hope to update the paper soon too.
----
"Design Patterns for Distributed Objects" is the title of a presentation I
gave at the Australian Java Users' Group on Monday July 12 1999.
I wrote a paper which is essentially the same as the talk,
although the paper has not been published in any more formal sense.

http://www.ajug.org.au/ajug-qld/papers/john_farrell.19990712.html

I'm interested in:
	* getting feedback on the patterns
	* getting feedback on the writing
	* hearing about related work

From what I read on other pages (BeyondWritersWorkshops) there seems to be
quite an industry in reviewing patterns literature.
I hope some of the professional reviewers :-) can take some time to look at
this.
I am presently working my way through a bunch of papers, such as A PatternLanguageForPatternWriting.
Thanks!

The patterns discussed are:
	* Hand Off To Remote Worker (to be renamed to HandOff)
	* MiddlewareWrapper
	* BagOfJumpingBeans
	* TrinityPattern
	* SplitTreeFromLeaves
	* JournallingPattern

To turn this into a PatternLanguage, I would need to add:
	* PublishAndSubscribe
	* DistributedCallback
	* Write in the form, spirit and style of '''A Pattern Language'''
	* Tags without spaces in them.  For some reason, http://www.ajug.org.au/ajug-qld/papers/john_farrell.19990712.html#Bag%20of%20Jumping%20Beans doesn't work for me. (''Sorry, the tags are automatically generated for me, and the author of the document formatting system hadn't heard of WikiName s.'')
	* ''...more suggestions welcome.''

It also occurs to me that DesignPatternsForDistributedObjects effectively
include elements of:
	* DistributedProgrammingPatterns
	* ConcurrentProgrammingPatterns
	* LargeSoftwareSystemPatterns
	* ObjectSystemPatterns

I think it shows promise.
And with a little polishing it could be a useful PatternLanguage.
