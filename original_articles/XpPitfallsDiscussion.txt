Perhaps on the XpPitfalls page, each "pit fall category" could be factored out into its own page.
Like...
	* XpAdoptionPitfalls
	* XpRefactoringPitfalls
	* XpPairProgrammingPitfalls
	* XpPlanningPitfalls
	* XpOnSiteCustomerPitfalls
	* XpUserInterfacePitfalls
	* XpYagniPitfalls
	* XpDatabasePitfalls

Refactoring note: Modified naming scheme.

I think splitting them up is a good idea at this point because the page is starting to get big and hairy. Looking at the diff doesn't tell you as much anymore, and it only shows up as one item on RecentChanges.
