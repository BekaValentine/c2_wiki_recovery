A lot of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things. They don't realize that there's this like LatticeOfCoincidence that lays on top of everything. I'll Give you an example, show you what I mean. Suppose you thinking about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out of the blue no explanation. No point in looking for one either. It's all part of a CosmicUnconsciousness. -- Miller, as heard in RepoMan

''Some time back, I also saw this connection everywhere I went. The closest term I could come up with was Synchronicity. Unfortunately, a few weeks later I was in the hospital, recovering from a severe case of manic depression (the manic part, that is).'' -- AndreSlabber

The human brain is good at matching patterns. It can see the subtlest patterns with ease - it can even see patterns where none exist (Elvis in the condensation on a mirror). We usually filter most of these matches out as insignificant. The brain also likes to ignore non-patterns: When someone mentions a plate of shrimp and you didn't just think about a plate of shrimp, you're not likely to notice. Ignoring non-patterns is what makes "psychic phenomenon" seem real to many people: They only notice the matches, not the non-matches.

When you suddenly notice all these patterns, it means that you've ceased filtering out the irrelevant matches. The causes are myriad, but before deciding that a grand idea is the cause, consider: illness, religious fervor, mass hysteria, drugs, sleeplessness, or just thinking too much.

Is the fact that the topic LatticeOfCoincidence already existed an example of CosmicUnconsciousness?

''No. It's just a coincidence.''

Although if, on the other hand, the author had just thought of the idea of creating this CosmicUnconsciousness page, and right in the moment of thinking about it had refreshed RecentChanges and saw LatticeOfCoincidence pop up right at the bottom of the list... Plate O' Shrimp!!!

''RandomPages is like that. It's freaky.''
