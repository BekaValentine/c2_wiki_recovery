GoldenCoffin is not a GoldenHandcuff you see in the media, unjustified salary packages offered to nonperforming senior managers in private firms.

A GoldenCoffin is a livable wage, cushioned by a modest superannuation (retirement) package, that are available to Government employees for supporting arcane policies.

These policies are there due to:
1) demand by taxpayers for underfunded government
2) requirements by public for government accountability, more so than private sector
3) expectation by taxpayers for government to undertake expensive (noncommercially viable) projects
