''Healthy communities can solve problems very effectively. Social conventions and unwritten rules can be more effective than enforced policy.''

Here's my recent take on community solutions. Essentially, the more tighter knit a community, the more it relies on community solutions. However, the more impartial people are towards others, the more technical or legal the solutions become--relying on the "system" to manage the faceless crowd. These are correlations, not implications. I think these are part of the reason why Community May Not Scale: 
* ''When a group grows from dozens of individuals to thousands, it becomes impossible to feel any real acquaintance with more than a fraction of the population. When this happens, community standards and unwritten rules stop working.'' 
The group loses focus. Things fall apart. There seems to be a limit to how many people one person can really know. -- SunirShah
