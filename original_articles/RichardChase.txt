Software Developer.

I have been developing  online databases, and building plug-ins for ArcMap lately.  I graduated from Central Wa University in 2004.  I program mostly in VB.NET but like C++ and C# much better.

Quite a few beefs and swearing when programming for ArcMap.  Support is slim, but user forums are the only way to progress.

That's all for now.

Peace out.
