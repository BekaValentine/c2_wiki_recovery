I am a manager at TASS.
TASS is a company in the area of technical software development.
The homepage is www.tass.nl.
 
I started to get interested in XP in 2000 when I was working at a BigDesignUpFront firm. After having seen some other firms with a more agile process I became a technical manager at PTS.
In my current position at TASS I have the opportunity to stimulate and coach Scrum/XP training and projects.
 
You can reach me by email though mailto:gerben.blom at tass.nl.
