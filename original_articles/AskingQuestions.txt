* HowToAskQuestionsTheSmartWay
** http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html. 

Examples:
* ClearRequirements (Clarification)
** ''An apparent benefit of UserStories over 'good' old-fashioned, more or less clear requirements is that no-one expects UserStories to be the complete answer, even if they are more than just SomethingToThinkAbout.''
* Commerce
** BusinessRequirementQuestions

* PatternMiningThread (Dialogue)
** Does this mean that you believe in some radical alternative, like thinking about the problems of software in abstracto and then declaring the solution as a pattern? 
** ''Should these patterns be written by someone with no real software experience (such as the folks at SEI? '' 
** ''I shouldn't say things like that in public - pretend I didn't])? ''
** ''Or should it be the authors of the code, authors of code that has fared well and been maintainable and demonstrated other good qualities, such as QWAN?'' 
** ''Wouldn't that, then, be like mining patterns? And (oh, just write it!) isn't that what I suggested? ''
