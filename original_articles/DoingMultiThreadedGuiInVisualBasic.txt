Perhaps I've missed the point but its not that hard.

There are two approaches

'''Use a timer tick and D''''''oEvents.'''

 Sub Form_Load() 
   'Disable controls that have to wait for your long process.
   cmdThatUsesData.enabled = false 
   'Set timer interval to something low and enable it
   DBLoadingTimer.interval = 1
   DBLoadingTimer.enabled = true 
   D''''''oEvents
   ' do the rest of your form loading
 End Sub 

 Sub DBLoadingTimer_Timer()
   'Disable the timer
   DBLoadingTimer.enabled = false

   'Do the long process but put doevents every so often
   
   'Enable the controls
   cmdThatUsesData.enabled = true

 End Sub 
   
'''Use a timer tick and Do heavy stuff in separate activeX exe component'''

The timer set up if the same but the time calls a method on an object in a separate activeX exe component

You use an Event to signal completion of the task 

 Sub DBLoadingTimer_Timer()
   'Disable the timer
   DBLoadingTimer.enabled = false
 
   DBLoader.Loadstuff

 End Sub 

 Sub DBLoader_StuffDone()
  'Enable the controls
   cmdThatUsesData.enabled = true
   
 End Sub 

This code is off the top of my head, so probably not exactly right. 

The first approach can lead to a jerky GUI if the steps between D''''''oEvents are not small, if they are small the D''''''oEvents introduce a fair bit of overhead.
