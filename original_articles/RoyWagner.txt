A computer programmer who has debugged the core dumps of an IBM 360, actually used a keypunch to program in FORTRAN, was one of the first to promote the use of "online" computing with IBM/TSO, started off with an 8KB home computer (Commodore PET 2001), and now works from home dealing with Oracle's idiosyncrasies and programming in JAVA. And I have enjoyed (nearly) every moment doing it.
