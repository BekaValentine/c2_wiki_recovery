Different from MakeOthersLookIncompetent.

In this case the person makes decisions that severely limit the ability of others of becoming competent.

For example a manager that severely reduces the time allocated for a task without reducing the scope. The result is of course low quality and a lot of time is needed to fix it. That time is never allocated so the result is a self perpetuating mess.

See for example: BigEstimates.
