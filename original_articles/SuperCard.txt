A Mac-only HyperCard-like RAD-come-multimedia development environment based on 'screens' arranged like a stack of cards. Better colour integration than HyperCard (HC), but separate coding and interface environments are awkward.

More complex and less Rapid a RAD to use in practice, but makes prettier-looking applications than HC can out of the box.

Uses SuperTalk, the same kind of scripting language as HC, and will accept the same range of XCMDs and XCFNs as HyperTalk.
