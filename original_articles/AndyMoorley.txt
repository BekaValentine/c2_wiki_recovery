I have been an irregular and silent reader here for over a year now [now = August 1998].  I was introduce to it by PaulDyson who I worked with at that time.

I work for JPMorgan at the moment where I am the architect (whatever that migh mean in this circumstance) for their Smalltalk based derivatives system called Kapital.

I am especially interested in Architectural Patterns (see PatternsGenerateArchitectures for a clue as to what these might be) and how they help in defining the high level architecture of either an individual system or a network of communicating system. 
  
I am currently wondering how QualityAttributes and ArchitecturalStyle are related.  I am thinking about proposing a OT99 workshop on this.

I am also interested in learning a lot more about this ExtremeProgramming stuff.
