''Interesting. I am just looking at some of the NepomukKde tools available with the KayDesktopEnvironment. My interest is in ways of developing and sharing metadata in my environment. Does this have any links with that?'' -- JohnFletcher

Not intentionally.  Whether it's relevant, I think, depends on what you have in mind for developing and sharing metadata.  If you need the ability to draw and manipulate box-and-line drawings in Java, TomatoIde contains reusable tools for that, some of which I've easily re-used for a forthcoming edition of the RelProject.  However, as a tool in itself it's quite limited.  You can create Java programs (sort of) and edit them whilst they're running, which is oddly exhilarating but not particularly useful, though I do sometimes wonder if I've created something significant but lack the imagination to appreciate it.  (In 1992, I was shown the early Web and remarked that I didn't think it would catch on.)  Tomato is very tied to the Java environment, and is similar to BlueJay in some respects.
