The adoption of Christian values, holidays and other cultural attributes without belief in its supernatural precepts.

It is my understanding that there are several flavors of Judaism OrthodoxJudaism, ReformJudaism etc., and one of those flavors is SecularJudaism. SecularJudaism, I am led to believe, espouses the idea that the stories in the Torah are good stories, the rules are good rules (although a few thousand years out of date in some cases), and that the culture and traditions of Judaism are fun and comforting enough to carry on and pass down to the children. My impression is that this is an actual organized group of people (although I may be very badly mistaken). This seems like a good and sensible thing. I suspect that there is also SecularChristianity (albeit not organized), where people celebrate Christmas and Easter, understand and value the teachings of Christ, view the Bible as a whole as a source of wisdom and allegorical tales, pray because it gives them comfort and strength, but doubt that any dead people have ever been resurrected, that the supernatural sort of miracles ever happen, or that there really is a God. -- anon

''This seems like a good and sensible thing.'' How can giving lip service to anything seem like a good and sensible thing?

''the culture and traditions of Judaism are fun and comforting enough to carry on and pass down'' Seems very odd to say. Judaism and Christianity require one to do things considered weird by society. How can these be considered fun and comforting?

I remember my high school (uh, secondary school) English teacher telling me that she liked being a Roman Catholic for the rituals. I'm wondering how common this is...

Probably very common; I doubt however that any SecularChristianity as described above will get to heaven (they would be mightily surprised that it even existed for real).

  Everyone is trying to get to the bar
  The name of the bar, the bar is called Heaven
  The band in Heaven plays my favorite song
  They play it once again, they play it all night long

  Heaven, heaven is a place where nothing ever happens 
  . . .

"Heaven" is the name of a nightclub in London, England.

Approximately ninety percent of the Danes are members of the Lutheran Church, but most do not believe in the creeds of the church.
They do, however, believe that the rules of common courtesy and common sense are 'Christian values'.

Can this be moved to WhyClublet?

''I'd rather it wasn't, I just found it, thought it interesting and added a little bit.''

You could go see it over at WhyClublet, too. If you think this page is interesting, then chances are good you'll find Why interesting in general.

''It wouldn't be this page if it were on WhyClublet, it would be far more po-faced and lacking the sense of humor that I love finding on WikiWiki. Can't you just ignore it?''
