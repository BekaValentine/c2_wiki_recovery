Sometimes it is difficult to determine what documentation should exist for a project, and what each document should contain.  One good solution to this is to look at who you would expect to be the future audiences of documentation, and develop a document for each audience group.  

For example, where I work, some groups (each with their own set of documentation) include:

 - Regulators
 - Technical Support Staff
 - Clients
 - Employees
Of course, it is frequently possible to cut-and-paste portions of text or graphics from one group's documentation to another group's copy.

Generally if you're going to write technical documentation of any kind, you should get answers to these two questions pretty early in the game:

	* Who is going to read this?
	* What job are they going to do with the information?
