My diploma says I'm an engineer but I sold my soul to the Sales department years ago. I have since developped a mild but chronic case of technology withdrawal which I feed by lurking on techie sites. Got to WikiWiki by accident, and stayed because it excited some ideas lying dormant in my hindbrain about collaborative fiction. I hope to have some worthwhile stuff to contribute along those lines without getting in the way of the bigger projects.
