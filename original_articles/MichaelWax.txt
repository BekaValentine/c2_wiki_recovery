Program primarily in C#, Python, C++, Perl, and (gasp) VBA at work.  Spent many years programming primarily in Java.  Also program in other languages for fun.

The medium is not the message.  Good code does what we want it to do, regardless of the language.  (Certainly internal clients never know or care what language I am using, unless it's VBA which they can see.)
