Has a decision been made yet?

Which day of the week should GeekNight be held on?
	* MichaelRoyle - Saturday morning 8 am.  Just kidding Thursday.
	* ChrisTarttelin reckons Thursday.  He never makes it though, so what does that count.
	* DarrenHobbs also reckons Thursday.  He also never makes it though, so what does that count.
	* MikeMason has never made it since joining TW, since he drives to Hemel. But earlier in the week is probably better than later in the week, and with him not turning up until 7:30 being acceptable would be nice.
	* JimArnold - Wednesday.
	* StevePurcell votes for Wednesday, as a shot of insanity healthily placed mid-week.
	* TomAyerst - Wednesday.  Not Tuesday 'cos of XTC and I do family stuff on Thursday (which is why I've never been yet).
