Hi Phil, how are you doing? -- KeithBraithwaite ''Hi Keith! I'm very well, thank you.''

Phil, I've downloaded and installed BicycleRepairMan, and have had a few problems with it. I've fixed several arrising from BicycleRepairMan_IDLE.py, but haven't touched the other modules. In particular, I've been having problems with the menus. Please indicate your willingness to discuss the issue by posting in my page (http://www.python.org/moin/lwickjr) a link to a page where we can discuss the issue.
