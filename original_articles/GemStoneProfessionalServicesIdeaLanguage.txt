The GemStone Professional Services Idea Language is an IdeaLanguage that I wrote on how to design JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition applications with GemStonej.  The root idea in the language is Layered Architecture (a la FourLayerArchitecture), and it fans out to some 60 other ideas from there.  Some of the ideas from the language have been published individually at http://www.javasuccess.com, but they are out of context on that site.  The language as a whole lives in a WikiWorks installation behind GemStone's firewall, but GemStone has yet to publish it.  --RandyStafford
