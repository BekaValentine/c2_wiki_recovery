XmlTestSuite provides a powerful way to test web applications. 
See http://xmltestsuite.sourceforge.net/ for full details

The main aims of XmlTestSuite are:

	*Tests are written in XML
	*Writing tests requires only a knowledge of HTML and XML
	*Testing encompasses all parts of the system including the database and file system.
	*Test environment is easily extended with new test classes
	*Enables test driven development (see TestDrivenProgramming)
	*Enables functional testing
	*Full compatibility with junit

Its open source. I've used it with asp and cold fusion.

Is there an FAQ for this project, or a support mailing list?  Anyone out there using this?  It looks like something with a lot of potential, so I will give it a try.

I've just tried installing it on Win 2000 to test our AspDotNet project. I know nothing about java, so perhaps there's something I've missed in the install process, but it doesn't work very successfully. It does verify HTML correctly, and can recursively check the links on a page, but when I tried using its XPath assertions to check for the existence of html elements inside a page, or to set values in a form, it gave false positives.

Is this because it's *nix biased? Anyone got it working on Windows?
