What are some of its strengths and weaknesses vs, say, CodeWright, UltraEdit, Emacs, and Vim?

Here is how I would compare Zeus to these editors:

* CodeWright: Very similar in terms of feature set, configurability and target audience. 
* TextPad as UltraEdit:	Not as good a general purpose text editor as these two. Being highly configurable, this does mean Zeus can be a little difficult to use.
* EmacsEditor: Does not try to emulate Emacs, but Zeus does provide an Emacs keyboard mapping.
* Vim: How can anything compare to Vim :)

''Is there a way to hide all the lines that start with more than a specified number of tabs?'' 

Yes and no. Zeus does have the ability to select and hide lines of code into a fold point.
