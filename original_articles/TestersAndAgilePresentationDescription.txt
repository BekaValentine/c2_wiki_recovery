October 2007 Event Announcement:

James Shore, coauthor of The Art of Agile Development and Agile Alliance award winner, is going on tour to celebrate the publication of his new book. For the October XPDX, he will present the following lecture:

Testers and Agile Engineering: Bridging the Gap
Extreme Programming provides a great set of agile engineering practices for programmers, but what about testers?  How do they fit in?  In this presentation, James will share lessons learned from several years of helping testers integrate into agile teams.  Learn how to use testers' specialized skills to prevent defects, not just find them.  Topics include requirements collaboration with Fit, customer reviews, exploratory testing, and working with developers who are using test-driven development.

James will also answer questions, sign books (books will be available for purchase), and give away a copy of The Art of Agile Development to one lucky attendee. For more info about James, visit his website: http://www.jamesshore.com
