A fingerwall is an attachment to a keyboard, a vertical piece. A regular keyboard is horizontal, it sits on the desk. A fingerwall adds another dimension to the keyboard: an L shaped keyboard with a vertical attachment so you can access a wall of keys that is sticking up. You keep your fingers on the home keys of the keyboard while having access to more keys. Keeping the fingers on the home keys is very important in efficient keyboarding.
