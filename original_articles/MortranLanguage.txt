A PublicDomain FortranLanguage preprocessor for StructuredProgramming. 

Mortran3 has been developed at SLAC by A. James Cook (a.k.a. Jim Cook, but probably not JimCook) and L. J. Shustek.

The term Mortran, like FORTRAN, has several meanings, depending upon the context in which the term is used. Mortran has come to mean:
 
	 :	- A Structured Language.
	 :	- A Translator for that language.
	 :	- A Macro-processor.
 
The structured language is implemented as a set of macros which are used by the macro processor to translate the language into FORTRAN. The resulting FORTRAN program is then run like any other FORTRAN program.

For a complete description of the Mortran language, including how to write macros, and the available meta-commands, please see:

So far, so good, but a more general macro-processor could do so much more.
