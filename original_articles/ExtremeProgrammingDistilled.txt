ExtremeProgramming requires 4 things: 
	* You do PairProgramming. 
	* You deliver an increment every three weeks (IncrementalDelivery). 
	* You have a user on the team full time. 
	* You have regression UnitTest''''''s that pass 100% of the time. 

As a reward for doing those, 
	* You don't (need to) put comments in the code.
	* You don't spend time writing requirements or design documentation.

Who manages and co-ordinates ExtremeProjects made up of more than three individuals? (Pair plus User)
