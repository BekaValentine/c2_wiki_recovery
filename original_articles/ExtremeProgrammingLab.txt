Currently consisting of JohnUrberg and JaimmeYork at a small software company in Eau Claire, WI.  Attempting to attract the rest of our development team to join us, but no luck yet.

We are:
	* pair programming (only two of us so it's easy to pick a pair)
	* test first programming
	* working in small iterations
	* limiting ourselves to a 40 hour work week
	* full of courage (we are doing ExtremeProgrammingWithPowerBuilder after all!)
