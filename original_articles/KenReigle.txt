I am currently a TeamLeader for KraftMaidCabinetry - mailto:kenr@kraftmaid.com.

I have accumulated a diverse set of skills over my 18+ years in IT.  When I'm not working or reading, I can be found on the golf course, in a pool hall, or playing EQ.

My latest effort is an attempt to use XP on my team's next project.  See XpKraftMaid.
