[ISBN: 0814404804] is a book on managing people from different generations, each with their different expectations.

An excellent review (actually useful) can be seen at http://web.mit.edu/smr/issue/2000/winter/bookshelf.shtml#generations. (BrokenLink) Someone provide some info (or link to info) on whats in the book?
