I am a software tester and now I am considering automation testing.
Automation is challenging and interesting, I will design a framework to reach my aim of "testers do what really needs a human to do".

After I finish a phase of the framework, I will begin to apply an offer of a U.S. university. I want to do some research on computer science.
