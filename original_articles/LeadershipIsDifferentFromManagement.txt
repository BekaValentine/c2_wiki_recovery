"Management is not something you ''do'' to other people.  You manage your inventory, your checkbook, your resources.  You can even manage yourself.  But you do not manage other human beings.  You manage ''things'', you ''lead'' people." TheServant, p.28

From OnBecomingaLeader, p.45:
	* ''The manager focuses on systems and structure; the leader focuses on people.''
	* ''The manager relies on control; the leader inspires trust.''
	* ''The manager administers; the leader innovates.''
	* ''The manager accepts the status quo; the leader challenges it.''
	* ''The manager does things right; the leader does the right things.''

People much prefer being led than being managed.

Leadership is about guidance and support, Management is about direction and control.

Managers try to create the Thing; good Leaders create the Environment.
