I am a SoftwareDevelopmentCoach introducing ExtremeProgramming and applying AgilePrinciples. I prefer to coach by  being JustaProgrammer PairProgramming with TestFirstDesign with my teammates or facilitating workshops with games. I am an independent consultant operating from my own company Living Software B.V.

I am interested in, amongst other things, ExtremeProgramming, DesignPatterns and TheToyotaWay. Some of my favorite authors are KentBeck, GeraldWeinberg and ChristopherAlexander. 

When I started out as a consultant, I found the work of DavidMaister illuminating. I'm not so sure any more about that. What remained was SecretsOfConsulting, FlawlessConsulting , some SolutionSelling.

Playing games to learn and share experience is fun. For instance the XpGame by VeraPeeters and PascalVanCauwenberghe, GameOfGoose by NynkeFokma and games from the SystemsThinkingPlaybook .

One of my favorite Extreme activities is to ReFactor, especially when using a RefactoringBrowser or similar tools. Refactoring results in SimplyUnderstoodCode. 

If you would like to meet me or other extreme programmers in the Netherlands or Flanders, visit the wiki at http://www.xp-nl.org (in dutch), the official wiki of the DutchXpCommunity.

Favourite languages: RubyLanguage and SqueakSmalltalk also ran: PythonLanguage, JavaLanguage, PerlLanguage. Finally after several years of practice more and more people are starting to see the limitations of the overly complex J2EE :-) 

TestDrivenDevelopment gets me  100% CodeCoverage. Build, install/checkout and monitor scripts are in RubyLanguage these days. Using Ant for this was way too complicated.
