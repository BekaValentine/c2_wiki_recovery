The GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute, if you ask them to, they will analyze the conditions in your company and tell you if it is, or it is not, a great place to work.  According to them, a GreatPlaceToWork is a place in which you "trust the people you work for, have pride in what you do, and enjoy the people you work with."

Companies are selected for "Best Companies", listed primarily on the basis of their employees' responses, in the GreatPlaceToWorkTrustIndex, using a proprietary employee survey developed by the GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute.

I have seen many companies showing with pride that they were given a good grade in the studies this institute provides, but I wonder what do enterprises that get a really bad grade think about the institute...?

I also find it strange that I have been unable to find a single place where someone disagrees with what the GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute thinks about a particular enterprise...  Why would that be (maybe it is not that popular)?

And finally, I wonder, is the GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute a GreatPlaceToWork?  And, how can they determine that objectively...?  Can it even be determined objectively?  Maybe the people that work in a particular place think it is great just because they have not worked anywhere else...?  I wonder if they take into consideration, the experiences of workers who have worked at multiple workplaces, verses just one?
