There hasn't been a CategoryProblem here before.  There are some pages which can go into it.

''At the moment, there are fifteen other pages in this category, not including RecentChanges.  Click on this page's title to see them.''

Surely, one more category is going to break and overload the Wiki software... sheesh... WardsWiki can handle it, and Wiki can use it.  I say go for it.
