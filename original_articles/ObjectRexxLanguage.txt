Object Rexx is an OO dialect of Rexx.

It is still interpreted like RexxLanguage (unlike NetRexxLanguage).

There are two free implementations of object Rexx.  

Open Object Rexx is the successor product to IBM's original Object REXX.  It is open source and has been considerably enhanced since it was an IBM product. It runs under all major operating systems.  

roo! is an independently-developed, freely downloadable object Rexx. It runs under Windows and has many Windows-specific enhancements and tools.
