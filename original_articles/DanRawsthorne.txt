I am one of the "graybeards" - having done OO since 1983. My primary OO interests are analytic in nature, with focus on UseCases, CrcCard''''''s, and other methods of requirements modeling. MyersBriggs = ENTJ, INTP, INTJ, ISTP(different tests, different times, different results...) 

Currently a Senior Coach and Trainer at 3Back (http://www.3Back.com) and can be reached at mailto:dan.rawsthorne@3Back.com . I'm a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) teaching CSM and CSPO courses all over the world. I'm also a PMP and have the PMI-ACP certification

DouglasShimp and I have written a book: ''Exploring Scrum: the Fundamentals'', which we self published. It can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/dp/1461160286

Old Stuff:

Trying to discover the relationships between UseCases, UserStories, EngineeringTask''''''s, and so on. Will use the page UseCaseToUserTask to explore this.
