Currently we trying to implement XP at UdNeueMedien, by following the following practices:

	* TestFirstProgramming
	* PairProgramming
	* PlanningGame
	* StandUpMeeting
	* SmallReleases
	* ContinuousIntegration
	* CollectiveCodeOwnership

and more to add...

As we are real green horns in the XP arena, I would like to trace a bit our adoption of
XP as a company-wide process (can I really say that ? see IsXpaProcess).

For this purpose I would like to update some kind of UdNeueMedienXpDiary on a weekly basis.
Stay tuned.
