A set of interested lectures by DavidParnas on the subject of SoftwareEngineering.

The bullet points are available at: http://www.sqrl.ul.ie/ParnasLectures.html . Very insightful.

Since I can subscribe to mostly every point he's making, but I think agile and Xp-ers may have diverging points I invite others to provide their own comments if any. Among issues that we discussed on WardsWiki there are SoftwareEngineering as engineering discipline and its relation to CS, professional licensing, SoftwareDocumentation, SoftwareInspections, design methodology, and a few others.
