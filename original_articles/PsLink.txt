'''Description'''

(Because I don't have time, I'm just going to stick the automated translation here.) 

PsLink is the software for palms which can treat text data like hypertext.
* By carrying out the tap of the text surrounded by the object for a memorandum "a tag", the text is moved to the memo pad data which it has in a title. A new memorandum is created when data does not exist. 
* By carrying out the tap of the text surrounded by the object for ToDo "a tag", the text is moved to the ToDo data which it has in a title. When data does not exist, a new ToDo item is created. 
* By carrying out a tap, the text surrounded by the object for addresses "a tag" is moved to the address book data the text and name, or whose company name corresponds. When data does not exist, new address data is created. 
* If the tap of the date is carried out, it will move to the schedule near the date. (It cannot move to a repetition schedule.) 
* When the tap of the URL is carried out, it is the Web page A display or " MemoURL URL is saved at ". 
* If the tap of the mail address is carried out, mail can be transmitted to the address. 
* In addition, a link can be set as the application corresponding to global reference. 
* '''PsLink is a based on the source code of PalmWiki'''

If this is anything like PsMemo, which is another fine software from the author, then we're in for a real treat. It looks like it supports Japanese, English. There's also a separate build for French. The author also provides some extensions to link to external applications like Mail, MemoURL, Agendus, iambicMail. You can link to Memo, Address, Todo, Mail, even hand-drawn notes like Cliememo, or you can define your own application links. (CliffordCaoile, 2004/09/05)

What about PalmOS 5+ compatibility? I have only 4.* and can't try myself... (Andrew)

Does work perfectly on OS 5+ (at least on my 5.2.1 T|3) (Vincent)

Well it says on the page that it is for PalmOS 5 and up. It doesn't look like it supports 4 or below. There are lots of Wiki-enabling extensions for 4, though. BTW, the bug-fix version 0.6 just came out this week.(CliffordCaoile, 2004/12/23)
