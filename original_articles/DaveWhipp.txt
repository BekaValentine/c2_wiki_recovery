I currently work for NVIDIA (http://nvidia.com).

My job is verification of hardware (ASICs), which involves writing a lot of software. An interesting feature is that the software is the acceptance tests for the hardware ... and the hardware (simulation) is the acceptance tests for the software! This seems like a good scenario for XP, though I'm still working on introducing the core practices
