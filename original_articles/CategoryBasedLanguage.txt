A category for any language that people assert is "based" in something.

E.g., PrototypeBasedLanguage, TupleBasedLanguage, etc.

I'm disappointed I was hoping this was about languages based on CategoryTheory, like CharityLanguage.

''That's what SaundersMacLane gets for picking such a generic name for the math.  Like how CategoryTheory needs a disclaimer that "This is not a category for theories."''

Yes, ''but,'' this is probably the ''only'' wiki category page that applies also to itself --- meaning, CategoryBasedLanguage can itself serve as a page describing category-based languages.  :-)
