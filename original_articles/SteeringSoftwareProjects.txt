Here is an attempt to create demand for processes like EvolutionaryDelivery and ExtremeProgramming, on the assumption that once the demand is there, the names won't matter so much.

''Why must the demand be created?  Isn't there already sufficient demand for better software development?  Instead of creating some high minded sounding document, I think we would be better off addressing the problems that exist today and how they can be solved.  [I don't mean so sound contentions here, but I do believe the approach started here is not productive and want to suggest a better alternative.]''

If you want these rights, there is a process called ExtremeProgramming which allows your programming team to hold up their end of this deal.
