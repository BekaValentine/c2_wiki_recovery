CollaborationIsNotOnePersonDoingAllTheWork. There is no option but to think ThinkWinWin and develop a CollaborationMaturityModel. 

WikiSym came and went as well. I tried to draw attention to people here that MeatBall GodKing needed help. What LessonsInCollaboration did we learn?

And when was the last time we had a CommunityProject where more than 3 or 4 people come together to create DocumentMode material that is useful? 

Have you gone out and try to invite people to come to C2 this year? I know how I behaved when a lot of people were busy in their EditWars. 

And I am comforted by the fact that despite all the WikiNoisePollution, there are people here that can serve as my role model. They are contented to cleaning up spelling mistakes, create useful material for entry level people, etc etc.

If you ask me WhatIsaCommunity, then my response would be people listed above. And content will come, if these people stick around. This is not VoiceOfWiki, it is created by one person, but the delete by another very visible person has been left unsupported for three weeks.
