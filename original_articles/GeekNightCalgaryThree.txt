Eric, what kind of docs are you using NakedObjects to generate?

In the NakedObjects framework, UserStories can be coded as AcceptanceTest''''''s. If you run such a test and it was successful, the framework automatically creates a HTML documentation file. This file contains the steps of your UserStory in written words, along with some graphical illustrations. I got that working on a simple story and it is quite neat! The authors of the book suggest that this documentation can become a substantial chunk of the user training manual.  -- EricLiu
