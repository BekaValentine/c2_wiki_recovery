BoundsChecker is an indispensable tool for Windows programming. It finds errors that no one else can find (including tons in Microsoft's code!!). Its main focus is on finding memory leaks.

''I have used the BoundsChecker tool a little bit. It did a good job of finding routine VisualBasic errors. I haven't used it enough, however, to say whether it's a solution to some of the problems described in ThingsWeHateAboutVbClassic. -- RobertEikel''

''How does it compare to leak detectors like Purify and ElectricFence???''

ElectricFence appears to be a malloc replacement that places each memory block onto a separate page with guard pages on either side to catch overwrites. The trick is to place the memory at the end of the block so writing off the end causes a fault. You can set up read/write faults.

BoundsChecker does not currently do this. (The main reason is that all the guard pages make your program run extremely slowly. Also there is a lot of software out there that thinks writing beyond the end isn't bad.)  
BoundsChecker catches writing off the end using a technique that warns you of the error but won't cause your application to crash when you touch the block.

Microsoft's VC++ compiler and libraries include tools that help with finding off-the-end errors and memory leaks. There are also new compiler settings in VC7.1 that can help find stack overwrites.
