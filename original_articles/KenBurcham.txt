It is funny, but I think this is the longest lasting "Ken Burcham" page on the net.  :)  

Well if you're wondering what I'm up to lately, my blog is here: http://kenspancakehouse.blogspot.com/

I'm working at CTUIR in pendleton, oregon, now, after traipsing from coast to coast to back again.  Just programming and raising my family and serving the Lord!

that's it for the moment.  But at least it cleans up my "Are You There" tag.  :)

I think you may be the first pastor/programmer I've met.
So have you seen DonKnuth or http://theconnexion.net/compass/ ?
