I chose DavidBrownAsWell because there was already a DavidBrown, which is not really a surprise.

I was first exposed to Smalltalk in 1985 when a good friend made me read the Blue Book. I then found a copy of Little Smalltalk by Timothy Budd, and got it working on our school's computer (I received a BS in Computer Science from Western Washington University (http://www.wwu.edu)). I did some time at Microsoft, and then got a job that actually paid me to program in Smalltalk in 1993.

I love Smalltalk. It's probably the most elegant language I know.

Wow. I can't believe my page is still here!

I've changed jobs twice since then, first to a small startup that I had a really horrible time at, and now at another startup where I get to program in Java, writing servlets, and generally get to hang out with really cool people.

This is a fantastic resource. I hope it lasts a very long time.

I am amused that my choice of DavidBrownAsWell has sparked some interest (not much, really) in figuring out how to deal with name collisions in Wiki. Since DavidBrown is a more common name than I would like, it is something that should be dealt with.
