BoostTupleLibrary in one of the BoostLibraries. It is closely linked to the BoostLambdaLibrary. See '''http://boost.org/libs/tuple/doc/tuple_users_guide.html'''.

It is one of the items included in the TechnicalReportOne and also implemented in VariadicTemplatesForGnuCpp. This means that the library will become redundant except to support old code and compilers which don't support the new implementations. See CeePlusPlusEleven.

The tuple concept expands StdPair to heterogeneous objects containing two or more items.

One application is to enable a function to return multiple values.
