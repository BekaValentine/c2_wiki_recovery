Mostly a manifesto, but it announces:
	* lengthy A & D are poor investments
	* user satisfaction is impossible
	* abstract requirements are largely imaginary
	* complete and unambiguous specifications are ineffectual

Replace instead with (it says)
	* always analysis (as an ongoing service)
	* dynamic requirements negotiation
	* incomplete and usefully ambiguous specifications
	* continuous redevelopment
	* adaptability orientation

A primary position is that the IS systems in an Emmergent Organization will always be changing. This causes those systems to always be in maintenance mode. As a result, the up-front analysis and design that is traditionally perform to ''reduce'' maintenance costs is ultimately wasted time.

These conclusions are remarkably close to many of the new RapidDevelopment methodologies such as ExtremeProgramming or AdaptiveSoftwareDevelopment. However, it differs dramatically in its view of the user and user-satisfaction.
