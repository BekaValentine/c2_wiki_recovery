I recently configured a Tkinter canvas such that parent and child data shapes appeared on top of each other, but if you dragged and dropped certain special shapes a rubber band would appear linking them back to where they came. And some special shapes would have children, or grand-children, that were special too, so you could slide them too.

But when you did, the rubber band positions would have to update to point to their parents. And if you drag their parents the slid special children, with their rubber bands, would have to slide too.

I eventually had test cases like "test_ShowSlidSpecialSiblingsOfSlidSpecialsSlide" or "test_NonSpecialSiblingsOfSlidSpecialsAreSessile" or "test_ReorientRubberBandsOfReslidChildSpecials".

I commented them with "# try to say this, Mr. Knox, sir!"

''# Bring your mouth this way.  I'll find it something it can say.''
