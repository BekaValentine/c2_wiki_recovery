Here are the things I remind myself to do when I am facilitating any
group.

	* don't show off -- you are there to convince them that they are smart, not that you are smart.
	* look to who you want to speak -- also, know who needs to be heard and when
	* let people think -- have them write alone, or discuss in pairs, before speaking to the group
	* don't work too hard -- set easy goals and take breaks. brilliance will happen soon enough
	* make a mental list of what you wish would happen -- revise it at each break

There may be good books out there. The only thing that comes to my mind is NormKerth's book on ProjectRetrospectives, a specialized kind of workshop. -- WardCunningham

IBM used to have a class in JointApplicationDesign (JAD) that taught very effective facilitation techniques.  They provided the book 'How to Make Meetings Work' by Michael Doyle and David Straus ISBN:0-515-09048-4 as part of the course materials.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in facilitation. -- MarkAddleman
