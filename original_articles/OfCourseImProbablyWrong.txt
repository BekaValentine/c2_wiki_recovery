When I read OfCourseImProbablyWrong, in the proper context, I see it as an introduction to an unproven hypothesis. I value those. I also value the ability to distinguish between them and proven hypotheses. It can be dangerous to find yourself running an experiment when you'd intended to apply a solution. That said "OfCourseImProbablyWrong" sounds unnecessarily self-deprecating. A simple "I think" would do in its place, I think. -- PhilGoodwin

I find that ContradictionIndicatesFalseFact:
No matter how '''"heavily proven"''' my knowledge is,
when the conclusion is a contradiction ''(like "1=2")'',
then I know that some "fact" I consider True is actually False.
