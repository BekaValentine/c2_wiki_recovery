A web-page similar to a Wiki one (see WikiWikiWeb), or sharing with it some basic concepts (all users can edit pages and so on).

I had a thought about Wiki-Like. I wanted to develop a Web page that browsed like a wiki, i.e. automatically create pages and link by typing CamelCase or using [[ - ]] type brackets and | pipes, but wasn't editable. Thoughts..comments... -- RobHolecko

If it's not editable, how does one automatically create pages or add links? Do you mean not editable by others? In that case, investigate WikiEngines with permissions.

Or do you mean using a wiki to create static Web pages?

Or perhaps you mean using wiki syntax to write Web pages. In that case, it should be easy to write a script to translate ''foo'' to <em>foo</em>, [[URL|link text]] to <a href="URL">link text</a>, etc.

'''Things of which WikiLikeThing''''''s are a part: '''
* H''''''yperArtifact
** Newly created hyperSpecification which deals, not only with what you type in, but how what you have typed in is handled. Such things as how to display it, manipulate it, store it and retrieve it. 
* WikiWords: in their various rawForms are candidatesForInclusion in this special artifact.. 
* OtherWords: In fact, if the H''''''yperArtifact has a H''''''yperArtifactprocessor designed with the ability to use them as hyperLinks, even Ordinary Words, Objects, States, Events, Actuators, D''''''ateTimeWords, A''''''cronymsAndAbbreviations, numbers, A''''''udibleFiles, A''''''lphanumericWords, or even Individual Characters can be included. 

In line with "To define is perhaps to value" We can include them in a thing called a H''''''yperRepository): 
* all reachableArtifacts (artifacts we know about and which become accessible at least in part), as well as 
* all discoverableFutureOrConnectableArtifacts,

A prominent example of a WikiLike system is http://piratepad.net, which is an EtherPad with links, created by surrounding the link text with double brackets.
Actually it appears to be the first rudimentary EtherPadWiki. To see it in use -> LikePlusButton.  -- FridemarPache
