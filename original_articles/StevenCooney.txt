Hey, go ahead and add stuff to SymbolicUserInterface if you like. The glyph engine was something I came up with for KatascopeStudio. It worked. . to some degree but it was more of a user interface mechanism than a true language -- LayneThomas

About to head out, but we can discuss all you like in thread mode on SymbolicUserInterface. The page isn't "complete", and a couple rounds of threads would probably help. -- LayneThomas
