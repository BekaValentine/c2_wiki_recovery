I've just been noticing this WikiWiki thing for about about a week (as of
Sept 13, 2002).  I'm wondering about using it as a tool for in-house communications at work.

''See WikiWikiClone for more ideas that might be suitable for an "intranet" or corporate environment.''

Thanks much for the suggestion.  I'll go read it now.

I've finally set up a WikiWiki at Work, using the MoinMoin code.  Now for the major propaganda effort to get people to use it.  

''Update:''  This was an almost total failure.  I used it personally and it served my needs well.  On the other hand, even after extensive propagandizing on my part, I got 0 (zip,zero,nada) hits in my server logs that anyone even looked at other than the home page.

I'm now (March 30, 2005) trying to get a wiki going at my new company.  If anyone knows of a particularly easy way to handle equations (sometimes very complex equations) in a wiki.  I would appreciate hearing about it.

''There are some wikis out there that handle equations, usually by calling out to LaTex. Here's one example: http://mcelrath.org/Notes/LatexWiki. I was able to hack LaTex into my PersonalWiki (a modified ClusterWiki) with about fifty lines of code. Leave a note on my HomePage if you're interested in the details. -- MarkIrons''
