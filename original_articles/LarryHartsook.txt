I'm a software engineer with Electronic Defense Systems Division (EDSD)
of GTE Government Systems Corp. We're located in Mountain View, CA.

I stumbled across the Gang-of-Four's book at the beginning of 1995 and
have been gently proselytizing folks around here in the ways of patterns
ever since.
