Altimara used to make a nifty still compositing package (think PhotoShop layers, except on steroids). Then PhotoShop came out with layers, and while AltimaraComposer was better, PhotoShop was GoodEnough for most people, thus making Altimara lose MarketShare. Altimara sold out to MicroSoft, which renamed the program MicrosoftImageComposer, which is a surprisingly nifty program that can only be gotten with FrontPage2000.
