A lot of people I know have two or more computers.  Typically they have a computer for RealWork, which often is a mac, or a linux machine (or in one case a machine running BeOs).  Then they might have other computers for fun or work, like a freebsd file server, openbsd firewall, old sun or SiliconGraphics workstation.  And then, most of them have their GameBox, a machine soley for playing games and watching dvds, and maybe using it to covert that one pesky word file that most non microsoft wordprocessors choke on.

''Really?  When I heard GameBox I thought of Playstation or Dreamcast.''

Also known as a LegacyBox when it's slower and runs older OSes in an attempt to play classic games like X-Com: UFO Defense that don't run on newer systems.

''Another name for a LegacyBox is a RetroPc. An alternative solution is to write a 386 CpuSimulator, and some hardware simulators and tie everything together so you can run WingCommander (the first one) in a window on your G4 iMac (assuming, that is, you have a G4 iMac, a copy of DOS, the time to put together the simulators, and a copy of WingCommander).''

There's MsVirtualPc... haven't tried WingCommander yet, wonder how it'd run.
