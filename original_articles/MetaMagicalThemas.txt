The name of DouglasHofstadter's column in the magazine ScientificAmerican published from circa 1981. 
----
The name is remarkable because it is an anagram of MathematicalGames, which was the name of the same column when MartinGardner was writing it. A book of almost the same name:

''Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern'',

[ISBN 0465045669] collected the columns and, I think, some related material that did not make it into ScientificAmerican. The book is a collection of DouglasHofstadter's columns, each paired with a reflection on the column written by Hofstadter. I am under the impression it was published in order to maintain his public presence while he worked on other books -- I seem to recall his writing something to that effect in his LeTonBeauDeMarot.
