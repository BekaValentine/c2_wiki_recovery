I'm working as an independent trainer and consultant. I'm mainly helping people applying agility in large projects. 

I was hugged by the idea of XP when I first heard about it (this was probably the practitioner report about the Payroll Project at OOPSLA'97). The agile value system provides a wonderful guideline for working in a successful and enjoyable environment.
