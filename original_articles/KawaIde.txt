http://www.allaire.com/products/kawa/index.cfm. It's pretty easy to use, will run tests in  JavaUnit ( JunitWithKawa ), and probably a good choice for beginners.

This is also the JavaIde used at XpImmersion.

''On 6 November 1999, Kawa was sold to Allaire, and then later to Macromedia.  The URLs still point at allaire, and may need to be updated soon.''

I use Kawa all the time, and have done for several years.  I find running
JavaUnit tests cumbersome (I can't just click on the JavaUnit stack trace to locate a fault, it won't let me recompile-all while JUnit is running etc.) and yet you claim that it integrates well.

Is there something I'm missing?  How do you integrate Junit with Kawa?

''I think that "well" is relative.  You can add it as a command so that it appears in the right menu when you click on a file.  Very relative. :-)  I have to take a look at Kawa 4 to see if things have gotten better. -- MichaelFeathers''
