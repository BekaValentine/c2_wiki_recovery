To collaborate in accordance with WikiCopyRights some online authentication mechanism seems to be necessary.

For example, author A gives author B permission to use some of his/her material on an external host (''e.g.'' a dedicated WikiForum).
To ensure, that the original author (and not a faked one) is giving permission, the following '''Authentication By Website''' procedure is suggested:

Author A
	1 gives a written permission on his/her external static Website
	1 establishes BidirectionalLink''''''s between his/her Website, the appropriate WikiPage and the new target page for applying the permission
	1 lets archive the permission document on a public Web archive

Author B 
	1 acknowledges on his/her target page the permission
	1 bidirectionally links the involved pages
	1 lets archive the acknowledge document on a public Web archive
