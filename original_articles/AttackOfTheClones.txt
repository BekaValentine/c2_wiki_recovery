Yet another StarWars movie.  And the one whose title sounds most like a cheesy B-movie, which is what the series has become.

If only GeorgeLucas had done what the had the good sense to do what he did for ''Empire'' and ''Jedi''--'''hire a real director.'''

Or a real writer, many many of the star wars novels would have made far better movies than what he wrote.
