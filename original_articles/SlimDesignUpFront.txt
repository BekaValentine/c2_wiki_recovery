In introducing XP to a team used to traditional design and review techniques, I found it helpful to have a 'slim' design instead of 'no' design.  Hence, SlimDesignUpFront (SDUF).   I don't know if this is only useful to help people cope with the transition to XP or a valuable technique in it's own right.  

It helped our team convince other stakeholders who were not used to XP that we had enough of our bases covered.  We could then do some XP.

SDUF consisted of the simplest document that could possibly work, including 
a) ISO boiler plate front matter
b) A Statement of the user story (from the external user's view)
c) A 'statement' of the Unit Test case (or reference to the code)
d) A checklist ensuring we thought of localization, performance, migration, logging, etc.

Developers could optionally add internal design in UML, but no one did.

It was easier to give folks a lightweight design doc than to convince them to accept NO design doc.
