'''Comments'''

''Except that they aren't. A hint to the person or persons mindlessly (via script, I assume) categorizing pages - Time in the title doesn't mean the page is concerned with time and programming. See ExposureTimeCalculator. If categories are to be just cached FindPage searches like this, we can do without them.''

ExposureTimeCalculator is about calculating the exposure time for the HubbleTelescope. It is about time and it is about programming, using the various variables in a calculation which determines how long the exposure should be.
