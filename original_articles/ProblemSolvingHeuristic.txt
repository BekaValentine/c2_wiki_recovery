See HeuristicRule.

A generalized rule or method for solving programming problems.

Some of the more robust ones include:
* GreedyAlgorithm
* DivideAndConquer
* DynamicProgramming
* ProcessOfElimination

So-called MetaHeuristics include:
* GeneticAlgorithm
* TabuSearch
* SimulatedAnnealing

"Old standbys" include:
* BruteForce
* RandomSearch

''Actually, some of these I would not count as heuristics. Instead, they are more like general search paradigms.''

Good point. My understanding of the word "heuristic" is that it implies that a method is not guaranteed to find a globally optimal solution. This is not the case for DynamicProgramming and BruteForce search (provided you have enough time).
