A really insane person who occasionally pretends to be able to write software.
----
And he actually writes software, too.  He lives in AucklandCity, NewZealand, and recently completed a degree at MasseyUniversityAlbany.

He's also a big fan of the BastardOperatorFromHell, written by SimonTravaglia.

He's just started learning ExtremeProgramming (though he's done bits of it before), and he's starting to like it :)

Without question, his favourite TV series is BabylonFive, followed by ReBoot :)
His favourite movie at the moment is TheMatrix.  And he really enjoyed ThePrincessBride.

MyersBriggs: INTP (67-11-44-44, at least according to one test)
----
His favourite Wiki pages (in no particular order) are:
	* RonJeffries
	* BugsArentVoodoo
	* LatherRinseRepeat
	* TaoOfProgramming
	* ProgrammingIsFun
	* LlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyllLlantysiliogogogoch
	* HeisenBug
	* QuotesOnProgramDevelopment
	* ZeroOneInfinityRule
	* CowOrker''''''s
	* DafinitionalHumor
	* OldRulesWithOutdatedForces

He's also getting dangerously addicted to http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/quickChanges?days=1
Also just discovered http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/wantedWikiPages, but hasn't decided if he's going to do anything about it yet :)

Here's a good quote he found on CreepingFeaturitis:

	 :	''"Engineers are people who love to solve problems. They love solving problems so much, that, given''
	 :	''no problems at all, they will invent some to solve." -- MichaelFeathers'' (don't know if that's his quote or if he was merely the one who put in on the page...)
----
And here's something else he found lying around... he's not sure if he agrees with it (lacking sufficient information), but it sounded cool:

	 :	''Java. The elegant simplicity of C++. The blazing speed of Smalltalk. Nothing that achieves this level of insult to three sets of language zealots in eleven words should ever be removed entirely from Wiki.''
----
And another one :)

	 :	''Programming is '''hard''' because its closest two traditional jobs would be mathematics and philosophy - except that unlike philosophers programmers need to produce something, and unlike mathematicians programmers have no proof of anything.''
