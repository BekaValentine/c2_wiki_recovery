A formal dialect of English spoken largely by upper-class English people. It is a common misconception of American people that all English people speak TheQueensEnglish. In fact, the majority of English people speak in a less formal manner, and regard TheQueensEnglish as old-fashioned and somewhat amusing. TheQueensEnglish predates and is precursor to its transatlantic cousin, AmericanEnglish.

''Called TheKingsEnglish when a male monarch is on the throne. It is not, of course, defined by how the monarch speaks. By extension, it also covers the written language.''
