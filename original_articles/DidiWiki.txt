'''Question'''

Who is supporting DidiWiki at present?  

I have un-linked the didiwiki.org link at the top of this page.  It is a spamming site now, and not related to the cool little personal wiki implementation.  

'''Answer'''
See above.  Also there is a fork called CiWiki

'''Question'''

I don't have Cygwin but I do have Windows 98. Will Didi work on my machine. Does it require a server or a browser? 

'''Answer'''
Cygwin is a unix environment for windows it is free and quite nice, to run didiwiki under windows you NEED cygwin. didiwiki runs as it's own server so all you need is a browser to access it.

Normally to run cygwin apps you don't need the whole cygwin installed on your machine, you just need a few DLLs from cygwin (if you know the right ones)
if you don't want to use the disk space of a whole cygwin install just to make DidiWiki work.
I haven't tried, but you may be able to compile DidiWiki under DJGPP as well, in which case it would run stand-alone.
