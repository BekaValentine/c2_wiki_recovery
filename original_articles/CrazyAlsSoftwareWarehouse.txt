Why are my prices so low !?

Because we take the remaining bits from many different programs, repackage them, and make them available to you at a fraction of the price you would expect to pay in stores.

''Am I missing something here? Is this a joke? Is this discussing CodeReuse, ComponentBasedDesign?''

Somewhat of a private joke, I'm afraid.   MichaelHill parodying bargain-basement quality code.  There must be a reason the timescales are low, the costs are cheap, ''etc, etc.''  That's right - poor, poor quality. -- AlanFrancis

CrazyAlsSoftwareWarehouse is a shorthand I've used to describe our industry from time to time.  Didja ever see one of those ads for somebody's furniture warehouse?  The guy looks goofy and insane and talks really fast, and at the end he says "why are my prices so low?  I must be CRAAAAAAAZY!!!".  (Just for the record I ''am'' critical of CodeReuse as a driving concept for delivering software, and even ComponentBasedDesign seems to me like one more attempt to over-generalize our work.  Still, the joke is just a joke, and it attacks an attitude more than it does any specific practice.)  -- MichaelHill
