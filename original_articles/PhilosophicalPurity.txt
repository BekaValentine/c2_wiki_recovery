A line of argument that corporate technical architect types are forced to rely on to influence the technology adopted by line-of-business development teams. Frequently "substantiated" with unquantifiable claims about said technology's better:

* scalability

* reliability

* open-ness

* security

* etc.

I should know: I had this unfortunate job a few years back! Even though the technologies we were pushing were probably great choices, the approach was horribly frustrating and unproductive. Has anyone else been caught in this role? How did you escape? -- BillBarnett
