The belief that the only way to motivate people to do what you want them to do is by the use of physical or verbal threats. Also contains the belief that anyone (over the age of about 4) actually ever does what you want them to do or that you can or need to in fact motivate people. -- 2003.24.12 PhilStubbington

This reminds me of a song by Hugh Laurie (better known as Dr. Gregory House nowadays) which is basically a critique of how the US government manages things, the bits in brackets should be screamed as loud as possible...

 Well, the world is facing problems getting bigger every day,
 They've got a greenhouse over Texas and recession's on the way,
 Although people tell you that this planet's dying fast,
 Well, I ain't seen a problem yet can't be solved by kicking ass.

 Kickin' ass, (KICKIN AY-ASS)
 Kickin' ass is what we do,
 Kickin' ass, (KICKIN AY-ASS)
 Iron foot in the velvet shoe.
 We don't care whose ass we kick, if we're ever all alone,
 We just stand in front of the mirror, and try and kick our own.

 Well, we kicked ass in Grenada and we kicked ass in Iraq,
 We kicked the ass out of the ozone layer, now they say we've gotta kick it back,
 We'll kick the ass of cancer and we'll kick the ass of AIDS,
 And as for Global Warming, well, just kick ass wearing shades.

 Well, you can haul your ass or shut your ass or bust an ass is fine,
 And there ain't no better place to put your ass than on the line,
 But if you're like us, (YEE-HAA!) Thank you,
 And you won't take second best,
 You'll put your kickin' boots on, and kick like all the rest.
 Thankyou.
