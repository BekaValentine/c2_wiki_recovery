"Identify the Champion" is a small PatternLanguage by OscarNierstrasz intended to give direction in the task of running a program committee.

----

'''Problem'''

How should you design the review process so that the PC meeting will succeed in selecting the best papers?

----

'''Solution'''

Make the paper review and selection process for a scientific conference more efficient by focusing programme committee members' attention on whether or not they will "champion" a submitted paper during the program committee meeting.

Be sure to distribute the papers to program committe members who are likely to champion them.  
* Organize 
** the review forms
** the ranking and sorting of reviews
** detection of conflicts
** the review meeting itself around the identification of champions  
* Use rating schemes 
* with explicit operational meaning
** such as, "I will champion this paper"
* rather than implicit, subjective meaning
** such as "strong accept", or "better than average", or "5"  
* Group papers 
** around presence or absence of champions and detractors 
** rather than ranking them by weighted scores  
* Drive all discussions and decisions toward IdentifyTheChampion
