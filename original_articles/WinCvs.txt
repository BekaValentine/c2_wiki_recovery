Windows version of ConcurrentVersionsSystem is available

As indicated at http://www.cvshome.org/dev/codewindow.html, "There are two ways to run CVS on Windows 95/NT. The first is as a client, talking to a CVS server on a Unix box, or to a CvsNt server on a Windows box.  This is the recommended setup and is commonly used.  The second way is known as "local" or "non-client/server" CVS. "
