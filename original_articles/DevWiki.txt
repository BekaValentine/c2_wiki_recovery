A Java wiki implementation which is fairly mature. Currently works with Apache and JServ on Linux and Win32; work in the pipe to get it working on Tomcat as well. (Tomcat works now but configuration looks hairy.)

	* '''A running DevWiki:''' http://www.devtools.org/tomcat/wiki
	* '''Source code and binaries:''' http://webtrans.sourceforge.net
	* '''Author:''' mailto:rus@devtools.org
	* '''How-tos:''' http://www.devtools.org/tomcat/wiki/InstallingWiki http://www.devtools.org/tomcat/wiki/CustomizingWiki

'''Design Highlights'''

	* Flexible architecture for adding new syntactic elements
	* Lots of services for creating complex behavior (database backend instead of flat files, versioning support, etc)
	* Config-file-driven for quick reconfiguring (no recompile needed)

'''Feature Highlights'''

	* Can have multiple "WikiSpace''''''s" which allow a single wiki server to have several different types of content.  Each space can have its own syntactic elements, its own RecentChanges page, and its own colors, while still being cross-linked via mixed-case words

	* Can have CVS backend which allows content to be versioned for easy recovery.  (Coming soon: colorized change tracking on the pages)

	* Can have custom logos, buttons, and page colors for your own Look & Feel

	* Can delete pages

	* Escape sequence character for inserting plain HTML

	* Conflict detection and resolution when two people save edits to a page at the same time

	* Pretty nice color-coded RecentChanges page; check it out: http://www.devtools.org/servlet/wiki/widget/RecentChanges

	* Automatically generated UsagePage that reports the site's installed syntactic elements and how to use them

	* The site's utility pages for saving, editing, deleting, and searching are themselves all implemented as wiki pages, so they are (if you want) editable on the fly also.  This makes it very easy to add new messages, looks, and functionality without even restarting the server, much less recompiling.  For more on this, see http://www.devtools.org/servlet/wiki/CustomizingWiki

Additional features:
	* A simple table markup, see http://www.devtools.org/tomcat/wiki/TableTest

	* New linking strategies allow acronyms such as NASA, and will correctly LinkRootWords when they have suffixes such as 'ed', 's', 'es', and 'ing'.  For instance a page named ReFactorings would first link to ReFactoring and if it doesn't exist, then to ReFactor.

Newly released (August 10, 2003):
	* InterWiki syntax.

	* ChangeDescriptions

I'm using DevWiki on my development box and am considering promoting it to deployment. Nice work, Rus! You might want to work on getting your Web site links settled down. I seem to need to resort to a Web search every time I need to find your site. Another big problem is the JSERV dependency when most of us (?) are using Tomcat. I wound up using a Tomcat version provided by one of your users, but his wiki directory organization bore no resemblance to yours. This makes it very confusing. I'd be happy to provide the Tomcat changes; config files mostly. -- BradCox
