The VademClio (aka Sharp Tri Pad) is a three-pound pen-based Windows CE (WinCe/PocketPc) computer.

I'm wondering whether anyone has been working with Squeak on it.
(I'm aware that there are Windows CE (WinCe) versions of Squeak, though I haven't read much about what folks are doing with it.)

With its pen-based screen, seems to me it's got a lot of potential.
If I get any free time I'll try it ... has anyone else started already?
