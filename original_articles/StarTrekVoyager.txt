One of the many TV shows set in the StarTrek world, and probably the BEST.

''Sort of a Gilligan's Island of the StarTrek universe. A lone ship is lost 80 years from the Alpha quadrant at maximum warp. They must get home. Many episodes end with them not quite making it, usually through some combination of Federation morals and under-explained "technology incompatibilities."''

They do make advances though. I think in one episode they cut 20 years off their trip thanks to a special type of warp drive that they stole from a borg ship; it also saved many lives.

''Except they never put too fine a point on how many years left that leaves. Apart from its notoriously poor production values, this series is very badly afflicted with TechnologyEvaporation, even worse than the original series.''

In defense of the evaporation, would you attach some weird alien gadget you just found to the engine of your car? without being able to send it to the Institute for Dangerous Research to actually figure out what it does?

In a few of the plots they actually did attach that weird gadget to their engine. And it got them into very deep sh*t.

I was puzzled by the fact that they wanted to get home, and it was going to take all these years at maximum warp but they  never went that fast.

The captain in this series was arguably the villain.
