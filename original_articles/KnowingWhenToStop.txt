There have been three 'aha' moments for me on IndexCard''''''s:

	* In the coffee shop when Ward turned that card 90 degrees from all the others (sorry it's too precious and personal to describe in detail in something as "open and vulnerable as Wiki")

	* Realising as the NikiNiki team tried to capture all details of UserStories and EngineeringTask's for Niki on Niki that we had somehow lost the wonder of XP's "card plus conversations" - which reminds me of the other DontImproveItUntilYouveUnderstoodIt mistakes we made along the way.

	* Reading this in VlissidesOnBeck: "a la CRC, where you keep people from blathering through sheer physical constraint? ... Right. You say the three most important sentences you have to say."

Blathering too much unverifiable stuff and not paying attention to human relationships - the two biggest problems in most projects (and on Wiki).

Time for me to stop too. --RichardDrake
