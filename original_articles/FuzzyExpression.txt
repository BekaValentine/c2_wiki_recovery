A FuzzyExpression combines FuzzyVariables with FuzzyLogic operators into something new. Either another FuzzyVariable, or a plain-logic BooleanExpression, or something that can be switched to the implementation of the current logical system, and thus invoke an event or action. E.g.: ''"If the temperature is warm, then turn the cooler on low; if the temperature is hot, then turn the cooler on high."''
