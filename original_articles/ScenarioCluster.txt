A cluster of ScenarioTextualDescriptions (or UseCases) is a group of STDs that are related in some way. For example, you may have a STD that describes how to make a call, but it has alternatives for error handling like the caller places the phone on hook before finishing.

Whole subsystems can be delineated by clusters.
