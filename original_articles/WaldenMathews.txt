MeanProgrammer seeking work. My main areas of expertise are in middleware and messaging frameworks, but lately I think I'm starting to grok the Web. On the scale defined by DanielJackson's "thinkers" and "tinkers", I gravitate toward the former, which means I take more delight in "nailing the problem" than in just getting something to work. Armchair etymologist, formal modeler, senior project irritant. Don't hire me unless you ''mean'' it.

Okay, I'm not seeking work anymore, so youse can all stop with the mouth watering job offers. Thank you.

CollaborationLeadsToHalfFinishedWork is better renamed to the page name you have suggested. I agree collaboration has nothing to do with success or failure. Please rename that page with my full support.
