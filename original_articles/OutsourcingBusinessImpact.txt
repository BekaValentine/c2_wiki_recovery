'''Startup concerns'''

Has to select a suitable implementation partner. Typically a consulting group that has expertise in both countries need to be chosen. It will be difficult to establish concrete success criteria, manage timescales and deliverables.

Productivity drop due to learning curves of the offshore implementation team are often underestimated.

Proponents of Outsourcing are everywhere, one 2004 article can be found at http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2004/0,4814,93413,00.html

'''Ongoing Operations'''

Impact of Timezone differences are often underestimated. Business application owners are ill prepared for early morning or late at night meetings to discuss project requirements or progress.

'''CultureShock'''

Cultural assumptions and idioms can cause problems between native english speakers in different countries.  When trying to communicate between native english speakers and non-native english speakers, these problems are only compounded.

Besides language, big cultural gaps exist in "value systems", legal matters, organization cultural mismatches.

'''ManagementOfReputationalRisk'''

Often even with due diligence, a firm seeking a joint venture partner for InternationalOutsourcing may not have sufficient understanding of the "true situation" in a remote country for risk assessment purposes. 

A Jun05 article on China, at http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1504423,00.html, gave some warning about aspects requiring closer inspection (e.g. law enforcement in a foreign country). There were some hints that companies in that country may not see it in their interests to "play by the rules".

'''Standard Consultant Problems'''

Whenever someone is writing software that someone else is going to get the copyright to, there is a lack of institutional investment.  Witness Microsoft writing OS/2 and the choice of 80286 assembly language.

----
'''DistributedSoftwareDevelopment problems'''

Even between people who work in the same building, speak the same language, grew up in the same local area, and meet face to face several times a week, it is easy to have miscommunications about desires, specifications, timelines, and such.  These problems can only be compounded if contact is limited to the telephone or email.
