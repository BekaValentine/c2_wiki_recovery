An excerpt:
	 :	About 2,300 years ago in what is now north China, a lineage of military leaders put their collective wisdom into written form for the first time. Their text was to shape the strategic thinking of all East Asia. It offered a radically new perspective on conflict, whereby one might attain victory without going to battle. Though in the West their text is called The Art of War, in China it is still known as the Sun Tzu, named for the patriarch of their lineage.

''"Win Without War"'' is said to be a top strategy of S''''''unTsu

''"The best physician is the one that prevents disease, not the one that cures it."''

''"Spring from the void, avoid strong places, attack weak points."'' (''void'' = a place which does not exist (in the mind of the one attacked))

An ancient Chinese text not so much about fighting wars, but getting your way without having to fight wars. It is really about social manipulation, and tends to go against many parts of western idealism. However, one can argue that if you don't follow the principles, then you will be victimized by those who do. One can also say that social wars are the better alternative over physical ones. It may be the reason why some Asian cultures are sometimes characterized as "peaceful but manipulative". However, its approach can be found in marketing departments and boardrooms in the west also. It seems the west is simply ashamed to document such rules of conduct in a larger sense despite it being common practice, but in Asian culture it is often seen as mere survival.

It should perhaps be required reading by anyone entering the real world after college. But no college would put it on their list because it's content often does not fit western ideals.
