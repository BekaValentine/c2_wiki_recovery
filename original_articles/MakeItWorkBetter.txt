After you've been able to MakeItWork, when you need to, MakeItWorkBetter.

You and your customer/user/client will define "Better" in the context of the problem. Sometimes "Better" means faster, sometimes it means "So that another routine can use this", sometimes it means "so that this can solve a similar problem".

Your UnitTest will help you MakeItWorkBetter without breaking it.
