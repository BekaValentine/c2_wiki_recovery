There are several websites that host projects (a few of them host thousands of projects).

They allow people from around the world to collaborate on a project.

For each software project, they provide a CVS repository, a mailing list, and often a bug database, a screenshot portfolio, and a Wiki for the FAQ.


* SourceForge ( http://sf.net/ ) : the largest ProjectHost.
* GnuSavannah ( http://savannah.gnu.org/ )( http://savannah.nongnu.org/ )
* GForge ( GeeForge ) - http://gforge.org/
* BerliOs ( http://developer.berlios.de/ )
* KLDP.net http://kldp.net/
* Tigris.org http://www.tigris.org/  (actually powered by http://www.collab.net )
* the Giant Java Tree http://gjt.org/

These host "open source software projects". Are there any Project Hosts that host any other kind of project ?

ProjXpert  ( http://www.ProjXpert.com/ ) hosts commercial, open source and shared source projects. It takes what works from open source development an provides it as a service( for a fee ) for non open source projects.

* There are zillions of shareware sites (many of which have begun listing open source as well)
