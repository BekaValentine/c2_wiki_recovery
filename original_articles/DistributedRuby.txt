Distributed RubyLanguage module, written completely in Ruby. By MasatoshiSeki.

DRb is included with Ruby 1.8. See also: http://raa.ruby-lang.org/list.rhtml?name=druby

Any object can be published on a port on the computer, there's no need for compiling stubs etc.

Includes a TupleSpace''''''s implementation.

It also includes a Jini-like (service autodiscovery) system named Ring (see RubyRingServer).

It is amazingly simple to use, especially when compared to JavaLanguage's RemoteMethodInvocation. Below is the complete source code for a "HelloWorld"-server:

 require 'drb'
 
 class Example''''''Server
   def hello
     "hello world"
   end
 end
 
 DRb.start_service("druby://localhost:1234", Example''''''Server.new)
 DRb.thread.join

Here's the client:

 require 'drb'

 DRb.start_service
 srv = DRbObject.new(nil, "druby://localhost:1234")
 p srv.hello
