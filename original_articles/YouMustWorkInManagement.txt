A man is flying in a hot air balloon and realizes he is lost.  He
reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the 
balloon further and  shouts:  "Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?"
The man below says: "Yes, you're in a hot air balloon, hovering 30
feet above this field.

" You must work in Information Technology," says the balloonist. 
"'I do," replies the man. "How did you know?"

"Well" says the balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically
correct, but it's no use to anyone." 

The man on the ground says, "you must work in management." 
"I do" replies the balloonist, "but how did you know?"
"Well", says the man, "you don't know where you are, or where
you're going, but you expect me to be able to help. 
You're in the same position you were before we met, 
but now it's my fault."
