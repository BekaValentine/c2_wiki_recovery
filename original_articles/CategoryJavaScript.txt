Click on the page title to get a list of pages where the main topic is JavaScript, JScript, or EcmaScript.

Lumping these topics together into one category is perhaps debatable. Nevertheless, they ''are'' related, and lumping them together helps a person to compare and contrast them. Although "ECMA" is the most generic name, "JavaScript" is reasonably generic and maybe comes easier to mind. Hence, CategoryJavaScript was chosen as the name for this lumped category.
