Since most of the ExtremeProgramming Gurus and the Patterns Gurus have limited their recent contributions or have run out of new things to add to this wiki, and have moved on to GreenerPastures, the question typified by the following quote - raises a question - What is Wiki's FourthLife? Its first life was generated by a Alexander's book, its second life lead to the writing of books, its third life, a mid-life crisis about where and what it is, leading to a discovery of the TruePotentialOfWiki.

"Originally, wikiwiki was about patterns. Then it "degenerated" to XP and lost some writers, but gained others. In its third life now, it seems to be about navel gazing. Lost some more writers, probably gained some others. I am looking forward to its fourth life."
