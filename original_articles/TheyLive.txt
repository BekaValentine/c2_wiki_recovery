Terrible movie with a wonderful premise; we are all MindFsck''''''ed thralls serving intergalactic slavers that control us through hypnogogic advertising. Contains the longest and silliest fight scene in movie history.

Despite the bad acting and whatnot, it was a great movie. I don't know if it actually invented them, but it sure had some great lines: "I came here to chew bubble gum, and kick some ass... and I'm all out of bubble gum." Well, okay, maybe ''one'' great line.

Definitely a B movie (and notice how "Big Business" has replaced Communism as the bogey), but the makeup job on those aliens was terrific. It was the only movie that ''ever'' gave me nightmares. -DavidBrantley
