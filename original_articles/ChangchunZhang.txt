The OCP(Open-Closed Principle) principle used in the OOD. Firstly it is described in the Agile Software Dev by Uncle Robert.

It means that the OO System is Closed to "modification", but Open to "extension".

But how to understand below two words, because they have the very common meaning - '''''"Change"''''':
* Modification
**''To change how something is done.''

* Extension
**''To add new things that can be done.''
