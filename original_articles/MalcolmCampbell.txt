On Software Development:

*  I have always been interested in unconventional means of designing and coding software. The common sense ideas I came up with independently (in the 1980s) meshed with my later studies of iterative development - and conversely, clashed with the accepted ''norm'' of strict waterfall methodology in the shops where I have worked. More recently, I've become a SystemArchitect - and in that role have attempted to make headway on iterative/cyclical/agile development front with meager success... in fear of becoming part of the Borg.  Signatory of the AgileManifesto.

*  I attempt to AvoidComplexity on a daily basis.  (Life and projects are complicated enough as it is.)

* Most of my coding now is for my own amusement at home - so software development is something I am enjoying more now than I used to (hard to really enjoy something when someone is breathing down your back to get it done).  Thinking of starting an OpenSource FreeSoftware project, or joining someone else's.

On Information Management:

*  WikiLover .

Personal History:

*  Was a larval programmer in the early '80s - Basic and Fortran were the tools used in this exploration.  Actually used a printer/terminal back in the day (I believe it was attached to a VAX system).

*  Served in the military for a decade.  At one point I would deliver punch card decks to a facility to feed an ancient mainframe computer - those were the good old days.

*  Pursued a Computer Science degree - 30 hours remaining.  On the short list now to return and finish (okay - maybe the long list - as wife balefully glares in my direction).

*  15+ years experience in IT, both in software development (userland applications, metrics analysis/modeling, system management and logging, and systems integration) and in support (Unix/Linux system administrator, technical support for applications, and network engineer (responsible for capacity analysis, ordering new circuits, and design of transport)).

Skills:

* Shell scripting, to include sh (prefer bash)

* Python. (Python has completely replaced Perl, sed, awk, and  Java in my projects.)

* Basic, Fortran, C/C++, Lisp, Sun RISC Assembler, 80x86 Assembler, Perl, Java - haven't touched these in many years.

Learning:

* Zope 3.x 

* Python 3

* IPv6  

* VmWare and other virtual machine managers (VirtualBox and KernelBasedVirtualMachine [KVM] too).

Tool Bigotry:

Yes I love Python; my next large personal project will be in python (I'm always tempted to do PrematureOptimization - but resist the temptation).
