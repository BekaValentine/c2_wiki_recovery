I've been looking at Fit (FrameworkForIntegratedTest) lately, and one phrase in the instructions really struck me: Maintain As Usual.  I realized that I have tendency to consider some aspects of the project to be SecondClassCode.  "Why OnceAndOnlyOnce it, it's just /user interface code/temporary/test code."  So far, I've never been correct to treat code that way, my life would always have been simpler if I remembered to MaintainAsUsual.
