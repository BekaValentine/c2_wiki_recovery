If you enjoy his stories and discussion books, I advise you NOT to read his autobiography. -- VickiKerr.  ''please say a bit more about why not -- JamesCrook'' Replied by email. -- vk

You might also try "Till We Have Faces" (ISBN: 0156904365), which is a retelling of the Roman myth of Cupid and Psyche. I liked it, anyway. -- JonathanRosebaugh
