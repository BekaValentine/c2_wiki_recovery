''To forgive is divine.''

Can we really forgive ourselves if we do not forgive others?

'''WikiProblems'''

A page intended to start an "out-of-body" discussion of wiki behavior and events leading to drastic changes causing lots of inconveniences to a large body of wiki users (who observed but did not participate).

Hopefully, a better understanding will lead to a good community solution for TheWayForward.

Your thoughts and views are most welcomed, but please be mindful of the MoreLightThanHeatGuideline.
