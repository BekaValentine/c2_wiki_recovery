The name of the OS on some/many/all Burroughs mainframe computers was the Master Control Program.  Also known as the MCP.  I've read the BEALGOL source code for one of these and think that the TronMovie image kind of appropriate -- with a procedure Hoover in charge of security. -- DickBotting

"Hoover" would also be a neat name for a mark-and-sweep garbage collector. ''One must wonder whether "Hoover" is a reference to vacuum cleaners or J. Edgar; I tend to think its a reference to the latter in this case.''

Hoover ''tends to apply the Decorator pattern to itself in interesting ways.''
