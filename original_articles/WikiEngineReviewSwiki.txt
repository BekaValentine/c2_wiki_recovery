Note: The Swiki farm is apparently using neither Swiki 2.8 nor Com''''''Swiki 11, but a fork they created earlier in the development process and which they have retrofitted with selected improvements from Swiki, Com''''''Swiki, or other sources. Thus, the Swiki farm is probably not an accurate example of the capabilities of either Swiki 2.8 or Com''''''Swiki 11.

The review of the Com''''''Swiki in use at the farm may have errors based on my earlier confusion -- I may have included features that I found documented for Swiki 2.8.
