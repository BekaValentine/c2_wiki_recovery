Other OperatingSystems prominent in the history of Unix:

* MulticsOs, more or less Unix's predecessor
* The CompatibleTimeSharingSystem, Multics' predecessor; arguably the first timesharing OperatingSystem
* GECOS was used to help bootstrap the first Unix system
* PlanNineFromBellLabs, designed by the InventorsOfUnix to be Unix's successor, correcting its flaws, adding things their Unix lacked, and refactoring all of it.  OpenSource since 2000 at http://plan9.bell-labs.com/
* InfernoOs, descended of Plan 9.

''-- Discussion moved from InventorsOfUnix:''

Unix was originally a "lite" version Multics. Techies loved Multics, but it was too expensive and too slow at the time, generally ahead of its time. Many of the concepts of Unix come from Multics as Multics fans tried to recreate what they loved about Multics on cheaper hardware and with a smaller profile.
