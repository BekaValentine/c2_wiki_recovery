I am a senior research scientist in the Software Engineering department of Simula Research Laboratory.

My research is focussed at ProgramAnalysis, ReverseEngineering, ProgramUnderstanding, and DocumentationGeneration. My homepage (http://www.leonmoonen.com/) contains more information and list of publications. Some of them are related to Agile or XP, but most to ReverseEngineering and ProgramAnalysis.

I'm one of the founders of the SoftwareImprovementGroup, an Amsterdam based company that develops ReverseEngineering and ProgramUnderstanding applications and uses XP for its development.

The RefactoringTestCode page was created for (continued) discussion of our work on refactoring of test code which was presented at XpTwoThousandAndOne.
