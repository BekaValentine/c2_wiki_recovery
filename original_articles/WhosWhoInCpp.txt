A group of folks on The C++ Source advisory board would like to put together a "Who's Who in C++" document. BillVenners suggested doing this via a wiki page, and then when it achieves a certain done-ness, turn it into an article for The C++ Source. I think that's a great idea and suggested this page as a start. -- WardCunningham

ScottMeyers' recent Artima article ''"The Most Important C++ People... Ever"'' [http://www.artima.com/cppsource/top_cpp_people.html] might be a good starting point. His five were:

* BjarneStroustrup
* AndrewKoenig
* ScottMeyers - author of EffectiveCeePlusPlus etc.
** http://www.aristeia.com/
* HerbSutter
** http://www.gotw.ca/
* AndreiAlexandrescu - author of ModernCeePlusPlusDesign
** http://www.erdani.org/ 

Some additional individuals:
* AlexanderStepanov
** MattAustern worked closely with Stepanov at SGI, and the STL owes a very large debt to him as well. See also Matthew H. Austern, "Generic Programming and the STL: Using and Extending the C++ Standard Template Library". Addison-Wesley, 1999, hardcover, 608 p., ISBN 0-201-30956-4 
* BarbaraMoo 
* MengLee
** She co-authored and co-developed with Stepanov the 1995 Hewlett-Packard technical report titled "The StandardTemplateLibrary"
* DavidMusser

''The STL is so incredibly essential to (and fused with) modern C++ that I would insist that Stepanov should be one of the top 3, ahead even of Meyers and Alexandrescu. -- DougMerritt''  

Members of the team that created the C++StandardTemplateLibrary and the definitive book by the same name: Alexander A. Stepanov, Meng Lee, and David R. Musser.

Should RobertMurray be on the list?
Also:
* C++ metaobjects and integration with SOM
** IraForman 
* Co-Authors on C++/Com Integration
** DonBox
** RichardGrimes
* Explained streams and locales
** AngelikaLanger 
* STLSoft and Author 
** MatthewWilson
* C++ numerics, financial analysis
