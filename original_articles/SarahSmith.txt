I'm a programmer(Java, C++, Database, XML).  I'm currently working on a Swing interface for a sophisticated petroleum mathematical model. 

During the spring semester 2002 I was the teaching assistant for Object-Oriented Programming and Design at CU.  I took this course in Fall 2001 and got very interested in design patterns. Dave Leberknight and Ron LeMaster are no longer teaching this class at CU; however, course notes are available at http://www.softwarefederation.com/cs4448/spring2002.html

Some of my applets and my resume are published on my personal web page (http://home.earthlink.net/~smith788home/sarah/).  Prior to staying home with my kids for 10 years, I was a Fortran programmer working on a petroleum exploration graphical workstation product.

I can be reached at sccsmith@earthlink.net.
