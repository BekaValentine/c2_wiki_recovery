		 :	WikiSpace is big. It's ReallyBig. You may think it's a long walk down to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to WikiSpace. It's so vastly mind-bogglingly big, you wouldn't believe it.

	0 Imports
		 :	None, there's nowhere to import it from.

	0 Exports
		 :	See Imports

	0 Money
		 :	None. The WikiDollarTag recently collapsed, the UglyCash is only exchangeable for the UglyCash, and the GigaPage is so big, no-one has collected enough of them to buy any of them.

	0 People
		 :	None. Since there are a finite number of pages that can support life, the average population density is 0, ''ergo'' anyone you see is a figment of your deranged imagination.
