This is the best site on the web for igo/baduk/weiqi players who already know the rules of the game.

Go to http://gtl.jeudego.org/ to check it out and have your games commented by stronger players. A games archive is also located on the site.

And the best way for seasoned players to contribute to the overall advancement of the community as well. Remember some people play go on the net from a community where there are no local clubs, and maybe your next generation is better to be addicted to GameOfGo than MTV or dark side of the Net, or computer games.
