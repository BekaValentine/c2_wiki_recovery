I'm a software CraftWorker, a LazyProgrammer and a TeamLeader working for a 
small software company called calendra (been there for three years now).

I work in the south of france, my california.
  
I started 8 years ago with a service company that decided to develop a software product: 
I learnt a lot because about everything in that project failed. 
I also got a solid SmalltalkLanguage, CeePlusPlus and Corba (CategoryCorba) experience.

From then on I took the Java (CategoryJava) wave and crafted for France Telecom and Gemplus.
 
	* ExtremeProgramming and the AgileManifesto is a breath of air. 
	* ObjectRelationalMapping is of great interest to me because of passed and current projects
	* EnterpriseApplicationIntegration and WorkFlow are current focuses
	* LogicProgramming grabs me: I studied the PrologLanguage and being a LazyProgrammer telling my computer what to do rather than how to do it is compelling.
