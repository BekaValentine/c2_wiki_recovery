XPlanner is a web-based project planning and tracking tool for eXtreme Programming (XP) teams.
See details at http://www.xplanner.org or http://www.sf.net/projects/xplanner.

We don't develop any. Can we use this tool?
?

''Don't know what you're asking, but I'll tell you our problem with XPlanner: the client company doesn't give developers admin rights on our NT and XP workstations. XPlanner doesn't require them, but it does require a DBMS. We can't even install MySql because it has to run as a service.''

Then try hsqldb. It is a full blown, open source database and it is written in Java. Porting xplanner to hsqldb should be easy, if it does not already handle hsqldb.

It handles HSQL fine. Also, MySQL doesn't have to be started as a service on NT. You can start it manually
from the command line. See the MySQL online documentation for more details. Also note that as Xplanner uses Hibernate to manage its persistence, you can use any database that is supported by Hibernate.

One thing you must do prior to installing Xplanner is to create your database and also your xplanner admin user - this is because Xplanner's installation does not do this for you.

This is definitely not an "out of the box" tool. If you want to use an Oracle database, good luck. The messageboards are not very active either.

''Oracle is not a supported database for XPlanner, so you are right, you're on your own if you try to use that database. Or even better, you could volunteer to support that database on behalf of the XPlanner team.''
