''Pinky and the Brain'' is a TV cartoon that is/was somewhat popular in the US.  It is about a pair of laboratory mice produced via genetic research. Pinky is mildly insane, and Brain is a genius who constantly hatches nefarious schemes to take over the world.  In each episode they almost succeed, then their plans are foiled at the last minute.

Each episode starts with the following dialog:

''Pinky: Gee, Brain, what are we going to do tonight?''

''Brain: The same thing we do EVERY night: try to take over the world!!!''

The Brain was played by Maurice LaMarche, and Pinky by Rob Paulsen, both veteran voice actors.

One of the most memorable of the show's running gags was a parody of DramaticExposition, where the Brain thinks of a wonderful twist to his latest scheme, and prods Pinky to help him reason it out. Pinky replies with a delirious non-sequitur, typically packed with innuendo:

''Brain'': Are you pondering what I'm pondering, Pinky?

''Pinky'': I think so, Brain. But { would anyone but Eskimos like blubber-flavored chewing gum? | how will we get the chimpanzee ''into'' the tutu? | aren't pickles that small called "gherkins"? | I'm not sure if I'm ready to balance a career ''and'' a family. | but if they called them "sad meals" nobody would buy them! | where are we going to find 500 pounds of broccoli at this time of night? | me and Pippi Longstocking? What would the ''children'' look like?? | burlap chafes me so! }

Brain has a baritone voice that can be tuned for menacing, disdain, mystery, hollow irony, and so on.

One of the better "hollow irony" quotes is spoken from the bottom of a large pit (actually a large footprint), wherein Brain, having been stomped and fire-toasted by a dragon, responds to Pinky's "Brain, you don't look so good" with the classic: (echos hollowly) "Something very unpleasant has happened to me."

''The character is an Orson Welles pastiche (or homage).'' (LaMarche also having voiced the character of Orson Welles in ''The Critic'', another cartoon.)
