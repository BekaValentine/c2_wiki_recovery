F: Anybody here knows what a LikeButton is?

J: Yes, you find it in most of the SocialNetwork''''''s

F: You know what effect it produces?

J: Yes, if a person in Facebook e.g. gets Likes, then this improves his/her EdgeRank, that is something similar to a PageRank...

F: Now I suggest a LikePlusButton, that works like the LikeButton but in combination with MicroPayment.

J: I think this could be done as an app for all appropriate SocialNetwork''''''s that offer some API.

F: You see the additional benefits for this game-like improvement?

J: Yes, a LikePlus really produces a sort of income for those people who give the most pleasure or usefulness to their peers.

F: We need MicroPayment providers with a zero provision for the Microtransactions, delivering an IframePayButton, that can be used on Websites, Blogs, and as an app in SocialNetwork''''''s.

J: I hope that there are enough providers, who allow a  provision of zero percent apart from transmitting the accumulated money back to one's own bank account.

F: Really, how about the initial load?

J: The initial load with some cents, can be done via lossless micropay for the receiver.

F: And the transfer from the Micropayment Account to the convential Home Bank Account of the owner?

J: .. can be done via e.g. PayPal with their usual fees.

F: Can you tell me the social provider of Micropay transactions who offers zero cost transfers as an option.

J: Yes, it's http://YourCent.com

F: Is there a Facebookpage for YourCent?

J: Yes you can find it via internal FB search.

F: I suggest two things.

(1) If someone in the target wikis or forums (to which this Pad is copied) doesn't want to have their contribution under CcBySa, please mark it explicitly so that we don't copy it back, but only

quote it under fair use.

(2) Write an app for Facebook and make possibly 750 Million people happy to earn possibly a lot of pennies even with oneliners.

J: Let me quote the WelcomeMessage of the WikiLike PiratePad.

" Welcome to PiratePad!

This pad text is synchronized as you type, so that everyone viewing this page sees the same text. This allows you to collaborate seamlessly on documents with no EditConflict s! "

The author also posted this post on the twinpage http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/LikePlusButton, where some more CamelCase links might be resolved.

''Somebody deleted my page, why that? I think it is such a useful contribution to the community, that it doesn't deserve it. -- FridemarPache'' 

{I recall the deleter (not me) described it as "spammy".  It looks somewhat like a thinly-disguised promotion of what appear to be commercial ventures: http://YourCent.com, PiratePad, etc.  Certainly the tone is more promotional than scientifically critical, and that tends to raise a bit of suspicion these days.} 

''Dear anon, thank you for your feedback. I reformulated my contribution, that it becomes obvious, that it is no promotion with a commercial interest. Indeed I am not affiliated in any way with the quoted entities. PiratePad is AFIK the highest developed EtherPad, because it allows Wiki links. YourCent is to my knowledge the only MicroPayment provider who allows the user to determine their support by zero to hundred percent. So I claim it as a useful contribution to the community, especially the programmer community of OpenSource. -- FridemarPache''
''PS.: By the way: I see that in c2 nobody has mentionned the EtherPad technology yet, that allows JointEditing in modeless Wysiwyg with a couple of persons, eliminating EditConflict s, marking individual contributions in different colors. However, if their CcBySa document relocates in the Web as black and white, this information gets lost. To keep it, we develop a new conversational style, where the tweetlike microcontributions are preserved via Shortcut Signatures.''

This looks very interesting to me and I had not heard of it before. I have started to explore PiratePad and also expand these pages. -- JohnFletcher
