A GoodIdea is something someone thinks would add to the Quality Of Life, particularly that of the one having the Idea. It usually is something outside of the possibility of the thinker initiating due to lack of resources, or position of power to institute.

As barriers exist due to inability to finance or to gather all the resources together to carry out the GoodIdea, the next best thing is to place the idea in the PublicDomain, where it can be exposed for those who will be able to do something about it.

Some Examples:
* FreeGasoline
* GroundBreakingLanguagesDiscussion
* HomeFactory
* HomeOffice
* HomeStore
* HybridDrive
* PersonalFlopiWiki
* SnapItInsteadOfScanIt

This is a great way to get an idea into motion and have the ability for others to contribute their ideas.
