A combination of AdHominem and AdVerecundiam which basically alleges that the opposition must be stupid, racist, cruel, immature, or something like that in order to believe whatever it is arguing.

(e.g., "What, you oppose a ban on pornography? Well, we know what ''you're'' looking at, you CensoredExpletives...")

It is also a form of ArgumentFromIntimidation to simply shout the same point so loudly and so often that it drowns out the opposing point of view. Sadly, a lot of people argue in this manner.
