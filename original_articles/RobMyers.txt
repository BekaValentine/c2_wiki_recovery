I'm an agile/ExtremeProgramming/scrum coach and instructor. I've had the great fortune to work with talented consultants such as FredGeorge, JimShore (previously known as JimLittle), JoshuaKerievsky, SomikRaha, JeffMcKenna, the team at MenloInstitute, and other trainers at NetObjectives.  Successful ExtremeProgramming-related projects with wikified stories include the NrcXpWorkshop, DenaliProject, and OtisTwo (oh, there's nothing here on OtisTwo?  Drat!).

If you're looking for anything from the old Mindful Software (http://www.mindfulsoftware.com/) site, I still have all that.

I hold a WardNumber of 1.
