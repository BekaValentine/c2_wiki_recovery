Thoughts that do not help upgrade a given situation should be eliminated from mind. E.g. anger, if is not productive (does not help the situation to be better) should be eliminated. Whenever you have a thought lingering in your mind, ask yourself whether it is useful in making the situation better. If not, move to those thoughts with which you can make it better.
