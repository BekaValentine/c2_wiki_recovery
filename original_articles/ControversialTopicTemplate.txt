Coffee is allegedly great for the following reasons:

* Helps you wake up faster
** Con: Does not work for everyone

* Makes you more productive
** Con: Can make you jittery and unpleasant, canceling out any speed-based productivity.

* Tastes Wonderful
** Con: Some find it bitter

'''Helps you wake up faster'''

This is bogus. There's never been a double-blind study of this.

''Yes there is. The University of Knowledge did a study in 1998. Read about it here http://www.uofk.foo''

But they only studied females. I'm a male.

''I can change that with a well-placed kick.''

Too much coffee made you unpleasant. See below.

'''Productivity Con: Can make you jittery and unpleasant'''

People like this are that way anyhow. They shouldn't blame it on coffee.

''I am not unpleasant, you pig-faced liar!''

I rest my case.

''That's because I drank coffee, stupid. I am not normally this way.''

Well, come back when you stop drinking it.
