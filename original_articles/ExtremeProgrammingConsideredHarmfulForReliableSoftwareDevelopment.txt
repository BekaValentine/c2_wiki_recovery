"Extreme Programming Considered Harmful for Reliable Software Development" -- a paper from 2002 by GeroldKeefer

	 :	''"Summary: This paper presents and discusses various data collected on Extreme Programming and how this method relates to traditional Software Engineering practices. The paper presents reasons, albeit no scientific proofs, why Extreme Programming may be harmful to a reliable software development project. The paper also discusses why Extreme Programming fails to provide answers to significant questions that contemporary software development methods have to answer. The Extreme Programming hype, and its variant in the "Agile Methods" packaging, currently dominates the software development scene and should be investigated and evaluated before assuming it is the best method for a particular project. This paper is an attempt to contribute to the discussion."''
