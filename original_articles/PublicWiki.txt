A wiki that is used by more than one individual, as contrasted to a PersonalWiki. The content is 'public' to its users. 

There are numerous PublicWikiForums as well as NonPublicWikiForums which have a closed user community but still fall under this category (as obviously does WardsWiki you are on right now).
