By CvsBasedWiki I mean, not a wiki that uses CVS to store versions of its pages,  but a wiki extension made to something like CvsWeb.

Essentially, a CVS repository is a filesystem. So I want an appropriate FilesystemBasedWiki.

Basically, if you already have a Web interface to the CVS repository, you would just ensure that the FilesystemBasedWiki scripting works in the files supplied from the CvsWeb interface.

A CvsBasedWiki would have extensions to allow links to particular versions of pages, etc., to be specified. As well as extra scripts to allow checkin and checkout.

A CvsBasedWiki would be part of a WikiForLiterateProgramming.
