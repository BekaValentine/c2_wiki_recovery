I've lost a page that I want to find (or create, if it was just a dangling link). Someone referred to AmNotation or something like that. I took it to mean documenting objects in the form of "I am a PHP lexical scanner. Call GET-TOKEN on me until I return NIL." The person also referred to CRC cards. Anyone?

''There are no pages containing Iam and CRC. Could the page have been UncleBobsNamingConventions?''

No, but that page is interesting :).   I am starting to think it was just a fig tree of my imagination...


''Not that often looking into c2, but I noticed your comment on Conciousness:
From m-w.com (Merriam-Webster):
consciousness, n. 1 a : the quality or state of being aware especially of something within oneself
I point this out because most of these other definitions appear to be definitions not of consciousness, but of recall or cognition or the ability to be self-referential. I've seen many really smart philosophers fall into this trap as well, and I can't imagine why, except that "I think, therefore I am" is the (incredibly appealing) root of most Western philosophy. But it doesn't pass my experience in meditating: I do not need to think to be aware, I can simply be aware without activity.
But it begs the curious question: why do so many people seem to think consciousness and reason are entangled?''

''Now, if consciousness requires reasoning, why not apply reason to a conscious being? And, furthermore, if reasoning requires consciousness, why not apply consciousness to all animate beings as well?'' --CarstenKlein
