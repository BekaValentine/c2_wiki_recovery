Computer user since the age of 4(PC-DOS r0x0r!!) and programmer since 10, currently I am a math and engineering major trying to transfer to a real school.  Since I am such a slacker, I have never finished any programs useful to anyone but me.  My primary interest is in gaming and ArtificialIntelligence.  I have written in several languages but I prefer C++ and Python to all of them.  I am trying to completely wean myself off of Windows for everyday computing because Linux is a heck of a lot more useful to me.  There are way too many computers in my room at the moment because I am something of a pack rat.  In short, I have 7 computers for my personal use which I actually use regularly.  If not for how much heat they create, I think I would use them more frequently.

I can read and write in three human languages currently (IMO rather poorly): English (no... really), German, and Latin.

I also tend to be very verbose in making a point -- and I argue about semantics -- so please be patient.

You desperately need to transfer to a real school since the current one hasn't taught you anything about algebra.
