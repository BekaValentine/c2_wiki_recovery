Me

One year later, I'm not sure if I'm still Me.

Another year later. I'm still not sure.

And yet another year later, I'm sure im Me but not the other Me's.

Another year later. This is funny. I'm quite sure I'm me. Met Ward today.

Now it is 2014. For sure this no longer the 1999 me. Now at eBay. Would have never thought.
