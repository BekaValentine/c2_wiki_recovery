Some programmers avoid "new" as a constructor name.

What are some examples of how this can improve code?

	* iterator := Iterator traversing: anArray.
	 :	This one's not bad, though some would still consider naming it "newTraversing" to make it a bit more consistent.

	* ...

What are some examples of how this can worsen code?
	* user := User instantiate: 214.
	 :	Why throw away the existing habits of object-oriented programmers if you don't get any clear benefit?  I've heard it argued that you're not creating a "new" user, only "instantiating" one.  However, in this case, the one-line description of the "User" class would be something like, "Represents a user of the system".  So, you actually are creating a "new" representation of a user of the system.
