''Omar, AreYouThere? almost OrphanPage, 2004-07-23, last edit 2001-02-24''

I just discovered Wiki today (2000, May 15th) and I like it !

I think I'll start using it as a personal thinking space, to organise ideas through hyperlinks, and discuss them with the rest of the world.

This reminds me of Manila (Useland Software). It's the Edit This Page thing.
