AxKit is an XML (ExtensibleMarkupLanguage) publishing system based around the Apache web server, ModPerl, and lots of CeeLanguage code to glue it all together.

It basically transforms XML on the server to different output formats (such as HTML, PDF, etc), using the following techniques:

* XSLT - XsltLanguage
* XSP - eXtensible Server Pages
* XPathScript - a PerlLanguage-based stylesheet language for XML
* FO - XslFormattingObjects
