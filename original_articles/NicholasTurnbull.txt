Well, this is (I suppose) my WikiHomePage on WikiWikiWeb. Will expand as more time permits. I'm a ComputerScience student, SoftwareDeveloper, and ProjectManager, and I look forward to contributing shortly. I've been editing on WikiPedia since Nov 2004 until recently, although I've now left Wikipedia due to their ongoing social problems; I might return when the dust has settled a bit, and GoodKarma has started to appear.

I can be reached at nicholas (dot) turnbull (at) gmail (dot) com, if anyone so desires.

Thanks for dropping by!
