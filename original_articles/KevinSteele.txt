Hi Kevin! Nice to meet you. I'm new here, too! -- SteveRusso

	 :	Nice to meet you too Steve.

Which WikiEngine would you say is the best?

	 :	Thanks for the advice.  It didn't take long to see the problems with Wiki, as described in UnresolvableProblemsOfWiki in practice.

I would like to get a really good idea of how Wiki works and I would like to install a good Wiki locally to experiment with.
