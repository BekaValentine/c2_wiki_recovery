The first edition came out in 1987. It makes copious mention of Alexander.

The second edition has eight new chapters and includes some discussion that I found very helpful of how adoption of WattsHumphrey's CMM-based 'process improvement' has in practice led to a low risk development process that delivers '''low value''' within many organizations. Quite unlike XP's aggressiveness/courage value or the development '''scoop''' described in SuccessStatement. -- RichardDrake
