Jeremy Nicholson is Technical Architect of UK-based PionLabs. He has worked with a number of blue-chip clients such as Unilever and Microsoft.

On a general level, he can be quite a pain as he is interested in just about anything and has to find out how everything works. He will do this tenaciously until you are either totally overwhelmed or just lost. A good skill to have for an OO designer.
