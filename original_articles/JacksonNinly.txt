I'm ''trying'' to decide whether to use PhpWiki or MediaWiki for a project I'm developing, intending to share and develop craft (knitting, crochet, etc) patterns and techniques. Not an entirely new idea, but implementing it with the ethical approach I have in mind seems unprecedented.

I'm used to that '''other''' engine, which for a few reasons seems to be the better choice in this case, despite my attraction to this one.

Knitters are notoriously opinionated. I'm sure you are, too. Do let me know what you think. --JacksonNinly
