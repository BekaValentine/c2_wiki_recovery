ConceptProgramming is a way to make development tools extensible so that you can use your concepts in the application, rather than the concepts offered by the designers of the development tools. 

Today, developers need to express the concepts of their application using only the available building blocks in the development tools (procedures, objects, widgets, templates.) 

DevelopmentTools can be extended using plug-ins with application-specific concepts (mathematical notations, optimizations, semantics rules, etc)

Sounds like tools that would enable you to implement and use a DomainSpecificLanguage in your program.
