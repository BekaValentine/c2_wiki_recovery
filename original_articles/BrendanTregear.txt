Newbie to the whole Xp and Wiki thing. Swimming around in this pool of ideas for the moment.

I am a junior programmer and the only programmer in this company. I have absolutely no mentors or other experienced developers to talk to -- that's why WikiWiki has become my substitute for work colleagues. Still its hard because all these holistic approaches have restricted application to ShrinkWrappedSoftware in Windows which is 90% GUI. Well that's my little story over with.
