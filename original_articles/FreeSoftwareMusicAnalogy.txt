I know a gentleman who has been a musician and band leader for years. In his 
day, he used to pack the house with fans of great big band jazz.

Over the years, ''the economics of big band music has changed''. My friend
still does occasional big band shows these days, but when the door has been
collected, and the musicians and roadies have been paid, he is lucky to
break even.

Why does he still do it? Because he ''loves'' playing those old GlennMiller and
DukeEllington and BillyStrayhorn tunes.

When the circus comes to town, they call my friend to provide the orchestra.
He puts together a few people and does the gig. Does he do it at cost?

Of course not. It wasn't ''his'' idea to have a circus.              

He ''charges'' for that. The circus will either pay the going rate for a 
top-notch orchestra or they ''won't have'' a top-notch orchestra.
