"Jugend forscht" ("youth researches") is a common (anti-?) pattern 
of GermanLanguage speaking managers. It is named after a popular competition for 
german students about innovations and inventions.

Saying "This is JugendForscht" is often used as a negative form of RespondingToChange.
It means: The suggestion is immature, it does not DoSimpleThings.

Using JugendForscht during a BrainStorming session is an AntiPattern.
