Data to Information refactoring is a set of ReFactoring techniques for converting DataOriented code to InformationOriented code. See InformationVsData and DataAndInformation.

Moved from ReFactoring:

'''Simple DataOriented? -> InformationOriented? refactoring''':
* move a class member into become a keyed TupleItem a TupleStructure within the class (or do the reverse).

'''DataOriented? -> InformationOriented? refactoring sequences''':

 1 change a table of columns into a class of members (or do the reverse).
 2 change a class of members into a dictionary/hash of objects (or do the reverse).
 3 change a dictionary/hash of objects into a group of dictionary/hashes (or do the reverse).
 4 change a group of dictionary/hashes of the former columns into a dictionary/hash of objects each of which describes a table column (or do the reverse).
 5 dictionary/hash of objects each of which describes a table column into an alternatively managed set of loosely coupled fields. (or do the reverse).


 1 change a Boolean into an EnumeratedType? (or do the reverse).
 2 change an enumerated type to a BitWiseEnumeratedType? (or do the reverse).
 3 change a bit-wise enumerated type to an EndemeSet (or do the reverse).
 4 change an EndemeSet into a FormatRestrictedString? allowing multiple instances of the same character (or do the reverse).
 5 change a format restricted string into FreeText? (or do the reverse).
