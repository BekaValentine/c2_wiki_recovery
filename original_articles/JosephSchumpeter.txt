Arrgh, this shouldn't have been deleted, but instead the "EditCopy from previous Author" feature should have been used to restore the original content. AFAIK, there has once been something useful here. Why can't I get older versions of this page? Is this somehow possible?

Yes, if the EditCopy isn't sufficient, you can retrieve the old copy from HistoryPages
