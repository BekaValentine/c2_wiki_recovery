[ISBN: 0312141041]

Anyway, I picked this book up off the sale rack at Barnes and Noble (the second of two times I've been there.  I really prefer Borders).  The title was interesting, and the price was right ($2.99) so I bought it.

I read it, and I wasn't gripped by it.  I didn't gain any deep insight.  I've heard of the book from time to time and how great it was, but I didn't get anything from it.  What am I missing here?  What's so great?
