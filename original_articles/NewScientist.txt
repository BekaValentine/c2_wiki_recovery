''There are backlinks.  It's probably useful for identification if nothing else.''

Or we could place a link to it home page http://www.newscientist.com/. Feel free to delete if you think this is advertising, but it may just be useful information should NewScientist come up on this wiki.

I think it is worthwhile to have a link here. I will attempt to add some content this week while attending the BritishScienceFestival which is happening this week in Birmingham (England). Science journalists gather at it. -- JohnFletcher
