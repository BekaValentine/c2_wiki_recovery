When there are concurrent requests for a resource, it is necessary to synchronize access.

'''Therefore:'''

Implement a ''scheduler'' that selects which request will be allowed to execute next.

Scheduling policies may be first-come/first-served, priority-based, or otherwise.

Using the StrategyPattern, one can customize the behavior of the scheduler for particular configurations or applications.

Consider the CommandPattern for representation of queued requests.
