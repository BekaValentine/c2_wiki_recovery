I was christened Francis Ryder but I am generally known as Phran. I have been practicing IyengarYoga for over 5 years and I am thus very Agile.

I have long practiced (since at least 1990) a form of PairProgramming I currently call BuddyIng

In the Early Ninetees I started a discussion (BCS OOPS North West) group in the North West of England. The group was fun and informative. The group has reformed under the leadership of KevinRutherford and under the name of AgileNorth.

You my like to read my story of the VelvetUnderground.
