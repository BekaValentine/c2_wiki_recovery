WiKit is an implementation of a WikiWikiWeb based on the ToolCommandLanguage and MetaKit (a database library by yours truly). Its home page can be found here:

WiKit is very easy to install.  It is a single-file cross-platform script package called a S''''''tarKit (see http://www.equi4.com/starkit/index.html).  You also need a single-file binary T''''''clKit (see http://www.equi4.com/tclkit/index.html) which is available for more than two dozen hardware and operating system combinations.  WiKit contains its own database, interactive (local mode) GUI, and page rendering, so all you really need is CGI.

There's an active Wiki site based on it for the Tcl/Tk scripting language, at:

With thanks to WardCunningham for stopping by and setting up a page:
