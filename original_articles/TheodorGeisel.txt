Theodor Seuss Geisel, a.k.a. DoctorSeuss, is best known for his children's books, of which he wrote more than 40.  Many (his best-known) he also illustrated himself; his artwork has a rather unique and humorous style.  Some of his best known are:

	* GreenEggsAndHam
	* TheCatInTheHat
	* FoxInSocks
	* OneFishTwoFishRedFishBlueFish
	* HopOnPop
	* HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas

He won the PulitzerPrize in 1984 and three Academy Awards, and died in 1991. Sadly missed. Notwithstanding considerable confusion over the spelling of his ''nom de plume,'' it is '''"Seuss"''' -- Not spelled Suess, but search ought to get you here to see the correction anyway.

There's also a wonderful parody of his style, easiest found with

And let's not overlook the Dr. Seuss Bible:

In addition to DoctorSeuss, Geisel also used the pen name "Theo. LeSieg" (Giesel spelled backwards) when he was the author but not the illustrator of a book.
