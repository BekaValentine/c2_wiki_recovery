	1. A processor driving a display is very busy.
	2. Add some extra hardware to the display to make the job easier.
	3. Give that hardware DirectMemoryAccess so that it can run by itself.
	4. Fetch data in the form of instructions (sometimes called a DisplayList) so that the display program can loop and branch.
	5. You've now got a display processor.  Return to step 1.
