EnhanceAndComplement is an IdeaSpace concept which views Ideas as complementary and integrated into Human thought. Intelligence can be measured in many ways, but the UsefulnessOfHumanIntelligence can be measured in the ability to recognize, store, recover and apply ideas in RealSituations.

TrainingOfMemory is usually thought of as a personal task, not as an Discipline or methodology. One does not usually think about how an idea is stored and recovered in the process of Human thought. One way such may be developed is the use of the ThoughtPerformanceMachine. It can serve as a MemoryAssistant. If an idea can be thought of as residing in an IdeaSpace, the electromechanical memory of the PersonalComputer can be utilized as one of the IdeaSpaces made available to EnhanceAndComplement Human thought. This is what service a notepad, sketch, photo, scan indexing and storage program, or other such Interfaces make available in the recording of ideas and events. An IdeaSpace can be useful in serving as an AnchorPoint.
