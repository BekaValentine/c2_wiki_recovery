Open question to Bil:

Do you grok CoupledMapLattices? I once drove myself nuts trying to convert their PDFs into a working implementation. Everyone knows that researchers start with source code, then convert it to math formulas in PDF, and repress the source code, to "prove we are real mathematicians who don't dirty our hands with non-rigorous source code". Then I can't figure out the original source code. All I wanted to do was cumulus cloud simulations. Any tips? -- PhlIp
