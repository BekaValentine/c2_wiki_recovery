OO Designer/Developer/"Senior Geek"

My interests include Agile Development, .NET and digital photography.

My web site, http://www.agilekiwi.com , is devoted to agile software development.  It includes a concise, non-geeky presentation of the case for agility: http://www.agilekiwi.com/guide_to_agility.htm

I am particularly interested in the value of good negotation techniques in software development, as described here: http://www.agilekiwi.com/negotiation.htm

I also blog about .net development here: http://dotnet.agilekiwi.com
