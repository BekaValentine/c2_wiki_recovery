A PeaceMaker is a placeholder in an organization who tries
to calm and hold things together until a leader can be found
or a reorganization is complete. The PeaceMaker should be
someone who is well-liked but who is not necessarily
technically proficient. Usually, this individual has many
years with the company, knows the political ropes, and can
buy time for a team as well as the team's management.

Usually, the PeaceMaker follows closely on the heels of the
ScapeGoat and precedes the guru who either evolves
into the CultOfPersonality or GuruDoesAll. Based on availability,
it may be necessary to use a DoorMat instead. The tenure of
a PeaceMaker is rarely more than six months.

It may be interesting -- although a bit distracting -- to note that the 1870's vintage Colt single action revolver was known as The Peacemaker, and that style of revolver is still referred to by that name today. The other reference to Peacemaker is applied to strategic nuclear missiles.

This is all just as an aside, mind you.

''Might instead of intellect...''
* Yes.  Certainly don't want any ''might'' in the hands of those from whom we mean to steal.  Rule of law.  Yup, that's the ticket.  If I can use my intellect to invent laws that can be construed and applied to my advantage, that's all we need.  That, and making sure those whose property or liberty I mean to take can't resist.  "You don't need to be armed."  ''I don't need to be armed.''  "We will take care of you."  ''You will take care of me.''  "You can trust us; we are your friends."  ''I can trust you; you are my friends.''  "Now, hand over your weapons so we can have peace."  ''Yes, here are my weapons, so we can have peace.''
** I '''STRONGLY''' support and practice the second amendment (USA) "The Right to Keep and Bear Arms". :-)
