Hi,

I'm a novice developer--been working with a Boulder based internet consulting firm for the past 3 years.  Primarily used perl and java, with a smattering of other technologies ("you want XXX?  Sure, we do XXX.").  Mostly self taught--no CS degree.  

Patterns interest me since I have so little actual design experience, and I'd like to do more of that.
