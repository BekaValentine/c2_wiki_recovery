Wouter van Oortmerssen is a living legend in the Amiga community. Mostly known about his ability to design and code a whole bunch of programming languages throughout the years, interpreted or compiled (counted 38 so far).
* Almost none released publicly, I seem to recall.

Overview of his languages: http://wouter.fov120.com/proglang/index.html
	 :	MPL, Dex, E, Aargh, PLX, Yax, NGRC, FalseLanguage, Blerk, OOHNO!, X780040, Bla, COW, GRRR, GRR, G, Apfel''''''Strudel, Ni!, Kartoffel, Uh''''''Oh, GRMPF, BRAAK, UH, UHH, Schnitzel, Saurkraut, Schnit''''''Saurkr, SaurkrautII, Borenkool, Aardappel96, Aardappel99, BRAAF, Da''''''Maul, WadC, Cry''''''Script (DOG), goat, PIG, NVSRRML, MOLE, Wortel, Sheep and SHEEP 

SHEEP language (code name for the AmigaSdk scripting language, kinda cool because it has some FunctionalProgrammingLanguage features such as PatternMatching and TypeInference)

Aardappel (a GraphicalProgrammingLanguage and FunctionalProgrammingLanguage)

Bla (a FunctionalProgrammingLanguage where, unlike Scheme, the lambda environment is a first-class entity)

E [AmigaEe] (a popular language for the AmigaComputer, unrelated to the widely known EeLanguage that is a successor to JouleLanguage)

FalseLanguage (Forth-like language, implemented in less than 1k of 68k assembly.  Supposedly the inspiration for BrainfuckLanguage and its ilk.)

Also notable are his game design projects, which include various maps and mods for FPS games, a simple doom/quake-like FPS called Cube, and a similar opensource GPL title called Sauerbraten.  Cube and Sauerbraten both share notable features of including a map-editor system in-game (Cube currently includes multiplayer internet map-editing) and a stark, minimalist approach to their implementation.  Also fairly odd is the fact that they include a basic scripting language that seems to be a twisted mish-mash of functional programming and a classical FPS console language - which is exactly what we'd expect from a language designer and FPS gamer.
