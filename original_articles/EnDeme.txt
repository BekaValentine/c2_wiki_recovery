An Endeme is a list of (nominally) 22 characters, each of which stands for something. Its EndemeSet defines what each letter stands for (as an EndemeCharacteristic). Endemes do not always have to be associated with an EndemeSet, but they usually are in practice. An example endeme is:

 CRDGBMLQVHFJNOAEPUSTKI
This is my cognitive Endeme based on the BusinessTalentEndemeSet.

For easier reading it can be displayed like this:
 CRD-GBML-QVHFJNOA-EPUS-TKI
Its 'full designation' would be:
 businesstalent:CRD-GBML-QVHFJNOA-EPUS-TKI
or
 BusinessTalent:CRD-GBML-QVHFJNOA-EPUS-TKI
or
 business talent:CRD-GBML-QVHFJNOA-EPUS-TKI
Each letter has a weighting within the endeme. The first letter has the strongest weight and is therefore the most important, each successive letter is less important in sequence. EndemeSet''s also contains all of these letters but since they letters have not yet been ordered into an endeme, they are called 'sets'. Because sets have no order. endemes have order and they are usually instances of sets.

Endemes store qualitative information.
