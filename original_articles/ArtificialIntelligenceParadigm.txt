There are many simple structures that go into ArtificialIntelligenceAlgorithms.  For example, the ThreeLawsOfRobotics could be implemented by integrating a SearchAlgorithm and a SubsumptionNetwork for input and output.  The SubsumptionNetwork could offer multiple possible routes to take, and the SearchAlgorithm would gauge which one would score the highest against the ThreeLawsOfRobotics.

Put some other ArtificialIntelligenceParadigm''''''s up too... they're kind of handy if you're looking for advanced concepts with funny names.

According to an article by Pui-Wing Tam in TheWallStreetJournal -- the authors hypothesize that the brain works by AnticipatingAndCompletingPatterns more than it does through input and output of information.  It seemed quite appropriate for ThisWiki.  Hawkins thinks his theory could reorient the AI research community toward developing methods of completing patterns rather than responding to specific sets of complete instructions.
