Hibernate is an ObjectRelationalMapping service for JavaLanguage. Hibernate lets you develop persistent classes following common JavaIdioms, including association, inheritance, polymorphism, composition and the Java collections framework. 

The HibernateQueryLanguage, designed as a "minimal" ObjectOriented extension to StructuredQueryLanguage, provides an elegant bridge between the object and relational worlds. Hibernate also allows you to express queries using native SQL or Java-based Criteria and Example queries.
