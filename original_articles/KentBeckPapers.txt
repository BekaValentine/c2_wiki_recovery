Here are working papers Kent has written:
	* OptionalScopeContracts -- http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/files/Optional%20scope%20contracts.pdf. When contracting for XP work, fix time and price, and fix a process by which scope will be negotiated. Oh, and make a series of short contracts instead of one long one.
