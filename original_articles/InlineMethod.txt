When a layer of functional call indirection no longer serves a communication or factoring purpose, remove it by textually substituting the body of the function at the call sites. The inverse of ExtractMethod, and by far the less common of 
the two.

''Given that most languages will do this as an optimization, or can be told to do this (the inline keyword in C/C++), this should be '''very rare'''.  I would only recommend InlineMethod in two cases:''

* ''Profiling tells you that the function call is a performance bottleneck, and other ways to encourage the compiler to inline the call are not working''
* ''The number of arguments to the function are huge and it is only called from one place--in other words, the function is '''tightly''' coupled to its caller and manual inlining actually makes the code more readable, not less''

''Both of these are quite rare, in my experience.''

Also an optimisation performed by some compilers, whereby a method call is replaced by the actual code of the method being called.  More usually referred to as MethodInlining.
