This book takes a very practical approach to implementing elements of the SemanticWeb with programming examples in PythonLanguage. The codes are supposed to be available on a web site http://www.semprog.com but this is not at present working.

One of the key ideas discussed is the use of RDFa (ResourceDescriptionFrameworkInAttributes) where the RDF (ResourceDescriptionFramework) data is embedded as attributes in XHTML markup.
----
There is a useful discussion of the SemanticWebLayerCake.
