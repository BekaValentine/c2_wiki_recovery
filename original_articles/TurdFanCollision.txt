A situation that goes very wrong and negatively impacts everyone within its radius of effect.

''Hmm someone is afraid of using a BadWord. The '''real''' way to say this is '''Skit Hit The Fan''' with a char replace.'' 

  // Sample implementation in QompLanguage
  '''func''' TurdFanCollision(s: string): string;
  '''v''' i: integer;
  '''b'''
    '''if''' s <> 'Skit' '''do''' exit(s);
    '''for''' i = low(s) '''to''' high(s) '''go''' '''if''' s[i] == 'k' '''do b''' s[i] = 'h'; break; '''e''';
    result = s;
  '''e''';

With regards to the "BadWord" comment above, this also has the advantage of being understated in a hackish way.  "I think that switching database vendors would cause a TurdFanCollision; we use too many custom features".
