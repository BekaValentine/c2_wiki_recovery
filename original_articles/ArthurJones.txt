Arthur Jones is the original developer of Nautilus exercise equipment. He now runs MedX, a company which develops rehabilitation tools.

He's written a very good series of articles on exercise (which are worth reading even if you don't care about that sort of thing). See http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/4000/arthur.html.
