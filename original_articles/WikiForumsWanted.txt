How often have you looked into the list of PublicWikiForums, being frustrated not to find the forum of your interest. If you don't want to create your own WikiForum by installing your own WikiEngine or opening your own forum on a WikiFarm, put your wish here.

* IdeasForDesignImprovementWiki.  Could have sub categories, such as:
** Consumer Electronics
** Computer Hardware
** Computer Software
** Software User Manuals
** Computer Peripherals and Accessories
** Automotive
** etc.
* This Wiki would be for explanation of deficiencies AND specific suggestions for improvement.

And how about:
* RequestsForDesignImprovementWike.
** This Wiki would be for explanation of deficiencies where no solutions have yet been devised.

I want to find a hosting site for wikis, where I can create my own private wikis which I would share with a defined, limited membership- for example to collaboratively write a book.

If you find an existing forum in the wish-list (having created one yourself or created by someone else), please announce it in PublicWikiForums (and delete the resp. entry here). Thank you.
