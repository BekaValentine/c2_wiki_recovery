Interests: Reducing the effort it takes to do the obvious without removing the flexibility to do the necessary. By extension, patterns, methodologies, frameworks, OpenSource, truly useful technologies like WikiWiki. I also enjoy using utterly bizarre tools to do the obvious like QuartusForth''''''.
