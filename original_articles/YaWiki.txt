Despite its painfully unoriginal name (If I see one more software package that has the words "Yet Another" in it's name, I think I'm gonna hurl chunder) it looks promising. I haven't played with it much, so my comment is only a guestimate at this point. - ''Sorry about the name, there are just so many PHP-based wikis out there. In addition, it's based on Yawp, which is (you guessed it) "Yet Another Web Programming" foundation for PHP. -- PaulJones''

The description of YaWiki from the website's homepage: "Yawiki is not a traditional wiki; it uses much of the Wiki Way, but adds logical name spaces, access control lists, navigational elements, and more. Yawiki is designed for collaborative web-based documentation efforts, although it can serve very well as a base for any website. What you see now is the default template, but the Yawp site uses a custom theme for Yawiki."

Here are some technical highlights on Yawiki:

* Uses the Yawp foundation for PHP applications (http://phpyawp.com). 
* Built from PEAR and PEAR-compliant objects such as... 
** Savant (http://phpsavant.com)
** Text_Diff (http://pear.php.net/Text_Diff)
** Text_Wiki (http://pear.php.net/Text_Wiki) 
* Database abstracted with DB_Table (http://pear.php.net/DB_Table)
** Works on most anything from MySQL to Oracle
** Self-installs the database tables on first run
* RSS feed support for individual pages 
* Has a special Area Map page that lets you define a page hierarchy for navigation elements 
* Supports separate name spaces (called "areas") in one installation
* Supports anonymous users and user authentication 
* An access control list that lets the wiki administrator control who can edit and view individual pages in each area 
* A comment system for users who are not allowed to edit pages directly 
* Theme-aware (build your own look and feel)

''One of the big features of YaWiki is the Area Map page. Because YaWiki is for collaborative documentation, and because the underlying Text_Wiki engine will allow for multiple output formats (such as RTF in addition to XHTML) it is useful to have a stated hierarchy for some or all pages on the site. The Area Map page is like any other page, except its indent levels indicate the hierarchy for pages, and it automatically generates navigational elements for the wiki (tabs, side-bars, etc). -- PaulJones''
