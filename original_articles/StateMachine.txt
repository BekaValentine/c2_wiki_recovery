A StateMachine can be described as: 

	*An initial state or record of something stored someplace 
	*A set of possible input events 
	*A set of new states that may result from the input 
	*A set of possible actions or output events that result from a new state 

A TuringMachine is an example of a StateMachine. So is a FiniteStateMachine.

Can a StateMachine be represented by WikiPage s? For instance would you put

  StateOne --(event_type_1 as plain text on the same page)--> StateTwo

or

 StateOne --(EventTypeOne)-->

Then have EventOne with a link to StateTwo. But then what if EventTypeOne applies to several States? Thinking here of using a PersonalWiki to model StateMachine s
