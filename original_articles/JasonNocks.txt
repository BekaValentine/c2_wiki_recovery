Jason has been learning and trying to adopt TestDrivenDevelopment and ExtremeProgramming practices since the year 2000, after first hearing about Refactoring and later attending a presentation by UncleBob at the Software Development 2000 East conference.
----
It occurred to me the other day that we don't have a place where Successful XP projects can be documented and publicized. So, I started the page, SuccessfulXpProjects. Please contribute examples that you are willing to share.

Thanks, Jason Nocks.

Some somewhat serious pages Jason has started:
* SuccessfulXpProjects
* EliminateDuplication
* ExtremeProgrammingMisconceptions
* TakeRegularBreaks
* UnitTestIsTheMock
----
Some pages Jason started that have highly questionable value:
* WorryDrivenDevelopment
* PairedVenting
* SafetyInNumbers
* MiseryLovesCompany
* BlameGame
* EndlessMeeting
* FragileProcess (FragileAlliance)
* HappyThoughts
* SleightOfHand
* StageMagician
* PointlessEvangelism
* CodeFreeze
* ClinicalTrialsHaveBeenFoundToCauseCancerInRats
* FiveYearsExperienceInNewTechnology
* EinsteinExpress
----
Other areas of interest that I'd like to see more discussion of and possible new developments:
* CodeSmellMetrics
* XmlTestSuite (I've written one in the past for a client, I'd like to see more use as an AcceptanceTest framework rather than for UnitTest''''''s. IMHO, there's not nearly enough emphasis on making it easier to write AcceptanceTest''''''s)
* ConceptOfCollaboration (See CategoryCollaboration)
* SelfOrganizing

Note: I like signing my comments as follows:
Cheers, -- JasonNocks

''That gives the unfortunate impression that you always have a drink to hand.''

Well, that may be where the term is often used, but I wouldn't say that the meaning is limited to that situation. And why is that an unfortunate impression?

''Haha! Exactly. I too use "cheers" for "farewell". It's more of a British-inspired thing and not very common in America, so it usually provokes some light-hearted discussion. But if they insist on picturing me with a drink, make it a Cabernet, and forget my fuzzy slippers, a silk robe, and an imported cigar. Jason, thanks for your refactoring of OpenSourceCommunism. I especially liked how you organized the the page to which you moved the discussion, and gave it an introduction and an explanation for the refactoring. Thanks.'' -- CarlosNsRodrigues

No problem. Funny stuff. Hmm, maybe it's really an indication that I need to join WikiholicsAnonymous... Cheers, -- JasonNocks

''Re your quick navigation links: you might consider AutoPcn.''

Cool! Thanks, I thought I remembered reading about that somewhere, but had forgotten where. I'll most likely try that out soon!

''You are now registered for the AutoPcn system.''

Thank you. AutoPcn is very cool. Cheers, -- JasonNocks

Note that JasonNocks is aware that a single newline does not break a paragraph.

Jason, I deleted your StageMagician page because it didn't say much. The SleightOfHand page is interesting, though. -- ElizabethWiethoff
