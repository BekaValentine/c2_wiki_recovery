I've been a programmer since I was very young.  I know a variety of languages, but most recently have used Python and C++.

Awhile ago, I passed the mark where my professional lifetime as a programmer has exceeded my non-professional lifetime.  It has always been something of a mystery to me why one counts more than the other.

Anyway, I write and think a lot.  I have an infrequently updated homepage at http://www.omnifarious.org/~hopper/, and numerous other accouterments of a modern web denizen.  :-)  My online handle is Omnifarious, so if you see that anywhere, it's likely to be me.

Oh, well, at the risk of being spammed, my email is mailto:eric-wiki@omnifarious.org.

Unless I say other wise, my writing is CopyLeft''''''ed: Use and quote it but say where it came from.

I have an OpenSource project I've been working on for a long time called TheStreamModuleSystem.

I have another OpenSource project I just started called CAKE, it can be found at http://www.cakem.net/  This project is also listed here under SpamSolutions.
