A common managerial AntiPattern, wherein the person who has the ''authority'' to see a task/project/etc. carried out is not ''responsible'' for the project's success or failure.  (Or, as is likely in many cases, is responsible for successes but not failures).  Naturally, this AntiPattern implies that somebody else has ResponsibilityWithoutAuthority.

AuthorityWithoutResponsibility can be as a result of some formal organizational structure (MatrixManagement produces this AntiPattern often--see below), or informally.  

Examples:

* In a matrix-managed organization, functional managers can often put the kibosh on a project but have little if any responsibility should it succeed or fail).
* Sometimes, the boss will instruct an employee to "own" a particular task--the employee might be punished should the task fail--but withhold the necessary authority to clear roadblocks.  
** Especially true of business managers who have program managers working for them--in many cases, the ProgramManager is held responsible for the success of the program, but has to continually beg the business manager for resources to get the program done.  (Including, in some cases, resources that were budgeted for the program).
** Often happens retroactively--the boss blames a subordinate for failing to get an assigned task done; when in fact the subordinate was unable to complete the task due to excessive roadblocks.
