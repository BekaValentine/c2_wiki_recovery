A SoftwareEngineer in NewYorkCity. (I also used to review movies for http://www.nynewcomer.net, which has ceased to exist.)

I have nine years of experience as an object-oriented software engineer. I'm currently developing applications in WebObjects.  I am highly proficient in WebObjects/MacOsx/CocoaFramework/NextStep/OpenStep (see CocoaProgrammers).  I love RubyLanguage.  And I'm an ExtremeProgramming fanatic - at my company, I was an early adopter of practices like UnitTest''''''s, CodeUnitTestFirst, RefactorMercilessly, and PairProgramming, and was part of the eventual adoption of ExtremeProgramming as our official methodology. I'm one of the founding members of XpNewYorkCity.
