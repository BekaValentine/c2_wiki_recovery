I have started to program with BASIC V2 (on an old Commodore VC20 -- with goto's and line-numbering) -- today I draw UML diagrams and program with (some more or less elegant) object oriented programming languages.

I like Wiki very much. There are often new ideas and thoughts that inspire my mind.

Special Interests:

* Information Management
* SoftwareReuse
* High Quality Software

I think XP is very inspiring, even if I don't know, if it is always right.

I am from Germany and many might recognize it by my writing. Maybe this is some kind of special LanguageSmell ;-) ?

My Homepage (sorry, in German): http://www.2CentsOfWisdom.de

Very interesting is also the article TheMythicalManMinute about SoftwareReuse.
