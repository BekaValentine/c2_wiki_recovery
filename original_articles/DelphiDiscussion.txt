The Delphi Process was developed by the Rand Corporation to predict future events or trends - my definition, not theirs.
It consisted of several steps:
Gather a group of experts.
Distribute a topic or problem to each one, gathering their comments.
Merge their comments, redistribute to the group, gather their comments.
Continue this process until a consensus is reached.

Look here for a nice overview:

a copy of complete book is also posted online (with, unfortunately, many typos -- as a Wiki user, I find it frustrating that I cannot immediately fix the typos).

Does Delphi have any uses?  Can the process be refined?  Did anyone ever use it for anything but demonstrating how the Delphi process works?

Perhaps the DelphiDiscussion page should be moved to MeatballWiki ?
