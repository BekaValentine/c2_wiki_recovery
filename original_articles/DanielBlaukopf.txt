I am a software engineer who spends his days at SunMicrosystems Israel. Wiki... looks good. Now, I'm off to explore the rest of the site.

October, and I'm back visiting again. This time I'm going to try to set up a clone.

I don't seem to have put my e-mail address in earlier. Here it is: daniel-at-blaukopf-dot-com.

A local WikiWikiWeb is now up and running! Unfortunately it isn't accessible from outside the firewall, so I can't put a link here.
