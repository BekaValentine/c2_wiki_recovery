Welcome to Wiki. I have a dumb question: Is Lux Spes your RealName? 

No, it isn't is my InternetName, I may one day share my RealName, I just don't feel like doing it today... I hope that doesn't make people uncomfortable discussing stuff with me. 

I am just not sure about sharing my RealName everywhere... every PrivacyAdvocateOranization recommends against it... on the other hand, I guess finding out what my RealName should be an easy thing to do for someone that really wants to find out... so I am just undecided... and I also agree with the ideas against RealNames in RealNamesPleaseDiscussion... So, NoRealNamesPlease.

The following is true about my LuxSpes name:

* I almost ''never'' use my real name online (for privacy reasons, among others)
* Almost No one online knows me by my real name anyway, and only a few people I've met online know my real name at all
* I chose this name when I first came online and have used it ever since (in addition to any variations and/or throw-aways)
* I receive mail at my post box in this name
* This is my ''chosen'' name, not the one forced on me as an infant

I just want to say that I think ArguingWithGhosts is very poetic
