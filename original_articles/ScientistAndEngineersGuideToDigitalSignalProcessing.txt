Describe ScientistAndEngineersGuideToDigitalSignalProcessing here.

''The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing'' by Steven W. Smith (1997). ISBN:0-9660176-3-3. Available online at http://www.dspguide.com. Claimed to be for "non-commercial use only", which I guess means is that you shouldn't be reading it at work.

DSP textbook, which (unlike most such books, such as DiscreteTimeSignalProcessing, which focus mainly on theory) contains a lot of material on ''practical implementation'' of DSP algorithms on commercial DigitalSignalProcessor''''''s.
