''You guys are wonderful -- thanks!''
-----

I'm employed at Computer Task Group Inc.[1], a large computer consulting firm based in Buffalo, N.Y.  There I
administer approximately 800 Internet user accounts.  We're looking for
ways to attract our remaining 3500 employees to participate
in this wonderful medium.  I think you guys may have hit on
just the idea: collaborative projects on the Net.  WOW!!

My interests lie in UNIX, Internet services, foreign languages
(German, Russian), computer chess, running (10 marathons),
and anything that fosters communications -- like this!
