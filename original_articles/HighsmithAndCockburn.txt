JimHighsmith and AlistairCockburn decided at last to pool their efforts.  Not clear just what this means corporatewise, when two people who each refuses to hire employees or work for anyone else decide to pool efforts :-).   However, what it does mean methodologically is that CrystalMethodologies and AdaptiveSoftwareDevelopment will start sharing vocabulary and concepts.  Jim and Alistair will continue to load concepts, principles, practices, techniques, work samples, and writing onto http://crystalmethodologies.org (no longer working -- try http://alistair.cockburn.us/crystal/ instead), since that was already going in the direction both want to take a public site, namely: open discussion and contribution on this notion of light-but-not-too-light, self-adapting or self-evolving, human-centric, concurrent, software development.  (Is it possible to say that in 25 or fewer buzz-free words?)
