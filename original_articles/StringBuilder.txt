A companion for StringBuffer which is not thread-safe but much faster. Use it whenever the buffer doesn't escape method scope or is otherwise protected from concurrency.

Replaces the default StringBuffer used by the compiler for String concatenation in Java since 1.5.

StringBuilder is also present in the DotNet BaseClassLibrary, with largely the same semantics.
