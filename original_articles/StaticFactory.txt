A Static Factory is a static procedure that creates an object, often an AbstractFactory.

	public abstract class Abstract''''''Factory {
	  public static Abstract''''''Factory createAn''''''Abstract''''''Factory() {
		// load a specific Abstract''''''Factory somehow...
		// like dynamically from a configuration file
	  }
	  public abstract Concrete''''''Produce1 createConcrete''''''Produce1();
	  public abstract Concrete''''''Produce2 createConcrete''''''Produce2();
	  public abstract Concrete''''''Produce3 createConcrete''''''Produce3();
	}
The above example is an AbstractFactory that has a StaticFactory built into it.  You create your instance by configing it in some way (like a config file or global property name) and calling it like so:

	Abstract''''''Factory fact = Abstract''''''Factory.createAn''''''Abstract''''''Factory();
Easy as cake.
