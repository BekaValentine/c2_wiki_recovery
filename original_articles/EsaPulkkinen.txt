I'm just another software engineer. I live in FinlandEurope. I've written quite a bit of Haskell and C++ code in the past 10 years or so. I'm not sure much of it is very useful though, the current situation seems to be that I have many unfinished pieces of code that do not do much. But I'm slowly working towards getting actually something useful.
I actually do have quite ambitious plans, but as said, it's unfinished.

Here are some topics I find interesting, just to remember that they exist:
   FpVsOo, OoVsFunctional, RoadMaps, UnifiedModelingLanguage.

Here are some topics I have changed at least once:

   AclassIsNothingButaCyclicDependency.
