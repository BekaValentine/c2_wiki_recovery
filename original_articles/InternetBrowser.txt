A term for a WebBrowser and is somewhat misused, since an InternetBrowser browses the whole InterNet while a WebBrowser only loads WebPage''''''s. There are such things as InternetBrowser''''''s in their own right, if they do more than just the WorldWideWeb, such as ElectronicMail, InternetRelayChat, or FileTransferProtocol.

''Are you aware that the very first widely used browser, Mosaic, became popular precisely because it was multi-protocol, and supported not just HTTP, but also FTP, GOPHER, etc, etc???''
