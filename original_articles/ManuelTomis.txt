I am 22 years old. I live in Cyprus and I am a computer science student at Cyprus College.

I like FreeSoftware, LinuxOS, and I am interested in language design. I am the creator of BrainLanguage (http://brain.sourceforge.net).

My other hobbies are science fiction (expecially StarTrek), and rock and heavy metal music.
