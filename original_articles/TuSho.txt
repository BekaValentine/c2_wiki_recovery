Hello. (This is a PseudoNym.)

''Hello.  Do consider RealNamesPlease.''

Thanks... but no thanks. I value the RightToVanish and also anonymity (e.g. I prefer anonymous forum software when using one.). I also use this PseudoNym elsewhere, and I'd prefer the connection.

''Forum communities have values too.  This one values taking responsibility for one's statements, which is exactly what fly-by-night dealers of words with false names and the RightToVanish are aiming to avoid.  But, while a few of us might gripe and you might get a little flak for it, we won't (and can't, technologically) forbid you from using a pseudonym.  So... WelcomeWhatBringsYouHere?''

I take full responsibility for my statements, of course, and this isn't a throw-away false name - being that I use it elsewhere too. Anyway, as for what brings me here, an interest in software design, development, patterns and people.
