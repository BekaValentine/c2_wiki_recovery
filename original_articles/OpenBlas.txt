OpenBlas is a new implementation of the BasicLinearAlgebraSubprograms (BLAS) continuing where GotoBlas left off. The library contains an uptodate implementation of LAPACK (LinearAlgebraPackage).

See http://xianyi.github.com/OpenBLAS/ for details.

The new work includes fixing of some bugs in GotoBlas and on some hardware it can give considerable improvement in performance. -- JohnFletcher
