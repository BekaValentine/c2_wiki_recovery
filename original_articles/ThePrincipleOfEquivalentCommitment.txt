ThePrincipleOfEquivalentCommitment is a mental tool that I use in association with TheZeroPointPrinciple; actually an extension.  You have a certain relationship with your (Company / lover / dog / whatever) that you strive to maintain as a BalancedRelationship.  Part of this perceived balance is that you get an equivalent amount of (remuneration / love / whatever) for the (effort / love / money) that you provide.

But the other balance you should strive for is a balance of commitment.  Is your (employer / lover / dog) giving you indications that they are making as deep a commitment to you as you are making to them?

Just something to consider.
