ToDo is often used in a PersonalInformationManager for things which have not been completed. This is a more universal version than that of comments made in source code. It is often scratched down on the back of envelopes, napkins from lunch, a 3 by 5 card, or in a formal notebook dedicated to Time and Information management.

TODO is often found in code indicating that something isn't completed yet. This has become so common that there's now an official @todo JavaDoc tag. Most pages on the wiki citing ToDo are using the term in this way.
