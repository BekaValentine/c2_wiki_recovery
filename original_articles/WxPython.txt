An introduction written by the creator of the WxPython wrapper is located at http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.4.2/wx500.htm

''The introduction and overview are still useful but all the technical information, including the code samples, are drastically out of date. Don't rely on it.''

Strongly recommended by EricRaymond (famous) and SteveHowell (not so famous).

NoelRappin and RobinDunn have written a book "wxPython in Action" (http://www.manning.com/rappin)

Other than Visual Basic, wxPython is the easiest to use GUI builder I've used for windows. It's easy to start building user interfaces right away after knowing just a little bit of python. --BlakeMason

Minimal wxPython application:

import wx

#You must have an application object, wxPython provides a basic one which is great for quick & dirty apps or samples

app = wx.PySimpleApplication()

f = wx.Form(None) #an empty top level window. None indicates that it has no parent.

f.Show() #they default to hidden

app.MainLoop() #starts event loop

Pythoncard is a design tool that uses wxPython. It's inspiration is Hypercard, and it makes building  most GUIs a toddle.
It implements most of the main wx widgets.
