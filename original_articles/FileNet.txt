Where can i find more information on FILENET!
FileNet is the world's leading enterprise content management system. Established in 1982, FileNET practically invented the field of Enterprise Office Document Imaging Systems. FileNET's Image Services is the industry's leading provider of high-volume systems for storing, retrieving, and managing document images, transactional content, workflows, web contents, and other business objects. More than 3,700 organizations worldwide have implemented FileNET systems to provide content management services that are scalable, highly available, and provide strong disaster recovery capabilities. They have provided solutions for 81 of the Fortune 100 companies. 

Unfortunately, despite an open and modular design that runs on the majority of enterprise computing platforms, FileNET's products suffer from a dearth of independently produced knowledge resources. 

FileNet : A Consultant's Guide to Enterprise Content Management by Todd R. Groff and Thomas P. Jones (ISBN: 075067816X)d was written to fill that information void and provide wider understanding of this complex and powerful set of products to enterprise level decision makers, project managers, and technicians. In addition, the book provides general knowledge on how to use existing document imaging and/or document management systems to provide advanced knowledge management functions.
