SysOs (careful now) is JerryArchibald 's software house:
  System Objectives
  12 Barger Hill Road
  Putnam Valley, New York  10579
I'm primarily a consulting gypsy and follow contracts wherever they lead. I work in Smalltalk, UML, and Java (all flavors, all tools, all platforms). 

I am currently working on reviving some earlier research on software design languages into new perspectives for UML and Java.
