Steve met WardCunningham at COOTS '97 (http://www.usenix.org/events/coots97). With a couple of friends from the Portland Java Users Group (http://www.solidware.com/pjug/), he persuaded Ward to present on PatternLanguages later that year.

At PJUG, Ward traced the history of pattern languages, brought home the AbstractFactoryPattern and SingletonPattern in the JavaLanguage, and briefly described the CrcCard''''''s design method. He then showed the group how to identify patterns in teams of two.
