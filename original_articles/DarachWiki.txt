IainLowe's WikiEngine using JavaServerPages.

The engine is a set of JSPs plus objects.

All formatting in the newest version is done using regexps from the new J2SDK 1.4 from Sun. I have also done a complete rewrite of the rest of the engine. The source for the latest version can be found at http://www.schmeez.org/software/wiki

Any idea what the features are? Security? Attachments? FreeLink''''''s?

''Features are simple but functional, there is no security, no attachments and free links are not supported.''
