No relation to AliceLanguage. The Alice Development Kit is an authoring environment for 3D storytelling.  It is designed to allow the novice programmer, or even the non-programmer, the ability to create fully interactive and responsive worlds.

Squeak-Alice is a 3D / Animation retained-mode framework to run these 3D worlds in Squeak. It has no authoring tools and relies heavily on Alice.

As a 3D engine, Squeak Alice is a mix of extremely good and extremely pathetic. It's extremely good because it relies on the MorphicFramework to be object-oriented, which just about no other 3D engine is. It's extremely pathetic because it has just about nothing that a sophisticated 3D engine should have, such as particles, transparency, or even ''fog''!

The pink bunny demo alone is sufficiently cute to turn people off of it forever.

Is there any way to import a2c files (standard Alice format) into Squeak's Alice?

Versions outside Squeak are plentiful, and can be discussed in AliceSoftware.  The latest version of this isn't in Squeak, but integrated into Sims 2.  http://www.alice.org/
