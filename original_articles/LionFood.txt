These two lions escaped from the zoo. To throw off pursuit, they agreed to meet up in a month. One month later, they met. One lion was half-starved, the other was sleek and well fed. They asked one another how they were going. The half-starved one said

"Man, it's been terrible! I ate one of those humans and they came after me with guns and nets. I'm lucky to be alive! How come you did so well?"

The sleek, fat one replied:

"I don't know what you are talking about. I camped outside <insert company name here> head office and ate a manager every day, and no-one even noticed."
