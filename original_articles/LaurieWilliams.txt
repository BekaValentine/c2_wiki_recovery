Laurie is doing some very interesting research trying to isolate what makes XP work (if indeed it works). She is beginning by comparing the PersonalSoftwareProcess with a very similar process, but including PairProgramming.

Hey, Laurie, is your PairProgramming research available online anywhere? -- FrancisHwang

Laurie's August 2000 PhD dissertation (the research referred to above) was on CollaborativeSoftwareProcess (CSP), which compared pairs using a process which added pair programming to PSP, vs. individuals using PSP. A PDF of the dissertation can be found at http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/dissertation.pdf.
