
Currently (summer 2005) working at Source Medical <http://sourcemed.net/> still a big fan of Agile development and PairProgramming.

Previously worked at Internet Security Systems <http://www.iss.net>, I was team lead on an XP project that ran from August 2000 until Feb 2001.  We measured a 65% improvement in productivity, and much higher quality (over 90% of functional tests passed the first time) when compared with the previous project the team worked.  Now I am manager of 3 XP teams.  XP is a great methodology.
