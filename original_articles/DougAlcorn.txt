I am a SoftwareEngineer. I have been working in the Unix environment for a while. I like to use emacs, program in elisp, C, C++, perl, and lately Ruby. I have my own Wiki at http://www.lathi.net/ and I run a Wiki at work as well. I'm really interested in CollaborationTools. I'm also interested in SoftwareMethodology.

My real email is mailto:doug@lathi.net. Don't send email to mailto:tarpit@lathi.net; it's a SpamTrap.
