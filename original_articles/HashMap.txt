The name of a DictionaryDataStructure (aka: Map) using a HashTable found in the JavaLanguage (due to the Hashtable name being taken up by a bad implementation in java version 1, and needing to remain for backwards compatibility).

Sometimes, Java programmers are prone to using the term HashMap in conversation. What they really mean is HashTable.

Disagree: the (non-standard, but widely used) C++ hash library that comes with most compilers is called hash_map. It might be the same as HashTable, but it doesn't mean that using the word HashMap is invalid. -- JamesAguilar
