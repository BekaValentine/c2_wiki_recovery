... the pattern community strives to develop a high
quality body of literature that improves the quality
of life for users, developers, managers, and others in
the software community.
The creative literature community uses a review format
called a WritersWorkshop to improve the quality of
literature that is published beyond a small circle of
colleagues.
Authors clearly can benefit from the feedback of their
peers and colleagues.
This pattern establishes a SafeSetting to provide
free-flowing input to authors while preserving their
dignity.

'''*  *  *'''

There are few things that satisfy authors more than
seeing their work published and widely used.
For works published without a critical review
process, authors will receive their first feedback
from the market they aim to influence, which may provide
a rude awakening for the author.
On the other hand, peer review can be equally frightening
and demoralizing, as the author is open to criticism from
peers who know the material and the author well.
Familiarity with the material makes it possible for these
reviewers to provide the largest volume of feedback;
familiarity with the author makes it possible for them
to "push the author's buttons" in the review process.
Yet such review is important.

'''Therefore:'''

'''Provide a SafeSetting where the author can receive useful'''
'''expert feedback directed at the work rather than at the'''
'''author, with the goal of preserving the dignity of the'''
'''author.'''

You can help the author feel at home by using the patterns:
WorkshopComprisesAuthors and AuthorsCircle,
which help provide a peer setting
with opportunity for reciprocation;
ModeratorGuidesTheWorkshop, which prevents the workshop
dynamics from getting out of hand;
PositiveFeedbackFirst, which helps the author's sense of
contribution and self-worth;
SuggestionsForImprovement, which defines the tone of
constructive feedback; and ThankTheAuthor, where
the community formally recognizes the author's contribution.
