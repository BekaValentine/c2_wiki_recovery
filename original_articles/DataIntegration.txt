Data integration connects the applications at the data level and makes the same data available to more
than one application. This type of integration relies on the database technologies and is ideal when
there is minimal amount of business logic to be reused and bulk amount of data transactions are
involved across applications. This type of integration is suitable for batch data uploads or bulk data
sync requirements.
