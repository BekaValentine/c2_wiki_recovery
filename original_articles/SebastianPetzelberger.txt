Previously I was looking for free wiki hosts.
If you know one, please edit WikiFarms.
Now I am long time glad with SwikiFarm

How do I promote Wiki?

Hi Sebastian.

Please add your experience so far to CorporateWikis.

	* If you want a corporate wiki, set one up inside your company's firewall.  It's safer and easy to do.
	* If you want a non corporate wiki, say here a bit more about what you want.  You may be able to collect a few like minded people.  I have seen what seems to be a free wiki at www.wikiworld.com (nothing to do with me).

There is also the book TheWikiWay which comes with a CD with a simple wiki on it.
