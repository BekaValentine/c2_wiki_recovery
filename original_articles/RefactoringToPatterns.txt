A concept I've understood for a long time, but a term I first heard talking to JoshuaKerievsky. 

Many times I've refactored, only to look up afterward to see the result nearly always provided a more elegant, integrated design than I considered going in.

WhatIsRefactoring? To me, it's an ideal way to explore, teach and learn about patterns because it does it in context of real code. The results are immediate and the ah-ha moment profound. -- JackBolles
