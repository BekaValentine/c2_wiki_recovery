A lot has changed since this page was started...

This may be considered off topic for the c2.com wiki, but this page has survived for almost 2 years (as of Jan 2003), so I don't think this will be a problem.

Now there is a Blender wiki too: http://wiki.blender.org

----

Blender is a free, recently opensourced, 3d modeling, animation, texturing, etc. application, supported on the following platforms:

* Linux (intel/PPC/?others?)
* Windows
* IRIX
* Mac

and probably others that I'm forgetting.

The official web site is:

http://www.blender.org

This site is mainly for developers.  Users will probably want to look at:

http://www.blender3d.org

and

http://www.elysiun.com/

----

The main reason why I personally wanted to make a wiki site for blender is to help coders who are new to the blender source find their way around.  This does '''NOT''' preclude anyone from adding other stuff, such as tutorials or feature requests or the like.

Here's the page with the source info on it:

A notion floated at http://www.blender.nl/discussion/read.php?f=4&i=5771&t=5771 . Wiki, but with animated 3D content as well as words. Depends on tweaks to TheBlender.
