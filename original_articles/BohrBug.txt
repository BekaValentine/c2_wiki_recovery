From the theory of DistributedComputing.

A BohrBug is just your average, straight-forward bug. Simple like the Bohr model of the atom: A small sphere. You push it, it moves. BohrBug''''''s are reproducible, and hence are easily fixed once discovered.

A BohrBug is rather boring, but...
we must not forget, it still is usually annoying undiscovered, can also be disastrous, not easy to find.... and destroyed, most often gives satisfaction and some knowledge for future of where to be especially cautious.
