''A notion which can allow information manipulation in a WikiWithMoreThanPages and a WikiWithMoreThanUsers'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20110914

A WikiWord is WordsSmashedTogether, while a CompoundWikiWord is WikiWords Separated By Specfic Nonblank Delimiters.The string above, following the italic phrase, is an example of one using the dot (.) as the delimiter.
 
The GoodThing about such a notion is that it can be used as a MeaningfulName in a URI. It also can be manipulated to form collections named by any of its constituent WikiWord''''''s, including collections based on any reordering of one or more of its parts:
* DonaldNoyes.ThinkingOutLoud would be used as the filter to construct a collection of pages containing the two WikiWords together, or if indicated, the WikiWords separated by spaces and/or other words.
** In the immediate form the collection would collect the DonaldNoyes pages which include ThinkingOutLoud and could be placed in sorted order of the modifiers (using the example, by DateStamp).
** One might also use the Notion to Collect all the ThinkingOutLoud pages by a given contributor either ever created, or created in date order, or by month, or by year, decade, or century. (This is particularly useful in construction histories)

The use of CompoundWikiWord''''''s can indicate other things and provide for other kinds of things, including such things making possible a WikiWithMoreThanUsers 

To make these thing possible, CompoundWikiWords would be processed using a WikiQueryLanguage (WQL). An unimplemented (as yet) in any WikiEngine I know.
