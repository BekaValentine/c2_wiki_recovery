That which is not written down will evaporate.

This is true in specifications and in technical discussions.

In specifications, the writer of the spec will often have a vision that isn't communicated in the document.

In discussions, things will seem clear in the moment but the understanding evaporates quickly. This includes both on-the-job discussions and classroom lectures.
