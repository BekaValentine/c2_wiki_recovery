'''UK DWP LessonsFromFailure'''

This report:

	 :	http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/26/dwp_network_outage/

describes a rather interesting incident in the UK.  A couple of quotations from the article may be in order:

* Most of the desktop computers in the UK's Department for Work and Pensions were paralysed for four days on Monday

** Hmm - I knew Mondays were difficult, but one that lasts four days is just not fair!

* a limited network upgrade from Windows 2000 to Windows XP was taking place, but instead of this taking place on only a small number of the target machines, all the clients connected to the network received a partial, but fatal, 'upgrade.'

** Ah, an "upgrade" ...

* MS consultants have been flown in from the US to clear up the mess.

** At whose expense, we wonder.

* ... a spokeswoman amusingly insisted that the Department's systems had not in fact fallen over. They were working, it was merely the case that "80 per cent of desktop computers are not connecting through to the mainframe systems."

** Interesting definition of "working".
