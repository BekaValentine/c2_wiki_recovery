"Potlatch" is a ceremonial feast among certain Native American peoples of the northwest Pacific coast, as in celebration of a marriage or accession, at which the host distributes gifts according to each guest's rank or status. Between rival groups the potlatch could involve extravagant or competitive giving and destruction by the host of valued items as a display of superior wealth.

''Vaguely connected is Queen Elizabeth's way of discouraging rebellion by her nobles. She visited them. The costs of funding such a visit fell on the host, who then was too poor to fund any serious rebellious activity -- AnonymousDonor''

'''Potlatch''' is a word from the language of the Kwakiutl of British Columbia. The ritual was described by Franz Boas (http://emuseum.mnsu.edu/information/biography/abcde/boas_franz.html). -- TomRossen
