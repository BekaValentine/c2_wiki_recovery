LeoSchwab is indescribable.

However, the last net hit Google reports for him is in 2000. Does anyone know if he has gone offline or something?

----------------------------

No. Google finds later references if you use 2002 as a search term as well as "Leo L. Schwab".

LeoSchwab is neither offline nor missing; he just doesn't update his website, http://ewhac.best.vwh.net . Leo *can* be described. A former co-worker once referred to him as 'quirky'. He's also been called an 'amiga legend' because of his graphics work on the AmigaComputer. More recently, he wrote many a DeviceDriver for BeOs until being laid off with many other employees when Be, Inc. sold its intellectual property to Palm. 

In the past, LeoSchwab was known for his hat, his cloak, and his recumbent bicycle. He still wears his hat every day and owns even more cloaks than before. He hasn't ridden his recumbent for a few years, but still has it in the garage, along with a fair amount of vintage computing equipment. 

Leo's current interests include costuming and vintage dancing, especially Victorian mid-century waltzing and Regency dance. Leo is working freelance and looking for a position that would fully engage his curiousity, meticulous nature, and expertise. He is usually very prompt about replying to email sent to ewhac@best.com .

Leo is now working for Openwave in Redwood City, CA.
