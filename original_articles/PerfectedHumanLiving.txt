''Consider our tiny benighted friend, the housefly. Surely it is not so optimal to be a fly as it is to be your wise and puissant self. So by your logic you must enlighten all the flies. But now there will be no-one to eat all your perfectly digested excreta. You'll drown in the stuff. Perfectly ...''

''Now I hear you say that a fly is not a human. And I've met few who are. But we each have our role to play in food and social chains. We must each eat a certain amount of someone's excreta. How can this arrangement be made just? Well, speaking practically, it can't. So attempts to perfect justice invariably end in horror, and perfection remains a game for fanatics, philosophers, and children.''

''This may be why LaoTse said,''

	 :	The gentle desire no-desire,
	 :	Value no-value,
	 :	Learn no-learning,
	 :	And return to the places people have forgotten;
	 :	They would help all people to become natural,
	 :	But then they would not be natural.
