'''Documentation-procrastination technique:'''

TrainUsersFirst.  Train at least one user before writing any documentation for a piece of software.  While training that user, develop a one-page cheat sheet (either paper or Wiki).  Repeat process for 2nd, 3rd, 4th users, etc., until you either:

	* Find a user willing to write documentation for the software.
	* Have enough knowledgeable users that they support each other.
	* Have enough cheat sheets that producing documentation is more about editing than writing.
	* Discover your software is not usable enough yet to distribute.
	* Realize you can't write intelligible documentation so users are just out of luck  (AndyPierce)

This is a good idea for documentation.  But there have been cases where the users were trained before any''software'' was created.  This is generally not a good idea, although it can be a good mental exercise for generating stories.
