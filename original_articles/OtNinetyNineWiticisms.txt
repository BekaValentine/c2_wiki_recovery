At OtNinetyNine, large white boards were joined
together in a corridor 
for public writing, posting of questions, messages, responses, pictures, posters. (A sort of "hardware wiki" clone.)

Here's a communally written limerick that appeared on "the wall":

 "There was a young man from Trieste
 Who said "in OO why test?"

   ...
   When hacking out Java
   It's such a palaver
   Delivery?, Surely you jest!

   ...
   We know that we should
   But develop so good,
   Our users will do all the rest

   ...
   Objectively speaking
   Other tasks are competing
   So leaving it out's for the best

   ...
   A class or two here
   A class or two there
   ... it's integrate if we're blessed

Maybe someone else with the results of the OT competition could post them?

Just tidied this up a bit...my favourite was from a few years ago, when contestants were asked (among other things) to rejig song lyrics. Some memorable submissions included

  I can't get no
  Good abstraction
  ...

  When I find my code in times of trouble
  Bjarne Stroustrup comes to me
  Speaking words of wisdom,
  OOP
  (a full three verses of this one...)

And many, many more...
