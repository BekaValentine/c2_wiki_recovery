I was a software developer at Lucent Technologies, Naperville, IL. until July, 2001, when I got caught in the great voluntary retirement program.  Now I'm happily retired, working on improving my drawing/painting skills, and looking into open source development.

I worked with BobHanmer and JimCoplien, among others -- Cope got caught too,  but Bob might still be there!

Before the great vrp, we were finally doing some BackwardLookingWork, 
mining Patterns from the systems we've built.  Probably don't have time for that these days.
