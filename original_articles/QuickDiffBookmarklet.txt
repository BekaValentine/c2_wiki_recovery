is a WikiBookmarklet, that gives you quick access to the QuickDiff-feature of the WikiWikiWeb, just like clicking on the 'last edited' date at the bottom of a WikiPage:
    javascript:void(location.href = location.href.replace("wiki?","quickDiff?"))
You can also use the following to open a new window. Everyone to his taste.
    javascript:void(window.open(location.href.replace("wiki?","quickDiff?")))

This bookmarklet is especially useful for pages containing .gif references or are very long, because they may be slow to load, and if 'stopped' may not show the last changed date.
