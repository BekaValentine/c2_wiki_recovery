There are several types of financial planning processes. 

One process is personal financial planning.

Personal financial planning is a systematic series of specific steps to make sense of many complex and separate components of a person or family's economic wellbeing.

Major areas of focus include but are not limited to retirement planning, estate planning and estate tax, state and federal income taxes, investments and securities planning, employee benefits and insurance. 

''Of course, the above is an ideal rarely found in reality.  "Financial planning" is usually a "service" offered by a bank to encourage its customers to give more money to the bank.''
