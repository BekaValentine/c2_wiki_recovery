Although NoAgreementOnWiki correctly states 

	 :	'[...]there is no good way to express agreement except by linking to it. Unless you can expand upon the material presented, there is nothing left for you to say. Adding applause and saying MeToo, at least, are of extremely limited value. In short, whether or not you believe SilenceConfersLegitimacy, it is certainly the case that most legitimate arguments can only be responded to with silent endorsement.'

there are a few other ways to 'silently' agree with some content/position/statement:

* Correcting spelling, improving layout.
* Adding appropriate WikiTag''''''s, WikiBadge''''''s, especially categories.
* Removing something made redundant by that part.

These silent tasks indicate to the observant WikiZen that someone else reviewed the content and agreed with it (at least superficially).

''"...there is no good way..."''

I think this is unscientific. Better "... we havn't yet found a good way...". Of course there would be many ways to express agreement, for example add "ContributorsAgreeing (...) ContributorsDisagreeing (...)". It just depends on what the community wants to establish.

Or, like google PageRank, simply link to it so that it will rise in WikiAwareness. --Mark Janssen

This is silly, because of course there is going to be AgreementOnWiki, DisageementOnWiki, and NoAgreementOnWiki.  What else would one expect with a communication medium where many minds can come together to discuss many issues and subjects?  One comes and reads, participates, and walks away with more information and views then before.  If one agrees on a particular subject of contention, then simply say so and why, and the same way if disagreement or perhaps no conclusion can be made.  So, why does there need to be a consensus?  That is up to the reader/participant to decide for themselves, as there never will be a definitive answer for anything.  The most valuable asset of this Wiki is the discussions.  Innovations and new understandings come from listening to, and discussing, different points of view and approaches.  Agreement-shmeement, disagreement = potential magic!
