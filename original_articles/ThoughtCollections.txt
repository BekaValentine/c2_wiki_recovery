This page is intended as a voluntary writing page, as in poetry, rhyme, short stories, and random discussion. Please contribute, and if you intend to be critical, this is not your page. I (nor any other contributors, hopefully) do not claim to be an artist of any sort, I just recognize the benefit of free flowing thought. So, enjoy!

 Along for the ride
 too late to sleep now
 rough night, avoid a fight
 found a friend in which to confide.

 Outstretched arms
 tainted materialistic love
 can't believe
 the soft sweet everything
 and everything 

 Opened eyes
 inward glance
 past faults colliding
 with present lies
 culminates in future regret
 self compromise.

 Too late
 - far too late, to sleep now
 awake all night
 awake in deep sleep
 dreams disintegrate with broken ideals
 hard to determine
 hard to agree
 hard to consider
 hard to keep consistent
 my idea, what is right
-- MattThomas Overflow of powerful emotion, recollected in tranquility.


~ baraka ~
the world, without filters
~ no words...
awake in deep sleep; 
finding balance ~ strength, love ~~
easy to determine...easy to keep
...hard to find ? .... the important is inivisible to the eye...
