TermOfAbuse doesn't have a page.

This is interesting.  Some things can have both positive and negative meanings, for different people.  Often such terms are used in political argument. Most people build themselves a list of things related to those they disagree with.

PoliticallyCorrect
UnixCulture
TheNotUnixCulture
TheDownloadCulture

etc etc to taste.
