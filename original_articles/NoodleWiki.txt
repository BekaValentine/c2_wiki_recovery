GoodWiki - Basic Wiki using ASP and either Access or File System. http://adamv.com/dev/asp/noodle/ 

This is a simple wiki. As far as ASP wikis go, I prefer FPWiki, but this has been added to help make the list as complete as possible.

''The textarea definition used for the editing box needs to have'' wrap=virtual ''or'' wrap=soft ''added to it to avoid horizontal scrolling.''


Updated 31 May 2005, now uses CSS for layout, JavaScript for detecting unsaved page changes, Quicksort for sorting when using the filesystem back-end. Comes configured to use the filesystem back-end out-of-the-box now, so installation is now just unzipping to somewhere in your IIS web-root.
