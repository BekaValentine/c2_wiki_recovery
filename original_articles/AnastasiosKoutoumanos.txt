Anastasios (aka Tasos) Koutoumanos 

Used to be a Java programmer but then had to finish PhD dissertation to present it at the National Technical Univ. of Athens. Now done away with this unpleasant task and hopes to get back on the Java rail as soon as I realize that I will have enough time to play with his new-born daughter Ero for at least the next 15 years :-)
