Consider the doubling of characters to form LinkPattern''''''s: e.g. UuSsAa.

It should also be stated that the need for such a device is because of a defect in Wiki (''there, I said it!'').  Ward's syntax for links is clever and simple, but it forces people into sometimes bizarre and unnatural devices to form page links.  Instead of adding to the bizarre with doubling characters, how about we ask Ward to consider adding an alternate syntax that supports cases like acronyms.  One possible syntax might to surround the link with square brackets as in [[USA]].  This would be rendered as a normal link. 

Other ways to represent USA:
UnitedStatesOfAmerica
UdotSdotAdot
CountryUsa
