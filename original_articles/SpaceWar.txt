We use to play spacewar on the imlac in the NineRoomAtPurdue. We had to populate the vectored interrupt logic before this program would run. JohnBottoms built button boxes (like modern-day game controllers) which made the game a lot more fun. (Lest you think we just goofed off, we also built a network graphics system and simulated shuttle landings.) -- WardCunningham
