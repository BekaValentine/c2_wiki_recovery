I used to work for Microsoft on the Visual Studio product. I worked on the C++ debugger, which eventually became the Visual Studio Debugger. I also worked on the C# editor.

My work in development tools and the Wiki's discussion of development practices have a lot of overlap.

While at Microsoft, I wrote a blog about my work that may be of interest: http://blogs.msdn.com/jaybaz_MS/.
