This is a good source of information about NumericalAnalysis. It also contains codes, and there are many other codes available for most of these things.

''The original FortranLanguage version of ''Numerical Recipes'' was widely reviled by quite a few professional numerical analysts. Anyone know whether later versions, such as this CeeLanguage version, addressed the original criticisms?''

I believe that the comments were about the quality of the source code rather than the mathematics. -- JohnFletcher

For information about Numerical Recipes, including discussion forums, see http://www.nr.com/. The site also leads you to free PDF downloads of ''Numerical Recipes in C'', in Fortran 77, and in Fortran 90. You need to pay for ''Numerical Recipes in C++'', however.
