This is my brand new Wiki homepage.

''Hello Dawn. I suggest you do some reading: WelcomeVisitors NewUserPages StartingPoints. You can't say that this is a brand new Wiki, but you could say that this is your brand new WikiHomePage on WardsWiki. This page is to be used to tell us a little about yourself, a place for us to leave messages for you and vise-versa. But, it is not a place for you to start your own Wiki from: WikiSquatting WalledGarden.''

I've clarified it for you.

''OK, I understand, sorry. :) Delete my remarks as you wish, and "Welcome To Wiki".''
