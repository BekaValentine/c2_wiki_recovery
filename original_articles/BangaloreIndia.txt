''''The Silicon Valley / Plateau of India''''

The best city in India (also called the Garden City) and capital city of the southern Indian state of Karnataka. As one person visiting from US said, "If you want to visit India, land in Bangalore first and then go to the other places. The adjustment needed is lesser."

A recent report indicated that Bangalore had surpassed the SiliconValley in the number of people employed in the IT industry.

''If I visit, will they give me my IT job back? Seeing all those people driving nice cars eating at good restaurants would only remind me of the good ol' days before globalization gutted IT in the US, sending me close to poverty. And beware: Live by globalism, die by globalism. Bangalore is not immune from the same forces that tumbleweeded Silicon Valley.''

Absolutely. Giving all our money to lawyers, insurance companies, and death-machine manufacturers had nothing to do with pushing up the cost of US programmers. Go tropics go tropics! -- A NordicAmerican

''It's simple macroeconomics. The cost of anything - including labor - is far greater in the US than in India. Part of this is currency exchange rate (dollars are worth far more than rupees), part of this is the greater overall wealth of the US. It should also be noted that India spends lots of its money manufacturing its own death-machines; unlike the US, India has several rather unfriendly neighbors, including one (Pakistan) with whom it has waged several wars over the past half-century.''

I doubt many of the IT workers there are driving nice cars and eating at nice restaurants - the wages are good in Indian terms, but pitiful in US terms (even taking into account the relative cost of living).
