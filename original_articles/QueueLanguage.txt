
q is a MinimalistLanguage created by ArthurWhitney and distributed by http://kx.com. It is an ArrayOrientedLanguage that also implements a RelationalDatabase. It shares some characteristics with APL (AplLanguage) and J (JayLanguage) and its predecessors A+ (AplusLanguage) and k (KayLanguage); like k, its greatest use is in managing huge transaction-oriented databases. In this class of problem q's performance is often staggering.
