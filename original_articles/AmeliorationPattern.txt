An amelioration pattern is a prescription for how to edit (i.e., rearrange, add and delete) an existing situation (represented by a pattern) to achieve some further effect or behavior. The existing situation doesn't have to be bad in the absolute sense, just bad in relation to the desired new behavior. In this sense, an amelioration pattern is transformational in character. It probably should describe how to transform from one (bad) situation or pattern into another (better) pattern.

''Wow. I must be really stupid, because this whole page reads like gibberish to me. I always thought that amelioration was something performed by ''people'' who had a vested interest in seeing to the substantial righting of wrongs, smoothing of the rough, etc. Now you're telling me that all the analysis, contemplation, and planning of correcting problems can be accomplished through the use of a ''pattern''?!? I must really be getting old. Heh. -- MartySchrader''
