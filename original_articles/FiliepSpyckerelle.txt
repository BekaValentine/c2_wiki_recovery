Interested in OO and methodology. 

Walked the Wiki for a couple of years but was too scary to expose whatsoever.

While working on a regular expression tester, undertook again some revamping on the AspWiki version. Will pass (20/02/2002) a newer version of asp.wiki which has a richer feature set and which also allows for accented characters in WikiNames.

Other interest is to enhance the VbUnit with XML for reporting functionality.
