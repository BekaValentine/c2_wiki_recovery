A GarbageCollection system implemented as part of the Jalapeno/RVM project at IBM; it is a ReferenceCounting collector with a cycle-detection system. It is not quite as fast as leading generational collectors, but it is RealTime.

"The Recycler is a concurrent multiprocessor garbage collector with extremely low pause times (maximum of 6 milliseconds over eight benchmarks) while remaining competitive with the best throughput-oriented collectors in end-to-end execution times."

Advertised as 'Java without the coffee breaks'.
