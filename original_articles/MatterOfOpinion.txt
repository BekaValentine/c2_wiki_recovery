Sometimes we just have to accept that there are many ways and many views on particular subjects. None of these views can be 100% correct; some can be more correct than others, but there may be valid reasons why a particular way or view has been chosen. You just have to respect the opinion of the other person and accept that their way of thing is right for them, even if you feel they are misguided.
