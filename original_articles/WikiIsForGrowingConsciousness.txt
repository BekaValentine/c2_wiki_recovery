Maybe in 50 years time -- who knows, maybe sooner, maybe later -- there will be intelligent computer programs reading Wiki. But there aren't any yet. ''How do you know?'' When there's some discernible prospect of them existing, it might make sense to take them into account. 
''Why not think about it before such a critical event manifests itself (what needn't be necessarily the case)''

But why do so ''now''? ''Because a hopefully generous time interval for anticipation might be helpful for the HumanBeing''''''s.''

We haven't the slightest clue what they'll be like. ''Yes. Therefore we should start to think about as soon as possible.'' About the only thing we ''can'' be sure of is that any entity, human or computer or alien life-form, capable of reading and understanding the content of Wiki won't need primitive mechanical aids.

I don't advocate writing for humans because I think humans are the most important things in the universe. I advocate writing for humans because ''at the moment and for the foreseeable future'' humans are the only entities reading Wiki. There may also be computer programs doing some very mechanical processing on Wiki, but I don't see how complicated WikiBadge''''''s will help ''them''. I don't believe in optimising our writing for readers that don't exist yet and whose preferences are completely unknown. -- GarethMcCaughan

This reinforces the concept YouArentGonnaNeedIt ''yet'' so therefore, DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork '''until''' we HumanBeing''''''s who are the current form of UnitTest''''''s find our peers. -- ChrisGarrod
