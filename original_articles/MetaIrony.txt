Possibly, beyond the usual restrictions that we consider to be the ambiguous position of irony.  Possibly, irony shifting its position, the duality of the ironic position, viewed from an unusual angle.  Maybe, it is therefore an ironic irony!

''Subtle understatement + Irony?''

Would it be possible to get an example?

There is such a thing as double irony but this would be on the same level, metairony implies a level above.

There's a song from the former singer of Die Krupps. The chorus goes like:

	This is the paradise way

and then, a hissing voice in the background interjects

	or so, the snake would say

It's hard to explain, but I think the second line's words are ironic, and the fact that it's sung in a snake-like voice is in turn ironic of the irony - sort of meta-ironic. The classic example of course is HaHaOnlySerious. -- ArneVogel
