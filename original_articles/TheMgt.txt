Markoff Chaney, one of RobertAntonWilson's most enduring characters, is a dwarf whose mission is to throw a spanner into the corporate machine. Chaney's prime M.O. is to forge announcements and signs that increase stress levels, like:

		 :	To meet new Business Health Guidelines, employees are required to wash their hands '''both''' before and after urinating. Thank you.

and invariably signs himself,

	 :	"--TheMgt"

CatBert seems to draw on Chaney as his inspiration. Not to be confused with MarkvShaney.
