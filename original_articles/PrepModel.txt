PREP organizational model

In SevenHabitsOfHighlyEffectivePeople, Covey talks about organizing tasks around your roles.
Defining your roles and maintaining balance across roles isn't easy.

Here's a simple short cut.

PREP is four categories:

	* Personal
	* Relational
	* Environmental
	* Professional

Here are some examples:

Personal tasks
	* Eating / Sleeping / Hygiene
	* Exercise
	* Classes / Study
	* Reading
	* Doctor/Dentist Visits

Relational tasks
	* Social Activities
	* Quality Time
	* Phone Calls
	* Hanging out
	* Personal Favors

Environmental tasks
	* Domestic maintenance and engineering (housework/yardwork)
	* Car maintenance
	* Paying Bills
	* Grocery Shopping
        
Professional tasks
	* Work/Job/Career Related
