I heard in spring 2002 that some researchers trained a rat to respond to transmitted commands via implants in its brain. The rat, carrying a tiny video camera, could be maneuvered through rubble. Sounds useful for locating earthquake victims. -- EdPoor

''I keep pet rats; I'm very fond of them. They're affectionate and personable. They also tend to evoke reactions ranging from disgust to terror among people who aren't used to them. They might not be the best vehicle for a rescue operation.''
