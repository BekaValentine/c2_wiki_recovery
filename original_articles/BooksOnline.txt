There are advantages in having BooksOnline, besides being available from many places and using different devices, both fixed and mobile.

The first is the reduction of the ReferenceFootprint, (how much physical space it takes for storage and reading) such that one may carry or access hundreds if not thousands of books from online sources or from flash drives or device memory spaces.

The second is the ability to make text readable for the visually-challenged through text magnification or its conversion to sound or tactile media.
