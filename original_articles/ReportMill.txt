It is great to build reports that use objects as datasource (you can bind report elements to objects, or methods in objects) so it is a great option if you are using an ObjectRelationalMapper to get the information from the database. 
AFAIK until recently ReportMill was the only ReportingTool that was designed to make it easy to use objects as the datasource for reports.
