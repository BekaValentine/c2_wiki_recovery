Standard Average European (or SAE for short) is what BenjaminLeeWhorf of the SapirWhorfHypothesis called similarities among European Languages, but it can also be applied to other languages. Like, ''Chinese is actually rather SAE.'' Or, ''Don't tell JamesCookeBrown, but LoglanLanguage is actually very SAE.''

''Why is Chinese SAE?''

''And why, pray tell, is LoglanLanguage SAE?''

I don't know if they are, I just heard that somewhere, but see http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lojban/message/7580.

How can we tell JamesCookeBrown? He's dead.

The standard non-SAE language according to Whorf is HopiLanguage.

''Jeepers H. Creepers, NONE OF THIS gives me any information on what it means to be Standard Average European, or what you're trying to connote when you say that? It's enough to make one motion for deletion of this page...''

English: I can eat glass, it doesn't hurt me.

StandardAverageEuropean (ISO 13271): Eu posso vidrio essen, cela non hurt mig.

This whole page seems to be nothing but an expression of LojbanicSnobbery.
