'''I live at WikiPedia, but I thought I'd set up a vacation getaway here....'''

I've been reading up for a while at MeatballWiki and decided that this looks like a good place here

I try to keep the following queries in mind as I work:

'''--> Working on Wikis''': ''The Four-way test from Rotary International''
* Is it the truth? 
* Is it fair to all concerned? 
* Will it build goodwill and better relationships? 
* Will it be beneficial to all concerned? 

'''--> Working with others on Wikis''': ''Queries from the Religious Society of Friends''
* Do I approach others with respect and concern? 
* Am I concerned with community and its needs? 
* Am I an agent for tolerance and acceptance? 
* Can I forgive others easily? 
* Is there harmony between what I believe and how I act?

'''--> Five nice ideas from a Wikipedian'''
* Make others feel welcome (even longtime participants; even those you dislike)
* Create and continue a friendly environment
* Turn the other cheek (which includes walking away from potential edit wars)
* Give praise, especially to those you don't know (most people like to know they are wanted and appreciated)
* Forgive

I'd love to hear from you...
