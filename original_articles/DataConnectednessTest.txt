"The Data Connectedness test checks whether you actually can traverse the network of collaborations to gather all the information you need to deliver the services. (I have seen a major system design fail this test!) " 

- from [1] "Object-oriented analysis and design, part 2", by AlistairCockburn, in C/C++ Users Journal, one of the 6 tests for a design.  Also on ObjectDesignQuality, but there there are only 5 tests.  In the CUJ article there are 6 :
	1. Data Connectedness
	2. Abstraction
	3. Responsibility Alignment
	4. Data Variations
	5. Evolution
	6. Communications Patterns
