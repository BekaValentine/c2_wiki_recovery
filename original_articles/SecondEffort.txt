When you are DoingStuff, and the outcome of the doing is unsatisfactory, or incomplete, sometimes a SecondEffort is required to make it so that ItWorks. This is also true of efforts which accomplish the doings by StepwiseRefinement, or via an organized, step by step process.
* WikiGnome''''''s are found employing this strategy as they go about their work of making this wiki a better place. 
** as in identifying and fixing broken links (first effort: identify) (second effort: fixing)
* Programmers employ this strategy in their TestFirstDesign efforts which result in better and correctly functioning programs, routines and processes.
* Athletes also are known as champions by taking this to the extreme.
