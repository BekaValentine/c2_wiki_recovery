I am professional programer with 20 years experience in a variey of enviroments. I claim to be an expert in nothing, and I futher assert that this modesty is not false. 

I have spent my working life in relative obusrity, struggling in isolation with the challenges of Software Development, while at the same time eduating myself on Best Practices, Worst Practices and almost everything in between. As compared many who have contributed to these pages, I consider myself something of an imposter. But  I have decided to make my presence known at this time because I have come to realise that there are far more people who claim to be experts than who actually are-- as I see it this gives me licence to speak so long as I do not claim to be more than I am.


Thanks to Ward and all those to make this an interesting place to visit.
