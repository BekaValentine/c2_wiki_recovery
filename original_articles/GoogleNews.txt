GoogleNews is a search engine that searches many participant news sites for the latest news based on key word searches. I use it to look for news related web pages with up-to-date information (created in the past ?couple years). 
* Use this for GoogleNews Advanced search (removed by Google in Nov2004) -> http://news.google.com/advanced_news_search?hl=en&num=100

The advantage of using GoogleNews (http://news.google.com) instead of the regular GoogleSearch is that I would not be getting pages that are created 5 years ago (e.g. search for Xml). And it is therefore very useful for beginners in a fast changing technical area, since it only returns news related websites that are recent.
* BeginnersMind can not diffrentiate which is out-dated vs current relevant information.

Disadvantage of using GoogleNews is that the News facility does not have as wide coverage as the main GoogleSearch, and that because it is a beta users cannot count on its availability, nor consistency of behaviour over time.

''Not to be confused with GoogleGroups, which used to be DejaNews.''

'''Example in late 2004'''

''While doing a search on '''"SP2 patch" activex ''' ''
* GoogleNews comes up with 1 item, an article titled "How to Break Windows..."
* GoogleSearch has 616 items, but did not show the one listed in GoogleNews (from addict3d...) unless it is asked to repeat search and include omitted items
** The GoogleSearch came up with this interesting reference to http://windows2000mag.com/Web/Article/ArticleID/43130/Web_43130.html that is dated June2004, which is absent from GoogleNews
