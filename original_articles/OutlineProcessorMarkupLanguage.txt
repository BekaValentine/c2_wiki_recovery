OutlineProcessorMarkupLanguage (OPML) is a data interchange format based on ExtensibleMarkupLanguage. It has ties to RssFeeds (ref http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML).

''Note there is a community designed spec completed in 2003 called OutlineMarkupLanguage. This is supposedly a better format, and separates data and presentation.''

** But what significant software uses it?
** To what degree are OML and OPML compatible?
