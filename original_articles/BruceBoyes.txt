In order of importance: father, embedded systems developer, pilot (PSEL and glider), musician, kayaker, etc. Lots of other hobbies but when do I have time any more? Currently, Systronix (www.systronix.com) is developing a line of engineering boards and accessories for the new TINI Java embedded controller. Blah, blah blah. A combination technology enthusiast, iconoclast, and entrepreneur. Will anyone ever read this? Pretty enthusiastic about Java. Can't wait for the soaring season to start.
