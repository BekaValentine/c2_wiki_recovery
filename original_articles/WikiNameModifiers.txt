'''Hmm, these are related to common refactorings...'''

	* A suffix of 'Discussion' so that the thready part of a page can be split off
	* A suffix of 'Not' as in WhyWikiWorks and WhyWikiWorksNot
	* A suffix of 'Faq'
	* A prefix of 'Recent' is prone to become stale except on automatically generated pages
	* A prefix of 'About' is redundant and rarely used

Hey - I see a pattern here.  Suffixes good, prefixes bad.

Hey, instead of the "Discussion" suffix, we should call it Talk. It gets rid of LongTitlesSmell.

''Try searching on Talk. There are some pages ending talk, but far more Smalltalk!! (search is not case sensitive)''

Hmmm, true.

In the spirit of DontMakePartTwo, consider not creating '___Discussion' or '___Not' pages. Instead, use ThereforeBut to prevent DocumentMode pages from becoming ThreadMode.

And if you must split a page, please read and consider SplitByTopicNotByOpinion.
