I'm the Webmaster at Perforce Software. I presented a pattern language for HTML way way back at PLoP '95. I haven't posted here for a while, but I'm hoping to get some information (or start a discussion) about WikiReplacingMailingLists. -- RobertOrenstein

''Has anyone at Perforce considered using wiki as a collaborative development tool? I was wondering just the other day how much work it would take to have something like MoinMoin use Perforce for version control. Difficult to say how useful this would be until you try it of course. -- ChrisSteinbach''

We're just starting to play with wikis. So far, there are four of us using it, and we'll widen the audience shortly. The main obstacle is getting people to buy into it, and I don't think this'll happen until our wiki supports Email Notification. Supposedly, that's in the works... -- RobertOrenstein

	* Teach introductory programming at a Pasadena Art College. I love this job!

	* Freelance programmer. Mostly HTML & CGI jobs these days. Nothing that interesting right now.

	* Manager and sole proprietor of Anamorph[1], a Web server. If you don't like it, you get your money back.

	* Just gave paper at PLoP on the pattern language of a Web site. Met a lot of neat people, and there's a lot to think about.

	* Don't know why I'm writing this in sentence fragments.

A note three years later, after talking with RonaldHayden (above) -

* I've moved to Alameda, California (near Oakland). I'm writing the documentation Perforce Software (an SCM system) and am helping on the SCM Pattern language.

OK, one item doesn't a bulleted list make. Still...
