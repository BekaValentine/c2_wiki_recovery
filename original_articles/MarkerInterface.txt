A synonym for TagInterface.

An idiom used in Java, and possibly other languages.  It's an interface that indicates the class is meant or allowed to be used for a particular purpose.  A classic example is the ''cloneable'' interface in Java.  Classes that "implement Cloneable" (see below) can be copied using the clone() method.

There may be legitimate uses of this idiom, but treat it with caution.  The use of a marker interface may well be a CodeSmell.  (Evidence in favor: to detect a MarkerInterface, you must use Java's ''instanceof'' keyword, which is definitely a CodeSmell.)

Seems like MicroSoft DotNet has an IClonable interface which is never used. What's the point if I still have to use a method on the default interface? -- ThomasEyde
