Let me throw out a question that has always bothered me. I've worked with several people who follow object oriented programming on an almost religious level. But I've noticed that few of these people have ever implemented large pieces of software (e.g., 20K to 50K lines of C++) on commercial project schedules. And in the case where the object zealots have implemented large pieces of software, they have tended to either be too slow or not work or both.

I was trying to split up the many points covered in AnOoMagicBullet so we would have a chance to look at them more clearly. The leading paragraph on this page is I think about ObjectCargoCult kind of behavior. --KentBeck

Don't let the tenets of XP (or any other theory about software) become ReligiousObjects, because all ReligiousObjects deserve ExtremeIconoclasm.
