Lead programmer on many videogames, including Spider-Man 1 and 2.  Managed about a dozen coders on a team of around fifty coders, artists, producers, and game designers.  I blog at http://gamedevblog.com;  my e-mail address is jdfristrom@yahoo.com;  projects I've worked on are listed at http://mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=26239/;  I have a few articles published at http://www.gamasutra.com.  I've also written a novel under a pen-name, Dionysus Logged Out, almost completely unrelated to software engineering, but it should appeal to most geeks: http://www.dionysusloggedout.com.
