Any script which automatically participates on a Wiki (or WardsWiki in particular). I'm excluding read-only scripts like FilteredRecentChanges, etc... to qualify as a WikiBot a script/program must modify (or attempt to modify) WardsWiki.

Unfortunately, most such programs have been put to questionable or outright obnoxious purposes. Examples:

* Numerous spam-bots that automatically post WikiSpam.
* WikiPageProtectionBot''''''s that periodically check if a page has been deleted or changed, and restore it to the version the bot author prefers (from an off-line copy).
* WikiPageDeletionBot''''''s, that periodically delete (and usually DoubleDelete) a page the bot author dislikes.
* UndoEditsByIpBot''''''s, designed to harass individual users by deleting indiscriminately their changes. ''A program of this type, but used to remove spam, has already been written and tested, so a script would also be possible. Some spammers seem to be using similar methods for selective spamming of this wiki.''
* WikiWipeoutBots, which try to delete or destroy all Wiki content.
* Fantabulous''''''Bots, which do anything you can imagine... and worse. I once saw such a bot argue insistently against StaticTyping! ''Evidence? Or is this just flippancy?''
