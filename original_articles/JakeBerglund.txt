My name is Jake Berglund and I was a partner imeme.net, an affordable Zope webspace provider. I play non-classically oriented music, and was under the label of nconsequential.org. I was preparing to relocate to Virginia to take over Systems Administration for imeme while the current Administrator (Mindlace) began employment with Digital Creations. All of that happened. Since then, iMeme was taken over by someone else who screwed the clients and defaulted on moneys owed by the company, and gave the domain name away to someone else entirely.

Jake Berglund is now in Portland, Connecticut and works as a stonemason. His business is at markmastersmasonry.com and has music available at metasyntatic.com.
