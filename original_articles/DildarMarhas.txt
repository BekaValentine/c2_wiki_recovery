When I first started working with SmalltalkLanguage (Smalltalk V/PM) I did not understand the difference between a Class and an Object. Then there came a time when I wanted to write my own MetaClass. I find SmalltalkLanguage beautiful and liberating. I have no grudges against C++, Java or even VB. 

I enjoy spirited interchange of ideas about DesignPatterns, ChaosAndComplexity, EvolvingSystem''''''s and FormalSystem''''''s. I work with FrancisTownsend, RickHansen and DanSurdu.
