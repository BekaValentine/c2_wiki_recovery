This has both Wiki and non-Wiki aspects.

Lately, I've contributed to a number of wiki pages, even created a few, and find that I can't always remember where I said something.

Damn.  So here I am, trying to contribute value without trying to get my ego involved, and finding that ego elimination by not signing leads to forgetting where I've buried the bones.

So, I guess I'll start signing my work again.  Not so much for the "credit" but so I can find old tidbits I've already said and avoid saying them again.

And then there's the programming side.  Here I am, going through ColdCode whose authors are dead, retired, or fired (and occasionally still with the company), and finding that I'd have a better idea of the thought processes if I could be sure whether author.a or author.b wrote it, since I've begun to get a sense of trends in their coding styles.

So, I've also gone back to signing everything I contribute to this ColdCode, so that the next SoftwareArcheologist who comes along will have at least a prayer.  -- gh
