I'm no XPert but here's what I think:

If I were a TriageNurse, I would do it this way:

Decide on which pile/category each patient (i.e. card) falls into:

	1. Cases that don't have to be taken care of right away.

	2. Cases that need to be taken care of right now.

	3. Cases that are too far gone and can't be taken care of -- these are the cases that can't be done even with the maximum time allotted.

Then focus on pile number 2, and throw away/modify pile number 3. Plan to do pile 1 later...

If there's too many cards on pile number 2, rethink which ones you can put on pile 1 instead. If there's still too many, even after culling the ones to put on pile 1, decide which cards on pile 2 to put on pile 3...

Problem solved.

I ask my boss to do card triage for me: I make a card for each thing I've been asked to do, and add cards for things that I want to do but haven't been asked to do.  Then I ask my boss to sort the cards.

I'm always surprised how wrong I was when I guessed what was important to my boss.

This is visceral and direct. My boss never complains about the schedule dates I never meet (I have yet to meet a schedule date on this job). After all, my boss physically put the meet-the-schedule card lower in the stack before handing it back to me. -- WayneConrad
