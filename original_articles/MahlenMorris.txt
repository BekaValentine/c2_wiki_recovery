My name is indeed Mahlen Morris. I live and work in San Francisco, California. 


I use JspWiki at work for the Engineering Intranet. Our internal user base is slowly growing, as I attempt to infect each developer with TheWikiWay.


I'm working on code and applications for clients to JspWiki's WikiRPCInterface. See http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Hula and http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Hoop for the latest, including a project to supply a WikiRPCInterface for WikiWikiWeb (sadly, Hoop has languished for some time now, due to strange bugs i could never track down. A partial rewrite might be in order.)

You can find out far more than you'd ever want to know about me at http://www.mahlen.org . The best (and most vain) email for me is 'mahlen at mahlen.org'.

I also use JspWiki at work for the Engineering Intranet (http://mummymakersdaughter.com)and I find it's simple, but useful functionality adequate for our needs.
