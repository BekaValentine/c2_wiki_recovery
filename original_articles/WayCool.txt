Of course Ward will know what most of the way cool gear you can party with is...

At OOPSLA '97, I met an intelligent young woman from Buenos Aires who had just learned "cool" the previous day.  She wasn't sure what relative temperature had to do with desirability.  

I convinced her that "way cool" is even more cool.  Perhaps "way cool" will become popular in Argentina.

She was also confused by my use of "pretty", as in "The zoo is pretty far from here".

You can really confuse her (if she's still around) by telling her she's "hot."  Of course, if you aren't that friendly it be "not cool" to say that to her.
