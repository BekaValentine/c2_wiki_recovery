Data which contains information about what it is. Programs utilizing DataRecognitionSoftware will be enabled to utilize data contained.

'''XML Provides a method'''
* may give hints as to universal methods:
* Two examples
** well-formed and valid XML contains a DataTypeDefinition reference which provides information about the structure and meaning of the document's content. (This from someone hopeless overwhelmed with fad-induced infatuation for everything XML related, I must warn you.) 
** UNIX scripts whose first lines are the path to the interpreter executible needed to intepret the script.  (This from someone who of course knows nothing of value about anything related to Unix or C, I must warn you.)''

Can this DataTypeDefinition be recognized by a wide range of Software products?

'''Original Introduction to this Page'''

A proposed approach would employ techniques and procedures contained in the operating system and/or at the executable program level, (not merely filename extension/association level) With the Operaating System/Program having the capability of recognizing what the data representation is (regardless of the extension and filenaming convention) and the ability to scan the files which may contain data and provide on demand the list and location of files with accessable data for that Operating System/SoftwareProgram Configuration, along with such search and query dialogs to make it possible for one to use the data, regardless of whether it is plain text, worksheet, or database, XML, Unix, CAD data or even proprietary format.

It is something worth doing, The question is - How can it be done? 

Could be accomplished in progressive steps

* Create a NewGenerationFileManager which would display
** the file, extension
** the file size
** the date&time, 
** an extension hyperlink which would bring up access and methods information
** hyperlinks via a drop-down-list of choices of programs able to handle the information
*** a way to select a default method or program based on the PlugAndPlayDataDefinition contained within the file

This could be based on
* the DottedPrefixExtensions of the filename 
* a programatic recognition of file content

Windows Explorer 
* associates file extensions with applications
* delegates further interpetation of the data to the application itself
* if it cannot find an application for the file extension, it presents you with a list of known applications.  

Is there a way to improve the Windows Explorer system? -- SteveHowell 
* ''yes, present you with a list of applications 
** which know how to handle the data
*** e.g. 'edit xml' instead of ''all'' progams 

See discussion on DottedPrefixExtensions

Some programs, such as editors and browsers, work with many file extensions.  
* They typically set themselves up as right-clickable programs in Windows Explorer.  

Other programs, such as XML editors, 
* associate themselves with only a few file extensions
* you typically launch them by double-clicking on associated files.  
* as each new XML editor gets installed on your system, Windows overwrites the default association for .xml files
* I think it should allow multiple applications to register for a file extension

In practice
* I find I open more files from applications than from Windows Explorer
* Good text editors let you
** navigate the file system easily 
** build up tools menus to launch other applications

Examples
* Use EditPlus as an IDE for Java, Python, and Perl
* Use WindowsExplorer only for file system maintenance, like moving directories around.  
**(Actually, I use EF Commander for that, because I hate Windows Explorer's interface.) -- SteveHowell

This page indicates the need for
* software and data formats which do not now exist
* software which would be intutitively utilized (quick learning curve)
* having an adaptive nature (AutomatedIntelligence)
* assisting and instructing interactively on data handling
** giving developed options 
** showing paths to available processes based on content and context
