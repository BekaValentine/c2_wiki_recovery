QuickWins is a well known jargon in management strategies. When consultants are brought in to do a study, they focus on identifying QuickWins so both they, and their sponsors look good.

Clever people have been known in getting involved in QuickWins, and move on before it gets to be discovered that the solution was superficial, non sustainable, etc.

----
'''QuickWins are necessary and not necessarily evil.'''

See TheHeartOfChange for an example where a well known organisation expert is advocating the need for QuickWins to get people focussed on whatever ChangeManagement project being investigated. So even non-sustainable QuickWins can be beneficial, as long as work continue on beyond the QuickWins stage.

QuickWins are dangerous when they are used with the phrase QuickAndDirty as in "all we need is something quick and dirty".
