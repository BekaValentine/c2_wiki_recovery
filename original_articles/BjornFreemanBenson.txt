I live to fly my airplane (fondly known as Super Boy http://superboy.org/whysuperboy.htm). To support this habit, I make a living delivering software products.  I've been proselytizing lately about how software engineering is more and more about the people and not about needlessly complex technology.

My all-time favorite language has been Smalltalk. I also find that for teaching, APL, Forth, Scheme, and ML are great mind-benders.
