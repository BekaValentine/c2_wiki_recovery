We are all familiar, and are found using, the commonly known WiFi platform for connecting our computing devices to the WWW.

What if, in order to enable portable, extensible WiFi Networks, the network hub to which devices connect, were portable, self-powered, and connected via a specially designed high-capacity (fast) hub within its range, potentially within a mile, within six-miles, or hovering (as in satellite, blimp, or drone).
* applications
** human convening assemblies as in conferences, assemblies, temporary-venues, civilian or military operations (as in disaster-relief), meant to enable a communication and networking potential of portable, relocatable nature

How would this, or does this work?
* Ordinary devices would access the portable WirelessWireless call if for fun, the WiWiFiNetwork, as they would an ordinary WiFi Network
* The NetworkingDevice would be capable of serving many (hundreds, perhaps thousands of WiFi Hubs, placed in convenient locations to service its own temporary and/or relocatable PeoplesUnit 
** Convoys
** Moveable Venues and Mobile Service Units (thinking again - disaster or humanitarian relief units or operations)
* The NeworkingDevice would be capable of connecting to a WideAreaNetwork, or a public, secondary, or private Internetwork with sufficient bandwidth and speed as to enable adequate if not exceptional services to its clients.
