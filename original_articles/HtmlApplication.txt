Yet another 'standard' then. Or did I interpret this wrong?

I have become, within the past month, standards mad! And to go with it, tired of all these new standards appearing. Having just completed a project which utilised the upload and download capabilities of the HTTP protocol. I was '''shocked''' by the simple fact that the most widely used browser (MicrosoftInternetExplorer) has the worst support for the entire protocol.

I had to seriously rethink and mess around to get it working. I did, however, which was nice. But I conform to standards more than ever now; and I wasn't bad before either.
