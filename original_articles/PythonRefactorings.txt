Hey, BicycleRepairMan, what are some good PythonRefactorings?

A Python fan rewrote the 50-page initial example of the MartinFowler book 
RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode. 

The Python version also includes the UnitTest suites which were used to support the refactoring. Fowler approved the page and praised its format. It's all here: http://www.hiper.com.br/python/refactor/ (BrokenLink 20100627)
