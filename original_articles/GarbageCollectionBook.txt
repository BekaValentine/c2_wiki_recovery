''Garbage Collection -- Algorithms for Automatic Dynamic Memory Management'', by Richard Jones and Rafael Lins.   

* A truly one-of-its-kind book; there is no other volume which covers the topic of GarbageCollection so thoroughly.   
* This book will doubtless grow in importance as languages with GarbageCollection continue to move into the mainstream of computing.
* Highly recommended for anyone interested in programming language development or implementation.
