Abstraction can be defined as the extraction of the essential features of a complex object or matter, primarily by disregarding one or more properties considered less important.

Elaboration can be defined as the process of combining abstract principles with raw materials, thus creating useful objects with all necessary features and detail filled in.

Most programmers are elaborators. They are the salt of the earth, but they enjoy using VisualBasic. 

A valuable minority of programmers are abstractors. They enjoy some of the strangest languages, such as C++.

Most teams need lots of elaborators and a few abstractors, which is a fortunate coincidence. -- DavidBennett (an incorrigible abstractor)
