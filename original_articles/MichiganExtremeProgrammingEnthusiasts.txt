'''Membership Dues'''

These are for meeting room space, refreshments, etc. We've had up to 50 people attend and as little as 15. Average probably about 25. To get a room for that many people, we have to usually look to outside facilities and rent something.

Member dues can be paid by mail. Please make your check payable to 'MXPE'. If you need a receipt sent back to you, please be sure to include a return address with your payment. Payments can be sent to the following address:
	 :	MXPE Treasurer
	 :	2041 Miller Rd
	 :	Metamora, MI 48455-9222
Payments can also be made at the meeting. Please show up a few minutes early if paying on site. We will have a very limited ability to provide change, so please try to bring the exact amount in cash or write a check (preferable). The dues schedule is as follows:
	 :	Professional Member: $25 Single meeting: $10
	 :	Corporate Member: $100 (can send up to 6 representatives to each meeting)
	 :	Student Member: $5 Single meeting: $2
