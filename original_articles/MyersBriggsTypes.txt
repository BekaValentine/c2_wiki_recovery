'''What are the funny letters?'''
Each of the 4 letters in your acronym shows your preference along one of the following four dimensions:
  E/I = Extrovert / Introvert
	(E reenergizes from being around people, I from being away from people)
  S/N = Sensation / iNtuition ''("I" was taken, so they use "N")''
	(S wants concrete, 'now' relevance, N likes abstraction)
	(S watches things external, N looks inward)
  T/F = Thinking / Feeling
	(T values rules, F values relationships)
  J/P = Judging / Perceiving - the mode of thought used first
	(J  likes to have decision made, P likes to defer decision making)
	(J uses T or F first, P uses S or N first)

'''Temperaments:'''
  SJ (Sensation+Judging) - "The Guardians" (Security Seeking)
  SP (Sensation+Perceiving) - "The Artisans" (Sensation Seeking)
  NT (iNtuition+Thinking) - "The Rationals" (Knowledge Seeking)
  NF (iNtuition+Feeling) - "The Idealists" (Identity Seeking)

 *NF is Bones
