Just another software developer enthusiastic about DesignPatterns stuff. Also guilty of Hackerdude.

He Started thinking about "why we do things the way we do them" when he picked up the wonderful PragmaticProgrammer book. Since then he's looked to work with people who both a) Have that book on their desk, and b) It is VeryWellThumbed. Also semi-fan of the ExtremeProgramming crowd and the MartinFowler ideas.

David has been programming since 1989, in pretty much all languages. He's a self-taught programmer, who started as a business database programmer (DBase) and kept going. He's "forgotten" many languages, including AdabasNatural (a Cobol-like substance), the whole range of XBase, and Delphi. He's still hacking around in Java, C/C++, MozillaXul and Eclipse.

He used to hate Macs, then he used a MacOS X. Now there's a Mac (cube) at his desk, although admittedly as a secondary test machine (and he can't stand the one button-mouse shortsightedness). A similar story goes with SunSolaris.

Lately I've been working on MetaModel frameworks. I want to do more of it.
