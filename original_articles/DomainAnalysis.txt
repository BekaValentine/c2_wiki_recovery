When a stable domain serves as a basis, it is feasible for one to consider constructing a generator for a particular domain. The generator can be used to automatically build a series of related objects. Relational database systems are an example of a mature, stable domain where it is quite conceivable to perform a generator type domain analysis. The query language, platform, operating system and windowing environment are the main parameters for such a relational database builder.
