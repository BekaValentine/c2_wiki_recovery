About me:
I'm Mostly looking for info on the dynamics of online communities, social dynamics, online conflict resolution, etc... I've been on Wikipedia for awhile http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mike_McGregor_%28Can%29 (My userpage), and I'm active on a site called http://www.londoncommons.net/ (LondonCommons.Net) that is currently going through some growing pains. I hope to bring some useful ideas from here to there. (that's London Ontario, not London England). I'm currently working at a [homeless shelter] in which the staff uses a consensus model for decision making.
