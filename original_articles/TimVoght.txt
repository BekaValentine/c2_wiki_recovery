I'm an EmbeddedSystem''''''s programmer who - professionally at least - works almost exclusively in C. I have spent a lot of time in the last couple of years studying object-oriented material, in the hope that I won't be left behind. I have found WikiWikiWeb to be a fantastic resource.

I like what I read about ExtremeProgramming. TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign is a revelation. I am still reeling from this simple but, until now, evasive truth. The full impact of this realization may take ''years'' to settle in. Thanks for the discussions...

I've made a contribution, MechanismRichPolicyFree.

I've suggested a WikiInterchangeFormat.

I've written a WikiWikiClone - PyWiki - in the PythonLanguage. I've released it under the GnuGeneralPublicLicense and hope others will benefit from it in some way.
