Especially with gas hovering around $3.00/gallon in the US (I know, it's '''still''' cheaper than in the rest of the world), one would have thought that Wiki would have stayed in town this labor day, and gotten some housework done.

Instead, it apparently grabbed a towel and a bathing suit, jumped in the car, and sped off to the beach.  :)

At least it got back to the office on time on Tuesday.  :)

''I could be wrong, but '''my''' theory is that that's silly. :-)''

Hey, it's more interesting than "the server went down..."

* Although it's true the server went down.
**''No it didn't.''
* Yes, it did.
** ''No it didn't.''
* Yes, it did!
** ''Didn't.''
* Oh look, this isn't an argument.
** ''Yes it is.''
* No it isn't. It's just contradiction. An argument isn't just contradiction.  An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition.
** ''No it isn't.''
* Look, you just contradicted me.
** ''I did not.  By the way, are you here for a 1-hour session, or the 10-week course?''
* Just the one session.
** ''Are you sure?''
* Yes.
** ''No you're not.''
* Oh, this is futile! I've had enough of this.
** ''No you haven't.''
* I'm not prepared to pursue my line of inquiry any longer as I think this is getting too silly!
** ''Oh, right.  You want the Complaining course, which is three doors down.''

Quite agree, quite agree, too silly, far too silly. Come on, you, you've got to go do another page now!

Anybody want to try putting the above in DocumentMode? :-)

I don't care ''if'' Wiki Did Take Labor Day Weekend Off, I want to know ''why''!!!

* Because it was tired? Hey, even servers need a holiday!
* Because it was hit by a hurricane?
* Because Ward took a holiday?

''c2.com still responded to pings.''

* Must have been the result of a hangover then.  Responding to ICMP but ignoring HTTP requests is a server's way of saying "Oh, my head!  Go away and leave me alone!  And turn out the damn light, willya?"
