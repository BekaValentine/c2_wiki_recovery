Opposite of ReverseIndex.
----
The ForwardIndex is the look-up of the references made on the current page. It can include local as well as external references, and can include the topic spaces and category spaces which might exist in a PersonalWiki. For efficiency and flexibility one might construct this index at the time the page is changed. -- DonaldNoyes
