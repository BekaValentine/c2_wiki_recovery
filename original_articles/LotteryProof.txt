Could this be a solution for LotteryNumber?
Describe conditions and terms for LotteryProof. 

I bring in intellectual challenge.

And immediate feedback from users, maybe (smiles).

The conviction of working on something that is making a difference.

How about AppreciationOfIndividualAccomplishments (see under TeamsDontThink).

For me, a project is LotteryProof (that is, I won't leave if I can help it) if:

	* I enjoy my co-workers' company: they get my jokes, we enjoy talking to one another.  Doesn't mean we have to be close friends.

	* I perceive some beauty in the project.

	* I find the work intellectually stimulating.  Usually, this means we're doing something I haven't done before; ideally, we're doing something nobody has done before.

	* The team is making progress; I believe that we will ship a product near some known date.

	* The organization for which we are working is stable.  I am not worrying about whether the project will be cancelled, the company will go bankrupt, or half the team will be hired away.
