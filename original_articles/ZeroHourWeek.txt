After I have completed a piece of work and sold it successfully to two or three companies for internal use, I generally have a one or two years period of ZeroHourWeek, exactly doing nothing but just answering some calls when they happen. (Never get to a complete hour within a week)

Those days seem to be over though.

A ZeroHourWeek makes a lot of sense ''especially'' after a long period in which one cannot find the discipline necessary to employ the SustainablePace of an EightHourBurn, FortyHourWeek or whatever constitutes a reasonable balance.

This is also what you get when one of the following occurs:
* Retirement (forced or otherwise)
* When you are party to a Downsizing
* When a project is cancelled and persons working on it are not reassigned to potentially successful projects
* When work is outsourced to those managers feel will follow direction and produce results (possibly Out of Country)
* When on vacation and a so-called friend does you in.
* When one has enough financial security as to be able to stop working
* You are recipient of a financial windfall
