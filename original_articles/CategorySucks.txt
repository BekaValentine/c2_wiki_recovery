The use of the word 'sucks' in a page title has proven to be a useful way of sucking people into a discussion regarding strengths and weaknesses of whatever sucks.

With everything sucking so badly, it seems apt to have a new category devoted to things that suck.

CategorySucks sucks! :) Agree, my man!

SucksSucks

What sucks is when people say, "It's all about.....whatever"!  If I hear that one more time, I'm going postal!!  I mean, it's all about mental health.  What is "all about that"??  Huh??  What?? "It"??  What is "it"?? (As you can tell, I don't like that phrase very much.  It sucks.)

Shoot, I'm lost.  How do you get back to the beginning?  Anyone?  Anyone?  *sigh*  ...this sucks.
