The technology of the WikiWikiWeb allows people to make changes to some text, the same way a programmer patches program source code - a glance at the QuickDiff for a page will show this in action.

It seems that it isn't the technology that makes WardsWiki special, it's the loving care that the WikiMaster and his WikiGnome''''''s put into the patching.  Most of the ReallyValuablePages weren't woven in one pass, they are patchwork quilts so fine that you can't see the seams between the patches.  The edges meet neatly, and there is just enough thickness covering the whole area.  Some people call this DocumentMode, but it isn't always like that.
