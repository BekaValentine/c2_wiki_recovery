I love my green-and-ice deluxe, which I got for a birthday present this year after begging.  I'm holding out for the Innogear <http://www.innogear.com/> Six''''''Pax for my first Springboard module, though.  Of course, it wouldn't be anywhere near as cool if it didn't make extensive use of the PalmOs LessIsMore principle.

I had the Visor Deluxe, and then upgraded to Visor Prism(color). I am very happy with my purchase. In conjunction with OmniSky Internet service, I think they are the best available handhelds on the market. They use the PalmOs platform, with thousands of free and low-cost applications, and a relatively low price on the hardware as well. The color display on the Prism is beautiful, too. --JoshuaBaran

Unfortunately, CDPD (which the Minstrel S-based services use) isn't anywhere near as widespread as voice cellular, meaning OmniSky is quite useless unless you stay near large metropolitan areas.

The Visorphone is a Springboard expansion module for the HandspringVisor that turns it into a cellphone.

Has anyone here gotten one? -- DavidCorbin

''If it were cheaper, I might.  Man, that thing's expensive.''

And now it's cheaper.  $49, but you can only get it with Voice''''''Stream service in my area.  Not sure what other areas have available to them.
