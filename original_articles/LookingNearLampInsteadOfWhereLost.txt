One of my favorite tech metaphors is based on the following joke:

A: What are doing here under the lamp-post, son?

B: Why, I'm looking for my watch.

A: Where do you think you lost it?

B: I'm pretty sure I lost it in the park.

A: Isn't the park three blocks away?

B: Yes, it is.

A: So, why are looking here?

B: Because the light is better here.
