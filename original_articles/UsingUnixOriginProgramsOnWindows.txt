I am involved in UsingUnixOriginProgramsonWindows.

I am currently using Tcl (windows version) to develop various applications. I think that it had a considerable potential for solving a number of problems.

There are plenty of programs, tools and books. Many of the programs are provided in the form of binaries which will run in the windows environment, which is a common one to find in engineering, as opposed to computer science, within a university.

The problem areas are those of installation and the use of auxiliary tools and commands. Both these items often need separate treatment in the different application areas, because the organization of the environments is so different.

This is where culture comes in. That is why, when I started the pages called UnixCulture and TheNotUnixCulture (which I took to be Windows and Macintosh mainly), I was really concerned about explanations of the auxiliary tools and simple things like where to put files when installing things.

I regard WikiWiki and TheTclersWiki as really good places where users and incoming developers can feed back to those who originated the tools how it feels to try to make use of them.

I belong in two other cultures which are quite different and I will describe later as it is time for me to go home for my tea. They are TheDownloadCulture and TheChemicalEngineeringCulture.

I will log them here as they arise. I wrote the text above in July.

I am currently trying to get StlPort to work using SymantecCpp. It is obvious that it has been used with this compiler, but the information I have is insufficient for me to get a complex macro system to work to access the header files of the compiler. In here there is the difference of / and \ in paths in UNIX and DOS.
