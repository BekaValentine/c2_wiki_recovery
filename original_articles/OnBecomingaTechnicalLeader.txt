''On Becoming a Technical Leader'' by Gerald M. Weinberg

----

The title is a deliberate play on OnBecomingaLeader by WarrenBennis. Jerry talks a lot about how one leads from a technical position, with his usual clarity. Also a strong bias toward seeing the work situation as a system, and an emphasis on individuals.

The book deserves mention because it's definition of leadership is as compelling as DeMarco's from PeopleWare: "A leader creates a context in which others can succeed."
