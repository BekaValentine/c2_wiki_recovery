Kyle Cordes is a software developer / consultant / trainer in St. Louis, MO.  His web site includes only a few pages of crass commercialism, and many pages of content (hopefully!) of interest to developers:

	* The "BDE Alternative Guide" for Delphi developers.

	* The "JBuilder Open Tools Repository" for JBuilder users.

	* Thoughts on software development, including XP.
