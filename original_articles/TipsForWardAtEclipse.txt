* IBM recently "donated" a bunch of stuff it got from Rational when it bought them to the Eclipse Foundation. For the love of all things computer, do everything you can to prevent any of that code from being incorporated into the Eclipse core. ''What's wrong with it? Any supporting evidence?''
* Could the Eclipse foundation be more fun? It feels like it's corporate, perhaps legacy of being an IBM project. The Mozilla community knows how to be funny: http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50349
* On the topic of businesses, how many people feel like too many of the extensions and additions to the Eclipse project are Marketechiture, driven by the companies that have joined the Eclipse project? Take BIRT for example. Please.
* Please make it easier for people to write plug-ins!


Make sure they don't forget Eclipse's Smalltalk roots! This is the first development environment that can rival ParcPlace's. Particularly with respect to navigating ridiculously complicated object hierarchies and writing your code in the debugger, if you are so inclined (Extremist Programming?)

Extremist Programmers don't use debuggers
