The Marx Brothers were a product of the US vaudeville era, which produced some of the best comedy of all time.

The Viaduct dialog from "The Coconuts" is still one of the funniest word play skits I have ever heard.

To wit:

	'''Groucho''':	You're a peach, boy! Now, here is a little peninsula, and here is a viaduct leading over to the mainland.
	'''Chico''':	Why a duck?
	'''Groucho''':	I'm all right. How are you? I say here is a little peninsula, and here's a viaduct leading over to the mainland.
	'''Chico''':	All right. Why a duck?
	'''Groucho''':	I'm not playing Ask-Me-Another. I say, that's a viaduct.
	'''Chico''':	All right. Why a duck? Why a why a duck? Why a no chicken?
