I have long been a fan of this site.

Having worked a long time in industry at the sharp end of application development, I am now an aspiring Java educator and author.

My contact details can be found at http://www.jbridge.co.uk ( please update your contact details - BrokenLink )

I shall be back here to learn (frequently), and hope to contribute when I have something useful to say.
