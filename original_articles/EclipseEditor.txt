[EditHint: MergeMe with EclipseIde ]

----
The features of Eclipse I use the most:

	* Built in refactorings tools
	* CVS Client
	* Built in ANT and JUnit tools

If you want to do something that Eclipse does not do by default, you can find several plugins. For plugins, visit http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net/eclipse/index.jsp.

Also check http://download2.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/R-2.1-200303272130/whats-new-all.html for some of the salient features in 2.1.

''And if it can code-complete entire statements of JavaLanguage for you, then exactly what is the ''_language_'' for??'' --PhlIp


1) Languages aren't write-only. Longer statements can make the code easier to read.
2) Just because it can code-complete the most common statement doesn't mean those are the only statements you use.

And it contains code-templates. With these code-templates, you can define often used code-snippets like for-loops or for-iterations. Just press Ctrl-Space. I like it.

I am eternally grateful to Eclipse for researching the usability features which have since appeared in VisualStudio. -- PhlIp
