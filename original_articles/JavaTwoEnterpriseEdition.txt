Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE), a Java platform from Sun. See http://java.sun.com/j2ee/.

J2EE includes technologies like: EnterpriseJavaBeans, JavaServerPages, and JavaServlets.

* How is it different from J2SE (standard edition)? I am under impression it has server technology as well? If J2SE has application server components, then what is the additional features offered by J2EE? What is the breakdown of customer base (percent) between J2SE and J2EE? What migration paths available?
** J2SE contains certain APIs and frameworks: Swing, java.io, etc. J2EE specifies that certain additional ones ''must'' be supplied by the environment: transactions, a persistence engine, etc. To do this, vendors build J2EE "containers" which are (usually) Java applications that supply these additional services, as well as libraries available on the system classpath, and so on. 

There is a book called the SunCertifiedEnterpriseArchitect...
* probably should try JavaTutorial first before buying books

EjbTwo is the starting point for V2 of JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition for this wiki

'''J2EE landscape'''

''Different implementations become separate competing products (Feb05)''
* "The battleground is evolving to .Net vs. IBM's WebSphere, BEA Systems Inc.'s WebLogic and SAP AG's NetWeaver. as opposed to .Net vs. J2EE" from http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/appdev/story/0,10801,96955,00.html

For BigIron shops that use BigBlue their needs are well taken care of, if they have the budget. See for example, EnterpriseJavaBeansInCics as the bridging mechanism.

'''JavaEnterpriseEdition version 1.4'''

This is the starting base where SunCorporation got to join and deploy the MicroSoft / IbmCorporation led WebServices developments in SoapProtocol, WebServicesDescriptionLanguage, etc. See Aug03 article at http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/12/HNwsiprofile_1.html

I also recommend the J2EE Bible (The 1.4 Edition) published by John Wiley and Sons
