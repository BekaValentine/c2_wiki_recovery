''...one of the most highly regarded and expertly designed C++ library projects in the world.''
* HerbSutter and AndreiAlexandrescu, C++ Coding Standards

''from the site ...''

The Boost web site provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard Library. The libraries are intended to be widely useful, and are in regular use by thousands of programmers across a broad spectrum of applications.

A further goal is to establish "existing practice" and provide reference implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. Ten Boost libraries will be included in TheCppStandardsCommittee's upcoming C++ Standard Library TechnicalReportOne as a step toward becoming part of a future C++ Standard.

Although Boost was begun by members of TheCppStandardsCommittee Library Working Group, participation has expanded...

Boost has its own WikiWeb: http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl.

Many of the libraries are HeaderOnlyCeePlusPlusPackages.
----
The BoostLibraries are maintained using GitVersionControl with a set of submodules, one for each library and tool. See also GitWorkFlow.

'''Versions'''

Boost is not static and all the time new libraries are being added to it. An open peer review process is used to assess each addition. Also, work is carried out to expand the range of compilers which will run Boost. Libraries included have to be maintained to remove bugs and also accomodate new compilers. There is always work in progress and it takes some time between approval of a new library and when it appears in a release.

Boost libraries transform the CeePlusPlus experience and are a major contributor to LateCeePlusPlus's unique character.
----
It is interesting from the above list of releases that Boost has continued to develop over a long period. I think that the peer review process is an example of a working CommunityOfTrust of the sort which JimCoplien wrote about on this wiki in 1996. -- JohnFletcher

''' Libraries'''

There is a great wealth of cool libraries available here; Boost should always be double-checked before creating your own library. The libraries page http://boost.org/libs/libraries.htm lists the following categories. For more information, see '''http://boost.org/libs/libraries.htm#Category'''.

* String and text processing
* Containers
* Iterators
* Algorithms
* Function Objects and higher-order programming
* Generic Programming
* Template Metaprogramming
* Preprocessor Metaprogramming
* Concurrent Programming
* Math and numerics
* Correctness and testing
* Data structures
* Input/Output
* Inter-language support
* Memory
* Parsing
* Miscellaneous
* Broken compiler workarounds
