Not to be confused with RobinWilliams the author(ess).

''The following all from memory ...''

Robin Williams (the actor) has starred in many roles. His big break was in a minor role as MorkFromOrk in HappyDays, and then went on to his own series, MorkAndMindy, with PamDawber.

Major films include TheWorldAccordingToGarp, GoodMorningVietnam, MrsDoubtfire, DeadPoetsSociety, FernGully (VoiceTalent), TheBirdcage, PatchAdams, GoodWillHunting, JakobTheLiar, AwakeningsFilm, JumanjiFilm, FlubberFilm, AladdinFilm and many others. When he's good he's very, very good. When he's bad it can be excruciating. His choice of film has not always been great.

One of his most recent films is the very good OneHourPhoto.

Shouldn't this be RobinWilliamsTheComedian?
