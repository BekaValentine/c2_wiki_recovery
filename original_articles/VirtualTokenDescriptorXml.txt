'''Virtual''''''Token''''''Descriptor''''''''' (VTD) is a page on a proposed JavaLanguage based Xml API and claimed to be markedly superior to existing DocumentObjectModel or SimpleApiForXml (SaxDriver) based methods.

An Oct2004 article exists at http://www.devx.com/xml/Article/22219?trk=DXRSS_WEBDEV that gives extra information.

According to the SourceForge site, this set of "protocol"? achieves its performance gains by achieving the "parse once, use many-times" ideal. It is touted to be inherently persistent and is well suited for hardware implementation into network switches and routers. See more at http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net/faq.html

''Interested to hear from people who can share their experience and viewpoints on this NextBigThing for Xml. For example, if it is so good then we expect an equivalent scheme to be made available for the DotNet environment? And what about the needs of legacy VbClassic developers dabbling with Xml based applications?''
