A nickname for a seemingly obscure feature switch or setting that "magically fixes" something. For example, a web-page that displays as blank unless the user (or technician) explicitly adds the page's site to the "Trusted Sites" list in InternetExplorer. A user wouldn't typically know about such steps.
