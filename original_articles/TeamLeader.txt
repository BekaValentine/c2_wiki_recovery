A TeamLeader is an experienced SoftwareEngineer who has some responsibility for the development activity of other engineers. It is usually seen as a technical role rather than managerial. The TeamLeader would usually have some development activity of their own.

A good TeamLeader needs to be able to do GuruingByWalkingAround. When a team member has a problem, they expect their TeamLeader to be able to suggest a way forward. The TeamLeader should always be available to answer questions.

Team leadership and project management can be usefully understood as a ''service to the team''. This is especially so in environments like the one here at Keane were TL's are both technical leads and line-management. --KeithBraithwaite
