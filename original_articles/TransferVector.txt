A TransferVector is used to communicate between domains or subsystems. It is best designed to minimize inter-domain knowledge or dependency. E.G., using a Java Array''''''List as the mechanism for communicating between the database access layer and the next tier of an n-tier system. Another good example would be a SOAP server.
