Ignore the risk and trust to luck that we get away with it.

RiskEvasion is in contrast to RiskAvoidance in a similar fashion to tax evasion and tax avoidance.

Strictly, it's only RiskEvasion if we actually do get away with it. If we don't our project just goes down as another victim of risk. HandWaving features heavily in this strategy. The phrase, "it's a calculated risk" may well be employed, which means: it's a risk but I can't be bothered to calculate it.
