A WikiMentor has the MentorRole in a wiki environment. It is important to have people who review wiki edits and whose role is to watch how the wiki is developing. This could be considered more of a job than the role of a WikiMaster. This should be somebody wiki users can ask. If he is wise he does not take an overly active role, but if he feels he needs to act, he should. This is somebody who does the refactor work that many users do not like to do and maybe not many people are able to RefactoringWikiPages.
