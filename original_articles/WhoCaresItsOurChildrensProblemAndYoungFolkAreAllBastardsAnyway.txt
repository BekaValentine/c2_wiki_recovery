Sorry, unless you're planning to pop off within the next 25 years, the likelihood is that KillAllHumans is '''your''' problem. And there are many solutions that are already too late to implement. Which is sort of how we got in this mess in the first place.

''Phew! That's all right then, as I'll be quite old 25 years from now.''

Seems like it's the old folk who are the bastards. It's this attitude that caused TheBottleneck ... maybe the solution is to TorchOldPeoplesHomes. Well, not a solution, but it might give us young bastards a laugh.

Political FutureDiscounting? Sounds logical to me.

''But seriously, TheBottleneck has been created by HumanNature, which is to say by the nature of a top predator. We don't care what we eat, so long as there's food. We don't care what happens to our prey, so long as there's food. We don't care about the rest of the ecosystem, so long as there's food. And if there's no food, heck, let's move some place where there's food. No such place? Ahhh! We're doomed!!!''

Would you believe a NatureTax?
