This is a WikiSuggestion for a modification to Wiki that would implement a sort of unit-test on DocumentRefactoring.

The suggestion is best explained by an example:   Suppose we say that 3 votes are required to validate a change to a page. Then, when someone changes a page by deleting paragraph A and adding paragraph B, the next 3 people to view the page will still see paragraph A in strike-through text (to indicate that it is being deleted) and paragraph B in highlighted text (to indicate that it is new).  Any other "diff" representation wll also suffice.  These 3 people will be asked to vote on whether or not the changes stay true to the original intent of the page. After all 3 have voted "yes" the changes go into effect so that the fourth person to view the page does not see paragraph A (and paragraph B is not highlighted). If anyone votes "no" the page automatically reverts to its original.

Really, this is just a shortcut to speed up what already happens: if a malicious editor wrecks a page, a benevolent editor will recover the page from archives. But by making this process part of the software, it becomes more automatic, like a unit-test for refactored code.  --MichaelRoss
