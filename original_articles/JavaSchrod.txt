I've been programming for decades; Java, since 1999.  I really like Java and the OO paradigm.  I want to be productive.

I've got opinions, see XpJobs and JobTitles.

	 :	''As he prepared to catch his flight to Boston, the traveller's colleague advised him to try the fish there; "In particular, the schrod is excellent."  On arrival in Boston, the traveller hailed a cab and asked the driver, "Where can I get schrod?".  The driver was silent for a moment then replied, "Buddy, I've heard that question a million times, but never in the pluperfect subjunctive."''

Where did the 'h' come from. It was always 'scrod' in the primaeval forms of the joke
