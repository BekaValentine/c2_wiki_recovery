"Concurrent Programs are notoriously difficult to get right. This book provides a systematic and practical approach to designing, analyzing and implementing concurrent programs. Concurrency concepts and techniques are introduced and illustrated using both state models and Java programs. The design models enable concurrent behavior to be animated, mechanically analyzed and then implemented in programs." -- Amazon review
