PHP Wikis

There are a growing number of Wikis written in PHP, the PhpHypertextPreprocessor scripting language. See the PHP section in WikiEngines for more.

Here is a list of "active" PHP WikiWiki sites as of June 28, 2003:
	* PhpWiki (1MB+ download with 600 files, GPL, flat files, should be comprehensive but wow, 600 files?).
	* WikkiTikkiTavi (29K & 40 files, GPL, many reference links, the latest is version .25 on Source Forge MySQL. Really nice). The instructions are sparse, but there a lot of sites using it.
	* PhikiWiki (Small 6-8 program files, flat files, but it wanted to write outside of it's directory -- which I don't allow, but their demo did look nice).
	* CoTeia (Links off to a site in Brazil (.br) & is in Portuguese).
	* PukiWiki (Japanese site).
	* WikiPedia (Probably overkill for most sites... GPL, MySQL, but be warned, it has a lot of hard-coded strings and features specific to the Wikipedia encyclopedia.)
	* ErfurtWiki (450K download, very few files, Public Domain, flat files, dbm or mysql/postgres, Funky plugin interface, extensive documentation.)
	* AnotherPHPWiki (more info here?)
	* WakkaWiki (272K 40 files BSD? license, MySQL, very easy install)
	* PmWiki (Nice features, easy install)
	* BlenderWiki (This one links to a web site in the Netherlands (.nl) won't come up).
	* BlastWiki (Links to a page stating BlastWiki in no more).

It's hard to search for pages that are actually ''about'' PHP, since many URLs contain ".php" - so this Category should be more useful than most. Or in Google you can try adding intext:php to your query.

Volunteer categorizers are always welcome; start here: http://www.c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?search=php
