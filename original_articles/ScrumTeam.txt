In the ScrumProcess, the ScrumTeam is SevenPlusOrMinusTwo people who organize themselves around a SprintGoal.  This is the group of people who do the work in Scrum.  Everyone who is on the team is equally committed to meeting the goal, and is held equally responsible.  You should never hear "That's not my job, I just write documentation" on a ScrumTeam.  Testers, documentation authors, coders, sysadmins, whoever else may be needed to achieve the goal: they're all part of the team.

The team is empowered to do whatever is needed to meet the goal.  During the ScrumSprint they only have two requirements:  attend the DailyScrum meeting and update the SprintBacklog.
