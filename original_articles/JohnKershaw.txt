John Kershaw lives in Shipley, UK (http://www.shipley.org.uk), and is using phpwiki for:

	* Burley Green: http://www.burleygreen.com - Leeds 4 community site
	* Bradford Christian School: http://bradfordchristianschool.com - where I teach on Fridays 
	* http://www.peditors.com - for users of PaulComputing's 'pedit' Palm OS text editor (http://paulcomputing.com)

In fact, I've had such good experiences with these wikis that I've set up Site''''''Writer.net to create wikis for people who want a wiki site but don't have the know-how to do it themselves (http://www.sitewriter.net).

'''Regarding graffiti'''

I have seen some very beautiful (and other less beautiful, to me, but still expressive) art written on walls. I've also seen people decide to leave their homes and our community because someone else thought it was okay to scrawl their name across every flat surface. That makes me sad. -- JohnKershaw
