Hey EverQuest fans, here's a never-ending game!

 #!/usr/bin/python
 print "Yes?"
 while 1:
	raw_input()
	print "I don't understand."
Play with the computer until you're convinced that it truly does not understand.

Now it's back to real life, people problems, or TheLastComputerGame.

I once made a program (in GW-BASIC) for my little brother like this:

 while 1:
        print "Talk to the monster --> "
	raw_input()
	print "Grrrrrr!!"
For about half an hour he thought it was the most fascinating thing ever invented.
