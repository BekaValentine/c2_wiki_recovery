A Cmaps Server allows collective mindmapping for comfortably interfacing of Wikis.

Somebody here, who wants to engage as a server provider. The client and the server software is free. It is already used on thousands of edu institutions, but now IHMC opens itself to build a Cmappers community beyond
the WalledGarden of educational institutions and Academia.
