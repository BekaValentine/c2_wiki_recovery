[There used to be a from-marketing-for-management type of advertisement here, with IMHO very low signal/noise. For those who want it, I've still got a copy. The above is just an attempt to summarize the interesting bits. I'm also not sure the information is correct - for example, I always that that PowerTier was the EJB thingie. Somebody please correct/confirm this, if possible. Afterwards, please delete this comment here. --FalkBruegmann, 2002-08-29]
