PageDiscovery is when you happen upon a really interesting discussion on a page you've never seen before because someone put a new edit on it after it hadn't been touched for a year. -- AlanFrancis

This works for RecentChanges junkies.  Alternatives include:

* RandomPages
* http:wiki?search=$ (from WikiList) gives the (very big) alphabetical list of all titles.
** To save server and download time it might make sense to save a local copy to be reused.

It also helps RecentChangesJunkie''''''s to use RandomPages and then touching those that seem worthy of attention. Like this one.
