Teamwave is a commercial product that grew out of the GroupKit CSCW work at the University of Calgary. 

It is a TCL-based client-server system that runs on Macintosh, UNIX and Windows 95/NT.

The basic paradigm is a series of shared rooms, each of which is represented by a whiteboard on which participants can draw or write or paste applet instances. 
* The rooms are persistent and can be used interactively or asynchronously.
** Like WikiWikiWeb anyone can edit the materials placed on the whiteboard by other people.
