''This is a page of celebration '' DonaldNoyes.20110711
----
It is a recognition of this wiki's achievement of accumulating 35,000 plus pages on July 10, 2011, having existed since around 1995-1996 (See WikiHistory) or about sixteen years. 
----
The use of the internet and its social communication abilities have changed in dramatic ways since then.  It is now not uncommon for two people, or a group of people, from ordinary desktop, laptops, or handhelds to communicate in NearRealTime from nearly any populated region in the world, using video, audio and data modes to transfer information in the same time slots, while using their devices for other things during the exchange.
----
During that period of transition, this wiki has remained a dependable, consistantly available locale for the interchange of information, techniques, methodologies and for general collaboration on a number of projects and subjects. 
----
It has maintained this ability by the use of a simple method of hyperlinking via WikiWords and other text located in pages with a MeaningfulName, most often descriptive of the subject or message of the page. Ward has maintained this reliability by establishing an initial philosophy of Using TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork. Best Wishes to WardCunningham , from a grateful bunch of WikiZens, who say ThankYou. 

This page was constructed as the 34997th page on (20110706) in anticipation of the event which took place four days later. (20110710) -- DonaldNoyes

Thank you Donald for making this page. I also want to join the celebration, not only of this wiki and WardCunningham but also all the other things which have come about using the idea of wiki. -- JohnFletcher
