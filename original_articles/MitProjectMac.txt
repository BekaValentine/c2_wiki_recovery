''Project MAC''

''MIT Project MAC, suggested by J.C.R. Licklider, was the organization that began the research that led to Multics. It is now called the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science. "MAC" was an acronym: MIT Project on '''M'''athematics '''A'''nd '''C'''omputation ''

''[Kenneth Flamm] Project MAC was a large and well-funded effort. Its initial grant from DARPA for a little over $2 million per year was quickly raised. Funding peaked at $4.3 million in 1969, slumped to under $3 million in 1973, and rose again in the late 1970s. Project MAC's research staff peaked in 1967 at 400.''
