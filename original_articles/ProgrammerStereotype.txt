I searched for JrandomCoder, but couldn't find it. Because this category was strangely missing. 
Well here it is. I added some to the list.

See e.g. 
* http:wiki?search=coder
* http:wiki?search=programmer

I added this tag to quite a lot of these and I have to say, that there is quite some redundancy or at least a very wide and finely filled range of types (from idiot over average to good and grand master).
