The intent of the project founder, StephaneDucasse, is to create a professional SmalltalkLanguage IDE that supports his computer science research.  The project has attracted some Squeak users, including the SeasideFramework project, which, as of 2009, is now developed using Pharo.

1.0 beta was released in July 2009.

The current stable version is Pharo 3.0 (as of May 2014).
