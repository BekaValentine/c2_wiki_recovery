I begin to think I'm imagining it, but am I right that there's a large Waterstone's bookshop in the Burlington shopping mall, where I purchased the book TheQuantumSelf a few years back?  I live a few minutes walk away from where Waterstone's started, in Hampstead in London, and I suddenly wonder if my mind (quantum or otherwise) is playing strange tricks on me. -- RichardDrake
