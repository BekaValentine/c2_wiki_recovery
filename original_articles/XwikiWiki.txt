Before building XWiki, I have been a long time user of TWiki which has been a great source of inspiration for XWiki. I'm also very impressed by the work done on SnipSnap (and Radeox, which is used in XWiki) as well as AtlassianConfluence (although I regret it is not open-source). -- LudovicDubost in 2003
