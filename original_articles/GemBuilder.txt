GemBuilder for Smalltalk

GemBuilder for Smalltalk is the Smalltalk client interface to the GemStone object server. It provides a relatively transparent interface to server Smalltalk objects. Objects are either replicated from the server to the client, or messages to server objects are transparently forwarded.

see http://www.ipass.net/~vmalik/gemstone.html for a pretty good FAQ.

GemBuilder for Java

GemBuilder for Java is a Java client interface to server Smalltalk objects. From a Java client one can send messages to server Smalltalk objects. The results of a server message send is either a complex or simple object. For complex objects, a proxy is returned to the client. For simple objects ( integers, floats, strings ... ) the objects value is returned to the client.

It is possible to build customized marshalling and de-marshalling logic for your Java and Smalltalk objects to make this more transparent.

GemBuilder Java also provides GemStone programming tools including class browsers, work spaces and debuggers.
