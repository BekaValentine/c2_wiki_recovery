MAGMA is a library of routines for LinearAlgebra which make it easy to combine use of GeneralPurposeGraphicsProcessUnits (GPGPUs) with computation on the CPU. In particular, it makes it easy to adapt programs which make use of the LinearAlgebraPackage (LAPACK).

'''Current Version (May 2012): 1.2.0'''

The library makes use of ComputeUnifiedDeviceArchitecture (CUDA).

Performance can be improved by also using OpenBlas to improve the performance on the CPU.

The main interface is to CeeCeePlusPlus and there is also an interface to FortranLanguage.
