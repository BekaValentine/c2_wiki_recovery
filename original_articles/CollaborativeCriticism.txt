CollaborativeCriticism is using a community to examine and potentially produce better understanding of a writing, work, missive, political speech, debate, law, media article, etc....

It is especially important if the community is in some way out of balance with the author of the work.

I have some fragile code based on a UseModWiki running at http://drf5n.freeshell.org/piki.cgi

I see it as using the power of a wiki to enable many eyes to make small criticisms and feedbacks to public speeches and policies. I also see it as kinder, more useful, and ultimately more effective than the blogger practice of Fisking: If 10-100 people research, criticise, and collect their arguments in a wiki focused on a political statement, business, media publication, or journalist, the criticism is likely to be of high level, and the original writer would have to take notice.

DavidBrin's "The Transparent Society" made me see wikis as a possible method for ensuring accountability of the powerful.
