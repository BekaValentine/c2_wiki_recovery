''('''Hmm.''' I sincerely doubt this is'' the ''Iain Howe of'' The Culture ''fame. Probably just something created by a foaming-at-the-mouth literature fan.)''

There's an Iain Howe of "The Culture" fame now? Although come to think of it I 'am' a foaming-at-the-mouth lit fan, I'm also Iain Howe... I suspect you're mistaking Iain Howe for Iain Banks. We share the same first name and that's about it.
