http://andysocial.com/wiki is the home of GiikiWiki.

GiikiWiki is a really bad play on homophones and also a fine place to chart geek hobbies.

Started in 2004, GiikiWiki's primary weapon is IMINT.  And GIS.  Its two primary weapons are IMINT and GIS.  And multimedia.  And a fanatical devotion to the pope.

Among GiikiWiki's diverse categories are computer graphics, multimedia, computer and non-computer gaming, imagery intelligence, and geographic information systems.

No one expects the Spanish Inquisition.
