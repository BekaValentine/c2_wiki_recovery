Some info from the blog of EricNiebler:
* ''The C++ community is suffering from the loss of the cpp-next.com website and all the great content that was once hosted there. In the past 2 months, I’ve gotten many questions both about the site and about the fate of my “Expressive C++” article series. In response, I will re-post my old articles '''on this blog''':

But I’m busy and it’ll take time. In the meanwhile, if you have a desperate need for a readable introduction to Boost.Proto and domain-specific embedded languages in C++, and you don’t mind reading raw markdown, email me. I’ll send you what I have.''
