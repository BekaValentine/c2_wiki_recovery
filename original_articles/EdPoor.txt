I'm a software engineer interested in improving the development process - especially mine! I also like JavaLanguage, reading and music. 

I would L-O-V-E to find an XP project to work on.

Not to be confused with Edouard Poor, who also reads the wiki, but does not have a personal page on it.

Old Talk:

I am a new user of Wiki, and I just can't believe you let J. Random User do whatever the heck he wants with your server. How do you stop vandals? 

Anyway, I see an old friend Tom Leylan is here . . . 

Welcome to WardsWiki, BigMetalGuy. Could we convince you to use RealNamesPlease? Thanks, and best regards, -- RandyStafford. 

Sure, I'm Ed Poor. (Should I make an EdPoor page?) 

Yes. Then you can replace the entire text of this page with the word delete, and the wiki server will delete this page. 

Wow, that's scary. How does such anarchy work? (I'm a refugee from UseNet, where all discussions I care about degenerate into flame wars, so I really want to know :-) 

Depending on how long you've been on UseNet, you probably remember "acceptable use policies".  At least, we used to have them back in the 1980s when I spent time on comp.lang.smalltalk, etc. Well, WardsWiki runs on a similar principle.  The acceptable use policy is loosely documented in various places, and quite well adhered to by the WikiCommunity. There is the occasional flame war, but goodwill generally prevails here. And, believe it or not, WardsWiki is really not anarchic - it is fairly well self-organized and self-moderated. And it has been vandalized only once or twice in its six-year existence, as far as I know. Content can be restored from backup in such an event. -- RandyStafford

Editing for posterity.

''"Self-organized and self-moderated"... sounds like anarchy to me! --WilliamUnderwood, who'll see himself out now :)''
