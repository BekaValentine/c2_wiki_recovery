A novel by RobertHeinlein

Title taken from (or referring to, however you want to look at it) Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem ''Ulysses''.

Relevant excerpt (lines 58-61):

 Push off, and sitting well in order smite
 The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
 To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
 Of all the western stars, until I die.
