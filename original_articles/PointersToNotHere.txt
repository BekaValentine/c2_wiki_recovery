''Pointers To Not Here '' -- ThinkingOutLoud DonaldNoyes 20071030

This is a class of pointers which exist to indicate the lack of a pointed to State, Object, Reference, or Method.

It is initially a Pointer to Nowhere and has no champion, being only a notation.

It becomes actionable only when it is provided a destination or fulfillment by one who accepts, or is assigned the responsibility of action.

It is useful because it announces that something is missing.

''I think I know what this is supposed to mean but it really is formulated too abstract/fluffy.''

This is what ThinkingOutLoud is. (Abstract, Structural, Not fully developed, suggestive) I mean for the idea to be abstract. In this way it covers more objects, much in the way classes do.  

''[Indeed.  The above certainly raises the bar on WoodenLanguage.  Wouldn't the description be much clearer if it were replaced with a statement like, "These tags indicate pages in need of further work or attention," and perhaps change the page title to something meaningful like PageNeedsWork or CategoryNeedsAttention?]''  See Below (Plain Language Instances)
