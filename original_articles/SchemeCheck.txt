Scheme-Check is a port of Haskell's QuickCheck tool for PltScheme. 

All of the functionality of the original tool is present, though there are some stylistic differences. 

Scheme-Check was a first shot at porting QuickCheck for other languages, because I sincerely believe that the testing model it provides is significantly superior to traditional TestDrivenDevelopment. With QuickCheck, you do not test individual cases. Instead, you state general properties and the tool takes care of generating random test cases for the properties. -- CarlosScheidegger
