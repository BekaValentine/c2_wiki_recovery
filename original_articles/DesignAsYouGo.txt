A D''''''esignMethod where design is interactive, where the designer interacts with the design, perceiving it and comparing it to a template or a mental image of its I''''''maginedDesign, making adjustments to both.

The A''''''ctionPursued is to make the design approach the image. It is more like fashioning an object like a blob of clay rather than applying different colors of paint to a canvas, even though some facets of both creative works are included.

The imagined or real pattern, being it a figure, like model, or a sketch, or  an outline, or a bunch of CRC cards or stories, or an image clearly or not so clearly imagined in your mind is compared with the W''''''orkingInstance of that image.
Then adjustments, rearrangements, dependencies, interactions, and appearances are applied to reshape the W''''''orkingModel.

It is the application of C''''''ontinuousTesting of the imagined with the real, the pattern with the object created from it.
It does however have the added dimension and complication of a C''''''hangingPattern or Model. The D''''''esignRequirements, the U''''''serRequirements, the P''''''rocessRequirements, the E''''''nvironmentRequirements, will change, forcing adjustments and modifications in the O''''''ngoingDesign.
