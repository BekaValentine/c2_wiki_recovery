A GoodUrl is one that is ShortAndSweet

----

Basically, most URLs have a lot of unnecessary junk that isn't needed. Also, many are using forum parameters (query strings) where they shouldn't apply, such as to define a page on a CMS or Wiki.

1. Forum parameters should only be used for parameters, not to represent regular pages. This means no ?StuffLikeThis or ?page=StuffLikeThat. Use the RewriteEngine with a proper RewriteRule on ApacheServer.

2. FilenameExtensions are unnecessary. Servers like ApacheServer have ways to find the internal file that represents the request. So no ''index.html'' where ''index'' would suffice. (''index'' would server-side load ''index.html'')

3. What about cgi, cgi-bin in URLs? RewriteRule 'em out!?

Are Wiki URLs good URIs? What is preferred?
* http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GoodUrl ''-- Good''
* http://c2.com/cgi/wiki/GoodUrl ''-- Better''
* http://c2.com/wiki/GoodUrl
* http://wiki.c2.com/GoodUrl ''Nice!''
* http://c2.com/GoodUrl
* http://c2.com/GoodURL
* http://GoodUrl.c2.com  -- is there a wiki that puts each page into a (virtual) subdomain?!? ''-- Bad''
