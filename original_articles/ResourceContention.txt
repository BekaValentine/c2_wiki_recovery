One problem that appears when using LockBasedSynchronization.

Most processes try to hold a single lock. The lock is held only by one process at a time, but while a process is holing the lock, there are several others waiting for the lock.

What would normally execute very fast is executing very slow because the concurrent threads or processes are all serialized by the access to this shared resource.
