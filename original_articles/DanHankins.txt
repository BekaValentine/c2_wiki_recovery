'''Projects'''

This is a a subset of the list as on my web page; 
provided here to invite discussion of the topics.  If anyone is 
interested in seeing more information on any of these, let me know and
I'll expand them here or make pages for them.

'''Completed:'''

	S''''''tatSort:	Algorithm that in practice sorts numeric keys in O(n) time (worst-case performance is O(nlogn)).  It works by doing a numeric integration of a histogram of the keys in order to predict key placement in the sorted output.
	HISM:	Hankins Incremental Storage Manager
	 :	A Modula-2 library for automatic incremental garbage collection.  Meant for use where responsiveness trumps performance.  You can find it at Google Groups with search terms "hism hankins".  I'd like to know what other people think of the "percolation" algorithm.
	QDFC:	Quick and Dirty Flash Cards.  A SpikeSolution for making a memorization program modelled after flashcards, with an algorithm to optimize re-presentation of missed cards.

'''Current:'''
	R''''''ecallMaster:	Commercial version of QDFC.  Using single-person version of ExtremeProgramming process (ExtremeProgrammingForOne).

'''Future:'''
	S''''''uperToDo:	To-Do program incorporating dependencies and floating priorities.
	XPWorkFlow:	Automation of the ExtremeProgramming process
	jDROOL:	Java-based library for experimentation with ObjectOriented semantics such as futures, prototypes and delegation, among others
	OOVM:	Virtual machine with object-oriented architecture; instead of memory addressing, object addressing.  Instead of instructions, messages.  If someone's already done this, please point me at it and slap me upside the head.
	Neoterica:	Artificial Life virtual machine and ancestor.  Instruction set and ancestor are done, what's next is implementation and visualization.
