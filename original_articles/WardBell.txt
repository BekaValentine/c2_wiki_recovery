I'm Ward Bell, a marketing and business development consultant with a growing interest in applying information technology tools to the needs of my clients.

Of particular interest is the exploration of highly interactive processes like those being used on this site.

I need to learn a bit more of the protocol and then will come back to add/edit this page.

Still have not learned enough of the protocol to contribute, but have good intentions now that DenhamGrey has encouraged me.

Greetings Ward,

I think you will find this system has some significant advantages for 'cleaning up' conversations, annealing, developing unique indexing systems and allowing the emergence of very interesting social protocols. I'm looking forward to exploring this further with you and PeterMurchland. -- Denham
