A campaign in the 1980s by the BusinessSoftwareAlliance to discourage software piracy. Very dated ads and now ridiculed.

The campaign has strong parallels to contemporary efforts to discourage music piracy.

Software has proven very resistant to piracy, perhaps because of, or resulting in the success of the OpenSource movement. Whether the same is true of music and movies is unknown.
