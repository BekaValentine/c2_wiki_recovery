Hi, I'm a GraphicsWeeny at the MathWorks. 

Previously an architect of a visualization component set in Java & C++ at a company that had adopted several extreme practices, but hadn't switch over completely. 

Way back, I was doing graphics hardware (back when there were more than 1 or 2 companies doing that sort of thing) and microcode.

Currently interested in the space where ObjectOrientedProgramming meets NumericalProgramming.
