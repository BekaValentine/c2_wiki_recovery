If you have lots of time to kill and learn for its own sake, and want the latest MicrosoftCorporation stuff, then visit http://www.microsoft.com to find a trial version download, then visit VbDotNet page to add a link. This way other people can benefit from your efforts as well. Be forewarned it is a LifeLongLearning exercise.

The first question you'll want to ask yourself, is do I really want to poison my mind like this, then you should slap yourself for even thinking about it, then go learn Lisp, Smalltalk, Scheme, Ruby, Python, Java, or CSharp, anything but VB, some friendly advice from a reformed VB programmer.  HaHaOnlySerious.
* If you are a MicrosoftSlave, then only CsharpLanguage is available, and try doing some prototyping in Csharp, and then I will have the LastLaugh

Actually Csharp is a much worse language than VB in many respects But since MS has an emotional investment in making it succeed, Csharp is likely to be improved much more than VB in the next years. Currently, Csharp almost sucks.
