JavaEnterpriseEdition is a simplified name for JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition created at J''''''avaOne 2005. The first product release is expected in early 2006, called JavaEnterpriseEdition 5.

Some of the technology improvements are said to be based on EnterpriseJavaBeans v3 that is in draft form in late 2005. ''See EjbThree''

It will feature increased compliance with WebServices standards. Which ones and which version?

For people interested in JavaAndDotNet, it may be of interest to note that initially DotNet had no support for the equivalent of "ContainerManagedPersistence" (CMP), (as of NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 it includes the AdoNetEntityFramework)  so applications built using that feature may not be readily ported to using EnterpriseServices, which is otherwise a DotNet equivalent of EJB. Source: MS Doug Purdy at 2005 Java One. Looking back, I can confirm this has been a "known situation" from the early days of DotNet.

''What is ContainerManagedPersistence and what purpose does it serve? And is there not another way of solving problems using other EJB tools / facilities such as JavaDataObject?'' AnswerMe please.
* Later, I found some mid 05 discussion by Application developers, and one person claimed CMP allowed for top down DB design. However my VbClassic and BigIron experience suggests to me CMP enabling topdown design would not have been a material benefit. PleaseComment requested by DavidLiu
