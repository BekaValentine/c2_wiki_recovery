Actually, I believe the term used was CeePlusPlusMinusMinusPlus which is read as "C++ with a lot of stuff removed and then a few added".

I heard JamesGosling (I think) say that at a presentation I attended a few years ago.

Does this still exist? Did the prototype make it into product form? If so where would one look to find more complete information? Was it intended as a replacement of C++? How successful is it today? Is it what we now call JavaLanguage? (someone has applied that category to the page).

''It's Java.''
