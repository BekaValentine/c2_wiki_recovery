WardHatesWiki now, irrespective of his sentiments towards WardsWiki in early years. It is just that he is too embarrassed to come out in the open, with so many keen supporters of wiki around earlier.

The situation is definitely getting better [worse?], endless wars and responses help diminish enthusiasm. Sure, there are MeatBall people coming to give morale boosts here. But you can see long-term supporters leaving one by one, or others no longer using their UserNames, etc., etc.

Keep in mind that this is meant in the same sense that GoogleHatesWiki. He doesn't actively hate it - he just seems no longer aware that it exists.

''It is normal to expect somebody to go through periods of heavy involvement and light involvement. It is probably cyclical.''

Well, everything that has a beginning has an end... does Ward really hate Wiki? Can you hate your own child? ... You surely can disapprove of the direction it's taking, but hate?

* WardHatesWiki because more people are leaving wiki as a result of ZeroTolerance towards the actions of WikiStewards
