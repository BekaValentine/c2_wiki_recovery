'''Changing as a result of innovation'''
* ''"In addition to changing as a result of inventions and discoveries, cultures change through the process of CulturalDiffusion. The spreading of a thing, an idea, or a behavior pattern from one culture to another."''

'''Continuous invention and innovation'''
* ''"Continuous invention and innovation are at the core of systematized research. They involve coming up with streams of new inventions and innovations over a limited period of time. Turning out those new discoveries has to occur in a fairly continuous or systematic way, to meet the many challenges faced by organizations. Successive experimentation is therefore part of continuous invention. For the kinds of organizations typical of technocapitalism, continuous invention and innovation are vital necessities."''

'''Innovation can lead to profits'''
* ''"There is a great deal of technology available that will make your company more profitable or more efficient. You may even have specific people allocated to identifying and evaluating new technologies that may be beneficial to your company. Depending on your business model, you may be inundated with vendors who promise that adopting their technology will save you money, increase productivity, and make upper management giddy."''
