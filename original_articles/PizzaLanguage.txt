The Pizza people describe it as:

Pizza is an extension of Java [JavaLanguage] with three important new features.
 
	* Parametric polymorphism. Although superficially similar to C++'s templates, this implementation is based on the HindleyMilner typing systems of ML [MlLanguage] and Haskell [HaskellLanguage]. 
	* First-class functions. Similar to the blocks of Smalltalk, functions and procedures may be passed as parameters, stored in variables and returned from methods. 
	* Class cases and pattern matching. Pizza includes support for visitor-style patterns directly in the language, allowing much more expressive and readable code.
