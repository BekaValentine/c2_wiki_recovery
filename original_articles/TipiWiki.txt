I found no wiki which suited my needs perfectly, so I started my own project, TipiWiki. It is now usable I think, so I want to "register" it here. Just have a look and give some advice, so I will be happy. ;)

http://tipiwiki.sourceforge.net

The aim was to create a
	* standard-compliant ''which standards? -> XHTML 1.0 strict''
	* simple
	* easy to install
Wiki in PHP. The data is saved in plain files, so any Web server with PHP is sufficient.


To allow text wrapping in the editing box, "wrap=virtual" or "wrap=soft" should be added to the textarea definition, as it isn't the default in some browsers. ''wrap is not xhtml strict''
