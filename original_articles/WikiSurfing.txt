It was suggested on WikiWalking that "Surfing implies being carried by some sort of imperative, unknowable force. The waves are marvels of physics, and have a volition of their own, unfathomable by human minds (without much preparation)."

Whereas it is here suggested that WikiSurfing is more appropriate ''because'' of that 'unfathomable' nature of WikiWiki that is over and above an individual's contribution (SystemicThinking).

Surfing is also an appropriate term, because surfing requires a mastery of the 'unfathomable' and it is observed that when one loses respect for the PowerOfWiki, you invariably get dumped (AustralianCulturalAssumption? What's the common term for falling off a wave... WipedOut?).  What do you do next? Jump back on your SurfBoard with a newly acquired respect for WikiWiki or leave WikiWiki and head back to the beach to sunbathe? 

I know which one I prefer.

P J O'Rourke talked about surfing the internet vs. lying on a towel next to it.

He's a political commentator from USA? heh. Would like to see that quote.

There is a cultural connection. Surfing is (as I understand it) a Hawaiian invention, and term WikiWiki is also Hawaiian.
