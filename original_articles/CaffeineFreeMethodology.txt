''It struck me that ExtremeProgramming is actually a CaffeineFreeMethodology. It's about staying relaxed and confident. All that hypertensive buzz is for projects where you do the testing at the end and stay up all night to fix bugs. Of course, this doesn't mean I'll give up my actual coffee... -- SteveFreeman''

I was seriously AddictedToCoke once, and it wasn't pretty. XP is definitely a sip of clean water for me in the sense that it relieves me from the pressure of "Well, if only I could stay up all night to finish this for the deadline."
