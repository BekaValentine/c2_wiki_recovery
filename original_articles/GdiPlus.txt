MicrosoftWindows GDI+ is a class-based application programming interface (API) for C/C++ programmers. It enables applications to use graphics and formatted text on both the video display and the printer. Applications based on the Microsoft Win32 API do not access graphics hardware directly. Instead, GDI+ interacts with device drivers on behalf of applications. GDI+ is also supported by Microsoft Win64.

MicrosoftDotNet's graphics API is based upon GDI+.

Good luck using it in VisualBasic without a wrapper.
