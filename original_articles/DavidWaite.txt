I am currently (as of 10:12 AM EST Mar 25 2000) a college student at University of Florida. I've also slowly been absorbed into being project lead on a rather large software project, so I've learned quickly the wrong way to do things. :) 

So I'm interested in the right way of doing things, which is why I'm looking at the ExtremeProgramming archive. Seems cool so far, although presently while I understand the importance of UnitTest''''''s, I have been too lazy to write them :)
