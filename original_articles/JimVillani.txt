Jim Villani is a Research Fellow at Logistics Management Institute, where he does software research, design, and implementation. Generally recognized in his company for software development expertise, he thinks of himself as an out-of-work musician (conductor, composer, clarinetist) who is just trying to make ends meet. He was the conductor of the NOVA Manassas Community Orchestra for the 2002-03 season.

He likes OO, Agile Processes, and the music of Antonin Dvorak and Karel Husa (among many others). Husa's "Music for Prague 1968" is the greatest work for wind band ever written and ranks way up there for all music ever written. He also admires the work of Kent Beck, Jim Highsmith, and Peter Coad.
