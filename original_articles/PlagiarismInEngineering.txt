
'''Sigh.'''

Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

I have used the triangles of others to build bridges.

I have used for formulae of others to calculate stresses.

I have used the physics of better men than I to assure the stability of my structures.

I have used the wheel to build cars.

I have used the sphere to build bearings.

I have used buoyancy to float my boat.

I have used magnetism and math to navigate.

Help me cleanse myself.  I am not worthy.
