As an alternative to the controversial SemiColon''''''s, some languages use parentheses to decide to look on the next line.  In other words, a command is assumed to only span one line unless a parenthesis is open.  Rather than something like an underscore in VB, one just puts parentheses around expressions if they are not already open.

This example is "self continuing" because the function parameters keep it open:
  foo(aaaaaaaaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbbbbbbb, ccccccc=blaaaah, 
      dddddd=gruuuuug)
This example requires parentheses to force the parser to look on the next line(s):

  x = (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa + bbbbbbbbbbb + CCCCCCCCCC
      + DDDDDDDDD)
