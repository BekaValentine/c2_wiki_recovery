Described as regrettable, but I don't believe it. ''The Pink Panther'' and ''A Shot in the Dark'' are timeless.

PeterSellers could take the lamest writing and - sometimes - make it savagely funny.

The PinkPanther cartoon series was good to. Except the ones where he talked.
''My personal fav:  the Panther's free-form "pink prints" compete with some staid builders "blue prints"''

And you could listen to that Henry Mancini theme all day.
