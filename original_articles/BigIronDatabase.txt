A BigIron database is the opposite of a NimbleDatabase. Examples include Oracle and (arguably) SqlServer. 


"Big Iron" (high-end, high-cost) databases generally include:

* OracleDatabase
* DbTwo by IBM
* IBM IMS (non-relational, considered legacy, but still common for narrow-but-high-volume tasks)

"Medium Iron" contenders include:

* Sybase
* SqlServer by MS
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Interbase

Smallbies include NimbleDatabase''''''s.

''Perhaps this should be renamed to DatabaseScaling or something.''

I don't understand that suggestion.
