A '''two-player stand-off" is a term in GameTheory that occurs in a multi-agent model where there is competition for resources in a fixed environment.  Eventually an agent learns a strategy and starts co-opting other players, but since the simulation happens simultaneously across all agents, eventually another agent forms a similarly powerful strategy and ends up making an EndGame where neither can defeat the other.
