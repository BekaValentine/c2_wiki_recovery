There is a book called OrganizingFromTheInsideOut that mentions the following:

Every time we go through a major change, we experience a breakdown in our organizational systems. It is inevitable, because we are dealing with a new set of realities, and it takes time to process the information and see clearly what we have to organize. Here are some common transitions:

	* Moving
	* Marriage
	* New baby
	* Starting school
	* Graduating from school
	* Retirement
	* Illness or death of a loved one
	* Job search
	* Business merger
	* Business growth spurt
	* Career change

A cheese served up in southern Europe that contains maggots. Some European tourists have reported this type of cheese; whether it is just bad cheese served to irritating tourists or a real dish remains to be seen.
