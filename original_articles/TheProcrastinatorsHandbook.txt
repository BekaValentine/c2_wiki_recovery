''The Procrastinator's Handbook'' by Rita Emmett. ISBN 0802775985

The strength of this book is not in its ideas for overcoming chronic procrastination, but in its discussion of the root ''causes'' of chronic procrastination. If you know what I mean.  But perhaps you don't, but then why should you?  I find it to be quite difficult to synapse successfully in an obtusian manner for long periods of time.

I was hoping this page would just say "... is due out any day now, we promise.". -- GarethMcCaughan

I'll get around to buying this book sooner or later.
