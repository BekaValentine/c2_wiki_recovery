If you're a programmer or fairly technical, you can probably get it up and running and get some utility out of it. Many bits and pieces are actively being developed, so expect bugs and unfinished features.

Camlistore Principles
* Your data is entirely under your control
* Open Source
* Paranoid about privacy, everything private by default
* No SPOF: don't rely on any single party (including yourself)
* Your data should be alive in 80 years, especially if you are
