Developer at Northeast Consulting, a management consulting company in Boston. I work mostly in ACI's 4th Dimension database environment, and while it's got many virtues, I'm shopping.

Much of what I don't like about 4D is clearly between my ears. I'm also shopping for development strategies; I got here via a link to ExtremeProgramming.

This WikiWiki thing is very interesting too. I'd be very curious what would happen if we set something like this up in-house. There are so many interesting ideas here, about so many things, I'm really struck by how well this model works.
