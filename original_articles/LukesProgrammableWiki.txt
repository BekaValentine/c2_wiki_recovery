A SmartWiki (written in ErlangLanguage) in which pages are literate programs written with embedded Scheme code. Pages are also language-level modules, and can refer to and build on one another. Scheme code can either be evaluated to show a simple result, or used for dynamic HTML generation.

Now with the more memorable URL http://gallery.vegetable.org/
* ????-??-?? (Page is no longer available - is there a new one?
* ????-??-?? ''I can bring it back Real Soon Now. I'm between servers'')
* 2003-12-15 The code is available at http://sf.net/projects/skwiki
* 2006-02-06 http://gallery.vegetable.org/ still doesn't seem to exist.  Any news?
* 2006-09-09 Site still not available. Remove the link?
* 2011 June, looks like a SearchEngineOptimzer (SEO) or keyword finder, and not a WikiPlace at all.
