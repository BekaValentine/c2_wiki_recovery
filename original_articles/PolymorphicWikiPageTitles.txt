A possible solution for ChangeTitle on wikis, when FreeLink''''''s are available. Simply: the WikiDatabase doesn't store a "title" for the page but instead just its "name" for linking ("key" in ZincWiki parlance). Then, when the page is requested (by clicking on a link from another page, typically), the name that was used '''there''' appears as the page title.

E.g. if this scheme were implemented for PhpWiki, you could write [foo | FooBar] in the WikiSource for one page, and clicking the resulting link would display the FooBar page, but titled "foo".

Another solution is to use WikiAliases, such as those implemented on SenseisLibrary.
