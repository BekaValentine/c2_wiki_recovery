IwannaLearnDotNet really quickly, VbDotNet and AspDotNet and then coding for these within the VisualStudioWhidbey environment, especially the WebServicesExtensions stuff. And then learning whatever available about the AOP and other additions that ACA (Avanade Connected Architecture) has put on top. Looks like there will be many long weekends ahead. Any regulars here doing Whidbey and ACA v4?
