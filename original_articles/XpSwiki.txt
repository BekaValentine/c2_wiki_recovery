So far it looks like a normal wiki. What features help an XP team?

''That's because the most of the work has been done in the backend. The tool may be used to gather lots of data and organize them the way you want. As an example, we have put a historical data table in each task's page that tracks changes of the points value of the task. (see i.e. http://www.agilexp.org/demo/18).''

Yes, I saw that, but I don't realize what's going on. Can you say how it works and what it does for me?

''Let's say you have to implement a task whose value is 3 points. After half a day of programming, you have completed about 1/3 of it, so you update the task page and put 2 points left to do and 1 point done. After saving the page, the task view is updated and the historical data table has a new entry. This table is created on the fly by querying the object structure of the wiki.''

''What can it do for you? It depends on what you want it to do. You may use it to automate tracking, or to automatically prepare reports on the project, or to compute process and product metrics, or whatever you want.''

It would have helped if I had used the edit command! Clearer now.
