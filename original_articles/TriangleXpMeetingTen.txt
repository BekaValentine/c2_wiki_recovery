Metrics on an XP Project.  BillKrebs at IBM worked on a study in conjunction with LaurieWilliams from NC State to numerically evaluate their level of adoption and results from using extreme programming using '''XP-EF''': XpEvaluationFramework.  Defect injection rate improved by a factor of two, and they documented the measurement framework so others can replicate the study.  Bill discussed his team's numbers and results.
