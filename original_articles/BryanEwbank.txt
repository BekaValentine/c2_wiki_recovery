Hi.  I'm BryanEwbank, a Programming Language and compiler developer.  I spend my days working with lex, yacc, C, and such.  FiniteAutomata are my friend, and I tend to see everything in computer science as a language translation problem (okay, I'm biased :-).

In truth, I spend most of my work time doing software archeology and cleaning up the detritus of years (okay, fixed bugs), and making sure to RefactorMercilessly while I do. 

I now work at Synopsys, Inc, and own the runset language for the Hercules product.
