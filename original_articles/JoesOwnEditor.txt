joe (Joe's Own Editor) is a modeless terminal TextEditor for LinuxOs/UnixOs/MacOsx, and I believe a MicrosoftWindows port is underway as well. It has a raft of useful features, including window-splitting, built-in calculator, macros, ability to run shell commands, regex search/replace, IncrementalSearch, autoindenting, SyntaxHighlighting, CTAGS (ExuberantCtags) keyword completion and UTF-8 support. Brace matching is currently being implemented.

The program can also be run with WordStar and EmacsEditor-like keybindings in addition to the default set.

JoeAllen, the original author (and after whom the program is named) recently returned to the project to release version 3.0 after nine years' absence. Is that a record of some kind?
