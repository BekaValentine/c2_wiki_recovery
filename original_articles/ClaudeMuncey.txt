Database mangler, er, administrator for a food processing company in California.  My only problem with Wiki is that once I wander in here, it may take me hours to find my way back out.

I have an NT based Wiki set up at work that I am using for database documentation, and at least one other team member has started to use it quite skillfully for that.
