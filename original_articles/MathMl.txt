MathML is a markup language for mathematics defined using XML. Actually there are two markups, called ''presentation'' and ''content''. For details, see http://www.w3.org/Math/.

There is an editor called EzMath which can export content MathML.

The output of MathML is not very readable, by humans that is (but see below). It does, however, make it possible to store algebra results in a database such as E4Graph. (See XmlDatabaseServers).

MathML does become much more readable when implemented in PXSL (ParsimoniousXmlShorthandLanguage) which can be translated to XML when needed.

This page lists ''several'' products for displaying/authoring MathML: http://www.w3.org/Math/implementations.html

MathML is rendered as readable math expressions in InternetExplorer by browser plugins such as MathPlayer.

The MozillaBrowser, MozillaFirefox, and modern versions of NetscapeNavigator have built-in support for MathML, provided you have the necessary math fonts installed on your system. See http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/ (fonts available there, too).

The AmayaBrowser has native support of MathML.
