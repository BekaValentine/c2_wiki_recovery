MichaelPalin seemed genuinely interested in his unexpected contribution to making the programming manuals of the future less boring when I finally told him about the PythonLanguage over a beer before Christmas. (All the Python tutorial code examples use themes from MP sketches of various degrees of absurdity. Somehow it's the first time that I've felt the subject matter ideally matched the mind-numbing nature of the material.)

I think I lost Michael when I tried to describe the difference between a scripting and a 'serious' programming language but I told him to tell the other guys the good news anyway. Let's hope they don't sue. -- RichardDrake

''Can you imagine MontyPython in court? hee hee!''

They've already been in court. In the 1970s, the US broadcasting network, ABC, had bought the right to show some MontyPython episodes on late night television. They took 3 episodes, smashed them together, cut out large portions (to remove ''naughty bits''), and showed them on a Friday night.

MontyPython sued, claiming that the cuts were unauthorized, that the result so distorted their work that it counted as copyright infringement, etc. The Judge was a Python fan! Eventually, MontyPython lost the court case, but won the war - ABC stopped showing the episodes, and they reached an out-of-court settlement.

There was an article on this in a 1976 New Yorker magazine (the one with the Saul Steinberg ''View of the World from Ninth Avenue'' cover, I think).

There's an interesting book documenting MontyPython's various run-ins with censorship, first from the BBC, then in the courts, called "Monty Python, The Case Against" (ISBN:0413486605)

	1. The larch.

	1. I'm a lumberjack and, hey, I'm OK. ''And I thought you were so rugged!''

	1. A dromedary has two humps and a dining car. ''You're no fun anymore.''

	1. Norway is in a constant blaze. Wooden buildings, you know. ''That's how things are out east - you know, Norway, Sweden.''

	1. When people put a nice chocky into their mouths, they don't expect to have their cheeks pierced. ''In any case, it is an inadequate description of the sweetmeat.''

Philosophers song

 Immanuel Kant was a real pissant 
	Who was very rarely stable

 Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggar
	Who could think you under the table
*** I think that "think" should be "drink" ... daveb ***

 David Hume could out consume
	Schopenhauer and Hegel

 And Wittgenstein was a beery swine
	Who was just as schloshed as Schlegel

 There's nothing Nietzche couldn't teach ya 'Bout the raising of the wrist
	Socrates, himself, was permanently pissed

 John Stuart Mill, of his own free will
	On half a pint of shandy was particularly ill

 Plato they say, could stick it away
	Half a crate of whiskey every day

 Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle
	Hobbes was fond of his dram

 And Rene' Descartes was a drunken fart
	"I drink, therefore I am"

 Yes, Socrates, himself, is particularly missed
	A lovely little thinker
	But a bugger when he's pissed

''This is related to the famous drinking philosophers problem.'' (they must've got thirsty after dining)

And is full of impossibilities and mentions Socrates twice.

Shouldn't this read 'Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel' rather than 'Schopenhauer and Hegel'? At least my version seems to.

Spam spam spam spam spam spam, spam spam spam spam spam

> "Shouldn't this read 'Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'"

Yes.

I believe that the version sung during "Monty Python at the Hollywood Bowl" contained the line "Schopenhauer and Hegel" but on the album version it was "Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel"
