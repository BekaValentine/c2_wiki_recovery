We are now moving into 2007. Several years ago I wrote this Wiki Article, I decided it was about time to split up the page as it was so long. Java has had a lot of advancements since I wrote this such as generics and auto-boxing. But I'm leaving this in its original form as it communicates the concepts simply and because I am lazy. Soon Java will have closures making much of this even simpler. Another thing, exception handling in java is kind of a mess. I'm not sure the best way to propagate exceptions from blocks but in java the simplest but PITA solution would be to have all the interfaces propagate Exception. ''-- RobertDiFalco''
