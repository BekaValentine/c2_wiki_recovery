Bookshelved ''www.bookshelved.org/'' is an active and growing wiki about books, for everyone with a passion for reading the things. With over a thousand pages, there's something for everyone.

By convention, each WikiPage on Bookshelved is the title of a book, the name of an author, or the homepage of a reader.
