What it is like to go from pair programming to not pair programming:

* You get to use your own system, all set up just the way you like it: resolution, editor/IDE, etc.
* You get to write code, not perpetually stuck as navigator/passenger.
* If you do not suffer from any mental deficiencies (e.g., ADHD, Asperger's), you can keep your train of thought, get that MentalStateCalledFlow.

That's funny -- I cannot maintain my MentalStateCalledFlow for more than two hours '''per week''' when coding alone.  --Samuel A. Falvo II
