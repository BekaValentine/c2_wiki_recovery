The following post (about duplication) reminds the importance of being ready to learn.  It is analog to some kind of being ready to change and related to WillingToChange.

''Duplication is a design lesson waiting to be learned. If you aren't ready to learn, duplicate away. When you're ready to learn, eliminate the duplication. Different people value learning and immediate progress differently. The more experience I gain, the more I value learning and the more I trust that a smarter me will make more progress.''
