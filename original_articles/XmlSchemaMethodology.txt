XML Schema Methodologies provide guidelines to consistently model and structure information.

----

DataOrientedSchemaMethodology is a DataOriented method found where a database row is represented in XML.

----

ObjectMappingMethodology is an ObjectBased methodology that consistently models the relationship between objects.

----

ObjectOrientedMappingMethodology is found where the information subject to ObjectOrientation such as polymorphism and inheritance.

----

SchemaVersioningMethodology can be found communicated XML documents are subject to ForwardsCompatibility and BackwardsCompatibility.

----

DynamicDocumentMethodology is used where a freeform document is typically created such as a word document or a web page that may have any information embedded at any point within the document.

----

DocumentMethodology is proposed for StatelessXmlDocumentProcessing where the document contains all the information required to solve certain problems.

----
A database row can store information about relationships between rows in tables.  An object hides its relationships with other objects from the clients that send messages to it.  So what exactly is the difference between DataOrientedSchemaMethodology and ObjectOrientedMappingMethodology? XML is just data, and XmlSchema can only describe data, so how can it be called ObjectOriented, given that objects have both data and behaviour?
