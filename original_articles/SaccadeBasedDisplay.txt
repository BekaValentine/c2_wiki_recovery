When I first learned about head mounted video displays, I thought they were saccade based displays using lasers. Apparently not. It's funny but I always seem to overestimate the state of an unfamiliar technology. When I was a child, I thought that Star Trek represented the then-current state of voice recognition technology.

Actually one of the earliest HMDs for low cost was almost that - it was a single line of small LEDs with a mirror that shifted
to provide a POV effect and create a 24x80 display over one eye.
