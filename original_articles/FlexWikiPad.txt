FlexWikiPad is a DotNet-based desktop application for building Wikis on your hard drive. It is OpenSource, and can be downloaded at http://sf.net/projects/fwcontrib. Because it uses the same syntax as the web-based WikiEngine FlexWiki, it can be used to provide offline editing capabilities to FlexWiki. All you need is a way to move files back and forth, like FwSync. 
----
FlexWikiPad only runs on MicrosoftWindows, and requires the DotNet runtime to be installed.
