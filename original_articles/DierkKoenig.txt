I learned to know the WikiWikiWeb when searching for information about DesignPatterns and ExtremeProgramming. 

I work for '''CanooDotCom''' in Basel, SwitzerlandCountry. 

Wiki Quick List: 
http://c2.com/cgi/quickChanges?days=1

We use a local installation of the WikiWikiWeb with some minor modifications.
Out we use our WikiWikiWeb as
	* corporate knowledge base
	* for discussion / feedback on proposals
	* up-to-date information on "who is where" and current occupations
	* and even for capturing and management of stories and tasks like in the XP PlanningGame
 
What we found useful:
	* access wiki through https for ubiquitous but still private usage
	* synchronize RecentChanges as an offline page with depth 1 for an offline (read-only) version of wiki
	* send wiki pages via mail for additional "push"es of information

Additionally there is a wiki to provide an interactive help system for '''XpPlanIt''', a tool for capturing the PlanningGame.
