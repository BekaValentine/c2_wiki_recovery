I started out life in hardware for a drive manufacturer. Transferred to their computer systems division where I 'wrote' h/w diagnostics.

Then had the opportunity to become involved with embedded systems at a (spinoff) company called ETA Systems. ETA built, for a short (6 years) time both air cooled and liquid nitrogen cooled super computers. We ran the entire fault tolerant system from an embedded system that was operated by a GUI running on an Apollo Computer.

When that industry died, I tried application programming, then moved on to *nix system administration and finally into systems design. So I'm one of those guys some of you occasionally dislike 'cause you don't agree with the (h/w, os, router, switch, protocol, language, gui, etc. pick one or more) choices I've made.

I've been in the industry since the late 70's and have tried most everything and even try to keep up with what's current. I currently reside in rural western Wisconsin in a log cabin wired with 100MB ethernet. Well since this was written I've added WiFi and SuseLinux. I've also been playing with an opensourced app I've written that's modeled with M$ Access running with MySQL as the backend.

I've also been spending time completing my degree, well ok I'm not completing my degree I've started over and moved from EE to BS Business (IT management). I should finish this within the next 6 months or so. After that I'll be aiming for my Masters, Finance? I'm not sure what that'll be but we'll see.

UPDATE
I completed my BS (some would say I haven't) and am almost finished with my MBA. Next up will be my doctorate which I hope will produce something that will be of use to someone, someday.

I still run 100MB ethernet & WiFi and all of my windows uses are on a VM running inside a mac pro, safe and sound. I've expanded my hobbies to include astronomy, when the sky is clear.
