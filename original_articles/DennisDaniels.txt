I believe education is key to a better, happier, and stronger community.  Providing a quality education is a growing challenge. Free curriculum management systems that do not depend on expensive licenses to provide solid database resources and services for students, teachers, administrators and parents are available Education in America, and probably for the whole world, is a highly politicized glacial bureaucracy. And change, painful for all, is excruciating for public education. 

Of course, academia is not for everyone and the apathy I've encountered in the youth of today is probably no different than the apathy expressed in the last decade or last centuries. As an educator and a technologist though, I struggle with finding a way to communicate the very real challenges students today will face in the workplace of a global market.
