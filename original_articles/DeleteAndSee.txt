I thought I'd share with y'all something I've learned about page deletions and our Wiki.

Marking a page for deletion makes it what's known as a short page. This script http:shorts.cgi from ShortWikiPages lists the short pages that contain the word 'delete', ''but it doesn't list the pages that also contain the word 'see'.''

So, if you mark a page for deletion and also say, "see ThisOtherPage," it won't end up in the short list. Then if the page you've marked for deletion falls off RecentChanges before someone else seconds the deletion, ''it might never get spotted again'' unless someone feels like slogging through the month-by-month RecentChanges or doing a full search for the word 'delete'.

[''My experience is that few pages marked for deletion fall off RecentChanges unless the case for deletion is dubious.'']

Lately when I mark a page for deletion, I use "=> ThisOtherPage" so that the page I want deleted shows up in the short pages list. Perhaps someone should change the shorts script so that 'see' pages don't get excluded from the list, but that's the way it is nowadays.

''This is exactly why I use the tag '''D''''''eleteThisPageSoon'''. Going to that page and clicking on the title then finds all the pages that contain the tag, some, but not all, of which are true pending deletions.''
