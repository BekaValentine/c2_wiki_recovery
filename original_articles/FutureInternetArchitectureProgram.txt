'' What can we expect the Future Internet Architecture to be like '' DoingStuff.DonaldNoyes.20131204
* The Internet has created unprecedented opportunities for advancing knowledge across the spectrum of human endeavors.  
* It has evolved from a small scale network of networks to become integral to our lives and vital to the operation of all critical sectors of our society. 
* The continued success of the Internet, will be increasingly burdened by sophisticated security attacks (threats) 
* And by the performance reliability decline of Internet services. 
* As our reliance on the security and dependability of our information technology increases, it is evident that to meet the emerging and future needs of our society a new trajectory is required instead of the current incremental patchwork changes constantly required in the current Internet.
