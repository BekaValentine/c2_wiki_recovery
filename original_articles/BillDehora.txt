Bill Dehora is a programmer. 

He got into programming from artificial intelligence, when he realised you have be able to write lots of great code and that the smart bit is only the icing. He got into artificial intelligence when he realised that even great human computer interfaces weren't enough to make computers really useful. He got into great human computer interfaces when he realised that there were more interesting and pressing usability problems with computers than anything in the world of physical product design. He got into product design when he decided to take a degree in it instead of computer science. He hardly ever puts cycles in his code. 

Currently he's working away as a ChiefArchitect at http://www.newbay.com

His MyersBriggs is INTJ
