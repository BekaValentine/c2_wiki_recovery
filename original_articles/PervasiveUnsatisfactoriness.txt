The Buddhist or Sanskrit word for suffering, ''duh-kha'', which is often translated as ''PervasiveUnsatisfactoriness.''

Conceding that pervasive suffering exists is the first of the FourNobleTruths of the Mahayana.

The direct translation is so excellent! It is my favorite word: 
in Sanskrit, ''duh'' means ''bad'' and ''kha'' means ''axle hole'', so it means ''eccentric, not holding your wheel of existence (Samsara) correctly at its center''.

The meaning is certainly related to ''WabiSabi.''

Is this the recognition that reality needs constant refactoring?
