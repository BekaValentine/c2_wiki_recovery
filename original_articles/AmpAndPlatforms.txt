Historically: ''AMP - Apache, MySql, and PHP''

Currently: ''AMP - Apache-ish, MySQL-like, and Programming (probably PHP/Perl/Python...)''

AMP is infrastructure typically used for hosting dynamic, database-driven Web sites.

Historically, AMP was known as LAMP, which stood for '''L'''inux, '''A'''pache, '''M'''ySQL, '''P'''HP.  This was followed by WAMP (for Windows) and MAMP (for Macintosh.)  Over time, the OperatingSystem has become irrelevant and the choices of database system, programming language, and Web server have expanded.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMP_packages

The thing common to LAMP, WAMP, MAMP or any *AMP is '''AMP''', which is a (Apache, usually) WebServer, a (MySQL, commonly) DataBase management system, and a (PHP/Perl/Python, often) ProgrammingLanguage.
