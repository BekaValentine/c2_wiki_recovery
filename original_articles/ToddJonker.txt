Hi everyone,

I'm a Senior Technical Associate at ZEFER, Pittsburgh. I'm a big fan of XP, and I'm doing my best to pull as much of its wisdom as possible into our lives as consultants.

Big thanks go out to Kent, Ward, Martin, Uncle Bob and everyone else in this community for the inspiration, advice, and general Good Karma.

Cheers!

.T.
