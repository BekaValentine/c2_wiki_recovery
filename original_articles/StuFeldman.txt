StuFeldman invented the MakeProgram in 1979.  If you have read GraphTheory, his algorithm solves ALL DirectedAcyclicGraph problems.  All of them.  The trick is to accurately describe the graph.

Once you start writing Makefile''''''s and reading those of others, you find that the computer is learning from you and teaching you at the same time.

It has been said that Stu's '''make''' is the first great stride in ArtificialIntelligence with software.  Are there other strides?

''Who said that? Lots of us have done strange and wonderous things with '''make''', but I don't offhand recall any interesting AI uses to date, even if it is theoretically possibly to do something along those lines.''
