The PiratePad is a wikilike EtherPad variant, where in addition to joint editing, intra-server links can be produced, by enclosing link text in double brackets. -- FridemarPache

Experimenting with links. I put [[idea]] in my PiratePad and it created a page called http://piratepad.net/idea which does not seem brilliant as it will fill up the namespace at piratepad.net. It also contains some scrambled text which I did not supply. Can I get rid of it? It now contains an example of a dialogue between two users.

I tried to make a daughter page from my own with [[<mypage>/daughter]] and that does not work.

I have tried the export options and HTML works but not the plain text.

Is there some more documentation with examples somewhere?  -- JohnFletcher
