Is this real life?
----
Pardon me for being reluctant to say, for I can't commit myself to a simple answer on so broad a question. Could you be more specific?

Perhaps you mean something like this:

 Algo Main()
   Ifreallife then
     giveanswer
   else
     askforclarification
   endif
  End Algo
 
  sub giveanswer()
    displayonpage(answertoquestion)
  end sub

  sub askforclarifiation()
    displayonpage(requestforclarification)
  end sub
