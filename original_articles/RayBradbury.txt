American psychological fantasy author, best known for ''The Martian Chronicles'' and the dystopian novel ''FahrenheitFourFiveOne''. He generally writes about themes and passions, not hardware, and dislikes being lumped in with all the shoot-em-up SciFi authors.

''And, hence, exactly like in one of his dystopias, the LSM is now widely reporting that a "Master of Science Fiction" has passed away. ''Ay-yi-yi'' haven't you clowns ever heard of FACT CHECKING??!''
