This is an attempt to classify disagreement reasons, along with tips on working past impasses.

* Disagree with Authority (ArgumentFromAuthority)

* Too many variables - There are lots of metrics or evidence specimens, but the weights given to each is in dispute. (TooManyVariablesForScience)

* Definition - LaynesLaw

* Miscommunication (dreadfully frequent; sometimes results in ViolentAgreement)

* Differing set of accepted axioms

* Differing priorities, especially if these are not recognised

* Personality clash (biggest and most frequent cause of all)

When you find yourself arguing with someone, even though they are basically right, it is time to quit, because you really don't have a legit reason for the argument.  The real reason being, "you just don't like the guy".
