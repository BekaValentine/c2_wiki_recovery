Quote from http://www.activewin.com:

	 :	DirectAnimation provides unified, comprehensive support for animation, streaming, and integration of diverse media types, such as 2-D vector graphics, 3-D graphics, sprites, audio, and video. Because it is a COM API with an underlying engine/run time, DirectAnimation's functionality can be accessed by a wide variety of programmers and authors:

** HTML authors can animate their Web pages without any programming. The DirectAnimation is included as part of the IE4 minimum install
** Scripting authors using Microsoft?Visual Basic?Scripting Edition VBScript ) or JScript can utilize Dynamic HTML to create animated Web page properties.
** Programmers using Java, Visual Basic, and Microsoft?Visual C++? can develop ActiveX?controls or full applications with multimedia support and interactivity.

''I did a lot of work with DirectAnimation when I was at Microsoft back in 97-99.  My opinion, which was also shared by a lot of other people was that Direct Animation sucked, to put it bluntly. -- CurtisBartley''
