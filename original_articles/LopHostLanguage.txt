A programming language that is used as basis for LanguageOrientedProgramming. Any programming language (e.g. BASIC, C, Java, ...) may be used. LOP works by using a separate language, the LopLanguage (e.g. ThelopLanguage) for naming functions and variables consistently. So LopLanguage and LopHostLanguage cooperate on completely separate levels.
