''Tor, AreYouThere? OrphanPage, last edit 21 September 2003''

ProgrammingLanguageJunkie and EvilOverlord studying in LundSweden.

Currently infatuated with ObjectiveCee and PythonLanguage.
Especially in combination with SWIG.

In the last year I've been working on and off on a typesetting
engine (for latin scripts only), trying to best LaTeX at it's own game.
It's going quite well. Well enough that I want a WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouMean
document processor for it.

So now I'm involved in writing a cross platform GuiToolkit that uses
antialiasing for all graphics operations. Sort of like MacOsx does.
Except it works on Unix and Windows.
