The Vadem Clio (aka Sharp Tri Pad) is a three-pound pen-based Windows CE (WinCe/PocketPc) computer.
It can be opened like a notebook, stood up like an easel, or laid flat like a pad.
(See http://www.vadem.com for more info.)

It reminds me of the Momenta, except that it works.
I'm wondering whether anyone has been working with Squeak on it.
