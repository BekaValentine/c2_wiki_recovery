I am a project lead at PitneyBowes trying to introduce XP into our group.  This should be quite interesting as the chief technology officer for the company has begun a CMM initiative.  I haven't met our auditor yet but I have heard that he has made some generally positive comments about XP.  I'll keep you posted.

I can be reached at art_thursland@tspb.com
