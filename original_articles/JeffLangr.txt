I am a software developer and owner of Langr Software Solutions (http://langrsoft.com). I currently live in Colorado Springs, Colorado, US.

I was an ObjectMentor consultant from 2000-2002. I've authored three books, including AgileInaFlash with TimOttinger, published by PragProg on January 20, 2011, and EssentialJavaStyle: Patterns For Implementation (1999) and AgileJava (2005), both published by Prentice Hall. I contributed a couple chapters to UncleBob's book CleanCode (PrenticeHall August 2008). You'll also find links to 90+ articles on software development at my site.

You can also take a look at the Agile In a Flash blog site (http://agileinaflash.com), where Tim and I created all the blog entries--and many more--that are the basis for the card deck.
