A successful meeting has three phases:

'''Phase 1: Preparation'''

Always ask a few questions before you start:
	* What is the main goal? (the email Subject:)
	* What are the topics of the meeting?
	* What are the expected results for each topic?
	* Who has to join the meeting? (the email To:)
	* Who will be interested? (the email Cc:)
	* Can the goal be achieved in a different way?
	* Are the selection of topics and participants homogeneous? Is it possible to split the meeting? To refactor the meeting?

Actions:
	* Check that the meeting room is available, and reserve it. Sometimes the room will be occupied by your boss, and he has a more important meeting than you.
	* Reserve 15 minutes more time than you think you'll need.
	* Check that all the equipment you need is available.
	* Invite the participants directly and at least one day before the meeting.
	* Check the schedule of the participants to make sure they can make it.
	* Inform any interested people about the meeting.
	* Include an agenda with the invitation.
	* Assign the recorder and moderator.

The result of the preparation is the Agenda.

The Agenda contains:
	* Place
	* Time and date, duration
	* Participants
	* Topics with description, goal, owner and estimated time
	* Moderator
	* Recorder
	* If a regular meeting, the last minutes of the meeting and the goals achieved and issues still open
	* A hint about the penalty if a participant is late

And keep in mind:
	* Fewer participants is better.
	* If a goal is to generate work, invite those who must do this work, or at least one who will be responsible.
	* Fewer topics is better.
	* Describe the topics in two to five sentences.
	* Describe the goal for each topic along with any related information.
	* Always assign a topic owner.

'''Phase 2: During the meeting'''

Actions:
	* Welcome all participants, and say a few words about the main goal.
	* If it's a regular meeting check the last goal list.
	* Assign work only to the participants. A participant can delegate work, but is still himself responsible to see that it gets done.
	* Be as brief as possible.
	* Moderate the meeting.
	* Avoid off-topic discussions.
	* Avoid discussions that are relevant only to some of the participants. Suggest an action item, that these participants discuss the issue off-line.
	* Avoid long discussions over complex issues. Move the discussion to its own meeting, with its own agenda.

Ending:
	* Make a summary of the goal achieved and the results.
	* Thank the participants.

'''Phase 3: After the meeting'''

Actions:
	* Stay for a few minutes for further questions. These questions may be off-topic, but they can be helpful in planning the next meeting.
	* The recorder should write and publish the minutes immediately after the meeting.
	* The minutes are similar to the agenda, except they include the actual participants, start, duration, and results.
