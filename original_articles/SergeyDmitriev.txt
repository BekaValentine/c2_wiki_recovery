'''Who:'''
	* Co-founder and CEO of JetBrains/IntelliJ Software (http://www.intellij.com) 
	* Programmer, who doesn't like to program, that's why IntelliJ IDEA was written. (But this is just the beginning)
----
'''Participated in inventing and programming of different things:'''
	* I'm co-inventor and co-creator of IntellijIdea, the best Java IDE
	* I've started JetBrains Fabrique project at May, 13 2002 and managed it at early stages(now it is being developed in JetBrains)
	* I've started Omea project (the personal integrated information environment) at March-June 2003 and manage it now as product manager
	* Some other, before JetBrains: TogetherJ, bug tracker, GIS system, and image recognition system.
	 
----
'''Now working on:'''
	* The meta-programming system (MPS) implementing ideas of language-oriented programming (see below). It was started in August, 2003
	* Some new project, that will allow make Internet better place to live in - more information about it will appear a bit later 
----
'''Looking for:'''
	* Smart people
----
'''Now thinking about:'''
	* How finally to make a computer understand what we want from it.
	* Or may be simpler: What is the next programming paradigm (after ObjectOrientedProgramming)
Now, I have some ideas what can be the next, I call it LanguageOrientedProgramming. This method should open possibility to easily define new languages along with writing programs on these languages. Defining new language means describing its structure, its editors and interpretors or codegenerators, optionally there can be type system, set of constraints, etc. See my interview here: http://www.codegeneration.net/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=60 or discussion of this new approach (in Russian!) here: http://sergeydmitriev.livejournal.com. Also, there is an article at http://www.onboard.jetbrains.com/articles/04/10/lop/ about LOP.
In June 2005 we've started the early access program for Meta-Programming System, that implements ideas of LOP. Anybody can download it from http://www.jetbrains.com/mps

'''Hobby and other interests:'''
	* Algebra & number theory, functional analysis & mathematical foundations of quantum physics. Trying to find parallels in these fields.
	* Biology of cell and artificial life and evolution
	* Mathematical knowledgebase
