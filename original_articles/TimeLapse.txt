As long as we have been recording sounds and images we have been playing them back at different rates. The computer just makes this easier. Here are some sites that shift speeds in interesting ways.

'''Urban and Pastoral Life transitions in sight and sound'''
* http://www.theircircularlife.it/ -- Flash sound and image over a 24 hour period.
----
'''Wave motion to Sound'''
* http://c2.com/doc/waves -- mp3 of ocean waves played as sound wave rates.

'''Seismicity to Sound'''
It interests me that someone has thought to do this, as exampled above, but I wonder if anyone has done something similar with seismic waves? When I was a MtStHelens last summer, I was wondering what the waves appearing on the seismograph at the Center would sound like when converted to sound, the adding of the dimension of binaural might here be employed by integrating two sites at various distances from each other. Could the human ear also be used to detect patterns which lead up to earthquakes? Could it be that the legend of animals sensing earthquakes in advance be attributed to sub-audible vibrations they may sense through their feet? I think to consider and implement this might be a good open data research project. --DonaldNoyes
