The application of wikis is limited only by intent and imagination, not form!

While it is true that WardsWiki is not a dictionary, it is also true that the wiki format is useful in the formation of excellent and useful dictionaries, encyclopedias, thesauruses, InteractiveNovels, schedulers, PersonalInformationManagers, and the like. 

It is not form but intention which makes a page title true. Wiki could be all of the things and combinations and conglomerations of all of the things listed. 

In fact a wiki could be large enough not only to contain an encyclopedia as in WikiPedia, but could contain an entire library of books, articles, encyclopedias, dictionaries, glossaries, financial records, movies, sounds, 3d graphics, games, Shopping Malls, and Wiki Universities.
