I have a very poor memory for some things and am at times quite disorganized.

It would help me to be more respectful to the wiki audience if I were to finish what I start.

A reference to this page in an area where i would like to clarify or follow-up a topic would help me be tidier.

If anyone chooses to use this page, it should always appear in the referencing page with your signature.

Might be better if renamed to PlanToExpandThis, as life has a way of "happening", and intentions not always being fulfilled (wink).
