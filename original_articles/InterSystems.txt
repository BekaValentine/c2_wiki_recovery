A Database company that creates what IDG called a "Post-Relational" Database.  Basically it is a multi-dimensional database core with a Object Engine for Java, C++, .NET, and COM sitting on top along side (not beneath) a JDBC/ODBC relational interface.  Due to the nature of their database it is a no brainer to do Java Binding / Objects at a speed of 7-20x faster than Sybase/Oracle to the point of doing real time data mining on the transactional data.

Supports both Object projections and standard SQL projections, so you can access your objects as objects, or do SQL queries to obtain the resultset of object ids and then instantiate them.  This can save you from creating lots of joins which are normally needed to pull the ThirdNormalForm data for the user presentation  layer...  f
