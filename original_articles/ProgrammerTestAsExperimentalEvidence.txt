Each ProgrammerTest in your TestSuite is an experiment describing facts which the theory of your implementation must take into account.

The scientific process (or "method" or whatever) consists of:

	* observe
	* document
	* experiment
	* publish
	* reproduce
	* model
	* repeat

The TestFirst we operate on the Great Implementation in the Sky takes centuries to reach the next version.

But computers are designed to be implementation platforms. So we get a simpler cycle that takes only hours:

	* UserStory
	* CustomerTest
	* TestDrivenDevelopment
	* ContinuousIntegration
	* DailyBuild
	* RefactorMercilessly
	* FrequentReleases

Those two cycles are perfectly parallel.
