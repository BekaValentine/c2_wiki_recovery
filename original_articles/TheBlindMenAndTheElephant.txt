Relevant to the ProjectManager or even JustaProgrammer, especially those of an OpenSource or AgileProcesses mentality.

Reframes WickedProjects as FuzzyProjects

Leverage points for escaping from (either role of) the MasterSlave relationship: purpose, generosity, personal judgment, patience, acknowledging our own blindness.

from the author:

The Big Idea:

	* All projects, even "wicked" ones, can be juicy.

Supporting Key Ideas:

	* Projects have changed, but our expectations about them haven't.
	* The myths about how projects are supposed to work create misery.
	* Our methods for doing project work create our madness.
	* You have the power to create juiciness!
	* Juiciness isn't just an accident or a nice-to-have, it's an essential component of a thriving business.
