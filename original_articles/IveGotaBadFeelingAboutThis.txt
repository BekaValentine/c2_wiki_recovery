Famous phrase from StarWars; uttered numerous times through the movies, usually right before a TurdFanCollision occurs.  At least once in every movie; more than once in several.  (Even more often than instances of C3P0 getting disassembled -- and poorly re-assembled -- in humiliating fashion).

Frequently heard in many IT and software engineering shops as well; often with a similar result.
