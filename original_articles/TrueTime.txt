TrueTime is one of the products that I have worked on. It provides timing and performance reports on all sorts of code, such as Java, C++, VisualBasic, VisualC++, and now Web and ActiveSCriptPages. Because it hooks Windows first, we can go down to the kernel level and time into those routines.

It's a product I have used over the years to get accurate timing for my code.
