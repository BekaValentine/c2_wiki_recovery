Has anyone read or studied Husserl's phenomenology?  I am starting on it, and it seems interesting, relevant to cognitive psychology and AI (e.g. Minsky's frames).  The book I am using is Husserl, Phenomenology and Intention.  Hard going, but if I squint right, I catch some strains of some interesting music.

In HusserlsPhenomenology, 
 the Lifeworld, as opposed to 
 the ConstructedWorld of the sciences, 
 is the place where also the scientist spends his life and operates his instruments. 

A later phenomenologist, AlfredSchutz,
 called it the world taken for granted. 

More recently, a similar idea 
 has emerged in AjGreima's NaturalWorld
 which is natural in the sense of a natural language,
 natural to us as the language into which we are born.

Contemporaryphenomenology 
 has developed as a philosophy of NewThinking a phenomenology of life that 
  can be applied in different ways toward 
  solving various problems of InterSubjectivity.
   ...
Celms calls Husserl's phenomenological idealism life philosophy.

The history of phenomenology shows that 
 the notion "life", "live", "life world" and others become important in contemporary phenomenology. 
  Husserl's stand in his latest works is still connected with 
 the way, 
  which links phenomenology with its 
 turning to concrete subjectivity and its life. 

The pure life
 is the basis for reduction in Husserls phenomenology, acknowledges Celms.
 Life is grasped in phenomenological reflection. 

In describing the model of Husserl,s reflexive consciousness Celms 
 stresses that 
  life does not consist of objects but of experiences 
 (besteht mein Leben nicht aus Objekten, sondern aus Erlebnissen). 

We perceive experiences as an infinity of an immanent observation process.
