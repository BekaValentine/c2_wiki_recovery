The three territories of Canada (Yukon, NorthwestTerritories and Nunavut) collectively known as NorthernCanada.

Alternatively, anything further north than 100 miles from the southern Canada/US border.

By the 100 mile rule, both Calgary and Edmonton, with about 1,000,000 population each are part of the "Great White North". ''I've visited Calgary and lived in Edmonton, they are far from NorthernCanada. Check the map. - What is this 100 mile rule you speak of? 100 miles from the magnetic north pole? 100 miles from the nearest Ice flow? 100 miles from from Uncle Zeke?''

I think it is a real hoot to read such blatantly incorrect statements.  I often just shake my head in amazement when people make such absolute statements as are on this page.  It reminds me of Jay Leno and his Jaywalking feature.

''The 100 mile rule probably derives from the fact that a very large percentage (>80) of the population lives within 100 miles of the U.S. border.''

I love the humor of Bob and Doug McKenzie http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Underground/6756/takeoff.htm but they're not true Canadian representatives anymore than the stereotype of the Texas redneck is accurate.

I love the humor of RickMercer and his TalkingToAmericans special : http://www.canoe.ca/TelevisionShowsT/talkingtoamericans.html 

Thanks to our southern neigbors, we have too many Taco Bells, McDonalds and Wal-Marts.  We have too much cable, too many department stores just like Macy's, plenty of warm days and divided highways.

We don't have bears, midnight sun or rats.  Yes, we have mosquitoes and gorgeous long summer days.  In June, the sun is up at 4:30 a.m and it doesn't set until 11:30 p.m.

''There are no bears or rats in Canada?  That's amazing; there are lots of them in the US.''

Nah we got lots: The arctic is teeming with those cuddly white bears and pet stores carry those cuddly white rats.
