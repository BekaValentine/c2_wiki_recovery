"The difference between theory and practice is:

In theory, there's no difference between theory and practice."

ExtremeProgramming is a refreshing look at the problem.

There's lots of books and ideas and approaches to methodology, but
since I tend to be a bottom-up programmer, I tend to think of methodology
from the bottom up perspective.  

Basically, the mechanics throw people.

How to use the tools: compiler, editor, etc.  Some people have trouble at that level.

The more interesting level is just up from there:  source code control, automatic change logs, automatic builds & smoke tests, bug reporting/change tracking, etc.

The fundamental mechanical problem is communication and visibility.

The fundamental management problem is clarity of purpose.
