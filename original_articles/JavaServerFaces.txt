Anyone know anything about this technology beyond what Sun provides? Anyone used or considering using it? -- PaulMitchellGears

I'm "interested" in it only because I fear I'm going to have to be.  JavaServerFaces is the "officialization" of JakartaStruts by JavaSoft; it's incorporated by reference in version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, etc., etc. -- 65.221.130.254

Any connections between JavaServerFaces and RichInternetApplication''''''s?
- Not really.
