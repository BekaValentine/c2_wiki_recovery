I was first exposed to Smalltalk in a course at NorthCarolinaStateUniversity in 1987, using it sporadically until leaving IBM in 1994, and have been earning a living with it since then, in big shop/MIS situations. 

I am interested in the use of Smalltalk in small shops, writing for shrink-wrap, shareware, or small business solutions. My primary dialects are VisualWorks, VisualAge, VSE, and PocketSmalltalk.

I am currently an employee of FirstDataCorporation.
