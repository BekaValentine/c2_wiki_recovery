My surname is the 1341th most common in the US according to the 1990 Census. The alternate spelling, without the E, is a distant 58302th. So why do folks always misspell it?

David, did you remove the contribution attributed to you on CircleOfFifths?

The contribution in question was: "My piano is not well tuned, I must confess. Its temperament varies with the temperature. -- DavidBrantley"

I'd like to restore it unless it is your choice to remove it.

Thanks!
