SharedUrgency is the first item in the FormulaForSuccess, within the ChangeManagement context.

Without urgency, a large and / or diverse community cannot mobilize itself to seek an alternative to existing environment.

And if the urgency is not shared, then the forces of change can rip the community apart, instead of seeking BarnRaising solutions.

Sharing the urgency mean
* 1 - most of the stakeholders see themselves as stakeholders and see themselves as having meaningful participation in the changes processes.
* 2 - the stakeholders have a common agreement on the risks and issues.
