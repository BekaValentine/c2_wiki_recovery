'''AH-HA! I SEE IT NOW!'''

Everyone has experienced that joyful moment when the light flashes on -- the AhHa! of creativity.

''some enjoy it enough to pay for it. --PhlIp''

''Creativity.'' It is the force that drives problem-solving, informs effective decision-making and opens new frontiers for ambition and intelligence. Those who succeed have learned to harness their creative power by keeping that light bulb turned on. 

...

Through simple step-by-step exercises that require no special artistic abilities, Betty Edwards will teach you how to take a new point of view, how to look at things from a different perspective, how to see the forest and the trees, in short, how to bring your visual, perceptual brainpower to bear on creative problem-solving.

You will learn how the creative process progresses from stage to stage and how to move your own problem-solving through these key steps:

* First insight
* Saturation
* Incubation
* Illumination (the AhHa!)
* Verification

Whether you are a business manager, teacher, writer, technician, or student, you'll find Drawing on the Artist Within the most effective program ever created for tapping your creative powers. Profusely illustrated with hundreds of instructional drawings and the work of master artists, this book is written for people with no previous experience in art.
