If you too wrote a bowling calculator after reading the ObjectMentor article (http://www.objectmentor.com/publications/xpepisode.htm), you can post it below:

Here's my ErlangLanguage one (being a wimp and just giving a total score as output :-)

 -module(bowling).

 -export([score/1]).

 score(Throws) -> score(1, Throws).

 %% score(Frame''''''Number, Remaining''''''Throws) => integer() (score)
 score(10, [A, B]) when A + B < 10      -> A + B; 
 score(10, [10, B, C])                  -> 10 + B + C;
 score(10, [A, B, C]) when A + B == 10  -> A + B + C;
 score(F,  [A, B | T]) when A + B < 10  -> A + B + score(F+1, T);
 score(F,  [10 | T])                    -> [A, B | _] = T,
                                           10 + A + B + score(F+1, T);
 score(F,  [A, B | T]) when A + B == 10 -> [C | _] = T,
                                           10 + C +  score(F+1, T).

''That one is really pretty amazing.'' Amazingly unreadable is what I think when I see this solution. Yuck.  ''(That's perl for ya :)''

A far less amazing one by LeoScott and WayneConrad is at http://yagni.com/cgi-bin/pywiki?BowlingScores

That one sparked Chad Fowler to issue this challenge on RubyGarden: http://www.rubygarden.org/article.php?sid=38

To answer the challenge, DaveThomas wrote his own rather amazing minimalist version, which you can see here: http://wiki.rubygarden.org/Ruby/page/show/Dave_Bowling_Solution

    loop do
      if    (frame  = s.shift) == 10 then frame += s[0] + s[1]
      elsif (frame += s.shift) == 10 then frame += s[0]
      end
      sum += frame
    end
He combined the tests that tests from the original article and the tests that Leo and Wayne wrote and made
his code pass them all.

Here's how I would do a totalizer in evil PulseLogic. A squished macro pseudocode version:
 
 #define P(x)  ((x)<0?0:1)) //returns 1 if (x) >= 0
 int b[21]={1,4,4,5,6,4,5,5,10,0,1,7,3,6,4,10,2,8,6,0,0};
 int t=0, bx=0;
 for (int i=0; i++; i<10) {
	t+=b[bx]+b[bx+1]+P(b[bx]+b[bx+1]-10)*b[bx+2]; 
	bx+=(2-P(b[bx]-10));
 } 
 printf("The total is: %d", t);

I just read JackHarich's response to the ObjectMentor article 
(http://smile.jcon.org/soft/info/process/xp/BowlingGame.html).
He made two assertions that I take issue with.  First, he says that with his approach, the original design didn't change like it did for ObjectMentor.  Thus his design was better.  Second, he says that his code is higher quality.

The first issue is a RedHerring: the ObjectMentor came up with a design and then coded it test-first, with lots of discussion and refactoring.  JackHarich just coded his design, filling in gaps as he encountered them.  It doesn't look like he tried to change his design during the coding process... so of course, it didn't change!

The quality issue is more interesting.  Jack says that the ObjectMentor code "produced no artifacts and was uncommented."  Later, he says, "Note the high quality of this code compared to [ObjectMentor's]."

Well... let's look at that, shall we?

'''ObjectMentor code:'''
* Statements: 40
* Methods: 13
* Conditionals: 7
* Loops: 1
* Tests: 10

'''JackHarich code:'''
* Statements: 72
* Methods: 18
* Conditionals: 24
* Loops: 3
* Tests: 1

Jack's code is larger, employs ''much'' more branching, and has fewer tests.  By my standards, the ObjectMentor code is higher quality.  Also, Jack's non-code artifact, his class diagram, is out of date.  It displayed many more classes than are actually coded, and doesn't include all of the methods that were coded.

This experiment matches my experiences: up-front design will produce working code, but it's code that's more complex than it needs to be.

A quick note about the metrics: I counted statements by hand.  Only JavaLanguage statements were counted.  Class, method, and variable declarations were not counted.  The keyword 'else' was not counted.  The 'if' and 'for' statements were counted separately from their body.  (Thus, single-line 'if' statements counted as two statements.)

JackHarich's code includes a number of GuardCondition''''''s that throw RuntimeException''''''s, as well as a boilerplate print() method.  Since the ObjectMentor code didn't include these, I left them out of the Jack's final count.

This was my attempt at the bowling game in RubyLanguage.  I had read the whole Java dialog, so I had some idea on the algorithm that would work.

But I tried a little experiment.  Basically, I wanted to put myself in a bit of a hole when you make the complexity jump from spares to strikes.  When you just have spares in your tests, then you can have an algorithm where you basically score as you go, and when you see that you've completed a frame with a spare, you just make a little note to go back and update last frame's score on the next ball.  Unfortunately, the code is not shown here, but it was pretty simple and all the "spare" tests passed.  

I knew, though, that the strikes would make this approach really cumbersome, so I basically had to bail out on the approach, and load up all the rolls into an array beforehand, so that I could just do a double lookahead on the strikes.  It turned out to be not so bad. I basically was able to take my add() method and rename it to revisit(), then I added the array of rolls, which hadn't been there before, then I refactored the spares to use the lookahead (while on the greenbar), then I proceeded with the strikes tests. 

Here is the final code:

    require 'test/unit'

    class Game
        def initialize
            @roll = []
        end
        def add(roll)
            @roll.push(roll)
        end
        
        def revisitRoll(index, roll)
            return if @currframe > 10
            @pinsdown += roll
            @throws += 1
            if (@throws == 2 or @pinsdown == 10)
                advance_frames(index)
            end
        end
        def advance_frames(index)
            @frameScore[@currframe] = @frameScore[@currframe-1] + 
                @pinsdown + bonus(index)
            @throws = 0
            @currframe += 1
            @pinsdown = 0
        end
        def bonus(index)
            bonus = 0
            if @pinsdown == 10
                bonus += @roll[index+1]
                if @throws == 1
                    bonus += @roll[index+2]
                end    
            end
            bonus
        end
        def score(frame)
            score_whole_game
            @frameScore[frame]
        end
        def score_whole_game
            @frameScore = {0 => 0}
            @currframe = 1
            @throws = 0
            @pinsdown = 0
            @roll.each_index { |index|
                revisitRoll(index, @roll[index])
            }
        end

Here's a PythonLanguage solution that uses recursion in what I find to be a straightforward way. It wasn't the first way I thought of solving it, but I prefer it to some of the other solutions on this page because I find the logic to be easy to understand. It fits a standard pattern for recursive functions, and is fairly close to the informal way that you might explain scoring to a person. It could probably do with some more polishing, and testing. 

I must admit part of what made this difficult for me is that it's not easy to find out the exact rules for scoring bowling, and I had to infer them from examples and test cases I found elsewhere on the web. Plus, being Canadian, I've mainly done 5-pin bowling, which has 3 balls per frame, and I don't even remember how to keep score for that!

 pinfall = {0:0, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:5, 6:6, 7:7, 8:8, 9:9, 'X':10}

 def score(game):
    """ Recursively calculates the score of the tail-end of a bowling game.
    """
    # first three cases handle the tenth frame
    n = len(game)
    if n == 1:
        return pinfall[game[0]]
    elif n == 2:
        return pinfall[game[0]] + pinfall[game[1]]
    elif n == 3 and game[1] == '/':
        return 10 + pinfall[game[2]]
    elif n == 3: 
        return pinfall[game[0]] + pinfall[game[1]] + pinfall[game[2]]
    elif n >= 4:
        if is_digit(game[0]) and is_digit(game[1]): 
            return pinfall[game[0]] + pinfall[game[1]] + score(game[2:])
        elif is_digit(game[0]) and game[1] == '/':
            return 10 + pinfall[game[2]] + score(game[2:])
        elif game[0] == 'X' and game[2] == '/': # strike, then spare
            return 10 + 10 + score(game[1:])
        elif game[0] == 'X': # strike not followed by spare
            return 10 + pinfall[game[1]] + pinfall[game[2]] + score(game[1:])

''Very nice. Yes, I think that there is a case to be made for rewriting the methods for calculating score in a functional style, given that they are pure, stateless'' calculation ''which FP is naturally good at. Hmm...I think I'll just leave a little [untested, might be totally wrong] Haskell implementation here...''

    scoreFrame :: Int -> [Int] -> Int

    scoreFrame 0 _ = 0 -- Base case, scores of the frames *before* the start of the game are zero.

    scoreFrame _ [] = 0 -- Base case, if there are no frames, the score is zero (simplifies implementations somewhat)

    scoreFrame n 10:x:x':xs = (10 + x + x') + scoreFrame (n-1) (x:x':xs) -- If this is the last frame, this *won't* be called--strike is treated as a ten.
    scoreFrame n 10:x:[] = (10 + x) + scoreFrame n-1 (x:[]) -- special case, correctly handles strikes into uncompleted frames.

    scoreFrame n a:b:x:xs | a+b==10 = 10 + x + scoreFrame (n-1) (x:xs) 
    scoreFrame n a:b:xs = a + b + scoreFrame (n-1) xs
    scoreFrame n a:[] = a -- special case, correctly handles uncompleted frames.

    scoreFrame 10 xs = scoreFrame 11 xs -- Kludge-y special case, correctly handles the final frame

    score :: [Int] -> Int
    score = scoreFrame 10
