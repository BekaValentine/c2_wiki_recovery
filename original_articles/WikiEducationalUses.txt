A department of English site using Pwiki. http://www.ugruenglish.uaeu.ac.ae
JeffNelson did the heavy lifting to for this site. He notes that "[his]
colleagues who have participated in the site project are sold on Wikis
now. The ease of collaboration is a huge benefit." JeffNelson continues: 
"In the future, I want to add educational plugins to the wiki - maybe things
like classroom scheduling, interfaces to a student records database,
student progress recording... etc."

Anyone who's interested in developing a free computing curriculum online, please check out my wiki at http://itp.innoved.org/wiki/freecourse. I've recently added student objectives for each major section of the course, and would appreciate any feedback.

Garforth Community College is a school in Leeds, UK, currently trialling a Wiki site within its more conventional web site (ie., created using the usual web-building software applications). Teachers and Students are being encouraged to create their own pages on the wiki site using wiki page naming. Feedback to date is very positive, with all users commenting on how simple (and quick) it is to get a presence up on the world wide web.
