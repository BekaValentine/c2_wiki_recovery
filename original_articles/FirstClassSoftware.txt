First Class Software, Inc. is our attempt to balance 
work with the rest of my life.  Currently I am the 
lone full-time employee, while my wife Cindee Andres 
handles accounting, graphic design, and developmental 
psychology (for me and the kids). Our goals are:

	* Live in a peaceful place.
	* Raise happy (or at least interesting) children.
	* Work on what juices us.
	* Make enough money to set us and our kids up financially.

We realize any financial comfort is 
an illusion, though, so when objects are as passe' 
as Cobol is now, we're prepared to do lots of other 
interesting things to make a living.

Our fundamental observation is that the 20th century 
encourages people to give up responsibility for most 
parts of their lives without any concomitant benefit.
We're not Luddites, we just want to be conscious of 
the choices we make.
