Well, I'm a former DECcie from 1983, doing today independant consultancy on OpenVMS.

I recently discovered the WASD server (http://wasd.vsm.com.au) which allows VERY easy CGI programming in DCL.

I arrived in here searching www.alltheweb.com for COOKIES :-)

In 2004, I left VMS land and moved to Air Soft. I run today an Air Soft shop in Toulouse.
