This term usually refers to a Domain Name System which translates textual names into their 
32 bit Ip Addresses -- as in c2.com --> 209.162.215.78

Technically DNS stands for D''''''omainNameSystem and a DNS server either answers queries
or recursively queries other DNS servers until it gets an authoritative answer or the query times out.

A good resource for dns is http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/
