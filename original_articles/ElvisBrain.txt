ElvisBrain - http://www.elvis.ac.nz/ - is a wiki we've been running for the last year or two to support the ElvisSoftwareDesignResearchGroup in NewZealand.

ElvisBrain was originally a private wiki running QwikWiki; we have recently moved it to a public Web server http://www.elvis.ac.nz/ and are running UseMod.

ElvisBrain is world-writable; you are welcome to come and browse our work and discussions, although there is no guarantee that you will find it interesting or useful: rather the reverse.
