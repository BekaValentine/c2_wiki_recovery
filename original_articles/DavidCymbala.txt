The material I have put here is a 'work in progress' that could use some
reactions from folks interested in patterns and so on. I must admit that
I am new to writing patterns, but I'm giving it the old college try.

I have a background in biology, even though I program
and design software professionally in the financial
sector over the past decade or so. If you are interested
in complexity theory as applied to genetics that crosses
over to software systems, check out:

I am building up a pattern language that
has a biological kind of feel to it. Here
are the patterns in it:

'''Complexity Surfing:''' (?? hmmm...better name?)
	* BeeHive
	* ModelYourEnvironment
	* ModelYourSelf
	* AlternateHardAndSoftLayers
	* DecideOnThePrimitives
	* CreateFlexibleMessaging
	* CriticalResourceFlow
	* IsolateAndIntegrate
	* {''Something about building your own constraints''}

'''Additional Pages that just play out ideas:'''
	* CreativeStupidity
	* LongTermGreedyAlgorithm
	* CriticalNumberOfWorkers

'''Other ideas that need to be filled out:'''
	* ModelStrategiesOfOpponents
	* SendScoutsIntoTheUnknown

'''Related Pages:'''
	* TrainHardFightEasy (not mine, but it fits in...'internal' fighting?)
	* TrainHardPlayEasy (a little blurb I wrote...the page was already there)

'''Beginnings of something interesting....:'''
	* PatternPattern
	* MetaPattern
	* { Related Meta-Pattern topics }

''(Does MetaPattern apply? Also, afaik, Pattern Language Pattern remains yet to be written. --Falk Bruegmann)''

''The subtlety of what each pattern language communicates is still emerging''
''as new pattern languages are being written. Are we even ready to start''
''writing a Pattern Language Pattern? Perhaps '''someone''' just has to''
''be bold enough to start with something that pattern language authors''
''can react to. --David''

'''Unix Shell Patterns:'''
	* UnixShellPatterns (some nice ideas for script writers from JimCoplien, et al. Soon to be added to on another page.)
	* IncrementalUnixShellDevelopment (I'll be filling this out soon)

More to come soon...
