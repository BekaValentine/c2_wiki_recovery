'''The original page by this name has been deleted for at least six months prior to its recreation Apr05.'''

The purpose of the resurrection of this page is to link to resources related to exploration of cultural concerns at WardsWiki.

I am hoping the exploration would only be facilitated (not dominated) by people with these characteristics.
* Have had significant presence in contributing to WardsWiki.
* Are still convinced that "Wiki can work" as a tool for collaboration.
* Are convinced that other people with very different opinions probably have valid observations or viewpoints.
* Committed to continue behaviors in a civilised and discreet manner, should lack of convergence of views lead to parting of ways in the future.
* Contributors to sign their work during discussion.

'''Please leave this part unchanged. A duplicate copy of the above points is made available for review in the next section.'''

''During this initial definition phase, there is no expectation that contributors have to go with the stated rules. For example, as the creator of this page I have not yet revealed my identity, but will do so in due course.''

What is WikiCulture? What was it and what is it now?

Discussion:

Wiki in the beginning was naturally 'WardsWiki centered'. Now comes the age of distributed Wikiing.

On MeatballWiki:WikiCulture such WikiOnWiki topics are very welcome. Use the free SensivaTool to jump to the Corresponding Wiki Page with one gesture ;-). -- FridemarPache

''[only be facilitated by those who] Have had significant presence in contributing to WardsWiki.'' Doesn't this "rule" run counter to the very culture this page is supposed to talk about? Not that that wouldn't be a good idea, but I'm just sayin'. :)
