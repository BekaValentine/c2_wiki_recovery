''Knots'' by R. D. Laing.
[ISBN 0-394-43211-8]

As I read it this is a book about common psychological
problems, presented as a series of patterns.  Here is the text of the introduction:

	 :	The patterns delineated here have not yet been classified by a Linnaeus of human bondage.  They are all, perhaps, strangely familiar. In these pages I have confined myself to laying out only some of those I actually have seen.  Words that  come to mind to name them are: knots, tangles, fankles, impasses, disjunctions, whirligogs, binds. I could have remained closer to the ''raw'' data in which these patterns appear.  I could have distilled them further towards an abstract logico-mathematical calculus.  I hope they are not so schematized that one may not refer back to the very specific experiences from which they derive; yet that they are sufficiently independent of ''content'', for one to divine the formal elegance in these webs of maya.

Here is the first pattern:

They are playing a game.  They are playing at not playing a game.
If I show them I see they are, I shall break the rules
and they will punish me.  I must play their game,
of not seeing I see the game.
