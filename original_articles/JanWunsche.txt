I'm a SystemDeveloper and consultant. I have a background in heavy methodologies from my time at Objectory in Sweden, but now I'm completely sold on the idea of ExtremeProgramming. I'm currently a partner in the consulting firm Europoint Networking based in Uppsala, Sweden. For more info contact me at mailto:jan@europoint.se or take a look at http://europoint.se
