In seventies Marvel comics, if you wrote in to spot a mistake (''On page 5 Hulk has torn his pants. But on page 9 they're untorn again!'') the editors would not respond. But if you made up a back-story they would award you with a NoPrize. It generally arrived by mail in no envelope with no stamp and was printed on no paper ...

* ''On page 7 where Betty is slung over Hulk's back she's actually darning his pants with a portable sewing kit.'' Yes! You win a NoPrize! Excelsior!
