This site is pleased to host pages for local groups devoted to topics of interest to our readers. Several indices make it easy to look for groups that meet in the areas you live, work and visit. 

	* CategoryXpUsersGroup
	* CategoryPatternsGroup

We hope you will make a page for your group even if you maintain a web site elsewhere. We are particularly interested in knowing what you do, how to participate, and what has worked well so far. 

We may like reading your meeting notes too. Here are two things you can do to make your notes fit in better here. 

	* Keep minutes on your own page. Put notes from your most recent meeting before those of older meetings. But don't let your page get too long. Condense notes from the older meetings until the oldest meetings are just a sentence or two. We'll leave this editing up to the members of your group.

	* Write discoveries, conclusions and observations as their own wiki pages. Name them after the ideas, not your group. This lets us fully incorporate the ideas into our evolving web without feeling like we are tampering with your history. But be sure to mention in your writing that the ideas started in your group.
