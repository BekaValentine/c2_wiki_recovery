Some WikiEngines allow you to edit pages the standard way or append comments in a forum-like way. They are somewhere between "vanilla" wikis and a WikiLikeThing.

Advantages:

* Pages can be locked for edit but still open to comment (AppendOnly).
* UserName''''''s and datestamps are displayed next to comments.
* Users used to forums don't feel lost and get used to the WikiWay gradually.

Disadvantages:
* Encourages ThreadMode.
** ''ameliorated by WikiMaster''''''s subsequently folding comments into the main text where appropriate.''
* DatestampsConsideredHarmful.
** ''ditto''

Known examples:

* QuickiWiki/ClusterWiki
* ProjectForum
* OddMuse can be extended to support this feature, as CommunityWiki has done.
* MassMind is a WikiLikeThing that supports comment appending.
* WaGn (AppendOnly or not)
* WeRc (http://werc.cat-v.org) implements comments and wiki editing as orthogonal and complementary features, ie., AppendOnly is optional.
