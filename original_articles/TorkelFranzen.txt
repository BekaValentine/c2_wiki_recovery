A Swedish logician, philosopher, and computer scientist. 

Some of his favorite pastimes include correcting confusions
about Godel's Theorem which are often found on the net,
and, more generally, making a net-nuisance out of himself
by "taking potshots" at people who, "even if by no means a 
loon or sectarian, will either fight tooth and nail
to avoid having to admit to any mistake or defect in [their] 
reasoning, or else, [their] idea of a good time being as warped as
[his], happily continue arguing just for the sake of argument."

On the former, see http://www.sm.luth.se/~torkel/eget/godel.html) and
on the latter, see http://www.sm.luth.se/~torkel/eget/net.html.

These two pastimes can sometimes be indulged simultaneously, such
as can be seen at GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem.
