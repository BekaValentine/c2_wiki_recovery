A tag used by Top to indicate things aren't going his way.

''Actually, I can think of many good uses for this tag myself, and I'm sure that it is the same for others.  As for creating pages just to irritate Top, now I think that is pre-pubescent behavior.''

And your point is...?  Actually, Top created the WikiWord, I merely clicked on it. :)
*"pre-pubescent behavior"
* ''At least playful rude is a break from rude rude sometimes. -t''

Yes, yes, I got that.  Your problem with it is...?
*''If everyone behaved in this way, what would become of Wiki?''
*It would become like the rest of the Internet.

It wouldn't be a bad alternative tag to SpaghettiCode or GotoConsideredHarmful... right up there with DllHell, RpmHell, ClasspathHell
