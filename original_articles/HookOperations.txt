Intent: The HookOperations design pattern defines interfaces and mechanisms by which software is engineered to be flexible and extended by people other than its creators.  See http://www.stevenblack.com/PTN-HookOperations.asp

''This is related to the EscapeHatch.  Perhaps it is a subset?''

''EmacsEditor does HaveThisPattern in many places: hooks are run after loading and saving files, changing edit modes etc..''

Isn't this pattern called listener?

Listener, in my understanding, is about being told about state changes. This is about getting a chance to intervene before or after an operation.
