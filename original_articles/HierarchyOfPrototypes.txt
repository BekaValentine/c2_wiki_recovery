I published a typical ''Hierarchy Of Prototypes''
in a technical paper published around 1987 -- the paper was titled ''Prototyping Toolsets and Methodologies: User/Developer Sociology''
In that paper I distinguished five levels of prototyping:

	*PaperPrototype
	*StaticScreens
	*InteractiveScreens
	*MixedModeActiveModules
	*LaboratoryPrototype
	*FieldPrototype

I still think that these are the ''natural''
prototyping levels of fidelity.  --RaySchneider
