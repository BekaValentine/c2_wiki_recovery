 Last night, going up the stair
 I met a man who wasn't there.
 He wasn't there again today
 I wish that man would go away.

 Last night upon the stair
 I met a man who wasn't there.
 He wasn't there again today
 I think he's from the CIA.

More Poetry on Wiki!

Which reminds me of one of my favourite pieces of doggerel:

 Vanbrugh's wit
 Without Thought or Lecture
 is hugely turned
 to Architecture!

(Dr Johnson I think, its usually Dr johnson!!)

Vanbrugh, the playwright, became the Architect of Blenheim Palace, near Oxford,
the extravagent Great House built for John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, by a 'thankful nation' for his successes in the War of the Austrian Succesion.

Vanbrugh was more than ably assisted by the gifted disciple of Wren, Nicholas Hawksmoor, an epic Architect in his own right, (eg ChristChurch Spitalfields, London)

(Wasn't there a classic 'B' movie with the same title as this page?)
