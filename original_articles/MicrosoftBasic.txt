MicrosoftBasic has been split into VbClassic and VbDotNet. This page is intended to address overlapping concerns of the above two streams of VisualBasic, and maybe earlier versions of BasicLanguage as offered by the MicrosoftCorporation.

----
VbClassic is used as an analogy to the CocaCola Coke Classic.

In future, the CategoryVisualBasic page will be split as well, as most of the information either relates to VbClassic, or VbDotNet.
