Hello there!

I'm Henrik Mohr, I live in Copenhagen, Denmark (EU), and work in the daytime as a Java developer, architect and consultant. 

In the evenings, I run my own company (Webdata ApS - http://webdata.dk), and amongst other things write technical articles primarily for PC World Denmark (which only very minimally is associated with the online version at http://pcworld.dk).

Currently, I work most with WebSphere-based technologies, but otherwise with Java in general.
I also do jobs based on Microsoft (DNA/.NET), but I really don't like it ;-)
