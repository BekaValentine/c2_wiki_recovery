This kind of list was used as evidence that CeePlusPlusReigns.

One should take into account some noise factors in the SourceForge data:
* As it uses Sourceforge data, it is biased towards OpenSource projects and not necessarily indicative of popularity in proprietary systems.
* It is up to the developers to report their languages. Many projects have none of this metadata.
* Many projects report all languages used, of which one is primary and others are used for small amounts of glue. I don't think there were many projects that used primarily AssemblyLanguage, for instance.
* Many projects report for which language it is used, rather than which language it was written in. (Example: most of the ForthLanguage projects were actually Forth compilers, not applications written in Forth.)
* Many of the projects are VaporWare, MyToyProgram, or inactive for years (though this list has been culled since 2003).

Very interesting. I am astonished to see JavaScript slightly ahead of DelphiLanguage/Kylix, and more popular than all flavors of Lisp and all other flavors of Pascal combined.

''In the end, this is only one data point. There are many other ProjectHost''''''s, many language specific. Another measure (Yahoo directory links) is on ProgrammingLanguages.''

''And http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm has popularity trends over time. It uses Google for its data and appears to be aligned to the software job market, rather than the OpenSource community.''

The "tpci" seems very unscientific as it uses keyword popularity as the indicator. There is no way to google for "C" without being completely overwhelmed by noise. It is also tainted by the fact that a language may have more "help pages" than a more popular language (but the language with more "help pages" would seem more popular).

None of the above have considered SpreadsheetModel as a ProgrammingLanguage. When I started to explore the MicrosoftExcelProgrammingLanguage, I found there is a huge secondary market related to education, consulting, third party tools. And the demand and pay scale for a good Excel consultant is much better than for the average website developer. I have made the wrong bet on traditional programming languages.

VRML is not a programming language - at least not any more than HTML is.

Top languages used in the GoogleCodeJam qualification round.  So these are languages used in the small because people are familiar with them and they are suitable for quick problem solving (one day time limit to solve half a dozen problems).

The subsequent rounds after most entrants are eliminated are dominated by C++ (75%), followed by Java and Python.
