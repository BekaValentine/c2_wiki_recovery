* using something like a wiki ''as the OS''
* various wiki used to discuss particular operating systems, or operating systems in general.

OsWiki is the idea of writing and using an OperatingSystem at the same time by several people over the web. While the idea is not entirely original, for example see the ForthLanguage and the entire unix family, WikiWiki is the perfect metaphor for this idea.

	* You probably would want to see some kind of VersionManagement for the code source, which is something some WikiWikiClone''''''s offer too. Because the code is supposed to provide some service, it would be good to have UnitTest''''''s and FunctionalTest''''''s.


	* Similar goals have been stated a long time before in the GnuHurd, http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd-paper.html. So, maybe an OsWiki is a way to not only have an OS that can be modified, but to provide an easy to use interface to actually modify it. Naturally it would use a NonHierarchicalFileSystem the WikiOs filesystem.

	* SmalltalkLanguage can definitely be like this, especially if you realize it isn't a language per se, but an environment. Take some existing Smalltalk Wiki and allow embedded Smalltalk commands in the pages. You're pretty much done. That kind of WikiOS would look somewhat like a distributed component network. 

	* The NomicGame often ends up with lots of work for the one in charge of executing the rules. If rules proposals where given in the form of a function in some programming language, everything would work completely automatically.
