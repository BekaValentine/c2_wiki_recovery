Which David Brown?  Good question.

	* DavidBrownAtLucida
	* DavidBrownAsWell ''(Would it make sense to rename this page as well?)''

''I added the link to DavidBrownAsWell. Maybe the content of this page should moved to, say, DavidBrownAtLucida, and this page should be left with links to the two pages with a brief description of which is which?''

Done
