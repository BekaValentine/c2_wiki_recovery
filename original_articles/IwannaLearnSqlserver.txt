To learn SqlServer, first get a copy of MicroSoftDataEngine that can be obtained freely from a number of sources.

Make sure the version you get has SQL2000 capabilities.

Then try to get a copy of SQLBooksOnline, which is a help file. If you cannot get it free using normal channels, then you have to obtain a free tutorial from the net, or something similar to help you overcome the learning barrier.

Also important is to get something similar to the SQL Enterprise''''''Manager tool, and I think clones exist somewhere on the net. The real version only comes with a package that costs money to buy.
