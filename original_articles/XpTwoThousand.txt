Having gotten safely back from the GREAT conference, I would like to express my gratitude. Thanks for a really great conference. I really enjoyed it. I am looking forward to attending XpTwoThousandAndOne :-) --OdinnSorensen

I also really enjoyed meeting the people from wikiWiki, putting a face to a name and then having an interesting discussion.  Diving off the boat into the clear blue water wasn't half-day either.  ...and I jumped off the tour bus to stay in a little hotel (where I am writing, now), just a walk away from the large hotel-cum-conference-center which will be next year's venue.  Hot sun, sand and salt water will be close by, next year. --AlistairCockburn

The main thing I have to say is that the electronic medium doesn't do many of you justice, especially UncleBob.  Perhaps an example of how much information is lost when moving from face-to-face to electronic communication.  And of course, there was the guy with the ear ring who was pretending to be AlistairCockburn.  "Alistair Cockburn?  Yeah right, I'm looking for your father." --JasonYip
