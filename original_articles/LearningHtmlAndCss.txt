HTML is HyperTextMarkupLanguage, the language Web pages are written in. CSS is CascadingStyleSheets, which are used to control the appearance of Web pages.

'''Are use of frames important?'''

Inline frames (IFRAME) has raised attention recently (end 2004) due to security risks. It probably also mean that there are significant use of this feature (MS version) across many sites.

'''Questions and Answers'''

'''Q:''' In an HTML page's <a href="..."> tag, can you refer to a file in a different directory, or does HTML expect all files to reside in one directory?

'''A:''' On one's own WebSite, one can use the link creation syntax to point at any page, absolute or relative.
* <a href="T''''''hisIsInTheSameDirectory.html">This is in the same directory.</a>
* <a href="../U''''''pOneLevel.html">This is in the directory above.</a>
* <a href="some_subdirectory/page_of_interest.html">This is in the directory below.</a>
* <a href="../A''''''notherDirectory/ADifferentPage.html">This is in a sibling directory.</a>
* <a href="/index.html">This is in the top-level directory</a>
* <a href="/2005/another_page.html">This is in a subdirectory directly below the top-level directory</a>
* <a href="http://c2.com">This is somewhere entirely different.</a>

If you refer to a subdirectory that doesn't exist, it will not be created. Instead, the Web server will generate an error, usually a "404 Page Not Found".

Note that <dd> has nothing to do with the <a> tag -- <dd> is used to build definition lists. (It does not mean "default directory".)
