  ''Flush the scissors down the hole''
  ''Your getting old''
  ''Your getting old''

  ''And I hate to remind you but you're going to die,''
  ''And you're going to be needing all of your lies.''

  ''Youâ€™ll be all alone,''
  ''When the animals cry,''
  ''All by yourself,''
  ''In some infancy's lie.''

  ''Someday soon''
  ''Someday soon''
  ''Someday soon''
  ''Someday soon''
