Hi,  
I develop software in C/C++/C#/Python and I'm very interested in ComponentBasedDevelopment, ObjectOrientedProgramming, DesignPatterns, ExtremeProgramming and AutomatedTest''''''s (I know it's part of ExtremeProgramming).

I'm a senior developer in Sony PlayStation. We do a common software platform and products like PSX.
