ConvergentDesign is a stray thought (the worth of which is up in the air) similar to EmergentDesign in that design evolves as an iterative process of small steps and quick feedback loops between programmer and users as the problem and solution space gets explored.  Move the programmer to the user work area.  Colocation and all that.

My experience has been that I can't tell the code-mangler what to mangle because I don't know in the beginning. ProcessIsMoreThanCode.  I can tell you the BusinessProcessParameters I use to tell if IsItBetterThanItWas and IKindaKnowWhatIWant but my rule of thumb is to NeverGiveUpOnSerendipity
