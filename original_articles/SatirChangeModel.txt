''Virginia Satir, a pioneer of family therapy, developed a model of how individuals experience change''

The Satir Change Model says that as we cope with unexpected or significant change
* we predictably move through four stages: 
** Late Status Quo
** Chaos
** Practice and Integration
** New Status Quo
