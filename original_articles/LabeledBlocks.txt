Some questions and answers on the establishment of LabeledBlocks

 Q: Are references used, or "labeled blocks"?
 A: LabeledBlocks could contain markers to ExistingBlocks, such as functions or curly-brace blocks.
** If references are used, they could also include (but not require) a "closing" marker
** Each and every word, sentence, paragraph, description, chapter, program, and process which exists 
    would qualify as H''''''yperLinks, and could be made reachable by existing or provided interfaces and/or processes.

 Q: Are the actual categories to be stored in the source code, or in a separate structure/database that links via a marker-ID?
 A: Neither, as they would 
** simply exist, and 
** have an addressable, reachable location.
* This could include Artifacts of different location, scope, size and be reachable as entire storage artifacts, such as a drive, or directories, sub-directories, documents, pages, processes, or states

 Q: Similar questions apply to meta-data.

 Q: If a coded approach, should it simply have an ID number, with the rest of the info kept in a separate database or system?
 A: That would make it an indexed database and would severely limit flexibility and extensibility.

 Q: Should markers be hand-keyed or machine-generated?
 A: Each Artifact should be separately identifiable and exist so that it can be made reachable via a H''''''yperProcess or H''''''yperTag.
