For many years, Borland's software development products didn't use "regular" Windows command buttons, they had their own version, which immediately gave away whether a Microsoft or Borland environment had been used.

The buttons featured icons along with the text which animated when the button was pushed in, before being released to complete the "click".

The icons were confusing at best, and an AmericanCulturalAssumption at worst:

	 :	Cancel was fairly understandable, being a red X.
	 :	Retry featured a slot machine.
	 :	Ignore was a white sign saying 55 that flipped over (?) to show an infinity symbol... that took some working out for Brits.

Actually, this points out a problem with icons - images carry much more cultural information than text. Frex, the configuration management tool we currently use has a row of icons across the top to allegedly facilitate use, instead of having to go to the menus. One button has a flying white bird on it - what does that mean?

''A panic button? Press this if the system is goosed.''
