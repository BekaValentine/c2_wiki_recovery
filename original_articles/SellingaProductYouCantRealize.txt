SellingaProductYouCantRealize is a management AntiPattern that consists in promising the customer you will be able to deliver a marvelous product that you know in advance you will be incapable of developing.

The context is often making a product that will have quite complex or unusual technical or functional constraints such as:
* High end availability and/or scalability,
* Mathematical complexity,
* Huge amount of data,
* Huge transactional throughput,
* Very complex business rules,
* Extreme parameterization,
* NotTheAppropriateProtocol,
* NotTheAppropriateTechnology,
* etc.

For sure, you can make a big fuss about this product which honestly has incredible features. The project that follows is generally reviewing objectives far lower.

I think of this as "Design by Contract."  The contract is signed, so we've got to write these features!
