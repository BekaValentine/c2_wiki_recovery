A book by LeeSmolin.

The book contains a theory of Smolin's which he emphasizes as an alternative explanation to that offered by the AnthropicPrinciple (in either form, the WeakAnthropicPrinciple or the StrongAnthropicPrinciple) in regard to certain implications of the StandardTheoryOfElementaryParticles.

The purpose of the book is less to present or defend this theory than a context to talk about much in the history of science and the scope of what science is able to talk about.
