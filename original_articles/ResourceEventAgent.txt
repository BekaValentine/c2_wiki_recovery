Resources, Events and Agents (REA) is an economic ontology fathered by Professor William Mc''''''Carthy (BillMcCarthy) of Michigan State University and developed for the past 20 years by Mc''''''Carthy and a band of students and colleagues.

REA is a distillation of common business interactions into a very few moving parts, most notably:
	* Economic Resources = for example goods, services, money.
	* Economic Events = production, consumption or transfer of Economic Resources.
	* Economic Agents = people or "parties" who execute Economic Events.

Those three concepts and a few derivatives can describe any business interaction or system.
