Recently found two intriguing things through unrelated paths:
	* WikiWiki
	* ExtremeProgramming

Interesting that they converge....

Back in 2001 I have hacked NotesWiki, because I'm a LotusNotes guy and wanted to do something sensible for a change :-)

My interest now is in Ruby and RubyOnRails

''That's cool! I used to work for DaimlerChrysler which is a LotusNotes user too. I wanted to have a Wiki back in 1998 and the internal developers said it would be very hard to do. The internal development was estimated to be +10.000 DM and we had no BusinessCase for it. At that time we went for CvWiki. -- FrankGerhardt''
