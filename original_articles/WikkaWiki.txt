'''WikkaWiki''' is a lightweight WikiEngine written in PHP, which uses MySQL to store pages.  WikkaWiki is a fork of WakkaWiki, to which a number of new features have been added. It is designed for speed, extensibility, and security. Released under the GPL license.

'''History'''

In 2003, the development of WakkaWiki came abruptly to an end, although a large community of users and contributors was still actively posting bugfixes, extensions and new functionalities.  First released in May 2004, WikkaWiki rapidly grew into a project aiming to remain faithful to Wakka's heritage of a ''lightweight'' engine with ''readable and accessible code''. The latest version (1.3.1, http://docs.wikkawiki.org/WhatsNew) was released on 31 Mar 2011. This release includes some security patches, many bug fixes, and new functionality, including relaxed page-naming requirements (CamelCase no longer required!), a new RSS feed generator, several new actions, and theme improvements.

'''Wikka vision'''

WikkaWiki's ''flexibility'' and ''easy adaptability'' to the user's needs - including the nonprofessional developer's - are among the most prominent and appreciated features of this engine. Compared to heavier WikiEngines, which integrate several built-in functions, WikkaWiki's goal is to keep its core ''as small as possible'' while developing an architecture that supports easy ''extensibility'' through plugin modules.

'''Wikka features'''

(http://docs.wikkawiki.org/WikkaFeatures)

Among the distinctive features of this wiki engine, it is worth mentioning the following:

* Support for different types of embedded elements: 
** images; 
** Flash;
** tabular data;
** safe HTML code;
** RSS feeds; 
** i-frames;
** Freemind data and maps (see MindMap for more information);
** "menulets," small actions suitable for embedding in custom menus

* User-selectable and modular theme support.

* Administration modules to manage pages and users, including tools for bulk operations like user removal or page reversion.

* Advanced (but optional) ''access control'', with user registration, password management and provision for user profiles, as well as access control lists for page access.

* Advanced ''Syntax Highlighting'' using GeSHi:
** support for 68 markup/programming languages;
** easily customizable output;
** (optional) line numbering;
** clickable markup pointers to official documentation;

'''Wikka niceties'''

* W3C compliant XHTML 1.0 transitional and CSS markup.
* A CSS-defined printable view.
* Advanced tools for publishing page revisions, including: 
** RSS feeds for recent modifications;
** WikiPing client functionality, allowing page changes to be broadcast and tracked on a remote WikiPing server.
* The ''SmartTitle'' function, dynamically retrieving page headers from the body, frees users from the use of CamelCase words as page titles and enhances visibility on search engines.
* An intuitive web-based upgrader from WakkaWiki.

'''Development'''

Forthcoming releases will (possibly) include:
* Enhanced configurability (e.g., user selectable/editable skins and menus)
* Dynamically-generated user documentation
* Scripts for retrieving and integrating content from remote wikis.
* Nested/threaded comments
* Revamped architecture to support independent development of "pluggable" modules
