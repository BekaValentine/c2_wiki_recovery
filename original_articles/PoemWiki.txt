 Let's raise the tone of our converse
 By rhyming everything in verse;
 To rhyme is harder than to prose
 But pithier and less verbose;
 A poem, ripe with potent signal
 Displays wisdom in its original
 Text, received pure from the Muses,
 Unsullied by noise, rust, and abuses.

 Further rhyming enlarges the mind
 Exercising forebrain with the hind
 Mental quarters - what better than scansion
 To add some rooms to your mental mansion?
 In even doggerelish limericks
 Lie enlightning, delightful gimmericks
 Dispense with prose and all blank verse!
 Forestall the EndOfWiki curse!
 Today, tomorrow, from now on
 Make WikiPage''''''s ring with song!

 I tell You dears, in sweetest candor
  Who are Dense with Alexander
 Rhyming words like 'Bee' and 'Sea'
  Made Edgar Allan Poe a Tree
 Impatient fingers drumming, drumming
  'e' and 'e' were slow in cumming...
 Finish up at any cost
 This steely helix, crossed and crossed --
  My chain link fence to Robert Frost.

'''Drivel:'''

An example of SeparateThreadsFromContent.

''Rhyming is only one of several methods of forming sound linkages in poetry. Actually, a poem is defined as a bunch of text presented in structured form. So that if it is reproduced, the line breaks and positioning need to be reproduced as well. This paragraph is not a poem then.''

Actually, poetry has nothing at all to do with the presentation of text on a page. Poetry is a verbal medium; poems are meant to be spoken and to be heard. Line breaks help to determine the intended spoken rhythm of a poem, but "a bunch of text presented in structured form" is not a poem any more than "a bunch of lines and dots written on staves" is music.

"No, not exactly.  Not all poetry needs to be read aloud or heard.  That is certainly where poetry was started, but poetry can be designed specifically for the page.  In this case formatting issues would be absolutely critical.  So although poetry can be a verbal medium, it is not defined that way, at least not these days.  Visual poetry is legit, too."

''Okay, I'm not deaf, but may I suggest that poetry can have both visual and auditory parts, and that each may delight different audiences?''

 You say that I am full of shit
 And lacking in important wit
 My reasoning is all askew
 And hasn't anything to do
 With logic, beauty or good grace;
 Shame should redden up my face
 And hairy palms wipe tears away
 From dimming eyes - Onan's dismay
 Was all the dues that I could pay;
 A failing mind weren't all inside
 My egg-shell skull and woe betide
 Those sloppy egg-white bits of brain
 That ran out from their own disdain
 For nasty foolish bad ideas
 That festered here between my ears.
 I'd say you're right, but that would take
 More art and thought than in me bake. -- Pete.

Observing the above, the rhyming portion is a lot easier to grok than the HaiKu. Rhythmic poetry in general seems too hard. But then others may find it easier to HaiKuMe than RhymeMe. Try it and let's see!

''Haiku ain't that rhythmic, either.''

i came here to escape the killing floor
many pages died tonight
and i alone am ishmael
to tell the tale

i am mishima

hero mishima
of sun and steel the author
dead by his command

but all that aside
thanks for this sanctuary

this line in the first wikipoem on this page struck me:
''A poem, ripe with potent signal''

reminds me of

''A poem should not mean
but 
be

palpable and mute
as a globed fruit''

When wording Wikis,

One wonders

''WHY''?

''WHERE''?

''WILL''

words work?

or worsen-

wearily,

wildly, 

waste

wordless 

''wisdom''?

'''''WHAT?'''''

'''''S.'''''

 finding wiki brave and new
 not quite certain what to do
 so I'm trying out a rhyme
 to play within the paradigm
