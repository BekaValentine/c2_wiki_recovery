Dear Ann Landers'
I am writing in reference to the lady whose husband throws her past back at her when they argue.  My advice to her is to dump him.  I am presently married to a woman who has a past.  She was up front with it.  That  was then, we are the now.  If this is his way of winning an argument, it is in very poor taste.  If he truly loves her and puts a full 100%of effort toward the relationship, this tacky scenario would not have taken place, let alone be thought of. I married my wife for who she is, what was, is not an issue, nor should it be..ever.  Have this numbskull read the 13th chapter of 1st Corinthians.  If he remains with the same thought process, throw him out with the bath water and go find an honest man who will love you for who and what you are.  You love someone for who they are not what was.
sign me a decent man in New Hampshire.
