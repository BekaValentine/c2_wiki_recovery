Sometimes a behavior is learnable, but not yet learned. 

TheCoach may create a chart that shows the status (usually over time). By putting this chart in the public area, everybody gets a reminder of where the team is on this, and visual feedback of the team's progress.

For example, many teams have a graph showing the progress of AcceptanceTest''''''s over time - how many tests passed, how many failed. Or the team may have a chart showing status for each test.

As another example, WardCunningham once created a matrix with developers listed on both axes, and asked people to put a check in the box for each person they paired with during the iteration.

When the behavior is internalized, the team will often remove the chart.

'''Single Person Projects (MicroIsv-s)'''

Big Visible Charts aren't just beneficial to teams.

For a single person project, the priority is on:

* accountability to my stakeholders (family) 
* focus (to keep me working on the right things)
* urgency (to constantly remind me how much work still needs to be done)

To satisfy these purposes my BVC has:

* Work Breakdown Structure (printed by MS Project)
* Schedule (a linear calendar of 4 weeks)
* Backlog Tasks cards (taken from WBS to show what is coming up)
* Current Scheduled Tasks cards (taken from WBS to show what is currently being done)
* Recently Completed Tasks cards (to show stakeholders what has been accomplished)

Here's an example of a BigVisibleChart I use for a single-person project in my MicroIsv business.
