Click the title above to see all DesignPatterns that have been categorized as BehavioralPatterns.

Behavioral patterns based on ''class'' tend to use inheritance to describe algorithms and flow of control, whereas the Behavioral patterns that target ''objects'' usually describe how a group of objects collaborate to perform some task that no single object can perform alone.
