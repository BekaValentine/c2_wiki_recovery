Juggling plays only at the surface of this book. It is really about learning and teaching, and about understanding individual learning curves; each with its unique hills, plateaus, and valleys. It is full of useful suggestions for lowering frustration levels, and for getting un-stuck when the inevitable learning ravine is reached on the way up the hill.

Much of what is said in terms of juggling translates easily into other contexts. Consider what you might substitute for "juggling" in the quote below:

	 :	"If you are not making mistakes, then you are not really learning.  To learn how to juggle, you have got to be willing to drop balls.  Anticipate unavoidable mistakes such as dropping balls, and reframe them as integral parts of the learning process.  Viewing mistakes as essential parts of the learning process makes any learning faster and more fun."

Parts of the book went a little far into mind/body for my tastes, and I skipped over the juggling poetry, but still recommend it, especially for those in "learn or die" mode who need to lighten up a little.

A bit unrelated, but it might be interesting anyhow:  When I learned juggling, I often found it useful to have a few extra balls and to sit on the floor.  That way I didn't have to crunch down every time I lost a ball.

Standing in front of a couch works very well - you don't need to bend over to pickup your balls.

Also, if you find yourself walking around the room chasing after the balls, stand close (uncomfortably close) to a wall (elbows at your sides, fingertips should touch the wall).  The wall will keep the balls in one plane.

Juggling seems to be more popular with engineers (including programmers) than with other types. Of the adult jugglers I know, three out of five (including myself) are engineers, and a fourth is a chemistry major. I could be imagining things. Does anyone else know of juggler groups that seem to be filled with hackish types?
