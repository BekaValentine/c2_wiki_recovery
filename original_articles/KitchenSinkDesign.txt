Sometimes in producing the specification for a product about which you know little or nothing, you will be uncertain just what the product should do. You will be under pressure from impatient executives desiring revenue, and impatient developers desiring something to code.

Therefore...
	* Obtain detailed information on all products relating to the one you are charged with specifying;
	* Throw in a few products in unrelated areas;
	* Always include at least one spreadsheet, and a BASIC-like ScriptingLanguage (i.e. CustomizationViaProgramming).
	* Paraphrase all features in your own words;
	* Do not be concerned about duplications;
	* Group features into at least 9 overlapping headings;
	* Alphabetize within headings.

Correct use of this Pattern will ensure that the development will take so long, the documentation will be so obscure, and the users so confused, that you will be certain to be able to write memos about what the other departments did wrongly, for years to come.
