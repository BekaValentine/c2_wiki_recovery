This is a page about JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition (J2EE) best practices.

Ted Neward raised some exceptions to the 20 point suggestion made in early2003.

One of these involves "loose typing" (waiting for more input from person who asked in QuickQuestions).

Ted's link for his views is located at http://www.javablogs.com/ViewEntry.jspa?id=20185

GlennVanderburg blog of http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Software/Languages/2003/05/17 also has comments on types. Maybe some kind WikiZen can link all related things together so we MicrosoftSlave''''''s can be jealous of what we do not know we have.
