If you're a hard-ass in all your negotiating, you can build a lot of enmity. Your colleagues will see you as grasping and set on short-term gain alone. You'll miss opportunities because of this. And you'll get bad karma, which is worse.

'''Therefore,'''

GiveAwayWhatYouDontNeed. Got some code or a document you can share? Don't sell it to them, just share it with them. Don't mind travelling? Then don't make it a deal-breaker. Happy to get their options? Accept 'em. Give them skills for free if the skills aren't going to be used much. And stop negotiating when you feel content - don't go for the last few pennies.
