http://www.pobratyn.com/phpwiki -- Dedicated to Science Fiction

It's an attempt at a ScienceFiction wiki - a sort of repository for info, stories, etc.. You can add anything you want, the more it has something to do with SciFi - the better;-). Put up your own stories if you wish. The woytex wiki was set up on 2001/02/20 at 16:15:03 GMT +1.
