Here is my standard blurb. 

"David O'Toole has been programming in various Lisp dialects (mainly
Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp) since 2004. Since becoming involved in the
vibrant Lisp games development community, he has released several
games written in Common Lisp (including a well-received puzzle game
called XONG.) David has had a long-term interest in studying and
improving the software and hardware tools used by teams of creative
people, including a stint at Irrational Games in Boston (2003-2005)
and independent collaboration and research."

I decided to update my blurb and homepage link on here because I've been 
reading the c2.com wiki for a long time.
