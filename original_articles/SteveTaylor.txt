Steve Taylor has been an editor, technical writer, Perl developer -- all in shades. Programming and related work included dBase (1979, 1983); WP macros 1986; VB managing a database/1986; 1995 a bit more intense with Oracle and Perl; Emacs; Vi.. (Sure, there were spring chickens back then. With dark hair :-). But Wikis and the web could be forums of ''change and growth..,'' we hope.

Even Wiki history ... people like WardCunningham, CliffordAdams, ScottWalters - add the list of people behind open source, html, browsers.
