''Welcome to Wiki. (I take it you are a person, not a definition.) Now I know what 'anand' means. I happen to know a vegetarian restaurant called Anand Bhavan which served '''the tastiest''' almond halvah dessert. Unfortunately, the restaurant lost its lease a few months a go and had to shut down. :-( Now I need to find out what 'bhavan' means. -- ElizabethWiethoff''

Well, bhavan means a palace (or hall)

''Thanks.''
