I'm a full Professor of Computer Science at the University of Bern,
where I run the SoftwareCompositionGroup.

Together with DennisTsichritzis I have edited a book on
SoftwareComposition.

I am especially interested in ProcessPatterns and ReengineeringPatterns.
If you are an author, programme committee member or PC chair for a conference,
you might be interested in IdentifyTheChampion, a process pattern for
running programme commitees.
