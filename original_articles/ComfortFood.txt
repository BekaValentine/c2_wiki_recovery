A ComfortFood is something you fondly remember from your childhood. The psychological benefits from consuming it usually outweigh the nutritional benefits. Wikizens are invited to list their ComfortFood''''''s below.

* Grilled cheese sandwiches (Velveeta cheese on white bread.)
* Toll House cookies and milk
* Pizza.
** For my parents, Chef Boyardee pizza (nothing at all like "real pizza") is a comfort food.
* Peanut butter & jelly on white bread (with chocolate milk).
* Monosodium Glutamate (aka Chef Boyardee)
* HappyMeals, boxed junior sized meals with drink and trinket, ''a la'' StarWars, etc. for younger set (ages 3 to 10)
* Cold cereal which goes to great lengths to include oddly colored marshmallows, cartoon mascots, more sugar than vitamins, and absolutely does not contain *bran or nuts.
* pretzels and a non-alcoholic carbonated beverage
* Ritz brand crackers crumbled into a glass, fill glass with milk, eat with a spoon (my SO thinks this is disgusting) ''so do I'' [I used to eat saltines in milk with sugar! mmm]
* Campbell's chicken noodle soup ("Thanks, mommy") For a nice take on this, see http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=20030308172420.12392.00000138@mb-ba.aol.com
* Yorkshire pudding
* PennsylvaniaDutch "pot pie" (which isn't a pot pie in the normal sense of the word--more like a stew made from beef, chicken, or ham, with very large, thick noodles, often dressed with pickled vegetables)
* Hamburger Helper
* custard pudding (rice, tapioca, chocolate, etc.)

Alternate definition having nothing to do with childhood: a ComfortFood is any food with enough concentrated fat and calories to give you an undeserved warm fuzzy feeling.

In Texas:
	* Chicken fried steak with cream gravy, corn & mashed potatoes with brown gravy.  Both gravy colors add extra comfort!

Some documentary I was watching pointed out that most comfort food is fatty, salty and sweet. Donner kebab, please!
