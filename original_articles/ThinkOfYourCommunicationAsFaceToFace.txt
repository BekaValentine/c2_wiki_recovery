While CommunicationsDependOnClarityOfPresentation, they also depend on the understanding of DialoguePractices. One must understand that a wiki conversation is not a monologue. 

It is a face-to-face conversation, where each conversant takes turns speaking and listening. When A presents, B should be listening. When clarification is required, B asks questions while withholding lengthy objections. It is the listeners aim to understand the other's ideas well enough to express them in his own words.  When this occurs, the listener can switch to speaking and the speaker can become the listener. Remember however to OnlySayThingsThatCanBeHeard.
