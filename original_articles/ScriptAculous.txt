Perhaps you've heard of AjaxWebApplications? Well, http://script.aculo.us/ is the meat. There are various competing libraries but RubyOnRails uses this by default so it's clearly in front.

Thank goodness there is a .ar TopLevelDomain. One of these days I'm going to register acul.ar and put up a website called http://crapt.acul.ar/.

''Great idea. That's better than the BbEdit site http://it.doesnts.uk/. Your crapt.acul.ar sounds much more WebTwoPointOh.''

I've been meaning to register http://ridiculo.us for a while.

''No good. For true Web 2.0 cachet, you need the subdomain, like so: http://ridi.culo.us/.''

* How about http://specio.us?

Good point.  Note to self - investigate availability of http://id.iot.ic domain.....

''I know the guy with grou.ch and cou.ch...''

The .ar TopLevelDomain belongs to Argentina, and here you can't have a domain unless is in a defined subdomain. For instance: .com.ar or .edu.ar or .org.ar. Sorry, crapt.acul.ar will have to wait.

No relation to DelIcioUs.
