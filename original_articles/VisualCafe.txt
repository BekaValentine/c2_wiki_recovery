A JavaIde developed by Symantec, subsequently sold off to WebGain.  It has now been sold to TogetherSoft. Then Borland bought TogetherSoft.

See http://www.webgain.com which has sold all of its intellectual property, including TogetherSoft.

VisualCafe was the first commercially successful JavaIde, but later releases were quite buggy.
