Update 2008-09-16:  The product is no longer available, as indicated at http://www.diamond-sky.com/download/

That's one more advantage of physical cards or open source software tools:  availability.

''I love how if you click on their Products link, Iterate Expert edition shows up, with the tagline, "For when index cards are exactly what you need."  I got a good chuckle out of that one.  Still, you cannot blame them (him?  her?) for attempting to build their/his/her (as appropriate) own company/career by riding a definite trend in the market (at that time, at least).  In a way, it's kind of sad.''
