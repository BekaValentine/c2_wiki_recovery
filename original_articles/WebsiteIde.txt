I think of a WebsiteIde as an integrated environment that lets me manipulate the various aspects of a modern (2002) website, using VisualAge-style interface technology.

For example, I'd like to be able to step through the evaluation of HTML/XML.

''Say again?  Stepping through the evaluation of HTML/XML?  That doesn't make much sence to me.''

I'd like to be able to seamlessly change a specific named color and have that change propagate to images, style sheets, and HTML/XML.

I'd like to be able to declare a fragment of text, such as a menu label, as the value of an Ide variable so that when I change it, the corresponding change is propagated to images (such as rollovers), HTML, and JavaScript.

I'd like to be able to simultaneously develop and debug JavaScript and the HTML that calls it (including HTML it might generate).

You get the idea.



Yeah get the idea. Was thinking on the same lines too. Will be a good replacement for those resource hogger IDEs specifically the ones available for Java.

'' Check out Mozilla with the Web Developer extension, VenkmanDebugger for Javascript and the DOM inspector.  This combo used along with your favorite text editor with balls (ultraedit, vim, emacs, etc) could come pretty close to what you desire.  That being said, you can't confuse HTML as a programming language.  You don't "debug" HTML, you either make it valid, or you don't.''

Also, Apple's SafariBrowser has an optional Debug menu, from which you get a whole bunch of goodies for debugging your web pages and JavaScript.
