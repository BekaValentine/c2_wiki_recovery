An application architect and mobile specialist at Atos.

Previously Chief SystemArchitect at Symbian, a mobile OperatingSystem company (http://www.symbian.com/) [SymbianOs].

Symbian do very little apart from licence; their legal department is the most important, so I left. Then they closed down. Probably for the better as the kernel had some design flaws.

I am also a ScrumMaster.
