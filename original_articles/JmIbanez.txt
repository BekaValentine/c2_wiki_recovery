JmIbanez is Jan Michael Ibanez, a student at University of Asia and the Pacific (http://www.uap.edu.ph) in the Philippines. He is currently taking up Information Technology studies at said school. And by the way, he plans to conquer the world someday.

He knows JavaLanguage, CeePlusPlus, CeeLanguage, and started programming on BasicLanguage. And yes, he did touch VisualBasic once in his life. (Okay, twice. Happy now?)

''By the way, this WikiWiki thing is interesting. I did code up an ad-hoc less-than-a-WikiClone in almost-pure JSP, with some JavaBeans because my webhost didn't support per-user servlet contexts, and so couldn't run most of the Java-based WikiClones out there''
