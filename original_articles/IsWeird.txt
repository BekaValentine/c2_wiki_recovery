IsWeird: proposed boolean property of many objects

Indeed. That reminds me of some renaming I've been doing in Java recently:

	* Exception handling ~> Exception hindering (humbling, fumbling)
	* P''''''ageNotFoundException ~> P''''''ageNotFoundEnigma (Expletive, Explosion etc)
	* Infrastructure ~> Infraslopsure as in "exception fumbling infraslopsure"
	* XProcessor (eg R''''''equestProcessor) ~> XProcrastinator
	* XManager (eg S''''''essionManager) ~> XBureaucrat (Obstructor pattern) ''(XMangler)''
	* delegate() ~> void passBuck()

I've felt for years that much of our naming in code (just as in job titles and product names) is nothing more than conceit or "marketing". The perjorative approach is not only highly therapeutic but more concise (because it mainly uses code) and without the bogus self-righteousness of loads of FixmeComment''''''s. It engenders the right kind of ExtremeHumility, counteracts the burgeoning Java hype (especially the self-importance of knowing the dark side of some fairly average class libraries) and provokes a genuine desire to refactor. Enough of this stuff and everyone begins to realise they could be looking at a HugeRefactoringOpportunity. -- RichardDrake

I've been told that many programs (especially EmbeddedSystem''''''s) periodically do a SanityCheck(). Someone told me there was a euphemism for that, but I've forgotten ...
