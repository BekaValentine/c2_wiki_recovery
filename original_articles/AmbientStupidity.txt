Ambient Stupidity represents a nightmarish vision of the future where we shall be repressed by ubiquitous electronic environments that allegedly are there to aid us.  Designed to be sensitive and responsive to people, they shall misjudge our intent and fail us at the worst possible times. Humans shall be trapped in a web of productivity-reducing automation that does what it thinks you want, but never what you wanted.

Actually...we're there now, aren't we?

''These darn computers...they never do what I want them to do, they only do what I ''tell'' them to do.''
