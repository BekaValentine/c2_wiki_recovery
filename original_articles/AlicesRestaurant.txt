The only reason I'm editing this page now is 'cause you may know somebody in a similar situation, or you may be in a similar situation, and if you're in a situation like that there's only one thing you can do, and that's browse to the wiki [blog, group], wherever you are, just browse in and type "Wiki [blog, group], You can get anything you want, at AlicesRestaurant.". And log out. You know, if one person, just one person does it they may think he's really OffTopic and they'll delete him. And if two people, two people do it, in harmony, they may think they're both PairProgrammer''''''s and they'll delete both of them. And three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people browsin' in typin' a verse of AlicesRestaurant and logging out. They may think it's a project. And can you, can you imagine fifty people a day, I said fifty people a day walking in typin' a verse of AlicesRestaurant and logging out. And friends they may think it's a movement. And that's what it is, the AlicesRestaurantAntiMassacreMovement, and all you got to do to end war and stuff is edit this page the next time it comes around on RecentChanges. With feeling. So we'll wait for it to come around on RecentChanges here and edit it when it does. Here it comes ...

BushSucks. Now what can an AlicesRestaurant do about that? Maybe it really is just a song?

Alice's Restaurant isn't around anymore (it's now Theresa's Stockbridge Cafe.) But, as the song says, "Alice didn't live in a restaurant. She lived in the church nearby the restaurant..." And the old Trinity Church, where Alice once lived and where the saga began, has become home to The Guthrie Center and The Guthrie Foundation.

So it all started one Thanksgiving ago - that's one year ago, on Thanksgiving - when my pair and I were programming when AR came on the 'net radio. I turned it up, and discovered my pair had never heard it before. So I made her listen.

So later on when the pit conversation turned to the WarOnSomeTerrorism that had just started, she asked if anybody was excused from the Homeland Insecurity issues.

I sang to her, "You can get anything you want at AlicesRestaurant."

Got the record. Saw the film. The Alice track is the ''entire side'' of the LP. It takes me back, which I need right now. Thanks. -- JohnFletcher

I grew up with AlicesRestaurant on the turntable (along with TomLehrer, but that's another story...); I think it's infused into my psyche in some disturbingly deep-seated way. With that background, I have to say this page is one of the best bit's of SelfReferential humor I've seen - ever. Bravo! -- GeoffSobering
