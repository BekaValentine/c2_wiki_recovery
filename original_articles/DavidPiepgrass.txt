Sorry if I use ThreadMode, but I'm new here.

'''Minimal Biography'''

I'm into computers, particularly aspects that affect the whole computer world: HCI (human-computer interaction), operating systems, computer languages, and ways computers can teach their users how computers work and how to use them. I'm also interested in technical writing and ways to use computers in education. I have a decent voice and love to sing; most of the music I like is pop.
