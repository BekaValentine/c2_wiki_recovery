I design & program (C++) custom applications in Minneapolis.
My interests lie in OOD and now patterns.  I used to think of myself
as an OO person who works in C++. . .  until I heard JimCoplien
speak on the multi-paradigms in C++.    Now I desire to be
a C++ developer who knows all of the paradigms of C++ ( OO, 
templates, procedural, etc. ) and knows how/when 
to apply them in my designs.

There's so much to learn, but I get to my goals by 
persistent reading, studying, and applying.  I find
most people (in all professions) ''want'' to be at a 
higher level, but not enough to ''work'' for it.

I have forged a position for myself within my company:  
ReuseRepository Manager.  I proposed the idea, and 
I was granted the authority--as long as I remain productive 
in day-to-day projects.  

I'm grateful for the opportunity to manage this project.  This is an excellent
opportunity to apply theory, develop ideas/techniques, and experiment
in a real-life/business-setting "lab."  I hope to write a paper or two on
my experiences and submit them.  Any offers to publish me?

If you read ''Software Development'' magazine, note that Racko Roland 
used my letter (from "Randy C") to start into his current discussion on an 
organized program of reuse.

I hate to bother busy and public people, so any questions
are infrequent, succinct, and pertinent.  My sincere thanks to 
JimCoplien and JohnVlissides for responding to my recent 
questions via email.

My hobby is keeping and breeding freshwater tropical fish.  
I've bred over 100 species in five years.
