I think this list should also be categorized by the requirements. Requirements vary. See ChoosingaWiki and look for your favorite features. Other pages may exist that do some breakdown by features. 
Make it a SimpleWiki - those very simple with no database required or use only textfile db. 
Or PortalWiki - those not only a wiki but also integrated other things to setup a web portal, like TikiWiki does. 

RandyKramer started this page as a "master list" of all known WikiEngines, WikiFarms, and maybe WikiForums at WikiEngineReviewWikiLists. He copied and merged several lists to make this one.

Hello. I want to write my own Wiki engine basically from scratch. Are there any usable modules out there that I can import? I noticed that "GNU Diffutils for Windows" would be good for managing diffs. I'm planning to use a flatfile organization scheme rather than a database/MySQL scheme. I'm also looking for a good "Wiki text to HTML" converter. I was thinking of "OutPage", but are there any alternatives?

It pretty much has to be a from-scratch organization, because I want it to be a major overhaul. I'm planning to introduce a Wiki moderation system that will eliminate all edit/revert wars and make spamming the Wiki a waste of time. I figure it's simpler for me to roll-my-own than understand other people's code, but modules that could be used as-is would be very helpful.

''By definition, a true wiki allows immediate updates, so it can't have a moderation system.''

So then make up a separate name for this program. That still doesn't mean it isn't worth writing. There still would be immediate updates. They just wouldn't be promoted to the "main" version of a page until they were moderated. People could browse the "moderated" version by default or say "show me everything, including spam and rubbish".

''Yes, a lot of people believe that it's faster/simpler to roll their own code than to understand other people's code. Permit me to cast some doubt.''

Some "Wiki text to HTML" converters: "libtext-wikiformat-perl", "libwiki-toolkit-perl",  some of the MoinMoin plugins, parsewiki, python-textile, stx2any, and probably a few others I'm forgetting. I think these are all open-source.

I hear that some versions of MediaWiki have a "patrolled button" that sounds similar.
Some pages on MeatBall don't go live until they have had no edits for 3 (?) days, which is assumed to indicate community agreement and consensus.

''How can something go live after three days when no one has ever had the chance on seeing any content, lest editing it?'' --CarstenKlein

Hey there, here is very nice article about the beginning of Wiki-Systems in german language.
It's called "Tanz der Gehirne", in english: "Dance of the Brains": http://humanist.de/erik/tdg/
