[VotingPatterns]

A form of secret ballot.  Each voter has a black marble and a white marble.  Once the issue on the floor has been discussed, each person puts one of their marbles into a bag.  Once everyone has voted, the bag is tipped up, and the marbles counted.

In the Freemasons, I believe, when voting on whether someone should be admitted into the order, the presence of a single black marble is sufficient to deny their application.  Hence the term ''blackballed''.

''(And they put the other marble in a second bag, so no one can tell how they voted by looking at the remaining marble.)''

Is the secrecy compromised when a voter says, "Hey, I need my black/white marble back"?

''Yes, but it would also be compromised by the person standing up and yelling "Hey! I voted against you, you turkey!"  (One assumes that the voters '''want''' their votes to remain secret.)''
