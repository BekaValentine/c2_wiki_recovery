Here are patterns for partners and parents.  

(Odd, isn't it, that techniques that work well with peers might also work well with children? KenMeltsner)

Partners:
	* FightFair

Parents:
	* PositiveCommands
	* AnswerAllQuestions
	* SleepProblems, FamilyBed
	* PairParenting (!)

Partners as parents:
	* ResponsibilityRelief
	* TimeOff
	* UnifiedFront

You know, we have the makings of a pretty good parenting book here. It would be an interesting experiment of the power of Wiki to see how close to a real book we could come.
