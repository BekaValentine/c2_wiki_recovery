''Seamless Object-Oriented Software Architecture: Analysis and Design of Reliable Systems'' by KimWalden and JeanMarcNerson.

[ISBN 0130313033]

This book describes the Business Object Notation (BON) method for software development. I highly recommend it as a book and as an approach to developing software. The back cover explains that the book shows how reuse can be achieved by applying three key principles of software engineering in an object-oriented method:

	* '''Seamlessness''': the ability to turn software construction into a single, continuous process.

	* '''Reversibility''': the ability to go back from implementation to design and analysis.

	* '''Software Contraction''': which applies pure object-oriented encapsulation to produce precisely specified, industrial strength reusable components.''
