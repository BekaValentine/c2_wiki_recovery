A board game invented in the 1980s for two players.

There's a mystery person on your opponent's card. Can you find that matching face in the crowd? Start with a game board full of funny-looking suspects. Then ask the right questions to eliminate the wrong faces! Once you're down to a face or two... solve the case by guessing who! Does your person have a big nose? No. Is your person wearing a hat? Yes. Now you can flip down all the faces without hats! Guess your opponent's mystery person before your opponent guesses yours.

Some people use a bizarre variant in which you are only to ask questions about things that might be inferred by their appearance, rather than simply about their appearance.  Such as "Does your person look hung-over?" or "look like a log-cabin Republican?" and so on.
