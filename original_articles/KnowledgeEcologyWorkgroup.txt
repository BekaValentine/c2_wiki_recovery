Over the last 6 months, a small team of people have been developing an exciting concept and the first phase of establishing a KnowledgeEcologyNetwork (KEN).

Knowledge ecology is an interdisciplinary field of management theory and practice, focused on the relational and social aspects of knowledge creation and utilization. KEN will only become a vibrant, global community of knowledge workers if all members can find and create opportunities for continual learning, and if all members learn to respect the sharing and contributions of other members.  Interestingly, it is much easier to talk about Knowledge Ecology than to practice it, although many people are trying very hard to develop the bonds of trust that will make the project succeed.


We have developed the initial elements of the design focused on the social, knowledge, business, and technology architectures necessary to sustain KEN and support its evolution.

We are now entering our second phase. We need to refine the architecture and design, complete the business plan, prepare marketing and promotion materials, and develop initial services which will become attractors to new members.  The KnowledgeEcologyWorkgroup will last four months, after which the new forms of self-organizing that may emerge from our work will take its place.
