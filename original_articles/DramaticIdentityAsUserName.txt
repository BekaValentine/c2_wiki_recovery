Anonymous contribution has long been the favored approach to wiki editing, but if you use a UserName, it should be your RealName.

Some users have chosen to adopt DramaticIdentity names as UserName''''''s.  This is:
* Against WikiSocialNorms.
* Explicity addressed on RealNamesPlease.
* An inviting opportunity for WikiVandals, as we have seen lately.

Please refrain from using DramaticIdentity names as your UserName.  There is no harm in signing contributions with a DramaticIdentity, but the UserName cookie has a different purpose.

If you are using DramaticIdentity to hide your RealName from WikiVandals, consider removing the UserName cookie completely.  Violating WikiSocialNorms with DramaticIdentityAsUserName may lead others to assume you are a vandal.  By editing without a UserName cookie, you are allowing other users to identify your actions as your own, and prevent WikiVandals from coopting your DramaticIdentity to cloud others' view of your actions.
