I find myself listening to PurposeSupportingCliche''''''s in meetings regularly.  If someone wants to adopt an IndustryStandard, the counter is NotInventedHere.  If someone wants to adopt a new gimmick (IfItsNewItMustBeBetter), then the counter is NotWidelyAcceptedPractice.  And so on.  Occasionally (just occasionally) one of these discussions will actually get into the merits of a product/methodology/etc. and something useful will happen.  The ClicheDrivenArguments pretty much go nowhere.
