What is MoreWikiThanWiki? TiddlyWiki. 

Maybe there are other candidates for this ... but if they can beat, say, http://www.tiddlytools.com then they're in the realm of genius ...

''How are you defining "wikiness" here? So far, this looks like a blatant ad, with no useful information that isn't also on the TiddlyWiki page. --TimLesher''

Um, it's a rave, but not an ad - I discovered TiddlyWiki at 4:30 am. yesterday morning. As for the reason why it's MoreWikiThanWiki, hooked up to pytw the server is a wiki and every page is also a wiki. For the first time you can email someone a wiki. TiddlyWiki''''''s evolve in both form and function as they pass from mind to mind. TiddlyWiki achieves the original vision of Ward's WikiBase, which no other wiki does. It's also a step towards ManaMana.

It's still not an ObjectOrientedWiki or AjaxSmalltalk ... but it's getting closer. --PeterMerel.
