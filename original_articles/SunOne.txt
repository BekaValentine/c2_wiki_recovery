Anyone in the know going to give us a potted overview?  --TomAyerst (still ploughing through the hype)

There is a lengthy white paper at http://www.sun.com/software/sunone/wp-arch/ that provides a reasonable overview, once you get past the smart services emphasis.  It provides web services using the key technologies of XML and (obviously) Java and all their derivatives, all done over standard protocols.  More acronyms than you can poke a stick at. 

	* Delivery to clients is using (X)HTML, VoiceXML, WML, SOAP, SwA, XMLP etc. using XSLT to transform data for particular clients
	* Service lookup via UDDI
	* Security through LDAP directories, PKI, SAML, XKMS etc
	* Web service runtime components are J2EE and J2ME
	* Services communication and processing via ebXML, BPML etc.
	* Services management via SMNP, CIM etc.
	* Development with JAX(B|M|R)
