the book of boot

chapter 1

1 in the beginning, root created /var, and /usr.

2 and /usr was void and empty, and darkness was upon the screen of the
terminal; and the spirit of root moved over the drives.

3 and root said, let there be sh. and there was sh.

4 and root saw that sh was good; and he divided the sh from the void.

5 and he called the sh "/bin/sh", and the void "/dev/null", and there
was boot and halt one session.

6 and root said, let there be a partition made amidst the drives, and
let it divide the drives from the drives.

7 and root made a partition, and divided the drives that were under
the partition, from those that were above the partition, and it was
so.
