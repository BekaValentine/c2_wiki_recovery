A StateDiagram visually shows the possible states a node of an abstract machine may go into, and the possible transitions among states. Heavily used in all application areas that use FiniteStateMachine''''''s, such as electronics (where such are used to e.g. design PLAs), and the theory of grammars.

It has recently seen more widespread use in software due to its incorporation into UnifiedModelingLanguage, where the machine undergoing transitions is an object of a class.

	 :	UML State Chart diagrams depict the dynamic behavior of an entity based on its response to events, showing how the entity reacts to various events depending on the current state that it is in. Create a UML State Chart diagram to:
		* Explore the complex behavior of a class, actor, subsystem, or component.
		* Model real-time systems
