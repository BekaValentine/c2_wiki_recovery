ExtremeProgramming made me think about this (as strange at it would seem)...

John Henry was a SteelDrivingMan. Sure, as the legend goes, he dies after beating the steam drill (new-fangled code-generating case tool), but that's not the point. Sure, he worked in awful conditions (modern day programmer working against unrealistic deadlines), and sure he toiled as a laborer for the railroads (modern day programmer working for large uncaring corporation).

But, he practiced PairProgramming (see SteelDrivingMan) and was an advocate of DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork. He used simple tools with sweat, grit, skill and determination. He became the stuff of legend (see http://metalab.unc.edu/john_henry/story1.html).

Or did he fall into the trap of HeroicProgramming?
