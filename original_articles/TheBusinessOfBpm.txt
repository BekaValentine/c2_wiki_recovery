What is the Business of BusinessProcessManagement (BPM)? Once that is answered and endorsed, then the people involved can go about implementing strategies in making things happen, related to its mandate.

Recently the local BPM community have been asked:
* Q: ''(Your) views and expectations of what the BPM Community is there for?''
* A from one response: '' (Hopefully) the BPM Community can become a trusted and credible advisory to sponsors of (firm XXX) BPM initiatives, and that the BPM processes will be relied upon as a stable process glue, to help realize (firm XXX) investments in planning, program and project initiatives.''

Those of us in the WikiCommunity who have contact with BusinessProcessManagement communities, do you have anything to share regarding "the Business" of BPM?
