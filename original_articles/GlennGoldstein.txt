Now over 5 years ago, I spent over a year at iBelong/Redwood/Verilytics introducing, installing, and running the XP process as part of my tenure as the Director of Development.  We completed over 20 iterations and the project was very successful in a number of ways.  We didn't find all aspects of XP useful and attempted to integrate offshore development into the mix with some success.

I was interested in examining other agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum) in addition to XP but have not had the opportunity.  Overall I felt that XP was intriguing but ultimately could only be successful in a limited number of situations where you had the right mix of project, sponsor, and especially developers.  Recently there is interest in using agile processes here at Avery.  I will provide updates if anything develops along these lines.
