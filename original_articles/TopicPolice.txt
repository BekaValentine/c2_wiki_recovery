Okay buddy, stop that editing right where you are. Fingers in the air. Spread 'em! Don't you know that this is WardsWiki? And WardsWiki has a code of OnTopic''''''ness, bud. Okay, so Ward never actually specified it. But other people did a long time ago. So it's the law. Make one OffTopic edit and I'm going to put you in DeleteOnceRestoreOnce. And if you don't abide by that you are obviously an anti-democratic enemy of all WikiZen''''''s, and deserve what's comin' to yer. Me and my possee will make you wish you'd never set your browser on the place ...
