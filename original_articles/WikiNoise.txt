WikiNoise is the random background anti-pattern of no value. (At least the average of all the WikiScore''''''s of all the WikiWord''''''s defined in the current page)

Random WikiWord''''''s will have a WikiScore. This WikiScore range between the talents of a WikiButcher and WikiWizard. Currently this WikiScore is from 0 - 10, with 0 having no value (ZeroWiki) to 10 being a WikiWizard to a WikiWizard (InfiniteWiki)

I estimate the WikiScore of this page at 4.

See: SignalToNoise.
