WikiArchaeology is digging into wiki asking questions about its past. 

''Is that all there is to say about WikiHistory''?

I think there is more to it that that. WikiArchaeology for me is following a thread into wiki and finding answers to questions which I did not even know existed. I have just followed up the only reference to this page. It is PleaseDontDeleteMyName and it turns out that I started it 10 years ago (July 2002) and probably created this page as well. I meet my past self and say hello. -- JohnFletcher
