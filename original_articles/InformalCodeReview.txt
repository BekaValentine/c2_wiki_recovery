A counterpart to the CodeReviewPatterns page for noting and discussing informal, rather than formal, CodeReview processes and patterns.

When PairProgramming is not possible, an InformalCodeReview usually is good enough. XPers may disagree with this.

'CodeReview's are not about avoiding random defects (although it might reduce the number of random defects introduced in a project). 'CodeReview's are about reducing the number of repetitive defects in a project. Once a project fixes a defect that is all over the place, the same defect can be reintroduced in another part of the project, just because people are used to code that particular way. CodingConventions and 'CodeReview's are the medicine to relieve that illness.
