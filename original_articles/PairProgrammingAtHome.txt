PairProgramming at home together with a visiting programmer.

Benefits from PairProgramming at home:

	*You don't get lonely, which is often the main problem for telecommuters.
	*Other people (wife, kids, visitors ...) are less inclined to disturb you when you are two working together.
	*It feels more like "real work", so you are less inclined to be disturbed by other domestic tasks.
	*It is easier to set and follow a time schedule (to avoid over/underwork)
	*If you find a partner living close to you transportation time/cost will be low/nonexistant.
	*Rotating which home will be used as workplace creates a change of scenery.
	*You may encounter an opportunity to have a dinner with the family of your co-worker.

Could maybe be called ExtremeTelecommuting?

You could imagine that a small team of programmers, living close to each other, could create a VirtualCompany and have all the benefits of both PairProgramming and TeleCommuting.
