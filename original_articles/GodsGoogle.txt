The SearchEngine the Gods use, for finding stuff like:
* the parents or "family" of a cell that may have drifted hundreds of miles away, or be deeply hidden in trillions of other unrelated cells;
* a soul in heaven (really hard to do without GodsGoogle);
* a soul in hell (you don't really need GodsGoogle, but it makes it easier);
* a particular atom in the universe, and its relationship with other atoms, by using the names of the stars that created those atoms by its fusion process;
* who is going to die tomorrow, next year, or two or three eons from now.

Any being that would have to resort to googling isn't much of a god, if you ask me. Sounds more like a human. -- BrucePennington

''It's meant to be a humorous clarification of a reference on LimitsOfHierarchies. The essential notion is that of a "super-Google" that can find anything, not whether or not an omniscient, omnipotent deity needs one. Don't take it too seriously, Bruce.''

And never mind that QuantumMechanics tells us there is no such thing as a "particular atom", that's entirely beside the point. -- SveinOve

It is perhaps possible technically to build very power search engines that go beyond word matches and associations (maybe at Angel level, not quite God), at least if performance is put on the back-burner (being an experiment at this point). However, the hard part is likely HumanComputerInteraction. Either it attempts to parse English and other natural languages, probably getting it wrong often, or the user has to learn something akin to ProLog in order to be precise enough for the computer.
