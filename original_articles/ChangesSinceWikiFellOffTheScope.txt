''Last time I was out in the world was June 2005. Now it's October 2007 and GoogleLovesWiki again. I wonder what all happened while I was away? --WikiWikiWeb''

Lessee ... you missed out on

* HurricaneKatrina
* RubyOnRailsRulesTheUniverse ''(but, thankfully, doesn't rule WardsWiki!)''
* WardCunninghamLeavingMicrosoft and then WardLeavingEclipseForAboutUs
* The untimely demise of Pete's LimpinwoodTeahouse
* Wiki has become a OnePileFilingSystem with pages hovering at about 32500 or so.
* The war of bots over preserving/disregarding spelling and syntax errors, -- or -, comma or semicolon, etc. has continued without letup, making it much more difficult to see what is going on in RecentChanges.
** I don't know about "without letup" - been some signal on RC the last couple days. You don't suppose?
* Many people who have interest in building, interaction and dialogue have gravitated elsewhere. Might come back if this place starts working again ...
* TheCppStandardsCommittee are at work on C''''''eePlusPlusZeroEx (now CeePlusPlusEleven)
* Other important events?

You could take a look at the backlinks of the ImplicitTopics for more?

''This is a page about stuff that wiki didn't think about because of being (a) lobotomized by RC spam and (b) deserted due to google-invisibility. Wiki knows precious little about June 2005 - September 2007. It's like it had a long lost weekend or something.''
