This PHP based wiki was inspired by KeheiWiki (Kehei is written by BobRacko). Features include:

	* Unable to create change it here
	* Easy autolinking to the uploaded files
	* An admin area to create and remove new areas (with a separate user access list)
	* Modular construction
	* Template driven
	* '''All links''' and pages are derived from the apache PATH_INFO env variable, so the URL's are tidy and search engine friendly
	* listing all or some topics in an area with one tag
	* Easy deletion and renaming of topics
	* Most administration tasks happen from right inside the wiki
	* revision backups and restores
	* web-based user administration
	* web-based template editing

One of the changes I made that makes it less-strictly wikiish is that autolinks are defined only by percent escapes. This seems to work well for my purposes.

Find it at http://www.2gn.com/source.html ''This link goes to the same site that PWiki points to--is this the same wiki or a previous name?''

That wiki forum is closed. It's there only to document my implementation.
