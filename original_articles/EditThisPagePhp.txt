'''''Edit This Page PHP'''''

At the fundamental level, EditThisPagePHP basically just let you remotely edit a single page. There are many situations where existing Wiki or Blog software is too complicated, or imposes too much structure. EditThisPagePHP lets you have total control over the HTML - you can use sophisticated CSS layouts, or very simple HTML - the software does not get in the way. 

Yet in spite of this simplicity, EditThisPagePHP also uses ideas drawn from various Wiki, Blog, and CMS (content management system) technologies. Like Wikis, it supports an edit-this-page button, page history, page diffs, and can email users when pages change. Like Blogs, it supports optional user comments, trackbacks (both send and receive), and delivers two RSS feeds - one for the current version of the page, and one with diffs. Like a CMS, it supports multiple roles, by default a reader, an editor, and a super-editor - each with different privileges. 

It is useful for standards documents, lists, game rules, and home pages or anytime a group of people want to maintain a publicly accessible page together that needs full control of the HTML. 

EditThisPagePHP is a PHP script that let's you edit the HTML content of a page by following a link on that page. Only two files are required: the core PHP script (editthispage.php) and a data file for your page. The core file can support as many pages as desired.

It currently works with PHP 4 and 5, and does not require SQL. Every revision makes a backup of itself, so no data can be lost. PHP is not allowed in the HTML text itself, to minimize security risks.

Future goals are to support more Wiki-like features, without losing the elegance of the one-script/mutliple-page implementation. This may include simple Wiki TextFormattingRules, RCS, etc. 

The current version 0.5b2 is at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=95462

A demo is available at http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/demo_05b2/index.php. The demo has an account with username "hackersinci", password "incibey" that allows access to the body content of the page, and other administrative features.
