''When buying many software packages, it is almost an expected thing that Updates may be required and thus have been provided for in their installation (usually with the understanding that users will allow AutomaticUpdates) -'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20141026

If you have many software packages installed and have opted out of automatic updates, you may upon booting the machine have multiple notices of such every day. It is something users have become accustomed to and have come to expect, thinking it is a GoodThing to do. 

It seems to me that the period between updates is shorter than it was a couple of years ago. Reasons for updates are sometimes given, though most often only through separate descriptions not included as part of the update process.

I have many software packages, and update nags appear several times a day ( as many as a half-dozen ). I don't use the packages at such a frequency, not depending on updates to provide security. I just assume packages are insecure, either because of poor construction, or other (marketing) reasons. I want to buy a package once, and depend upon voluntary upgrade purchases when performance can be increased or when wanted new features are UsefulUsableUsed.
