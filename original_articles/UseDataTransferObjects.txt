This was a name for a pattern that I later wrote as "Replicated Object" in my PLoP99 submission.  Do people like this name or the name I chose better?

The pattern can be found at

Should we really use "Replicated objects" when data is not read-only ? i.e in case of entity beans should we copy data from entity beans into data transfer objects and pass them by value ? The pattern described in above pdf is interesting; but we use entity beans(CMP) to reduce complexity in coding and designing. By using the approach (which according to me is complex), are not we violating the purpose ?
