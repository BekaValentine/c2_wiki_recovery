''Whenever one of these starts, you pause at the doorway and linger, hoping to take part in it.''

It came from the page of AlistairCockburn, where he wrote...

"I stumbled across the notion of a ConversationYouCantStayAwayFrom. Whenever one of these starts, you pause at the doorway and linger, hoping to take part in
it. For me it started when I was designing hardware... I went past a doorway and heard/saw them discussing a look-ahead typing interface ... I paused and wanted to take part, but had nothing to say. My next chance was some direct manipuation UI design I was doing on a piece of software (1986), where I lingered, making it more pleasant to use. ...I got drawn steadily farther into cultural, sociological and cognitive issues in software development, and enjoyed the conversations steadily more. ...I can't stay away from this conversation, and it gets more interesting as I proceed. 

"...A serious programmer is either a person to whom programming is their
ConversationYouCantStayAwayFrom, or who hasn't yet found their ConversationYouCantStayAwayFrom. LifesJustTooShort, so it is important to discover that conversation and live there. --AlistairCockburn"

Its always great when another person welcomes you into a discussion/conversation and thereby moves your 'pause' and 'lingering' to wholehearted participation. Obviously something about a CodeOfHospitality
