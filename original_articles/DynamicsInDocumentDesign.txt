"Dynamics In Document Design: Creating Texts for Readers", by KarenShriver

''Dynamics'' is a good book, and a model for other attempts to define an evolutionary change in an old discipline.  The book walks the reader through the tools of the "new" technical communication/writing: usability testing, scientific research on font choice and use, effective (as measured by usability or perceptual research) graphic design, etc.  There's also a chapter that provides a historical perspective on the field which gives much of the context needed to understand why a book like this is needed.

The book is grounded in practical examples and references to the open literature.  A good book.
