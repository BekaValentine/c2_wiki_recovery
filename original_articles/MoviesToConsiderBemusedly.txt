From MoviesToConsider

Here's a list of movies that tickle programmers, with their (programmerly) commentary on them):

'''Laugh 'Til You Pee in Someone Else's Pants:'''

	* '''Airplane!''' - routinely tops "funniest movie of all times" lists, and routinely places in "best movies of all times" lists. It will ruin the entire gritty self-important melodramatic 1970s big-star disaster flick genre for you. ''"You can let yourself out the back. There's juice in the fridge."''
** {Both the good gags and the bad ones will stick in your mind forever.
*** {''http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/ Robert Stack as Rex Kramer keeps cracking up. it still works. (This typography is correct, by the way.)''}
	* '''God of Cookery''' - Steven Chow's mind boggling Hong Kong style Iron Chef. 
	* '''Fierce Creatures''' - John Cleese (et al from A Fish called Wanda). In order to make a profit a (former) petting zoo must house only fierce creatures. Excellent British-like humor.
	* '''ThePrincessBride'''
	* '''The Adventures Of BuckarooBanzai Across The Eighth Dimension''' it works because logic
		* btw "don't pull on that u have no idea what it connects to" is within the realms of reasonable internal anatomical variations ...
	* '''AustinPowers''' (oh ''behave!'')
	* '''DrStrangelove''', or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
	* '''OurManFlint'''
	* '''UHF''' (WeirdAl's movie)
	* '''MysteryMen''' is fun -- and just as you would expect
	* ''Martha meet Frank, Daniel, Lawrence'' - An excellent British comedy with a neatly twisted plot. 
	* ''ThisIsSpinalTap'' - the original fake Rockumentary. More quotable than any MontyPython movie, and more cameos than I can remember.
	* '''SouthParkBiggerLongerAndUncut''' - brilliant. The BillGates scene alone is worth the price of admission, but any movie that makes you root for Satan has got it on the ball.
	* '''MontyPythonAndTheQuestForTheHolyGrail''' - The opening credits, alone, are funnier than most comedies. This movie is most insightful silliness.
	* '''BringingOutTheDead''' ''(also Gripping and Moving)''
	* '''Darkstar''' ''First feature by JohnCarpenter. Definitive SF parody. "congratulations, you have chosen to clean the lift. Please stand clear of the explosive bolts."''
	* '''WagTheDog''' ''Political satire with Robert Di Niro and Dustin Hoffman''
	* '''Scary Movie'''
	* '''Raising Arizona''' an early Coen Brothers film. Wacky funny, but pales in comparison with '''The Big Lebowski'''
	* '''The Big Lebowski''' a hilarious bowling film by the Coen Brothers. Every time you think you know where it's going, it heads in another direction completely.
	* '''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''' The Coen Brothers take on a jail break. Very funny and a great soundtrack.
	* '''The Pink Panther Strikes Again''' ''(uneven, but the "questioning of the estate staff" scene is rather hilarious and perhaps worth the price of admission, alone; many other amusing scenes, just a little more tiredly acted than the former) http://www.rabbitw.com/wavs/panther/clous004.wav''
	* '''Dogma''' (Don't miss the cameo by Betty Aberlin of MisterRogersNeighborhood!)
	* '''ClerksMovie''' (anything by Kevin Smith '''except''' ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''. Goddammit, that was ''terrible.'')
	* '''TheGodsMustBeCrazy''' ''Starts off with '''very''' dry humour, but had me rolling in the aisles later. Some (Bill Cosby) thought it was racist, but that's pretty narrow-minded.''
	* '''Mad adventures of Rabbi Jacob''' '''Slapstick'''
	* '''Dumb & Dumber'''?
	* '''The American Astronaut''' ''B&W, very absurd.'' 

'''Religious:'''

	* JesusChristSuperstar

'''For Adults Of All Ages:'''

	* The Iron Giant ''<-- a brilliant lampoon of the ColdWar hardware fetish'' (trivia bit: based on 'TheIronMan', a book by Ted Hughes, who was British Poet Laureate and Sylvia Plath's husband.)

'''Wait for Cable:'''

	* '''Charlie's Angels''' ''A helplessly camp big-screen adaptation of that popular TV show, The Power Puff Girls.''
		* I disagree - this is a wonderfully funny, while campy (sor of like StarWars, or maybe SpaceBalls in that, eh?) movie definitely worth renting.

'''Don't Listen to the Critics:'''
	* '''Chasing Papi''' this poorly-named tidbit was widely panned as a bad sitcom full of latina stereotypes, like watching Telemundo or Univision. I find those comedies insipid and I found this a delightful antidote. It sets up all the typical tired "cat-fighting over a hunk" themes and twists them to attempt to show character development. "Attempts" being the operative word, but the ensemble acting (yes, real ensemble acting & not clever editing) and the minor pratfalls between the major attempts are a scream. During a moment of reflection on one woman's life story we see an insert of another woman listening intently. But her toy dog picks that moment for an enormous yawn.
	* '''What's Up Doc?''' Screwball comedy and great UFH Saturday-afternoon movie fair. Yes, the gays like it too, because it has a young nubile 30-yo Barbra Streisand stealing every scene, one by one. And who's under the tarp on the piano?

'''Cult Classic:'''
	* FasterPussycatKillKill
	* Anything by Ed Wood, especially PlanNineFromOuterSpace and Glen or Glenda
	* EyesWideShut - gets better if you can stay awake
	* The RockyHorrorPictureShow
	* "Harold and Maude" ''sometimes the biggest risk is living''
	* The Evil Dead

'''See It On Video:'''

	* '''Dune''' [DuneTheMovie] ''(best if you read and liked the books)''
	* '''There's Something About Mary'''
