Forth is very much alive and kicking. Forth is the core of OpenFirmware. Forth inspired Postscript. Forth is being used and actively maintained in ''EVERY'' NASA satellite orbiting our planet. The number of Forth implementations continues to grow and evolve, even as others die out. Forth-native hardware is made both commercially and in home electronics labs throughout the world.

Forth is far from dead.

''I have never seen a Forth implementation in an actual product, but I've only been doing EmbeddedSystem''''''s development for the past 35 years or so. Perhaps the dozens of firms I've worked at are simply on the periphery of electronic products? You know, like everything from TV remote controls to Class III patient treatment equipment?''

''Oy. Get a grip. Forth is dead and buried. -- MartySchrader''

''The Catholic Church believed the Earth was flat for a whole lot more years than we are going to live, and, still, they were wrong. -- iru''

Getting your historical example wrong rather undermines your point: it was known that the earth is round from well before there WAS a Catholic Church. Stuff like people telling Columbus he would sail of the edge of the world is myth. 

''When it comes to the state and nature of the universe we inevitably are wrong - first. And so we modify, and are wrong again. Being the creatures we are, we try again, and seem to be right, but before long we find out we are still wrong. This is the nature of man and his attempts to understand what he cannot really see. After a while, even our institutions try, with the same results, temporarily utilizing their estimates, calling them '''best'''. Wrongness seems a more evident thing than rightness, and applies to ... human institutions.''

Getting back on topic we need more real examples. Intellasys still lists Forth CPUs as products on its site: who is buying them? 

Those who use '''embedded multicore processors''' and '''Scalable Embedded Arrays within the (SEA) Platform'''

It's been upgraded to "Fifth" :-)

WeNeedExamples -- please, please, whoever is trying to tell us that Forth -- or Fifth, or Bloofta, or whatever the durn thing is called these days -- that this turkey of a language construct is still alive '''provide examples.''' There are no commercial products out there being developed using Forth. There's probably more junk being created with Lisp than Forth. C'mon, show us what Forth is doing!

Okay, so it's used in a dead NASA project. Where else? The other document is just a language spec with no references to actual products using Forth. Where is Forth being used in an actual product?

The OpenFirmware variant was used to bring up the OneLaptopPerChild prototype in record time.  SwiftForth was used to implement the handheld UPS terminals you sign when receiving a package. Forth is the glue language at the heart of a JavaScript tracing optimizer.
