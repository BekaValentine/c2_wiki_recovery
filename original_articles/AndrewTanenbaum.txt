Tanenbaum is also attributed as the author of this quote:

"The nice thing about standards is that you have so many to choose from; furthermore, if you do not like any of them, you can just wait for next year's model." 

(Widely attributed to Tanenbaum, but also to GraceHopper. Quote appeared in Andrew S. Tanenbaum, p168 "Computer Networks", 1st ed, 1981, and p254 of the second edition. TheUnixHatersHandbook p10 attributes the first phrase of the quote to GraceHopper.)
