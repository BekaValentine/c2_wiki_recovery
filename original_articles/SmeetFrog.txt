	3. Migratory behavior. 
	4. Locality of habitat between two places: the Huron River of Michigan in particular, Ypsilanti, and some yet undiscovered arctic summer vacation spot (thought to be the northern coast of Labrador.
	5. An urban legend enjoying several newspaper articles spanning several years giving varying accounts but all hinting on the possibility that frog is a real living species.
	6. Raised eyebrows from biologists at several universities who have been asked to explain by curious gradeschool science teachers.
