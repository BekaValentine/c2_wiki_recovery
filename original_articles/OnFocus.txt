You can place a WikiPage OnFocus by making all kind of links to that page,  adding existing WikiNames in that page, or linking other pages to that page. You can also make a minor change, to place the page in RecentChanges, etcetera.

If you happen to find a very interesting page that's unreferenced, you should place it more OnFocus.
