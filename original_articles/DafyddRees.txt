I wish everybody here well and thank everybody for the great learning experience and friendship over the years since I first turned up here in 1998 (or was it 1997?)

I'm no longer actively taking part here. 

All the best for the future,

Dafydd

I'm going away. I'm not going to carefully edit everything - but I'm not going to wipe out big chunks of participation either. As far as my contributions go, you can keep them, edit them or delete them. Whatever you collectively think best.
