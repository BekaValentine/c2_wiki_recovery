The Sinclair ZX Spectrum is a Z80-based home computer from the early 80s, produced by Sir Clive Sinclair. The most recognizable feature was the 'rubber' keyboard.

The original machine came in 16k and 48k memory varieties - both having 16k of ROM sitting in the bottom area of the total 64k addressable by the Z80 processor. The ROM contained a BASIC variant which the machine would load on reset. Sinclair BASIC was notable for the fact that all keywords were tokenized. For example, you would just type
 P
to get 
 PRINT
rather than the entire sequence. Helpfully, the key combinations for the tokens were printed on the keyboard.
