True Zen means to follow the absolute cosmic system with the practice of the body.

	1 Be afraid! for cosmic system
	1 Wake up! to cosmic consciousness, satori-highest truth
	1 Be happy! Love every existence
	1 Believe! No doubt.
	1 Get up early! with sun.
	1 Sit down calmly! in zazen.
	1 Stand up and walk! on the great Earth
	1 Eat right! fresh and natural foods.
	1 Work! with samu spirit.
	1 Sleep early and deeply! with sun.
	1 ''Eternal Salvation! or '''triple''' your money back. ;)''
