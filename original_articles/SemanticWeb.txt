''"a Web that includes documents, or portions of documents, describing explicit relationships between things and containing semantic information intended for automated processing by our machines."''

A solid argument ''against'' the SemanticWeb mindset - entertaining and very incisive, titled 'MetaCrap' :)

''This is SlipperySlope argumentation, as if the fact that there are imperfections due to human involvement means that it should just all be thrown out. Furthermore, the author only chooses to look at the negative side of the "more-than-one-interpretation-of-data" coin. That's exactly what the semantic web wants to do there, direct people towards the positive side of that coin and flexibly allow but powerfully direct multiple interpretations.''

-- StevenCummings

[Tragedy of the commons applies here. People will, and do, lie about their sites. False meta-data, misleading meta-data, broken interpertations... look at the sort SEO attempts Google has to deal with]

However, even in the face of search engine optimization Google somehow manages to provide extremely high quality results based on metadata.  In general, I believe that the benefit of common metadata and ontologies far outweighs the cost of the inaccurate or misleading use.  Over time, maintainers and users get better at separating the wheat from the chaff.

-- RyanHoegg

Google assumes the burden of doing so, and has spent enormous amounts of money, brainpower, and computing power to do so. Requiring every individual user to make the same investment is not practical. A SemanticWeb that's tied to a specific vendor to be usable isn't that useful.

The effort to categorize every Wiki page would seem to fall under the aegis of SemanticWeb.  I imagine someone out there with lots of time and an attention to detail could potentially generate a DublinCore based RDF for each and every page on Wiki.  MetaWiki?

''Moved from S''''''emanticWebTips''

Write your Semantic Web tips here:-

AaronSwartz:

"If you don't have a domain name that you think you're going to keep..." You need to emphasize that this domain name needs to be kept practically forever, and the URI must not be reused. (Most people don't have that kind of persistance policy.)

"Use URIs that contain as little information as possible." Perhaps point to MemorableRandomStrings (MeRS) and other such resources?

"Reuse existing ontologies/namespaces wherever possible, but if your RDF starts looking like Frankenstein's early models then consider defining equivalences/subclasses of classes found in other schema within your own schema."

Would you like to read Danny Ayers views (touches on GoogleSearch as well) blog at http://dannyayers.com/archives/2004/11/23/google-web-vs-semantic-web/ and tell C2 community about its contents and your views of it? 

''Danny is totally absorbed by the "how" question, clearly confident that if we build it they will come. One key question I haven't seen answered: If all you guys are tagging your data, what incentive do I have to do the extra work of tagging mine? --mt''

In Mar05, Danny said at http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/03/29/technology-choices/
* ...describing the benefits of Semantic Web technologies - until there are more RDF-oriented applications and services around, the benefits of of using a domain-agnostic language above that of XML won't be apparent. ''What benefits?''

The SemanticWeb is the premier approach toward handling processing and working with RealInformation using technology. It consists of entities linked to entities linked to entities using various relationships. The problem with the semantic web is that it is disconnected from data. In order to connect it to data and make it highly useful, the entities themselves need some sort of simple generic InformationFriendly technology to define and describe them. I recommend Endemes as a possible technology for bringing together the worlds of data and information. Each endeme is an instance of an EndemeSet. Each endeme has a very simple generic way of representing data. Most data can be stored in endemes, and that which can't can still have its context described by endemes. Endemes are simultaneously InformationFriendly and DataFriendly. --JonGrover
