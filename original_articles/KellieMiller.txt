I am a Computer Scientist. I work for a large aerospace company that shall remain nameless, largely at their preference. I am fluent in C, Java, and Scheme. Recently I have been impressed with the clarity of Python and have been working on becoming fluent in it. I do NOT like Perl because, as I have recently discovered, it is not very pythonic :-).

I live in south central Tennessee and work in Huntsville, AL. I'm married, have two grown daughters, three cats, and a dog (but don't tell the dog that, she thinks she's human). I play guitar reasonably well, fiddle passably well and I'm learning to play Celtic harp.

''Hi, Kellie. Is that you on the QuotePageOne page??? -- ElizabethWiethoff (PythonLanguage rules, as far as I'm concerned.)''

Yep, that's me. The quote is thanks to my friend Bob Crispen (http://blog.crispen.org/) with whom I was discussing the psychological principles leading to the phenomenon of flaming on the Internet. I have since lost the reference to that discussion online but the quote survives as my Warholian 15 minutes of fame.
