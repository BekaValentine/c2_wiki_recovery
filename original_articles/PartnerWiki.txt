Let there be Wikis A, B then
 
A is a PartnerWiki to B iff there are pages a in A and b in B, where a is PartnerPage to b.

'''Corollary:'''
Each Wiki A is a Partner Wiki to A.

'''Note:'''
As soon as the communities in both Wikis accept one pair of mutual PartnerPage''''''s, the process of partnering has made a successful start.

'''Example:'''
This Wiki.
For further examples See TwinPage''''''s.
