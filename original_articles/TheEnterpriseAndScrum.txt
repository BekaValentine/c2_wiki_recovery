From the MS Press site blurb: "it’s time to extend the benefits of Scrum—greater agility, higher-quality products, and lower costs—from individual teams to your entire enterprise. However, with Scrum’s lack of prescribed rules, the friction of change can be challenging as people struggle to break from old project management habits. In this book, agile-process revolution leader Ken Schwaber takes you through change management—for you organizational and interpersonal processes—explaining how to successfully adopt Scrum across your entire organization."

This is KenSchwaber's third book on ScrumProcess
