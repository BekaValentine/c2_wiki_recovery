Here are some steps for ImprovingCollaboration
* Be people-centric. 
** This applies to how we design and present our work     
* Be willing to collaborate. 
** Belong to a community of like-minded people, 
** Decide that working together will both strengthen this community and improve the product of collaboration.     
*Create shared language. 
** Our work shares more similarities than we may think. 
** Conversing with others with like minds will help reveal those similarities
** Will in the process create a shared language that will make similarities apparent to all. 
** As a sharing evolves, a conceptual framework for collaborative work will emerge, revealing opportunities for improvments.     
*Keep improving. 
** Improvement is an ongoing process. 
** Introduction of new methods will change the way we collaborate, which in turn will create new opportunities to improve.    
*Finally, never forget Doug Engelbart's fundamental tenet
** Computers should help us become smarter and work together better
** Remembering this will keep us on the right track.
