The Central Master Universe is a potentially pretend place (a model) for an assumed single universal truth. It's the hypothetical place that only the top gods have access to and which we humans strive to get the best approximation of in our models of the so-called physical world. Whether it actually exists or not is an ongoing philosophical and physics puzzle.
