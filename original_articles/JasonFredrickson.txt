I am the CTO of Horizon, A Glimpse of Tomorrow, which builds networking technologies for the electronic entertainment industry (read: computer games).  My hobbies include backpacking, martial arts, reading, and writing.

I have major interest in statistical and mathematical modeling of human interaction - can we explain why a FortyHourWeek is good? Can we predict the productivity of a group of people over the next six months given their productivity for the past three? What really happens when you stop documenting and put all the programmers in one room?

In my spare time, I write a book on team software development, and build tools to assist in same. See http://www.projectmetrics.com/Projects/XPTracker/index.htm for an example.
