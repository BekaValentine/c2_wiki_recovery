While trying to develop new ways of accessing computers remotely, Tim invented the WorldWideWeb at CERN, where he defined HTTP (HyperTextTransferProtocol), HTML (HyperTextMarkupLanguage), and the URI (UniformResourceIdentifier). He founded, and is now a director of the WorldWideWebConsortium. In January 2004, he received the distinction of Knight Commander of the British Empire (KBE) -- in other words, he was knighted. Hence some would refer to him as "Sir TimBernersLee".

His book ''WeavingTheWeb'' is well worth reading.

The NeXt cube he used to build the first Web software is on display in the London Science Museum. Decide for yourself if that makes sense or not. ''Hm, one museum also has the hat of Nikola Tesla.'' [It would be cooler if the NeXT cube were still on the net.]

"Sir Tim" has a blog now, http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/blog/4, and in the first entry he says, "Now in 2005, we have blogs and wikis, and the fact that they are so popular makes me feel I wasn't crazy to think people needed a creative space."
