''"I've always wanted to be... a Lumberjack!  Leaping from tree to tree, in the mighty forests of British Columbia!..."''

A phrase related to me by a former manager.  A LumberjackMoment is one realizes (or confides to one's boss) that one is not happy in his/her current career, and desires to do Something CompletelyDifferent.  In the case I heard about, an engineer told my ex-boss that he wanted to leave the engineering profession and become a food wholesaler.  Now he works for Sysco (as opposed to Cisco; though both companies seem to be in the "routing" business...)

Name comes from the MontyPython "lumberjack" skit...speaking of which, lets Sing! Sing! Sing!

 I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK
 I sleep all night and I work all day
 (He's a lumberjack and he's OK
  He sleeps all night and he works all day)

 I cut down trees, I eat my lunch,
 I go to the lavat'ry
 On Wednesdays I go shopping
 For butter'd scones for tea!

And so forth.

Here is a start on a new version:  In the original, the Lumberjack-wannabe has just expressed dissatisfaction at being a barber (or a pet-shop owner; several different versions of this are found in Python).  In our version, OurHero is an intrepid salesman at RadioShack (something I regret I used to do--ScottJohnson)

Salesman:

 I've always wanted to be.... a Programmer!  

''(Rips off bargain-basement suit and clip-on tie, revealing...bargain basement suit, clip on tie, and wide variety of electronic devices on toolbelt).''

Chorus of PointyHairedBosses:
  
    Dum Dum Dum, dum-da Dum, dum, dum, da-da-da
    Dum Dum Dum, Dum-du Dum, Dum, Dum, da-da-da...)

Salesman:
 
 Leaping from job to job in the mighty corporations of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere)! 
 With my PalmPilot at my side!

 The generosity and fair play of Microsoft!
 The groovy corporate culture of IBM!
 The rock-solid business model of HomeGrocer.com!
 The profound respect for intellectual property at Napster!
 The professional accounting standards of MCI!

 And I will Sing! Sing! Sing! 
 
 I'm a programmer and I'm OK
 I work all night and I sleep all day

Bosses:

 He's a programmer and he's OK
 He works all night and he sleeps all day

Salesman:

 I write some code, I eat pizza,

 On Wednesdays I go shopping
 For gourmet coffee beans

Bosses:

 On Wednesdays he goes shopping
