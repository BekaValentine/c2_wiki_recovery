I have had two MomentOfUnderstanding events in my programming life.  The first was when I was nine and my older brother bought his first computer.  The Atari 400.  The first time I wrote

10 Print "Hello World"

20 GOTO 10

I knew what I wanted to do.

The second experience was in December of '95 when my older brother gave me a copy of the DesignPatterns book by the GangOfFour.  and I finally grasped the year of Smalltalk I had taken in college.

Since then I have been waiting for the the next MomentOfUnderstanding.

I am currently interested in:

1.  Building frameworks for change.

2.  Self describing systems.

I have been using Smalltalk in an academic and professional setting since 1994.
