Software developer (ChiefArchitect, I suppose, but don't hate me for it) for KLD Labs, Inc. (http://www.kldlabs.com)

Email is mike underscore smith at acm dot org.

Working on a GreatBooksList at GreatBooksListMikeSmith. Nowhere near finished (and removed, in possible preparation for moving to BookShelved Wiki).

Spewed out some stuff about ExtremeEngineering a while back.

Old stuff regarding my change of name (from Another''''''Mike''''''Smith) moved to MikeSmithNameChange.

Stuff regarding EddiesWiki, and changes I've made to it, moved to MikeSmithEddiesWikiStuff.
