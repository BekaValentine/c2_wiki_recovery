I think this kind of game is fun, and informative. YourMileageMayVary.

Catalog the bookshelf that is closest to your work area, the one on which your most-used books live. Skip the manuals; include only books you (or somebody) paid for. If your bookshelf is 5 shelves tall, stick to the shelf that's easiest to grab from.

That list was done perhaps in early 1999. I don't read or reference any of those books any more, as they've been internalized or forgotten. I'm reading many books now, but none stay on the lowest shelf. They're all stacked up all over the place. MyLowestBookshelf is gone (sob). July 00, Alistair

Months (and projects) pass. The only book now within reach is ''The American Heritage Dictionary.'' Go figure.

Many more months pass. Within easy reach (at work) are the aforementioned dictionary, and SteveMcConnell's ''SoftwareProjectSurvivalGuide.'' The missing copy of ''UmlDistilled'' was replaced by the second edition and sits on the bedside table, along with ''ThePerlCookbook.'' Most of the reference material I now use is on-line.

For the past many years, I've kept my closest work bookshelf in MRU order:  I always put books back on the left (or closest) side.  Then, about every six months or so, I box up the right half of the bookshelf, thereby ridding myself of the crap I don't need.

Currently, my 10 leftmost books are:

* ''PythonInaNutshell'', AlexMartelli
* ''The Python Cookbook'', AlexMartelli & Ascher
* ''Eclipse in Action'', Gallardo, et al.
* ''Designing Enterprise Applications with the J2EE Platform'', Singh, et al.
* ''RefactoringBook'', MartinFowler
* ''EffectiveStl'', ScottMeyers
* ''NetworkSecurity with OpenSSL'', Viega, Messier, and Chandra
* ''GnuEmacs Manual'', RichardStallman
* ''EffectiveCeePlusPlus'', ScottMeyers
* ''The C++ Programming Language'', BjarneStroustrup
-- TimLesher

How about the books that aren't on your bookshelf, because (a) they are lying open next to your machine, and (b) they are in your backpack/briefcase (or car), so that you have them handy whether at work or home?
