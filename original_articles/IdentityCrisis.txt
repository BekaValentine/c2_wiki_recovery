Wiki seems to be functioning best as a repository for collective wisdom, knowledge, and experience. Some of the ThreadMode discussions are pretty lively and make sense as threaded discussions, although that is not what Ward had conceived for Wiki. Many pages here are simply accumulations of people's understandings; as such they are subject to constant editing, revision, correction, butchering, and refinement. We all hope that the continuous evolution leads to a better knowledge base -- a vastly superior Wiki.

Malice is not the norm for Wiki contributors. There are many pages that discuss this potential problem in its various forms. However, I think Wiki is self protecting. The body of contribution provided by regular Wikizens will itself form a protective barrier against intentional misquote or malicious edits. Writing that reverberates with other Wikizens will remain. If somebody attempts to pervert that content then the flavor of the writing will be in jarring contrast to what had been written before. The sharp-eyed Wiki regular can spot that a mile away.

"Regular" is probably a key word here. I intend to be a regular reader of Wiki even if I am not a regular contributor. There is so much going on here that nobody can keep track of it all without that becoming a full-time job. I don't think anybody who has a life of any kind will be taking shots at Wiki just for the phun of it. We should be safe.

So there is no identity crisis. Wikizens know who you are if you contribute regularly and are worth reading. Wikizens will ignore you and your vandalism if you are otherwise.
