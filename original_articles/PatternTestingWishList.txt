* for performance reason split patterntesting-check into an abstract and a concrete part
* copy/paste problem with Log4j: Look at the following statement: "private static Logger log = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class);" - guarantee that this statement only occurs in class MyClass
* soften the InterruptedException
* provide a TraceAspect (with tracing also setting and getting attributes) which may be activated by @ToBeTraced annotation
* also a ProfileAspect with a @ToBeProfiled(threshold) may be useful
* Register JUnit test at JMX which is marked as @SmokeTest
