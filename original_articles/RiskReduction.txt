From RiskManagement.

This consists of minimizing the likelihood of the 
undesirable event. 

For example, ExtremeProgramming reduces the likelihood that you will lack some 
features at each milestone by reducing the amount of "extra" work to be 
done, such as paperwork or documentation, and improving overall quality 
so as to make development faster.
