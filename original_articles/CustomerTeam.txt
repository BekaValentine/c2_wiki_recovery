A recent BeckianConcept.

We have a fundamental duality in the ExtremeProgramming concept of an OnsiteCustomer:

	* Programmers should go to ''one person'' to arbitrate DomainDecisions.
	* The OnsiteCustomer role may need more resources than just one WorkUnit.

The fix, from the our point of view as programmers, places behind our lead OnsiteCustomer (still known to be the final arbiter) more "little people" further away from us, including documentors, marketeers, salescritters, and EndUser''''''s. We refer to everyone on this axis as the CustomerTeam.
