Merb (Mongrel plus EeRuby) is an MVC (ModelViewController) framework.

Formerly "Recommended as an alternative to RubyOnRails on RubyOnRailsRulesTheUniverse."

Now it is ''mandated'' as the alternative - Rails3 will use a Merb core: MerbAndRailsMerge. The dark secret here was Ruby and TDD were so fine that Rails could become Ruby's KillerApp despite having a weak core. Merb is all about core, pluggability, and SoftwareProductLines, so RailsThree is going to be just another of its products.
