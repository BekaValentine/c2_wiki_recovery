A TrailPage is a Wiki page that lists a bunch of other Wiki pages to view.  In a sense, you can consider the RecentChanges page to be a TrailPage of sorts.

''It's early, so before I merge, I'll double check myself and ask if anyone sees any difference between this and RoadMap''''''s?''

I would also point out the similarities with CategoryCategory pages, but multiple methods of navigation is an integral part of good usability.  You'll find the WikiSearch utility also pumps out a similar kind of page.
