I just wrote the FranAllen page (20070608) and recognized that her team had programmed several things which analyzed graphs.   ThisWiki only has these pages:
EntityBeansAsDomainObjectGraphs
GraphSinkDetection
UncuddledParagraphs
WebdotGraphServer
with the word Graph in them.  What I've learned from this drunken experience is that Graphs are very important underlying DataStructures that go unrecognized by the mainstream of PatternRecognizers at ThisWiki. 
I think it harkens back to StuFeldman's algorithm that MadeMakeWork

''Then you used an inappropriate search method. Use http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=Graph instead.''
