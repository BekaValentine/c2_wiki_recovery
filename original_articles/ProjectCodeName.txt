How do your code-name your projects?

I'm trying to think of a nice code name for the project so I don't have to type "Barcode Terminal Service for Oracle Applications 10.7" over and over and over again. I thought about: some random anime character, a word out of the dictionary... but perhaps a project code name should have at least some semantic resemblance to the project's purpose. Or maybe I'm just putting too much thought into it, period. :-)

''Just pick an easily pronounceable anime character name. There are enough of them... Giant Robo, A-ko, Lina Inverse, Gally, Lain, San, Rei, Setsuna, Nene, Rabby, etc.''

''Or rearrange your acronym to be pronounceable.  For example, BTS for OA 10.7 becomes BOATS 10.7, or even just BOATS.''

''Name it anything at all, except an acronym.  If you're an anime fan, follow the above advice, for it will serve you well. -- DanielKnapp''

Do like machine names - pick a theme and run with it.  We've used National Parks, and cars.  Or pick interesting words and BackroNym them. --PeteHardie

''At a past company, we used the name of Roman Roads, then we used (horse) racing courses.''

That's what ThreeLetterAcronym''''s are for:  BTS.
