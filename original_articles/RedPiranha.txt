RedPiranha started as an OpenSource version of Google Desktop, but which is morphing more into a Spring based EnterpriseJava Framework for Knowledge Management. It is available at http://red-piranha.sourceforge.net

It somehow reminds of a destructive form of a RedHerring. Is this purely coincidental?
