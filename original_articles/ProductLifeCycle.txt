Although it has been shown that there are exceptions, in general, products follow the same life cycle in terms of customer demand:

	*Functionality
	*Reliability
	*Convenience
	*Price

This assumes that the ability for the rate of increase in product functionality, reliability, or convenience is faster than the rate of increase in customer demand for functionality, reliability, or convenience.
