I work for a software firm called IQUIP (www.iquip.nl) since nov 1995. There I do analysis, design, programming, consulting, anything as long as it's object-oriented or CBD-related. I also teach on the subject, write in-company OO Survival Guides. Yup, I'm hOOked :-)

I like quotes, so I think I'll put them on a QuotesAndMusings page...

My expertise is:
