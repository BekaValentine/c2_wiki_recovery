KamikazeCoding is what happens when you've got a huge change to make, and you decide to just fix it all at once without consulting your UnitTest''''''s each step of the way. You just jump in and code! 

You start tinkering around, and tinkering some more, and pretty soon your program is so far gone that it's almost a DeathMarch project just to get it working again.

I used to do that, but I've seen the light! RefactoringIsPainless!

It is folly to write a lot of code without running it frequently as you go, UnitTest''''''s or no UnitTest''''''s. But, it's not necessarily a DeathMarch to get it working again. It depends on you, your coding style, the problem at hand and the rest of the system.

If you have good source code control, you just delete the mess you made and revert back to the last known good version where all the tests passed.  You ''are'' using good version control, right?
