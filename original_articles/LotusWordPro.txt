LotusWordPro is a word processing program made by LotusCorporation, which now belongs to IbmCorporation. It's part of Lotus Smart Suite. I've been using it since 1999, since an OEM version came with the PC I bought then. It's not a bad word processor, though it's getting long in the tooth, and it doesn't seem that IBM is coming out with any updates or new versions. Importing newer Word documents is a pain, and I've resorted to using OpenOffice for that. -- JohnWebber

''Update, Dec. 2003: I'm now using OpenOffice1.1.0 for just about everything. Converting my 1-2-3 spreadsheets to the OO format wasn't easy -- exporting them as Excel sheets and importing them into OO. Most of the formulas, charts, etc. (i.e. almost everything) had to be redone. But now I can access them from Linux.''

It handles complex page layouts better than MicrosoftWord, but it is harder to customize LotusWordPro's interface.
