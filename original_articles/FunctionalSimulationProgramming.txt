Functional Simulation Programming is similar to FunctionalReactiveProgramming except that instead of having a sequence of real data which have to be analysed. instead the sequence is generated by a model of some sort, and the task is to generate a set of outputs at successive simulation times. The expression I''''''ncrementalComputing is also used to imply that values are recalculated when something changes. A lot of the tools developed for FunctionalReactiveProgramming can be adapted for use. -- JohnFletcher
