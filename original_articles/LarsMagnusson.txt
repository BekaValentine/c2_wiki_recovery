Hello!

I'm an independent consultant focused on developing OO systems.
In 1989 I started to work with Oliver Simms to build a New World Infrastructure
(NeWI) for Business Objects. After a session in UK I moved on to developing in Smalltalk 
and now in Java.

Right now I'm in a project for an Insurance Brooker company and we are basing our
development on XP.

I can be reach at Lars@Magnusson.com
