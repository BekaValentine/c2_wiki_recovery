My name is Ingo James Dettling and I am an independent software engineer.
I studied computer science at the University of Karlsruhe, Germany.
I graduated with a Masters in 1996. Before graduation I started to work as
an independent software developer for DIGITAL in 1992. There I was involved
in small CORBA projects. Since this time I am focused on OOA/OOD/OOP with a
special interest in distributed applications. Also an area of interest are
e-commerce applications for the finance business.

Kent Beck, Martin Fowler and the GoF really influenced my way of developing.
The books of these guys are a must to every serious IT professional.
