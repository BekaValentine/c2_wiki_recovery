	 :	Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. 
	 :	I will face my fear. 
	 :	I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

''Official Silly Useless Factoid: In the animated series '''Earthworm Jim''', which appeared on US television in the mid-1990s, Jim's sidekick Peter Puppy would in times of peril recite the LitanyAgainstFear. This was one of several clever (by US mainstream TV standards) in-jokes that the series used. - JayOsako''
