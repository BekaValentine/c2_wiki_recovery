Maurits Cornelius (more correctly, "Cornelis") Escher was a Dutch artist who died in 1972 at the age of 73.

Famous for his etchings of visual and spatial illusions, as well as tessellations (roughly, regular divisions of the plane or 3D space).

Many of Escher's works are based on tessellations and optical illusions. For example, one man in "Belvedere" holds an impossible box:
