Guidelines to prevent a language comparison from turning into a LanguagePissingMatch:

	* Never dismiss a feature just because you don't see a use for it. Other people might use it all the time. Examples: MultipleInheritance, Closures, ...
	* Never state that a construct seems preferable without explaining why it seems preferable.
	* Use EprimeLanguage. That's to say, try to stop yourself from saying things like "ComIsLove". Explain instead what seems lovely to you.
	* Another useful technique is to expose one's lack of understanding.  Like "I don't understand how one implements polymorphism in VisualBasic", or "I don't see how X works better than Y."  Others will be glad to enlighten you.  (Be sure to avoid BrutalSarcasm, however--it rarely works in writing.)
	* Try to avoid 'league tables'.  (e.g. 'More shrink wrap apps are written in Language A than Language B'.)
	* If you are debating a non-technical issue (e.g. extent of penetration into a market) try to remember that it may have nothing to do with technical merit.
	* Question your motives.  What do you want out of the discussion, do you want to learn? win? comfort yourself that you will still have a job in 5 years? decide which language to go for next in order to still be in a job in 5 years?  
	* Do you feel angry when you read criticisms of ''your'' language?  Do you feel undermined?  Better work out why; these things are just not that important.
	* If you are debating to score points make it clear up front and put Advocacy in the page title!
