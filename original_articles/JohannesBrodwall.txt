I have been looking at Wiki for a long time now.  I feel it is an excellent
way of doing GroupWare (sure beats the heck out of LotusNotes!).  I wonder
if anyone is making an OfflineWiki.  That would be useful as a 
ProgrammersNotebook (for those of us who believe that paper is overrated).

''I wonder if anyone is making an OfflineWiki'' - There are several listed at http://wiki.tcl.tk/3747 (Personal Wikis page at the Tcler's Wiki). -- BrianTheado

'' Also check out EddiesWiki. for Win32 only though. Links to other offline type wiki's -- GavinVanLelyveld''


My PatronPatterns are:
	* LowCoupling
	* Intentionality over mechanics
	* DontRepeatYourself
	* ExpertPattern (HighCohesion between logic and data)
