The modern MS-DOS Prompt, a program written to incorporate the ''retro'' command-line interface with the modern Windows GUI system. With commands like '''net''' and '''ping''', most people who know about it say it's more trouble than it's worth, but this page exists to prove that Command Prompt rules. --SimonMould

Ways to use:
*Change a forgotten password when you only have one user ON WINDOWS 7 by SimonMould
**Either:
***Create a <disk which lets you boot your computer and use command prompt> and use it/borrow a friends with the same OS if you do not have another identically OS'd PC
***Boot your computer up from the disk, noting that the drive letter will be specified, probably differing from the default
***Load Command Prompt
***Click on your hard drive, making sure it is the one you use (although most people will only have one). DO NOT RELY ON THE DRIVE LETTER TO IDENTIFY IT
**Or 
***Terminate your computer (hold down the On/Off button) and start it in Fix your computer mode, and wait for an opportunity to use Command Prompt. ''Most tech-minded nerds (or people who have discovered it by accident) will know that you can just use the advanced boot menu, but the way to get to it differs between computers, and usually requires split-second timing.''
**Type '''copy <driveletter>:/Windows/utilman.exe <driveletter>:/utilman.exe'''
**Type '''copy <driveletter>:/Windows/cmd.exe <driveletter>:/Windows/utilman.exe'''
**Restart your computer normally
**When it is loaded, click the ease of access icon in the bottom left hand corner to open Command Prompt
**Type '''net user <username> <new password>'''
**Close Command Prompt, load your user, and then load Command Prompt from your user. Your drive letter will have reverted to normal.
**Type '''copy <driveletter>:/utilman.exe <driveletter>:/windows/utilman.exe'''
**Type '''delete <driveletter>:/utilman.exe'''
**Type '''exit'''
**Be proud that you managed to understand these really badly written instructions. --SimonMould

People say:
*MsDos's successor. It is not as good, but is the only thing compatible with modern Microsoft Systems from MicrosoftSystems. --SimonMould
