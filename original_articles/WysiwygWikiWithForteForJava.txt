Writing with the internal WWW browser of ForteForJava, I notice that cr/lfs are not represented correctly, when an edit form is downloaded. But when writing the representation is correct.

''It looks like this is the case.  Please be careful when editing wiki pages, then, because it completely destroys any formatting in the page.  I have just repaired the ForteForJava page to remove these effects.''

The InternalBrowserOfForteForJava could be made a WysiwygWiki FrontEnd for
different Wikis. It should always branch to the edit forms, present them
as HTML and save them as Wiki formatted text.

There must somewhere a Java RTF/HTML source to integrate it.
