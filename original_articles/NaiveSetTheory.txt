''Naive Set Theory'' by PaulHalmos

ISBN: 0387900926

At 104 pages, this SkinnyBook is rather outrageously expensive.

''Books are priced by demand, not by weight. Furthermore, much of the value in this book is not in the words themselves, but in the experience of ''learning'' set theory by proving for oneself all of the statements that Halmos doesn't prove ("exercises for the reader", most of them not labeled as such).''
