Community Technology is a London based charity.

We seek to empower people by promoting access to technology.  We provide:

* Free/cheap computers to the public
* IT services for other charities
* IT training

Alongside computing we are developing various projects to promote new technologies such as MolecularNanoTechnology, BioStasis, AntiAgingTechniques, ''etc'', and make them accessible to everyone.

You can help!  We always need computers, if you or your company are throwing away any, '''STOP!'''  Contact StephenElson and we can arrange to put them to good use.  BTW - we'd love to take your computers in France, America, Iceland, ''etc'', but the south of England is easier :^)
