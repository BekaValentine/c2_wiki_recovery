Printing

For printing I'm wondering what the service would be. Obviously the printing dialog is not part of this as it belongs to GUI above. This still leaves the representation of the printable entity, the printing driver, the pysical transport and the printer internals.
* Printable 
** Transport mechanism: file
** Interface language or commands: plain ascii text (target language source)
** Product examples: PostScript, TeX (one might add PDF but there you need a specialized API the generate it)
* Driver
** Transport mechanism: pipe, directory
** Interface language or commands: just pass the file to print

* interface
