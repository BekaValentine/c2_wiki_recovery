This is an attempt to refactor the constraint logic (''xxx''isQuota) out of Costin's GridBagLayout example, suggested on SwitchStatementsSmell. I'm not happy with the smelly null methods in A''''''bsoluteRank, but the conditional logic around rowParams and columnParams has been replaced with polymorphism. I find this code easier to understand than the original, but I'm not an objective observer. Feel free to improve and comment. -- EricHodges

''Ha, ha. Your code is still far from "polymorphic". Mind you, as per SwitchStatementsSmell you should replace also, HA_CENTER, HA_LEFT, HA_RIGHT and the other enumerations with polymorphism :)''

As I said above, all I addressed was the "isQuota" stuff.

''But to the point, Rank is an unappealing uncommunicative name. Readers are going to be surprised, provided they haven't read the other one before. Now you set up a complicated and data-redundant scheme in which the owner constructs an owned object AbsoluteRank, and passes itself to the owned with the only purpose that the owned object calls back to him to do a simple addition. In other words you replaced something as simple as:''

			if (paramIsQuota[i]  /*equivalent to quota[i]<=1  */)
				currentWidth = (int) (h * quotaParams[i]);
			else
				currentWidth = fixedParams[i];
			outCoordinates[i + 1] = outCoordinates[i] + currentWidth + gap;
''with a hierarchy and an object graph owner->[]owned->owner with cycles, and some extra 80 lines in the file (probably just a third are non-comments), it can't be easier to understand. Plus the innocently named calculatePrefferedSize will apparently side-effect the instance, and it also makes sense only when called in a particular order all the way from inside preferredLayoutSize() call order dependency, I have to balance my head and peruse the scroll bar quite a few times to convince myself that preferredLayoutSize()is correct and I still am not all clear. To each its own, but objectively you cannot justify it. ''

There is nothing called AbstractRank. And I think I removed some data redundancy. You used to have two arrays for row parameter values, with another array to determine which element of those two arrays was in use. I've moved all of that to one array of row values.

''As I said, this was strictly because Java does not support SUM types, in ML this would be one array of values. Strictly speaking I could have kept the original division (0,1) is quota (>1) is fixed size, but it ruined readability. This was just a technicality to get over Java's lack of nsum types. But you created a graph with cycles, just to set up a visistor double dispatch theme.''

I also removed redundant code. You expressed many of the same algorithms twice for rows and columns.

''I acknowledged in the initial post that I have some redundancy in rows versus columns. The pragmatics of it is that it was very difficult in Java to create some closures necessary to break some asymmetry in getWidth/getHeight and comparing the thing that I've done in preferred layoutSize() -> distributeSpace(), I decided that the algorithm in preferredSize() was simple enough, to leave the code in place for readability even if it suffers a bit from redundancy.''

----
''Just think about the following Costin's little theorem: if one is really ambitious, one can replace all if/then/else (other than those for testing/validating input data which is untyped before you call constructors from it and therefore you can't polymorphically dispatch) with corresponding abstract classes and hierarchies having as state the boolean variable or the switch variable of the conditional, plus''
*'' all the variables in the conditional branch with which to perform the computation of the branch in the newly introduced object'' 
*'' '''or''' a pointer back to the context in which to call a segregated method like in visitor double dispatch (exactly what you did below)''
*'' '''or''' even messier arrangements can be done:).''

''It is clear, I hope, that trying to get rid of all if/else or switches following the above recipe, is a nightmare. Therefore you have to find clear criteria when applying such a recipe is justified as opposed to writing the same thing in more lines of code but with polymorphism. And here comes NygaardClassification to the rescue: your ObjectOriented design should be about finding a useful physical model with significant autonomous entities whose behavior you describe in your classes. It is not, it should be not about taking arbitrary bunches of code and transforming them into classes/objects.''

''Let's agree that in many cases, repeated if/then/elses switches are a smell. But what kind of smell? It is a smell if it indicates the existence of an autonomous entity, worthy to play a part in the object model. In my code I intuitively went with the if/else but now that I check on it the if/else on that constraint that became a hierarchy only occurred in two methods and the branches are trivial. Hey, it's just a simple algorithm (actually two related: one for layout and one for preferred size), if we need to create lots of classes and object arrangements to realize a simple algorithm, we are in trouble.''

We have different ideas about readability. It's easier for me to see that there are two kinds of ranks (fixed and relative) and how their behavior differs. I don't understand NygaardClassification. From where I sit, I've found a useful model with significant autonomous entities. I don't understand what makes one model more or less "physical" than another. And I don't agree that creating lots of classes means I'm in trouble.

''You broke something very important called '''locality of reasoning'''. In the original class, the reader, provided he already understands the contract involved in preferredLayoutSize() and layoutConainer(), can read the code of the algorithms which is not too long and figure it out. Now you created the RankSet and XXXRank that are heavily intertwined, their method calls make sense only when being called from the original place, so instead of reading a screen worth of code in layoutContainer(), I have to keep in my head the interplay of RankSet, Rank, AbsoluteRank, RelativeRank. Reasoning about any of those classes does not make much sense in isolation. And this is the most definitive criteria for goodness of design. So you created 4 more classes, added extra lines of code despite your claim that you eliminated some redundancy, created a call order dependency, yet you claim that you have improved readability. How is that possible?''

It's easier to read (for my brain) because the additional classes and methods introduce abstractions. While reading preferredLayoutSize() I don't have to know what rowSet.calculatePreferredSizes() does, just that the set of rows will calculate its preferred size. 

* ''But that's all that preferredLayoutSize() had to do anyway. So you extracted a simple algorithm that fit into a method into a set of classes, that are now smelly: they are strongly coupled, a call order dependency which is one of the worst kind, have some unnecessary methods because of the problem in replacing sum types with inheritance, all in all they make up for more code than you had initially. Separating details of implementation makes sense in other cases altogether, for example, when calling something like SwingUtilities.invokeLater(lambda(){ textArea.appendText("Hello World")}) - where you don't want to know the details of Swing Threading and of how a text area works in the place where you called them. But here it was not the case, and the bottom line is that you created more code and more coupling. I think you ought to take one step back from MartinFowler and have a look to the good old EwDjikstra'''''''s "A Discipline Of Programming", where he exposes quite complicated algorithms (much more than this simple layout) in a language he designed and that he left it on purpose without procedures so that all the algorithm use nothing but blocks !!!''

Perhaps the algorithm seems simple to you, but it doesn't to me.

The responsibility for determining the vertical size has been delegated to rowSet. If I need to understand what it's doing, I drill down into that method and see that he's calculating the weight of the current component and then asking each rank to participate in the calculation.

''It would have been easier to see for you that there are two kinds of ranks (fixed and relative) if you were accustomed to programming in ML, Haskell or other fp languages that have SUM types, and you accepted that the way to have that in Java is not by polymorphism, but through a discriminator. But looking at the code from an OO perspective, and mind you no OO language (other than ObjectiveCaml of course:) , has SUM types ), you are definitely in "all I have is a hammer" position: all you have is inheritance hierarchies, but you have no SUM type, and you stubbornly refuse to see one when the algorithm cries for such a thing. Those smelly methods that apply to one case but not the other, yet got promoted in the Rank base class, are the definitive sign that you needed a SUM type.''

I didn't refactor your conditional logic to polymorphism because it was particularly smelly. I did so because you said it would answer my questions back on SwitchStatementsSmell.

* ''And that was precisely because it so happened that I revisited this code lately, but it's good so you can have an idea of the cases where ReplaceConditionalWithPolymorphism makes for worse code (more lines of code, more coupling, more smells). In those case you might want to consider ReplacePolymorphismWithConditional.''

''If you go ahead and replace the other SUM types in the code, then you'll see how you are in trouble.''

I'll try it when I get some free time. I've never programmed in ML, Haskell or any fp language, and I doubt I'll have to opportunity to do so in the near future. But I love to know how I am in trouble.

''Next time you are tempted to read an OO book, remember to make time to read a functional one. This exercise is sure to make you a better programmer. Plus OO book are typically on the dispensable side anyways :)''
