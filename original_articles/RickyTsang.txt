I am referred to here by Cameron Laird's Open Source column in http://www.swexpert.com

My biggest achievement in my life up to now is my Piano certification. Why a big achievement you might ask? Because i don't think i am talented in playing music.

My worst embarrassment is that after 9 years of programming since high school grade 11, i still don't have a personal web page. 

Career-wise i still have not decided which area of computing to specialize in. Currently i am working as an Application Support for a group of 15 people. I already know the software systems inside out. The worst thing for me now is that on the job there is no one i could learn from. I want to move on, but don't know where to go from here.

I am living in Vancouver Canada. Anyone lives here?
