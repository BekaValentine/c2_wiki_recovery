I find I feel a greater reluctance to get started on a new project if I view it as a "programming project".  If I use a scripting language I am familiar with, I can get started faster and with less effort. However, later in the project, it may well have become larger and less well-structured.  Or is it just me? Feedback would be welcome.

RapidPrototyping fits in here somewhere.  Ideally one should be able to ''grow'' a project.

''It has often been observed that most successful software grows from small to large, rather than starting out large. ChristopherAlexander has also commented on the importance of buildings with (metaphorical) life, which arises best from growth -- and therefore, design things to grow.''
