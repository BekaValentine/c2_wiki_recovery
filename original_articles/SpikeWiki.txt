Actually spelt Spike - a WikiClone being developed in Java by DaveHarris and RalphMellor.

[''See ServletBasedWiki or JavaWiki for details on other WikiWikiClone(s) written in Java'']

This project is currently on hold, due to lack of finance. (May, 1998)

Actually, by now, it is quite dead. 10/22/00

''So why is this page still here?''

It's referenced from a few places, so either those pages should be refactored or (preferably) this page left as a death notice. The comments elsewhere seem non-trivial, and expunging history won't let it serve as a lesson to other cloners.

There is also substantially more info on SpikeWiki on the WikiWikiWeb twin page: http://c2.com/w4/wikibase/?SpiKe
