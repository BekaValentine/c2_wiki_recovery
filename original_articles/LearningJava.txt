I think I want to learn the JavaLanguage. I already know C++. What JavaIde would you recommend ?
-- DavidCary

Regarding learning Java, how are your object-oriented development skills? See LearningObjectOrientedProgramming. On Java IDEs, there are a couple to look at. The JavaIde page goes into more detail, but I would recommend comparing EclipseIde with IntellijIdea and picking the one you find more comfortable. I prefer the former, and it's free and open source. --StevenNewton

Thanks for the pointer ! -- DavidCary

Follow-up: The book ThinkingInJava might be a good starter book. I've also heard that the Core Java vol 1 language book from Sun is worthwhile. It might be called the K&E for Java.

IDE What about netbeans?
is it good for a beginner ?

''I just downloaded it and took it for a quick spin -- seems OK to me. -- DavidCary 2004-11-03''

"NetBeans IDE 3.6 Quick Start Guide"
http://www.netbeans.org/kb/index.html



2004-11-05:DavidCary: I just hit my first Gotcha. I ran a simple Java application that reads and writes simple text files to disk.
    DataInputStream inStream = new DataInputStream( new FileInputStream("input.txt"));
    File outFile = new File("tempfile.txt");
In the Eclipse IDE, I became used to it creating the file in the same directory as the ".class" files of my application (something like
    C:\Documents and Settings\caryd\My Documents\caryd\java_workspace\hello_world\bin
). But in the Netbeans IDE, the same program created the file in the
    C:\Program Files\NetBeans3.6directory.
(the "search for file" feature of Windows Explorer, at least on this machine, by default, does *not* search the "Program Files" directory).

Supposedly this is explained in the Netbeans FAQ:
http://www.netbeans.org/kb/faqs/all-nbuser-faqs.html#FAQ_1_26
That FAQ says:
''... it is generally not a good idea to access files in such a way. Instead, the contents of the file should be accessed like
  InputStream in = MyClass.class.getResourceAsStream(RESOURCE_PATH);

Huh ? PleaseComment.

Please AnswerMe:
Moments ago, my compiler
("J2SE v 1.4.2_04 SDK with NetBeans 3.6 Bundle")
gave me this error:

 WebFetchApp.java [216:1] cannot resolve symbol
 symbol  : method contains (java.lang.String)
 location: class java.lang.String
                                if(line.contains("CONTENT_")){
                                       ^
 Note: C:\Documents and Settings\caryd\My Documents\caryd\netbeans_workspace\src\WebFetchApp.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
 Note: Recompile with -deprecation for details.
 1 error
 Errors compiling WebFetchApp.

The String.contains() method is deprecated ? Really ?
Funny, it doesn't mention that on
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#contains(java.lang.CharSequence)
.

What should I use to replace contains() ?
I suppose I could say
				if( -1 != line.indexOf("CONTENT_")){
but that's ugly.
