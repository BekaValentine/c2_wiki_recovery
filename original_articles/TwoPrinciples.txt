It seems likely that agile processes could work in any environment provided the bridging system makes use of two simple principles. 

	1 It coordinates between the islands using a demand-driven system instead of a schedule-driven system. 
	2 It provides for work to be requested in the smallest chunks possible. 

These principles are observed by the agile testing process described in AgileBridge.

This is just a guesstimate based on the success of LeanProduction.
