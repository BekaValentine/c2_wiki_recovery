This is an AntiPattern about Programmers as a people pattern.

If you have friends who are not programmers, but have association with programmers (e.g. partners), they may tell you a story about the ProgrammerType.

The stereotyped programmer is constantly charged with adrenalin, perpetually stressed, and typically narrow minded.

I would argue that ProgrammerType is just plain folks who are more stress tolerant than the average person. However the constant stress do create emotional outbursts that do not help their image. 

These people are incredibly focussed on their work and interests, and can therefore give the impression of narrow-mindedness.

ProgrammerType need the other types of people to mingle with, even on a ProgrammerType wiki.

I suggest this topic be moved and changed to ProfessionStereotypes. Every profession has a stereotype(s) associated with it. For example, sales people are assumed to be manipulative and untruthful.

''Programmer's don't need non-programmer social interaction on a programmer's wiki(they need technical info). For human contact, The BigBlueRoom is the way to go.''

Please examine WelcomeVisitors again. It has been refactored by many people. The second paragraph refer to focus on PeopleProjectsAndPatterns in SoftwareDevelopment. The word People comes first. Within the PeopleProjectsAndPatterns the first paragraph ended with Be kind and use understanding. 

Also, when we talk about people historically there are writers, managers, psychologists, thinkers.... Of course programmers are there as well.
