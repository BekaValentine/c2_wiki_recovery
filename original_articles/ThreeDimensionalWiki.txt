As the current WikiWay cannot scale past a certain amount of interactions (see WikiMess), the (approximately) 2.3 dimensional wiki hypertext must ultimately give way to its fulfillment of 3 dimensions. Call it WebDotInfinity. This is actually a problem with all community-driven sites. There's a scaling problem after about a hundred items. There is no algorithmic solution to the issue of combining "Most Popular" with "Most Recent". The only way to solve it is to '''add another dimension.'''

''Why is "Most Popular" an issue? It is for everyone to find their own interest. On this site the most edited can be found through NewRecentChanges, which reflects either on constructive debate (all positive) or a delete war (positive and negative alternating).'' -- JohnFletcher

[Because some people visit only occasionally -- what will inform them of an interesting set of pages from months ago?  The other reason is for ''scaling''.  On many sites with high daily activity, RecentChanges gets overloaded and no one can tell what is interesting.]
* The WikiPedia solution to this is a WatchList per user.
* Here there are WikiGnome''''''s who put a tag for the month on popular pages. Those are retained.
* RecentChanges is also moved to a page for changes in the month, also retained.

The above is true whether your data is the Internet or your OperatingSystem desktop. A 3-d data visualization model will obliterate the desktop metaphor of interacting with your data and make a KillerUserInterface. A UnifiedDataModel will reinvent the OperatingSystem and unite the Internet. Forget RDF and XML, a 3-d visualization layer will let your visual cortex do the work of making relationships between data.

Work is in progress on a GrandUnification. VisualPython -- the best hope for LanguageIsAnOs -- let the ''data landscape'' be your GUI interface.
