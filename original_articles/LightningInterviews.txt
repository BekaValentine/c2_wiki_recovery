I've developed a video blog format that fits well with my conversational style and available time. I'm calling it ''lightning interviews'' after the well developed practice of lightning talks. My hope is that by jumping right in to the good stuff I can avoid wasting a lot of your time and still give you a good feel for the individual and maybe a few memorable quotes too. I'm publishing on YouTube.

I set the goal of making five interviews before I started promoting any of them. I made the fifth a week or so a go. It was an interview with MichaelMehaffy, a long time ChristopherAlexander colleague.
