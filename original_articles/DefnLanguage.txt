A language created by KarlKnechtel, named after its unique "gelled-together" data type of the same name. It is a sort of cross between Lisp and set theoretic number theory, although some regard it as unrelated to either one. Karl's only comment on this has been "ein, zwei, drei, gsuffa! ...man made all the rest."

The Defn Language Community, frustrated with Karl's slow progress, began a Defn Compiler project on sourceforge (defn.sourceforge.net), which immediately splintered into factions. The Defm and Defo factions are currently neck and neck in highest speed of code execution, while the smaller Defx project has the highest level of functionality.

The original Defn community regards these newer projects as mere revisionists, while the splinter groups regard the original Defn-ers as old fogeys who never get anything done.

The ANSI standards effort has been slowed by a determined pork-barrel blocking effort out of Texas. The original fast-track ISO standards effort ground to a standstill after China and Japan were unable to resolve their differences over the stroke-order of the CJK glyphs for the internationalized version (Defi18n).
