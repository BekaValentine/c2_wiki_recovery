This page is intended to document some common misconceptions about ExtremeProgramming.

A couple have been started:
	* RewritingIsNotRefactoring
	* ExtremeProgramming is not CowboyCoding
	* ExtremeProgramming, instead of NotDoingDesign, is rather about ContinuousDesign (see also XpDoesDesign, DesignInXp, etc.)
	* ExtremeProgramming does not forbid writing any documentation, rather avoid TooMuchDocumentation (see also KeepMassLow, ExtremeDocuments, and OnceAndOnlyOnce)
	* XpIsNotaSilverBullet
	* ReFactoring should not occur in large expensive chunks (See RewritingIsNotRefactoring)

See also PairProgrammingMisconceptions.

Please add others that you are tired of dealing with. Cheers,-- JasonNocks
