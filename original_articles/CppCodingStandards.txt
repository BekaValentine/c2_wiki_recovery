HerbSutter and AndreiAlexandrescu

One of the CppInDepthSeries published by AddisonWesley.

The only C++ coding standard carrying BjarneStroustrup's imprimatur. Summarizes current C++ best practices with one great big fat caveat: de-emphasizes ExtremeFormsForCppCode. 

Follows Stroustrup's BigDesignUpFront neurosis for constness, privacy, and type-safety. Suggests in several places that other languages are "inferior" because they rely on ProgrammerTest''''''s rather than CompilerTest''''''s.

Nevertheless if you're going to work in LateCeePlusPlus this nice skinny book is an absolute must read.
