You've all been had. C2 stands for communism two, not cunningham 2.

This wiki is a communal portal that everyone owns. There is no private property. It is version 2 of communism because it is actually more like libertarian communism - we are all fairly free and c2 is a free market wiki - but at the same time it is communist because there is TragedyOfTheCommons and because it is public property rather than private.
