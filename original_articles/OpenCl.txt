OpenCl (OpenCL) is an open standard for computation on general purpose programming of graphics processors from different manufacturers.

From http://www.khronos.org/opencl/ :

''OpenCLâ„¢ is the first open, royalty-free standard for cross-platform, parallel programming of modern processors found in personal computers, servers and handheld/embedded devices. OpenCL (Open Computing Language) greatly improves speed and responsiveness for a wide spectrum of applications in numerous market categories from gaming and entertainment to scientific and medical software.''

It has been implemented by several suppliers of hardware, and C++ libraries allowing an embedding process:
* ComputeUnifiedDeviceArchitecture (CUDA) from NvidiaCorporation has an implementation.
* ExpressiveProgrammingForGraphicsProcessingUnits (EPGPU) provides a way to make using OpenCl easier.
