'''Wiki Newbie'''

Someone who is new to the WikiWorld and knows very little about wiki, the WikiWay or WikiHistory. Some believe that within a short while the WikiNewbie will either grow bored and leave the WikiWikiWeb or become a WikiLurker and evolve into a WikiGnome, WikiCitizen, or even a WikiMaster (after achieving WikiZen.)

* If you are a WikiNewbie, see NewUserPages, StartingPoints, and TipsForBeginners.
** Add your signature to RecentVisitors.

* If you are no longer a WikiNewbie, please be patient and helpful for those who are (see PrepareTheWay).

''If you continue to use the wiki, you will probably continue to learn more about it for many months after your first visit. Yes, even long after you no longer consider yourself a WikiNewbie.''
