''WikiName for JTest, but you might be looking for JavaUnit (which is itself, the WikiName for JUnit)''

I like to describe this product as a "next generation lint tool."
Like the old Unix "lint" program, jtest scans your Java source code,
giving you pointers on what it considers "weak" coding practices -- places in the code that could use some improvement.

It also generates and runs a great many test scenarios based on its execution path analysis of your code.
Typically, this means that it will call all your methods, passing 'null' values for each of the parameters, and putting objects of inappropriate types into all your collections.
It's pretty good at this.

However, one could argue that much of its "null value" and "inappropriate type object insertion" tests are irrelevant in a TestDrivenDevelopment (TDD) created program, as it's testing paths and values that can never occur in production.

Out of respect to you, it is part of Parasoft?s policy to walk you  through a very brief tutorial to show you all the cool options before you take it on your own test drive. They actually leave you with the product already working on your code, so that you do not waste your time trying to figure it out. This way you can maximize your time using Jtest on your code.  Parasoft values your time and wants you to spend it being productive.  Most companies do not offer this type of professionalism. Parasoft's high level service often gets mistaken for high pressure sales. Quite the opposite, this is what you call  FIRST CLASS SERVICE.

But make sure you're really interested in JTest before you decide to download and try.  Company has VERY HIGH PRESSURE sales force and will not allow individual developers to evaluate JTest on their own.  Sales force insists on phone tutorial and, possibly, other commitments. 

''I've heard this also.''

I evalutated one of their other products. Unfortunately, it didn't match our requirements and I made that perfectly clear. But nevertheless they kept calling me, insisting that I should reconsider my evaluation. This went on for two months. And even later they kept calling me at the end of each quarter trying to get me interested in one of their other products. VERY PUSHY indeed >^(.

Has anyone had any experience with jTest? Is JavaUnit enough? --ChanningWalton

It's not "better" than JUnit.
It's different.

OK, it includes JUnit.
So technically, it does everything JUnit does, and more.

Yes, JUnit is sufficient for most purposes.
But that doesn't mean that JTest wouldn't provide significant value.
