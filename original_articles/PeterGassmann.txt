I live in Switzerland near Zurich. I've studied computer science at the University of Applied Science Brugg-Windisch, Switzerland.

Right now I work for Sun Microsystems in Switzerland at the Sun Java Center, where I do consulting for clients (Java projects, XP projects).
Previously I worked for FJA Feilmeier & Junker AG (http://www.fja.com).

My professional interests are in developing software with Java, including how to manage OO projects, designing OO systems and how to build better software.
