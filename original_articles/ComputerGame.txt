One of the most successful applications of the computer. A subset of the larger class VideoGames.

''In fact, one can argue that computer games are the only computer application that is intrinsically useful (in the economic sense). All other applications (word processing, databases, etc.) only assist in the more efficient production of pigs.''

A ComputerGame can be the framework for:
	* Learning/Teaching
	* Training
	* Working
	* spelling
	* entertainment
	* political decisions
	* economical action

In the end, software not embedded into a ComputerGame has no future. -- FridemarPache

I now currently do all my word processing, spreadsheets and other office work using IdSoftware's marvellous Quake Office III package. Although compatibility with other packages is a bit of a problem, I can shoot the animated paper clip with a rocket launcher and watch its gizzards fly across my screen.

Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT - news) today announced that, according to Media Metrix Inc.'s March 2000 data, people are spending an average of four hours per month playing games on the MSN(TM) Gaming Zone (Applications), more time per month, on average, than is being spent on any other single activity on the Internet.

Well now, isn't part of the reason why we nerds prefer the UnixOperatingSystem to MicrosoftWindows (and CommandLineInterface''''''s to WimpInterface''''''s in general) that the Unix command line has an adventure game-like metaphor: you are in a place, from which you may navigate to other places, some of them hidden, some are distant but may be reached instantly via portals; you may look around you, you may cause things to happen; some people have more ability to cause things to happen than others. You can create new things, that other people can use to do stuff: sh(1) was the first MOO.

''You are in a maze of twisty little directories, all alike. In front of you is a broken pipe... ''

''Check out http://nadvsh.sourceforge.net/ for a shell that actually turns the Unix command line into an adventure game! '''

Whereas the Windows/Icons/Menus/Pointer metaphor is, well, pieces of paper on a desk. You can write on them. Or even file them in a folder. Yawn. -- KeithBraithwaite

I guess the equivalent would be the ill-fated MicrosoftBob.

ComputerGamesWorthPlaying are important for the hardware industry. Consumers don't buy new more-powerful computers for business or Internet apps - they buy them to run the newest hardware-intensive games.

First computer game played - 1976 believe it or not a colour, 3d submarine arcade game at an amusement park where you looked into a "periscope" with lenses that made the scene larger than life, pressed a button and it went "beep, beep, beep ..." and light "torpedo" fired to hit a "distant" ship passing on the horizon. You got 10 shots I hit the last one and it erupted in light and sound, amazing for a 10 year old who had never seed such a thing before. Must have been a combination of mechanical models, LEDs and simple electronics inside but it was definitely stereo-scopic. One of the best games experienced even to this day.

As someone who played a lot of ComputerGame''''''s (and programmed my own too) while growing up, but no time to keep up with them now, the 1/2 hour weekly television show Electric Playground is a vicarious source to see how they continue to evolve. Geared toward a younger audience it is hosted by 2 gen-Xers closer to my age they keep it interesting enough that viewers like myself can be entertained and gives a good one appreciation of the state of the industry. They show clips of all the new games in action and critique them a la Ebert and Roeper, and interview designers/managers from Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo etc and visit the big game conferences.
