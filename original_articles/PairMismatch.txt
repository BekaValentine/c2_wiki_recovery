A PairProgramming session in which one person has significantly more relevant experience than the other.  So much so that the less-experienced programmer will be expecting the senior programmer to direct the entire session.

'''Techniques for dealing with a PairMismatch:'''
	* Don't let it happen (PairProgrammingIsDoneByPeers)
	* LetTheJuniorDrive (AntiPattern)
	* DialogueWhilePairProgramming
	* ChangeDriverRoleFrequentlyAndRegularly
