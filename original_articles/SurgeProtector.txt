A feature of this site (and other wikis) wherein an exessive number of certain actions (such as PageDeletion) within a certain interval, possibly by a certain IP address, automatically triggers a countermeasure (such as edit throttling, an IP ban against the offending poster, etc.)  Intended as a defensive mechanism.

On this site, there is a SurgeProtector which bans any IP address that exceeds an unpublished threshold for PageDeletion.  (Perhaps a similar threshold should be implemented for page ''creation''; otherwise a WikiSpammer who creates new pages containing spam has a tactical advantage over the WikiGnome''''''s who would delete his garbage).

See the link on MeatballWiki for more info.  (In general, information on SurgeProtector''''''s in general, not specific to this site, should go on MeatballWiki).
