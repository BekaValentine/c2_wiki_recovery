---'''Old-School'''
 A continually used term by all ages, to describe older tradition methods, used by everyone 
 including the younger, hypocritical, gen Yhine gen, who reluctantly uses it because they are too busy 
 whining about many other things, for them to come up with a new and unnecessary replacement term, 
 -which had it been created, should have hopefully set them apart as the next new "cool" generation. 
 
 Old age consists of ages nearing or surpassing the life expectancy of human beings, and thus the end of the human life cycle. 
 Euphemisms and terms for old people include, old people (worldwide usage), seniors (American usage), senior citizens 
 (British and American usage) 
  older adults (in the social sciences[1]), 
  the elderly, and elders (in many cultures including the cultures of aboriginal people).
 Old people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more prone to disease, syndromes, and sickness than younger adults
  the organic process of ageing is called senescence
  the medical study of the aging process is gerontology 
  the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is geriatrics
  the elderly also face other social issues such as retirement, loneliness, and ageism
  the chronological age denoted as "old age" varies culturally and historically
 Old age is "a social construct" rather than a definite "biological stage"

---'''Those not old may simulate oldness'''

   Hearing: Use ear plugs to dull the sound of people talking.
   Touch: Wearing thick gloves, button a shirt or buckle a belt.
   Dexterity: With tape around several fingers, unscrew a jar lid.
   Mobility and Balance: Carry packages in one hand while using a walker.

---'''concepts - Old Stuff'''

 Just as many terms/concepts are timeless, such as mini-skirts are always ever fashionable, or term "cool", 
 the current, soon to be replaced gen, is still trying to find a meaningful contribution before hitting middle age.

---'''The new is returning with the old'''
* Return of the classic desktop and Start menu. (shown above) Windows 10 will come with a classic-looking desktop, which should please Windows fans who miss Windows 7. This means there will be a Start menu, too, although it looks a bit different from the menu we're used to. As previous leaks had indicated, the Start menu looks like a hybrid of a standard menu and the tiled Windows 8 interface.
