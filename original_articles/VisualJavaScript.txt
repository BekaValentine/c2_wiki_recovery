Anyone remembers VisualJavaScript? (http://www.jalix.org/ressources/internet/dhtml/_netscape/devguide/vjs.htm)

Right now, everybody is so exited about RichInternetApplications built with dialects of JavaScript (like ActionScript), and we are event starting to see the implementation of frameworks JavaScript as server side language AptanaJaxer... why then, we don't have anything like the very old (and very unknown?) VisualJavaScript that was released by Netscape about 10 years ago? Who owns that code base? Am I the only one that remembers VisualJavaScript? why do we ForgetTheWheel ?
