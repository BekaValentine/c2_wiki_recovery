I am the Senior Architect for Agris Corporation, a division of John Deere.  I can be reached at mailto:hroark@acm.com.

I am an ENTP (I used to be an ENTJ, but the life as a consultant has changed me. Now nothing is ever settled in my life.)  I think P's have more fun than J's.

I am a reformed CppProgrammer now prefering to use Java.  Java, mainly because of the market focus (I suspect), is a much more enjoyable language with better tools.  I don't know how I ever lived without MetaObjects and an Envy-like environment (ala VisualAge For Java).

My interests these days are focused on what does it take to turn someone from a OO-language expert to an OO expert (i.e.: Why does the person next to me know so much about C++ (for example) and yet so little about OO and the idioms that go along with it?).  Also, I am interested in why there seems to be so few good OO people.

I commonly recommend ''Thinking in C++''
ISBN:0139177094 and ''Thinking in Java''
ISBN:0136597238 to people wishing to learn OO.  I love ''Design Patterns''
(GOF) but find it difficult to those new to OO to understand.  As such, I am now recommending ''ObjectOrientedDesignHeuristics''
by Arthur J. Riel ISBN:020163385X, ''Designing Object-Oriented C++ Applications : Using the Booch Method''
by Robert Martin ISBN:0132038374, and ''TheCrcCardBook''
by David Bellin and Susan Suchman Simone ISBN:0201895358.  All are excellent and tend to get developers thinking in terms of objects quickly.

''Isn't HankRoark the name of an AynRand protagonist?''

Hank Roark is two AynRand heroes in one.  Howard Roark was the hero of TheFountainhead; Hank Rearden was a hero of AtlasShrugged.
