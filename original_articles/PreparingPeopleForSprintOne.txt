The people issues in software development are by far the most important and the ones that will have the biggest impact on project success. 

They are also the most difficult to describe general purpose patterns for because humans are unpredictable and human behaviour varies with geography, culture and time of day.

Here's a few patterns that I would like some else to take a crack at, I'm hopeless at this mushy people stuff:

* BuildSelfOrganizingTeams
* DealWithResistanceToChange
* BuildingTrust
* BeingAgile
** BeingAgileEqualsBeingNice 
** BeingAgileEqualsBeingAccountable
** BeingAgileEqualsBeingConfident
