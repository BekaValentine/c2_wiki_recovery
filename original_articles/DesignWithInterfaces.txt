This is from DesignInIdl, where someone mentions that the point is to DesignWithInterfaces without violating TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign.

In every (reasonable) programming language I am aware of, it is possible to write code without function/procedure/method/whatever bodies. This is just classical TopDownDesign, or perhaps BottomUpDesign, depending on your perspective. (That is part of why the HolyWar between TopDownDesign and BottomUpDesign is so silly.)

What bugs me is the fact that so few programming environments on linux (read text editors) seem to want to support this. In fact, ProgramsAreDatabases, not text files. Go there and read or write more, please.
