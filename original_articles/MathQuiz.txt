Mathematical quizzes. Some consist of one question, others of a set of questions which may or may not be related. VickiKerr started the whole thing and thus receives most of the blame.

	* MathQuizOne (formerly on this page) -- VickiKerr
	* MathQuizTwo (the submarine thing) -- StephanHouben
	* MathQuizThree (space-filling functions) -- DavisHerring
	* MathQuizFour (MartinGardner puzzles, mostly) -- HapAngery
	* MathQuizFive (fun with statistics) -- VickiKerr (probably)
	* MathQuizSix (numbers in other bases) -- AaronBlack

'''Rules''' (from VickiKerr)

I guess there are some common rules in such things.

''[In response to a request for fewer spoilers]'': I'm considering ways to make spoilers less likely. Q3 is now in MathQuizOne. I haven't really solved the spoiler problem, and reserve the right to request certain details by email to prevent cheating!

Ideas for future questions are welcome below. However, only ideas please, not complete questions (to maintain fairness). I may well delete ideas once I have read them! Note that questions must be genuinely mathematical but reasonably accessible. Subtle problems in statistics, for example, would not be suitable.
