RubyEmbed is a set of code in the RubyLanguage and CeePlusPlus which enable AlternateHardAndSoftLayers. The main program is in C++, and can call a Ruby layer which can call back to C++ and also load and use C++ or C extensions interfaced using the SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator. -- JohnFletcher
