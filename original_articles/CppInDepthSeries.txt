The CppInDepthSeries is a series of books on C++ published by AddisonWesley. Several of them already have pages in this WikiWiki

	* CppCodingStandards ''HerbSutter & AndreiAlexandrescu''
	* CppTemplateMetaprogramming ''David Abrahams & Alexsey Gurtovoy''
	* EssentialCpp ''Stanley Lippman''
	* ExceptionalCpp ''HerbSutter''
	* ExceptionalCppStyle ''HerbSutter''
	* ModernCeePlusPlusDesign ''AndreiAlexandrescu''
	* TheBoostGraphLibrary ''Jeremy Siek, Lie-Quan Lee & Andrew Lumsdaine''

Others seem not to have arrived here yet apart from some mentions on DefinitiveCeePlusPlusBooks.

	* Accelerated C++ ''AndrewKoenig & BarbaraMoo''
	* More Exceptional C++ ''HerbSutter''
	
Most of these I have 'on my BookShelf' as I refer to them for different ideas and bits of code. Those that are not on my shelf are on my shopping list.
