A ValueObject is a lightweight domain abstraction that has value semantics. It is typically (but not always) implemented as an immutable class. Examples are Money, Currency, Point and Rectangle objects.

This page lists known descriptions and documentation of ValueObject as a pattern. This literature either directly talks about value objects or uses terms that directly led to its current definition as given above.
