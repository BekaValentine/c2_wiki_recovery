Information Management is about documents, CAD drawings, spreadsheets, program code. IM means ensuring access, security, delivery, and storage. It deals exclusively with explicit representations. Creation, use, learning, meaning, understanding, and negotiation are NOT core issues but efficiency, timeliness, accuracy, veracity, speed, cost, storage space and retrieval ARE central concerns in IM.

Creation of information IS a core issue of information management, as are the other
stated non-core issues.  Information enters (is created for) an information system as collections of data signals by some important means, either artificially by another system or by human data entry. At that point, "local" information management comes into play.
The data/information must be used, have meaning, and be understood, otherwise it
would likely be rejected or discarded.  Information management creates a means
by which to evaluate the usefulness, meaning, and understanding of the data/information.
