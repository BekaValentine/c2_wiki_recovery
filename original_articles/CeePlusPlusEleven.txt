C++11 (formerly also known as "C++0x") is the current standard for C++, adopted in August 2011. Many parts of it are available in GnuCpp version 4.3.0 (or later), by Microsoft Visual C++, by Intel's ICC, and by many other compilers.

* Design

* Compiler support in GnuCpp version 4.3.0 and later:
** http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html
*** This web page crossreferences to the corresponding documents in the standard.
* ConceptCpp for one particular topic ("Concepts") proposed for C++11 which has now been dropped
* BjarneStroustrup maintains a FAQ on C++11 at http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html
** The FAQ has a pointer to a table of which compilers support which new features.

C++11 features include support for anonymous functions (lambdas), concurrency, efficient "moving" of objects (via "rvalue references"), VariadicTemplates, extensive new library facilities, fairly strong C99 compatibility and more.

'C++0X' looks a little like a dead fish.
