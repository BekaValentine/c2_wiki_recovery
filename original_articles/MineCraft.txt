MineCraft is a three-dimensional SandBoxGame created by MarkusPersson to replace InfiniMiner. The absence of this page until recently is major evidence of the fact that WikiIsDead.

''No, it's only evidence of the fact that we think MineCraftIsBoring.''

WikiIsNotDead And MinecraftIsNotBoring.

*That's it! Because MineCraft is taking a lot of time and Wiki is taking a lot of time and both can be very interesting, so you can not really do both at the same time. Wiki people do Wiki and games people do MineCraft. So wiki people are unlikely to write a lot about MineCraft and games people build their Wikis inside the game and not here. 

''Games people do MineCraft and wiki people do MindCraft? :-)''
