Since early 2002 there have been quite a few events called 'sprint' in the PythonLanguage/ZopeApplicationServer world. A sprint in this terminology is a get together for 3 to 5 days of programmers interested in working on an open source project. Sprints usually have a multinational audience. 

Often a conference is preceeded by a sprint (so much so that any self-respecting Python conference is now preceeded by a sprint), but sprints also occur standalone. One or more sprint coaches guide the process all along. Sprints are said to be inspired by an XP concept (references?).

The first instance of the sprint phenomenon has emerged as part of Zope 3 development and there have been many Zope 3 sprints since then (in the US, Europe, Australia and South America):

The sprint phenomenon has now spread to other projects like the Zope-based PloNe project:

and the PyPy project, a project to reimplement the PythonLanguage in an innovative way in Python:

---> http://codespeak.net/pypy/ (a number of sprints are described in their wiki http://codespeak.net/moin/pypy/moin.cgi/FrontPage?action=show)

There has also been a sprint focused on the Python language core itself:

Sprints have also spread beyond Python-land:
