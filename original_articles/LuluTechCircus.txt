I got to play 20 minutes of UnrealTournament 2003. The graphics were impressive. Can't say the gameplay seemed any different (that is to say, it was no more or less fun than previous versions -- just prettier).

The Lego Mindstorms booth was cool, but as an adult, I stood back and let the kids have fun. 

It seemed lightly attended. A few of my friends hadn't even heard of it the night before it started.
