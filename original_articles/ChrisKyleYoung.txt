This is the WikiHomePage of Chris K. Young, of http://cloud9.hedgee.com/. I also have a journal at http://www.blurty.com/users/cky/. Please refer to the above links for anything you wish to know that's not covered here, or mailto:wiki@hedgee.com.

I live in Auckland, NewZealand, currently working as a programmer. My favourite programming languages include AssemblyLanguage, C++ (CeePlusPlus), and elisp (EmacsLisp).

People I program with (feel free to add yourself to the list):
	* BradleyGrainger (http://cryo.gen.nz/)
	* EdwardSargisson (http://www.pobox.com/~esarge/)

I am a member of the KernelPanicLinuxUsersGroup, even though I am unable to attend their monthly meetings for locality reasons. This would be a perfect opportunity for you to perform the BreakingBreadTest if you know one of the members of that group; a fair number have met me in RealLife.

Or, if you happen to come by Auckland, be sure to get in touch sometime, and I'll be happy to have a game of badminton with you! (If you're not into badminton, I'm sure there would be some activity that we could both enjoy.)

For even more stringent identity checks, I'm a ThawteWebOfTrust notary. To be a notary, you have to be certified by three or more existing notaries, or (in my case) by Thawte personnel. If you wish to be notarised, just let me know.

Outside of computing stuff, I love playing the piano (sometimes even more than programming), and OnceUponaTime I actually took time outdoors to tramp as well; NewZealand is one of those fine places where there's plenty of good scenery wherever you go (except Auckland, of course).

PetPeeve''''s with programming styles used by some C programmers:
	* Gratuitous use of postincrement and postdecrement operators (by gratuitous, I mean using the postfix operators in contexts where using the prefix operators would be just as correct). In C, it's probably just a stylistic issue, whereas in C++, if the object concerned has overloaded operators (usually with operator++(int) implemented in terms of operator++(void)), i++ is no faster (and in fact, usually slower, especially if the operator is implemented using an out-of-line function) than ++i, which makes a bad tradeoff if the return value is unused.
	* Treatment of pointers as integers (especially when people use %u or %x conversion specifications to print out the value of a pointer---and the compiler is not in a position to complain about the mismatched argument types, since printf is a variadic function). The size of a pointer is as implementation-defined as the size of an int, and they should not be assumed to be equal. The printf function has a %p conversion specification for a reason, after all.

When I first encounter a social circle, the first question that gets asked of me is, `how do you know whoevermabob?' (''whoevermabob'' being the person who introduced me to the circle). So, to preempt that question here, the short story is that my ProjectManager has asked me to research on, and advocate, UnitTest''''ing in the office.

Of course, what no one anticipated was that I'd end up advocating ExtremeProgramming in its entirety! While I'm unsure of its viability in my current workplace, I will be sure to give it a whirl when the time comes for me to move on.

By the way, I would name this page ChrisKYoung if it were a WikiName. Well, at least it should satisfy the curiosity of all those who asked me what the `K' in my name stood for.
