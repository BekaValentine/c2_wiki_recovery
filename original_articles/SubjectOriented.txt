We all know what ObjectOriented means. But what does SubjectOriented mean?

Well there have been lots of people trying to make it mean something pretty much since ObjectOrientation was invented. But nothing has stuck. DoshMosh uses the term in a RestFul way. Basically it regards web pages, tweets, posts and user opinions of all sorts as representations of a subject. And it allows people to contrast and compare those subjects. 

This is pretty different to what we do with methods on objects. Subjects don't have methods - they have contexts. Which are a little bit like aspects - except arranged in a SemiLattice. So it is conceivable that a system could be ObjectOriented and SubjectOriented at the same time ...
