If you like the games played at PlopConference and EuroPlop you may want to have a look at the NewGamesFoundationBooks. GeorgePlatts let me browse his collection and here are some references. Some of them have a nice collection of parachute games. Lots of pictures, good instructions for use, for variation, good memories. -- MartineDevos
