An Agile project can...
* Accept feature requests in any order (the PlanningGame, DoSimpleThings, RefactorMercilessly)
* Release any integration (TestDrivenDevelopment, FrequentIntegration)
* Minimize the time between committing to a feature and letting end-users profit from it (SoftwareInProcess)

"Agile" is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of methods that encourage continual realignment of development goals with the needs and expectations of the customer. See http://AgileManifesto.org for a concise statement of beliefs held in common by the developers of these varied methods.
