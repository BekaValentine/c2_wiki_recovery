'''UK north-west agile group'''

AgileNorth is the UK's north-west regional agile discussion group.  We meet on the third Monday of each month at a pub in Warrington, just off the M6/M62, to share our experiences of AgileProcesses etc.  The aim of the group is round-table discussion of agile software methods.  Recent meetings have covered a broad spectrum, including MDA, domain modelling, prioritization of TechnicalRisk, QuestioningExtremeProgramming, reuse and many many more.

Contributors to recent meetings have included KevinRutherford, PhranRyder, SimonMonk, CliveMenhinick, GuyFrancis, RobJarratt, StephenHutchinson and AnotherMikeThomas...

Everyone is welcome - beginners, experts and skeptics alike.  Attendance is free - just come along and join in the debate.  If you'd like to know more, contact KevinRutherford or visit our home page at http://agilenorth.org.uk.
