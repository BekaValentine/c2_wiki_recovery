Do programming for a living. Coined the term "NonIntrusiveMethods" some time before the term AgileMethods became the vogue. Do like Eiffel and the SmalltalkLanguage, none of which I currently use to earn a living. C# takes care of that for the time being.

Got my BSc Honours Degree from U.M.I.S.T (University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology) in 1991.

Live just outside Oslo, NorwayCountry.

At WOOD'97 in Oslo I had the pleasure of sitting at the same table as RonJeffries during lunch. Wow! Autographs to be handed out on request :-)
