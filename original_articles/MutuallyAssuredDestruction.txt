MutuallyAssuredDestruction was the basis of detente. In short, it involved having so many missiles pointed at each other by the US and USSR that if anyone shot one off, everyone on the planet would die. With the end of the ColdWar, this particular idiocy seems to have been disassembled.

''As a means of avoiding WorldWarThree, MutuallyAssuredDestruction is very successful, it prevented WW3 for decades, while allowing entire industries to harmlessly yet frenetically prepare for it.''

It may not work on religious or dogmatic fanatics who find glory in taking ''everyone'' with them to judgment day. At least the Soviets wanted to live. We can't say the same about the new batch of dogmaticians.
