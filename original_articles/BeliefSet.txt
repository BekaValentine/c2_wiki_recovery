----

A primal para-psi concept by JaneRoberts. Here's the logic:

	* Term: ''Beliefs'' are opinions about life held by sentience.
	* Axiom 1: '''BeliefsCreateReality.''' Period.
	* Axiom 2: The point of power is in the present. '''All time is simultaneous.'''
	* Axiom 3: Indefinite realms of alternate '''ProbableRealities''' of each minor variation exist, and obviously beyond detection by any commonly known sensors.
	* Axiom 4: ContradictoryBeliefSet''''''s enable '''bad mental health'''. Get better by considering your beliefs looking for clusters of related ones that may more easily harbor these.

Reality floats in a field engineered by life to fit those axioms to a "corollary" of 3 dimensional space, math & physics constants, and time. All are camouflages on perceptual abilities and other-worldly communications.

When you die, you reunite with an "OverSoul", and then arrive at a new life, in any different reality.

Believing these things enables EtheIsm morality principles.

For what it's worth, this is a variant on a philosophical strain called ''idealism''

''Insofar as it returns control to the user, yes.''
