I used to run a NYC/New Jersey transit-related website at [deleted], with a simple itinerary planner.  The site also features a transit-related wiki: [deleted].

I'm also big fan of XML-related technologies.

Currently researching social, mobile computing, web services, and transit systems as a PhD Candidate in Albany, NY.
