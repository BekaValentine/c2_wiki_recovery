''I would have to say that the jury is out on the breakdown size, but it is a case of when not if. As for organic movement, maybe, maybe not. The roles may also happen spontaneously to different people at different times. I expect you are right in the main but the roles can change for specific moments during development. -- TomAyerst''

Okay, but when speaking of methodologies and process aren't you looking for the major trends rather than the exceptions? -- RobertDiFalco

''Often yes, but many of the most interesting findings come from minor offshoots. That is, after all where paradigm shifts usually start. -- ta (I could use twa but I might get mistaken for an airline :-)''

I'm not sure I disagree but I'm not sure I agree either. I've often viewed paradigm shifts as allowing people to do what they have always wanted to but have been prevented to by existing conventions. I often see a paradigm shift as the result of freeing us up to do the most natural thing. This is different than a fringe case. -- rd

We all know the rules for success in our business or professions, yet we also know that these rules--paradigms--can change at any time. What Joel Barker does in Paradigms: The Business of Discovering the Future is explain how to spot ParadigmShift''''''s, how they unfold, and how to profit from them. Through the power of this method--paradigm spotting--you can:
* find the people in your organization most likely to spot a new trend
* help your key people adept when a massive change is occurring
* learn to effectively grapple with your "intractable problems" and improve your results incalculably.

In addition, Paradigms is full of concrete examples of paradigm shifts and predictions for the future, and contains a new introduction detailing recent developments and pointing out areas to watch for paradigm shifts.

Joel Barker also has some videos which provide a good discussion of these ideas.
