The canonical universal solution to a FalseDichotomy.

Example:
* Option A - "Everything must be written in C++ for Windows!
* Option B - "Everything must be written in C for Linux!

'''or''' the always-there option '''C''' - ''Reject the extremes and find a workable, pragmatic solution.''

Other examples needing a pragmatic hybrid include:
* Adobe PhotoShop or PaintShopPro. Emacs or Vi. Notepad or Wordpad. 
** ''They can all be chosen''
** Some counter arguments may be found in PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers and related topics.
* You must be either a liberal pot-smoking democrat or conservative child-molesting republican. 
** ''In reality you can be a socially liberal, fiscally conservative, pot smoking (but not inhaling), under 18 republican who is paid to infiltrate the democratic party.''
