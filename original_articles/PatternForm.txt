A PatternForm is the literary structure of a written description of a pattern. The simplest pattern form is ThereforeBut. The DesignPatternsBook uses a more detailed and structured form. It is interesting to study the pattern form (as opposed to only studying patterns themselves) since the pattern form is a pedagological tool applicable to more than just software and architecture. In other words, "What makes patterns so powerful as a teaching and communicating tool?"
