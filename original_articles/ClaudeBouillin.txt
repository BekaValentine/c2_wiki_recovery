I have been a programmer at NokiaNetworks (later Nokia Siemens Networks) in Helsinki, Finland for about 20 years. I learned real programming in the 80s, on Sinclair/Basic, UCD Pascal, PL/M, C, then C++, Java, sh and lately rediscovering the amazingly matured Perl.

I have had MarcGirod and DavidPrice as work mates. Think of that...

I am a technical person by affinity, and a SW designer by education and inclination. And an active musician (http://www.geocities.com/boolabus/). Irish traditional: banjo, mandolin, mandola, shaker. Lot of fun!
