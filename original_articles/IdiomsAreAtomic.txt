It is a general rule in linguistics that idioms must be treated as a unit, and should not be analyzed (except etymologically) from the meaning of their component words. Thus, an idiom's internal structure may be ungrammatical, logically invalid ('I could care less' for 'I couldn't care less', a sarcastic variant of the latter which became common in and of itself) or even nonsensical ('head over heels' for feeling as if you were turned upside down, or the now-forgotten 'where's the beef?' for 'there's no substance to this'), but nonetheless be a valid statement in the language '''if''' the whole is recognized for its accepted meaning by the majority of the population within which the idiom is current. -- JayOsako

It remained current for about two years before fading out of popularity.
