Sometimes you are stuck with a silly task because others can't do it.

For example, a generalist IT person may may be able to write a simple application, but some oddball features may be beyond his/her ability or limited by the RAD tool he/she used. He/she can say, "sorry, but my tool does not allow me to implement that". But if you are a dedicated application programmer, then you are expected to be able to tweak the tools more or write it in a more powerful language such that you are expected to implement the goofy feature. It is okay when the feature is actually useful, but a bummer when the feature is a dumb idea.
