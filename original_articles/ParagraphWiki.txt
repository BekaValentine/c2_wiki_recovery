A ParagraphWiki is a wiki based on paragraphs instead of pages, or instead of just pages. This finer granularity may help with certain types of EditWar''''''s and provide better reference granularity and author content tracking. An experimental idea only. It would be sort of a compromise between a wiki and a discussion forum.

An open question is whether a max paragraph size should be machine-enforced to ensure sufficient granularity.

This reminds me of the XanaduProject.

''Shit, that association will doom the idea for sure.''
