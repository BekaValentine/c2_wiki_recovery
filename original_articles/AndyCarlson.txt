Andy Carlson is a Technical Architect currently working for Tech Mahindra's Business Consulting group in the UK.

Andy's professional interests have long included object orientation, design patterns (e.g. EssenceObject), distributed systems, Java and J2EE. More recent interests include Web Services, the Semantic Web and discovering the true meaning of the term SoftwareArchitect.

Domain-wise, the main focus is on telcos... order management, provisioning, rating, network planning, inventory. Other industries I've worked in include finance, supply-chain, manufacturing and travel.

Another (non work-related) interest is in the wartime activities of Bletchley Park and German cypher machines in general. I've written an Enigma machine which you can play with at http://homepages.tesco.net/~andycarlson/enigma/enigma_j.html.
