''Carole, AreYouThere? OrphanPage, last edit 2000-06-16''

I spent a number of years in the UK education system teaching in primary, secondary and special education, including teaching pupils excluded from school. In 1992 I joined ULTRALAB, a learning technology research lab based in South East England.  The mission statement of the lab is to make learning more delightful using new technologies.  I have worked on a number of online projects since 1992.
