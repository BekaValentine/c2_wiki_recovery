Which of the OfficialXpPersonnel do you want to be the next President of the United States?

	* [xxxxx] 163 : WardCunningham (have you read my platform?)
	* [xxxxxx] 195 : KentBeck
	* [xx] 115 : RonJeffries
	* [xxxx] 22 : MartinFowler
	* [xxx] 78 : KenAuer
	* [x] 0 : RobMee ''because of the name...''

''What's the significance of the large numbers following the 'x's?''

These are the votes already "taken out" of the ballot boxes and totalled.

I voted for MartinFowler because he's making a campaign stop in my neck of the woods (Sun Burlington) Thursday.
