''The Dance Of Change'' 

http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0385493223.01._PE_PI_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg
penned by Peter M. Senge, others, ISBN: 0385493223 is the follow-up to TheFifthDisciplineFieldBook, and discusses the interactions between forces encouraging (organizational) change and forces limiting or suppressing change. It's pretty good, if also suffering a little from the "everyone's a really nice committed person really" over-optimism of the first book.
