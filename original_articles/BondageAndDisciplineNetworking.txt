A variation of the BondageAndDisciplineLanguage first observed due to usage of TheOnionRouter.

This pattern describes the constraints imposed upon networking code which runs over TheOnionRouter. One constraint is that strong authentication measures and cryptography have to be used when communicating because anyone can control an exit node and intercept the traffic. Furthermore, BondageAndDisciplineNetworking leads to code with very low communication complexity because of the high lags.

BondageAndDisciplineNetworking can help building fairly robust networking solutions.

This sounds like performing bondage by tying up someone using networking cables.
