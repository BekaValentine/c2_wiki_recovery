A type of WikiBot used by spammers to post WikiSpam automatically.

Suspect such a bot is responsible if you notice many pages in succession edited from an unusual or Chinese ip address (eg., starting with 61, 218 or 221), and add a report to WikiSpammers if spamming is confirmed.

See WikiSpamSolutions for ways to deal with this problem.
