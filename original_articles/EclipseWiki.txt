A Wiki Editor plugin for the EclipseIde by ChanningWalton.

See http://eclipsewiki.sourceforge.net/

The above site is a little sparse on documentation regarding the installation and initialization of the plugin,
so I'm sharing what I've learned (''-- JohnDouglasPorter''):

	0 download the zip file as appropriate for your Eclipse version, and then extract it directly into your eclipse/plugins/ directory.
	0 (re)start Eclipse.
	0 somewhere in your navigator, create a new file called M''''''ainPage.wiki.

You're good to go.  All files named .wiki are associated (once the plug-in has been plugged in) with this Eclipse Wiki plug-in's editor.
