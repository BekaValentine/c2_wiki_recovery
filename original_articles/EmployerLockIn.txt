Many employees would like to JustLeave their existing jobs, but there are many things that can keep people from leaving bad jobs:

'''Restrictions'''
	* OverlyBroadIntellectualPropertyAgreements or anti-competitive clauses in contracts
	* Bad economy (that is, no alternative jobs available)
	* Use of technologies (proprietary or obsolete) that leave one with an unmarketable skill set
	* Requiring so much OverTime that there's no time for finding something better
	* Immigration indenture

'''Golden Handcuffs'''
	* Stock options
	* Deferred bonuses
	* Health benefits
	* Higher-than-average pay
	* Position of authority or respect
	* Personal relationships with co-workers

The above make some people feel that they are "stuck" with a particular employer, no matter how bad the job is.  In the case of the "restrictions", this feeling may be valid, but people who keep themselves locked in GoldenHandcuffs have only themselves to blame.
