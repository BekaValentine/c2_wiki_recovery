Sometimes I think I'm a little fishy swimming in the sea.
As the sun shines on the water far above I hear the little mermaids sing their little mermaid song.

Little bubbles from silly little men and women tickle me as they drift up, up towards the light.


When I'm not a little fishy I tend to stay away from the ocean - there be Sharks and Other Dangerous Animals.

I wasn't even looking for a Wiki when I stumbled across a reference to TWiki in a slashdot post. Since then I've been a convert. I've been running TWiki since 1999 and at this workplace, we're currently examining java based Wiki because of their crossplatformness. But I haven't found a java/servlet based Wiki that's as featureful as TWiki (Authentication, RevisionControl, Usable TextFormattingRules, uploads, plugins) so the search goes on...
