And of course the song:

   On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me beer

   On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me
   Two turtle necks
   And a beer

   On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me
   Three French toast
   Two turtle necks
   And a beer

   ...

   Five golden touques
   Four pounds of back bacon
   Three French toast
   Two turtle necks
   And a beer... in a tree
I need another beer after that.
