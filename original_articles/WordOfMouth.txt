WordOfMouth is when an idea is spread without the assistance of WellKnownSources. People certainly use the Internet as a WordOfMouth system, for example -

	* Forwarding emails
	* Putting links on web pages.
	* Posting to bulletin boards.

However these systems are not optimised WordOfMouth in the way that PosterCentricMessageSubscriptionProtocol is. -- PhilipDorrell
