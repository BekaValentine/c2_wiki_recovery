''Writers' Workshops and the Work of Making Things'' by RichardGabriel (ISBN 020172183X)

This book describes how to run a writer's workshop both for software patterns people and for just plain writers. The book attempts to explain how and why the process works, and the author has attempted the ridiculous goal of trying to make it accessible to computer people and writers at the same time.
