---'''Describe WoolenLanguage here'''
* Basic Description:
** Language in constant flux, in the process of becoming something other than fuzzy-words, developing its own definitions, structures, processes and environment, building itself into something fit for DoingStuff its users want to do, need to do, keeping a friendly user-extensible-framework.
* Features - a language which:
** produces predictable results, given the same named artifacts, regardless of when in the development cycle or maturity the artifactories are run
** does not obsolete its established predescessors nor take away their footprint or obsolete their operations
* Finish and Maturity - a language
** always adding to itself some of TheOtherThings needed by its users while retaining all of what it has been able to do in the past
** which has stepwise maturity, with DateStampedVersions
** which intends to be relevant and operational on new hardware and new operating systems 
---'''Useful functions and approaches'''
* using colon-prefixes to
** alphabetize
** read-to-me
** create
** allow versioning - makes new versions, with wanted results, by offered suggestions, changes, or introduction of existing or to-be-created-artifactory features, such that they make versioned-artifacts. 
** establish
** introduce
** give-example
** show-me
** save-complete
** store-reachable (everything needed is made reachable, ( available ), whether you are online or offline)

---'''Allows'''
* for different versions of the same artifactory to perform to produce or act upon artifacts in versioned fashion, with newer versions tending toward more efficiency, speed, and producing higher throughput (though not always so)
* the completion of large projects, using limited resources, spread out by time and geo-space, creating Artifactories which are synergistic, RequireNoAutomaticUpdates, and of which can be said: '''ItWorks'''
* Date-Stamping with Date-range-expressions like: ( 19950525-20141222 ) ''Life-span to current, of WardsWiki''
