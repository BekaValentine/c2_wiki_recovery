A large swathe of pages has just moved to WhyClublet. WhyClublet has very properly included an easy redirect mechanism so that links to Ward's wiki pages automatically RedirectTo here. Can we have a similar mechanism so that links to over there, or to any other community, can also be made into automatic redirects?

Without such a mechanism, InterWiki communication is stifled, and that may result in the various why pages, for instance, winding up back here ...

Note that numerous other wikis (such as ZwiKi, MoinMoin, UseModWiki, WikkiTikkiTavi) and AdvoGato have chosen a common "InterWiki" syntax for such links.  This system allows such links without a master "index" page.  (ZWiki keeps the site->URL mapping in wiki pages, but the other sites keep the map in a separate file.)  This style of InterWiki also allows links to multiple wikis with the same (local) page name.  (For instance, one can use ZWiki:RecentChanges and UseModWiki:RecentChanges.)

I am willing to port this form of InterWiki to the local C2 code if Ward wants this feature.  --CliffordAdams

''That certainly sounds like the solution to the possible problem.''

* Last change was 2004. Was it done any time?
* And is there a mechanism to redirect from one local wiki page to another? --ManorainjanHolzapfel 10/2014
