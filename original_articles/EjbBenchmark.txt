The goal of this benchmark is to provide some objective basis for the hard design decisions every EJB development team has to make. This is not a benchmark of application servers. We do not test the performance of one application server versus any other app. server. The benchmark does test the performance of six EjbIdioms all running on the same application server and using the same database. The benchmark seeks to answer questions such as: 

	* how should I design my EJBs to maximize performance when accessing a single instance of data at a time? 
	* how should I design my EJBs to maximize performance when accessing a collection of data instances at a time? 
	* how should I design my EJBs to maximize the performance under a load?

Are there other EJB benchmarking tools?
