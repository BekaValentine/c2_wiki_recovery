This page is reserved for some smart algorithm that describes the most forgotten pages in WikiWeb. ''(Something along the lines of LeastRecentChanges?)''

''I successfully mentioned ZenWindow for about six months before it was touched and thus not "forgotten" any more. I was pretty amazed it took that long, but it's a perfect page. I could list all the pages not edited since 1995, but I'm not going to. There are ''only'' tens of thousands of pages; go discover them for yourself, but keep them to yourself. -- SunirShah''
