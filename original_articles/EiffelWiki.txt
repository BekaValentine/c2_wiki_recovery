The Eiffel Wiki is a site for news and ideas about the EiffelLanguage:

	* http://efsa.SourceForge.net/cgi-bin/view/

But, like all good wikis, people are writing about broader issues too.

Pages are served by TWiki (TwikiClone). The file-upload, versioning and indexing capabilities of TWiki make it possible to us to host the Eiffel Forum Software Archive as a collectively-maintained wiki site.
