'''zL Work Bench'''

It is an old habit. Even in Wiki I need to jot notes to my self or my team in a perhaps strange combination of nested outlines of thoughts containing a KeyWord or cryptic comment. The trick for me is even after I have captured an entire creation as far as I am concerned, is to figure how to tranform the singleton words into sentences and paragraphs and turn my strange thoughtline into something other people call a document.

'''AugmentingHumanIntellect'''

is the goal created by Douglas C. Engelbart in 1957. 

	* "augmenting the human intellect" -- DougEngelbart 1957
	* 'Within weeks I had committed my career to "augmenting the human intellect."' -- DougEngelbart 1985

Douglas C. Engelbart in December 1985 (for his lecture on "The Augmented Knowledge Workshop" at the ACM Conference "The History of Personal Workstations") when he is describing the Genesis of his "Framework" (AugmentationFramework) quotes himself from 1957.

In December 2000, DougEngelbart received the USA National Medal of Technology for 2000, for "creating the foundations of personal computing".

There is very good article (with a silly title) written Feb 2001 in The Almanac News that fills in some of the history from 1985-2001 along with some of the things still to come from "Doug Engelbart's Unfinished Revolution" and the AugmentationFramework.

By 1962 the "Framework" (AugmentationFramework) for AugmentingHumanIntellect in 1957 had been refined into the AugmentationSystem with it's two subsystems.

	* The Augmentation System
		* The Human System
		* The Tool System

"I broke the many parts of the Augmentation System into two main sub-systems: one contained all of the hardware, software and other artifacts -- the Tool System; and all the rest of it I called the Human System. Note that the Human System contains our natural languages, and the conceptualizations and formalisms of every discipline: an overwhelming network of invention. (Sometimes, in the early years, I called these the Service System and the User System). 6A1B" -- DougEngelbart 1985

		* A Chronology of Events - 1968 - Paragraph 6G4

This "public debut" on Dec 9th 1968 of the state of the AugmentationSystem is commonly referred to as TheMotherOfAllDemos.

I have a tendency to use the phrase "Augmentation Of the Human Intellect" to describe the mission and others (including Doug) have different variations of that original quote to try to communicate the concept.

It is the HumanSystem subsystem of the AugmentationSystem Framework that has always been the important part of AugmentingHumanIntellect, not the ToolSystem subsystem.

Identifing the requirement for HumanPointingInterface in the HumanSystem was more important towards advancing the goal of AugmentingHumanIntellect than  

the ChordSet , the Mouse

I have been a long time advocate of the ThoughtProcessor 
style HumanInterface of a Tool called More [ ref ] 
by DaveWiner . While More got abandoned as a product , 
a new DaveWiner company UserLand created Frontier 
and ventured off into the realm of a Scriptible 
ObjectDatabase that has grown over the years. 

In December 1999 UserLand offered free web sites 
on their new FrontierManila server EditThisPage. 
The offer was obviously designed to catch me and it did, 
so I have been experimenting with  the ManilaInterface feeling some frustrations over the constraints imposed on what features available 
in Frontier ThePowersThatBe feel should be locked 
and unavailable to web.

Spotted specific request that RandyKramer asked about SqueakSmalltalk versus DolphinSmalltalk from people familiar with both. 

	* SqueakSmalltalk . 
		* It is the complete OpenSource SmalltalkLanguage that is FreeAsInBeer.
		* Created and guided by the authors and designers of the SmalltalkLanguage.
			* Dan Ingles and AlanKay
		* The modern update to Smalltalk-80 from an original license one image.
		* Create MorphicInterface Project instead of ModelViewController Project
		* SqueakSmalltalk does not yet support ModelViewPresenter 

		* DolphinSmalltalk is a good Win32Smalltalk.
			* ModelViewPresenter was a good change to ModelViewController
			* Moving your Project from the free to complete version is not that hard
				* It does depend on what your Project is

		* -- LantzRowland

RandyKramer also asked for preference between SmalltalkLanguage, EiffelLanguage and PythonLanguage. 

	* SqueakSmalltalk . 
		* Other SmalltalkLanguage
			* I love EnvyDeveloper but can rarely afford it
			* VisualWorks is very good
			* DolphinSmalltalk is good if you are only interested in Win32
		* EiffelLanguage is a good language
		* For scripting I prefer PerlLanguage over PythonLanguage and use both
		* -- LantzRowland
