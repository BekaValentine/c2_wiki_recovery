''The Future Of Information'' is a book TedNelson wrote in 1997; it's written to/for the WorldWideWebConsortium, especially TimBernersLee; NetScape, especially MarcAndreessen, and MicroSoft, especially BillGates.

It's full of great zingers like 'Two cheers for the web'. But seriously, it is quite provocative on the subject of WebArchitecture and SoftwareArchitecture in general.

It's available as fax images. http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/INFUTscans/INFUTscans.html [BrokenLink 2009-06-25]

At my request, he sent me the fulltext of the book, and I converted it to HTML with sections and links and such. I asked him if I could publish it via HTTP, and he said no, he's holding out for transcopyright for that. I even sent him a tarball of the whole thing so he
could publish it, but no. Sigh. -- DanConnolly

Much of the good stuff is in ''Ted Nelson's Computer Paradigm, Expressed as One-Liners'' http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/TN/WRITINGS/TCOMPARADIGM/tedCompOneLiners.html [BrokenLink 2005-06-07]
