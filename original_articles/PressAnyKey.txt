A common phrase used by computers to confuse their users.

Apart from it being general in a world that is usually very specific, the problem with it is that, often, any key will not do; Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys may not even send events to the port let alone be recognized as keystrokes.

Or the user may have the same response as HomerSimpson, "Where's the Any Key?"

I haven't seen "Press Any Key" for a while. Usually, when something happens that motivates the computer to pause in such a matter, it's in the form of a dialog box with a big OK button. -- NickBensema
