CategoryDebugging:

Novice programmers could use a good pattern cookbook for debugging software
applications.  Is this too general to warrant a PatternLanguage?
Debugging environments are very operating system  and language dependent,
but perhaps there are some general forces that can be 
dealt with.  

Perhaps some of the pattern titles would look like:

	* LocateDebuggingFacilities
	* InsertBreakPoints
	* LocateFailedProcedure
	* UseScaffoldingTechniques
	* IsolateAndTest
	* DecomposeToSimpleStatements
	* UseAssertions
	* RewriteWhenUnclear

Ah, maybe the problem domain is too large.
