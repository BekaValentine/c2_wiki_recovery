You have a beef. You read about this pattern thing and it sounds like a good chance to catharize your venom and make a permanent memorial to your sublime powers of observation.
 
Don't blog it, don't write a letter to the editor. Declare it a pattern, because if your complaint is in fact a pattern you've Discovered Something Important instead of being just another D''''''roneForTheMan.

Am I being ironic enough yet? I can't tell any more.
