Any suggestions on whether to use Wiki as a development tool?

What sort of developement tool? It's not much use as a compiler, or source code control.  It could serve as a project management or bug tracking system.  There are several pages that discuss that.  Or something other than software development, like commericial sales or community development?

This page's title doesn't enlighten as to the content.  Perhaps a better choice would be Wiki<name of tool>.

''It's not much use as ... source code control.''

Why not?  

What if the wiki were implemented on top of a version control software (like RCS), and didn't do the page formatting translations?

The build and tests could be managed from the server using something like CruiseControl that would build and run tests as soon as a change was made.

Emacs (and probably other editors) could be made to get source code from the wiki, and save it to the wiki.

Using wiki as a source-code control tool would be something like WebDAV already is.  Some SCM tools are already using WebDAV -- SubVersion being one that I know of.

''Why use a wiki for that instead of something like WebDav?''

Because I didn't know WebDav existed, or what SubVersion was.  Now that I know, I'm going to have a look at SubVersion.
