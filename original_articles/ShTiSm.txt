Short titles smell is in response to LongTitlesSmell.

Short pithy titles may be good for marketing but they aren't good for communicating information. See what you need to say to get your idea across.

''LongTitlesSmell isn't about marketing, it's about creating WikiPage''''''s with readable (as opposed to unreadable) titles. You seem to have confused being precise with being UgLy.''

[Not just readable, but also reusable.  The longer the title, the less likely you can use it naturally in a sentence. CaseInPoint: give us a sentence that naturally uses this page title. There is a HappyMedium, as with most things.]
