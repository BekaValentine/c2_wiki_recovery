'''Pascal-descendant languages''' and '''Pascal-like languages''' (PascalLanguage)

Pascal has numerous rather direct descendants:

* Concurrent Pascal (1975).
* Modula (ModulaOne a.k.a. ModulaLanguage a.k.a. CategoryModula): another of the WirthLanguages (1975).
* UCSD Pascal (UcsdPascal): U.C. San Diego (ca. 1977), then SofTech MicroSystems.
* Euclid (1978).
* Pascal* ("Pascal-star"): Stanford University (circa 1980).
* Modula 2 (ModulaTwo): yet another of the WirthLanguages (1982).
* Pascal Plus (1984).
* Modula 3 (ModulaThree)
* Oberon (OberonLanguage)

There is a separate category for ''Algol-descendant languages'' and ''Algol-like languages'' (CategoryAlgol), for programming languages whose relationship to Pascal is not documented or not convincing.
