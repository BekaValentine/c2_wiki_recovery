One of the changes to the JavaLanguage in Java 5 was ''static import'', which allows you to invoke static methods from classes without qualifying the method with the class name.  Example:

    import static org.junit.Assert.*;

    public class S''''''impleA''''''rithmeticT''''''est {
        @Test
        public void additionHadBetterWork() {
            assertEquals( 7, 3 + 4 );
        }
    }

assertEquals(), which lives on org.junit.Assert, has been statically imported.  Without the static import, the test class would have to qualify the invocation by saying Assert.assertEquals(...).
