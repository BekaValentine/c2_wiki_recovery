A wiki module for DotNetNuke.

http://www.dotnetwiki.org  -- The download (apparently from April 2004) is on this page: http://www.dotnetwiki.org/Default.aspx?tabid=52

''Anymore updates on this software? I have a friend who wants to integrate a wiki module into his DotNetNuke ContentManagementSystem -- SusanRoy''

As of January 13, 2005, http://www.dotnetwiki.org is a dead link.  Please share any ideas about where this project might be right now.

The developer says to "monitor http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/ for information", so development is perhaps stalled, but still active. -- DrewRobinson
