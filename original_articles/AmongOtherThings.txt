Spending some of my time in fixing some of the OldPages and checking for BrokenLink''''''s while reading a broad range of pages (20140724)

Dedicating an hour or two a day to this task, in the effort to FixOurWiki and to be involved in CrazyThingsThatMightSaveWiki. It is some "stuff" worth doing.

''It would be nice if you could try to track down some of those BrokenLink''''''s and replace them with good links, or remove the relevant bits if the link no longer works and the associated paragraph doesn't make sense without it.''

I agree, and this effort is the first step. In the second step, which may involve 8 to 10 thousand links, an orderly, systematic (via back-links on BrokenLink) research may lead to subsitution or replacement of about 25 percent or so (2000 to 2500) with current links, or discovered information.  
* As of 20140734 at 8:15 AM there are 521 entries.

I have added an auxiliary tag, "FixThis" as an option to hi-lite places where added and proximate effort may prove fruitful.
