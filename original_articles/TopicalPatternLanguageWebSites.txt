Wiki has proved a good place to socialize nascent patterns in the
early days of their formation, and in the days when the number of
total patterns was small.  Now, topical areas have started to grow
their own pattern sites.  Some are wiki clones;  others are just
fascinating places to visit.

Here are some web sites dedicated to broad topical areas, web sites
that combine the work of many individuals into common pattern languages
for their respective domains.  They may be good starting places if you're
looking for a pattern in one of these areas.
