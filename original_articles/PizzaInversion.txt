	 :	"''Pizza Inversion may sound like a cheesy name for a pattern, but it describes a recurring solution to a problem that is of fundamental significance to most software developers I know. I find myself using it much more frequently than anything in the now famous Design Patterns book[1]. Keep reading and I'm certain you'll soon find yourself agreeing with me.''"
