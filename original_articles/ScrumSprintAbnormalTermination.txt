The premature cancellation of a ScrumSprint, due to one of several causes:
* Certainty that the SprintGoal cannot be achieved.
* Fundamental and urgent external changes that invalidate the SprintGoal or the bulk of the functionality.
* Failure of the ScrumProcess implementation for reasons such as:
** fundamental team conflict
** inability to engage ProductOwner to get answers for the team

ScrumSprintAbnormalTermination is a rare act, not to be taken lightly.
