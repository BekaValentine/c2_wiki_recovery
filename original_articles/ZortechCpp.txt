Zortech C++  by WalterBright is an early, if not the first, CeePlusPlus compiler, as opposed to a translator to CeeLanguage. See the honourable mention of this in LanguagePissingMatch. It later was taken over by Symantec (see SymantecCpp) and still later became DigitalMars and as such is still evolving as a DOS, DOS32 and WIN32 C++ compiler.
