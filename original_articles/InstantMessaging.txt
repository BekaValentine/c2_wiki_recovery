'''Problem'''
How to get in touch with someone rapidly, and be assured that I have their attention?

'''Context'''
I have an address for the person I am trying to reach. I want to be sure that I have their attention (perhaps I will try someone else if they're not there). I might be trying to initiate a PrivateChat or PublicChat.

'''Forces'''
Perhaps the stuff that I'm putting under 'Context' belongs here?

'''Solution'''
Use Instant Messaging, whereby a message can be sent to appear instantly on the target person's screen.

'''Resulting Context'''
The recipient of the instant message will be interrupted immediately, if they are connected to the instant messaging service. If not, the message is typically lost. Sender knows very quickly if their message arrived, hence if the destination party is available. As with the EmailPattern, InstantMessaging tends not to bring others into the conversation, but to keep them out.

I moved my reply to http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?InstantMessaging. Ironically, I had written something there on ICQ the other day but I lost power. I guess I'll rewrite that too. -- SunirShah

One of the best aspects of workplace IM, for me, is that I can collaborate intensely with a colleague, and listen to screaming hardcore punk RockMusic at the same time, and they don't know. -- PhlIp ''Try Delius.''

They know now! Just think  - if 100% of your concentration was being applied to the "intense collaboration" you could be a participant in the solutions instead of just being a bystander. It brings to mind the commercial about telephones, a worried manager, three bystanders, 1 holding a Ghettoblaster and two doing gyrations, and a guy out on the front line doing what needs to be done. When the manager states the problem, the concentration shifts from the non-work related stuff to a phone which is used to check on the guy at work. When he confirms that the stuff needing to be done is in the process of being done, the three go back to Ghettoblaster holding and gyrations. (it appears to me that the company has three to many employees - possibly four if you include the worried manager who seems not to have a clue about what his people are doing.) The messaging is instant, but the load sharing seems out of balance.
I'm not knocking this situation because of the music and gyrations, but because of the lack of involvement. It seems to me to be the same if the worried boss and the three others were on a golf course and were using IM. It makes it possible for five to receive pay (with the one doing the work being the lowest paid and the first laid-off). :(  -- last edit by D''''''onaldNoyes Dec04

MicrosoftOutlook 2007 is said to include InstantMessaging capabilities. However this product will not be dropped from MicrosoftOffice Home or Student edition, in favor of an alternate called One Note. I am personally more attracted to linking to GettingThingsDone TimeManagement features in the new version. See http://blogs.msdn.com/melissamacbeth/archive/2006/07/19/671821.aspx for more.
