A skeptic just doesn't understand why C++ calls for specialized application of Xp. An example or two of real-world situations where Xp is ungainly in dealing with C++ would be a nice starting point.

OfCourse it does. C++ is ''different''. I haven't done XP yet but I have done C++ and I can feel it. I can feel the raw power, the almost limitless potential and the SharpEdges it is so famous for. I love it, but it requires different management (using third-party binary C++ libraries is a no-no for starters).
