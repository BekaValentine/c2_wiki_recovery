DonaldNoyes from JohnFletcher
* Hey, Donald, this looks amazing. I have just been looking at my own HomePage on the FederatedWiki pages. I can see that a different font size or page strategy (smaller) will be needed. How do I join in? I am very interested in effective communication tools
* reply:
** ''to get started, go to http://jfletcher.fed.wiki.org and follow the directions. Also view the videos Ward has prepared.''

DonaldNoyes from GunnarZarncke
* Hi, 
** from your edits I discovered this too and created http://zarncke.fed.wiki.org
** Seems I overlooked an old wiki mail from you: "From DonaldNoyes -> www.donaldr.noyes.com/c2/gunnar.htm" 
* reply
** It will be found in orginal form at
***  http://donaldr.noyes.com/c2/20120920GunnarZarncke.htm 

here in tabular form:
* ''Gunnar, ThinkingOutLoud is merely my way of recording first mind impressions''
** related to Wiki and organization of information mostly
* It is one facet of thinking were insights and mind flashes are recorded
** with the intent and sometimes the actuality of someone else contributing to what is thought about
** but only in the process of becoming something with a real handle on it
* I may be in the middle of something and have a wiki-related thought
** stop what I was doing and recording the thought, hopefully resonating with others who read WardsWiki
** Thanks for your mailbox item on my HomePage. I try always to respond!''
