Images Of Organization, ISBN 0761906347 
is a book by Gareth Morgan that presents different metaphors of organizations and discusses the differences in strengths and 
weaknesses in each metaphor. Organizations can be imagined as machines, as families, as brains, as military units, and many others.  In some respects, this is a PatternLanguage of organizations.  It is also a very well-written 
and thought-provoking book in organizational theory with many references for
further reading and thought. -- RachelSilber
