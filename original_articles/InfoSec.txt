Don thanks for your interest in this subject. I agree with you the term is commonly used and merit its own page. May I suggest you to link it to the main page of InformationSecurity at some stage.

Also currently a lot of information that supposedly belong to InformationSecurity (a broader subject) is actually located in SecurityManagement, which is extremely important but it does not represent all of InfoSec. I would love to see someone with initiatives to help improve security related pages, and maybe you are the one :) -- dl
