This page has been abandoned here for years, and I'm surprised to find it still alive. 
Always willing to do something here, but always trapped in other places.

Whereabouts update :

* Consultant (since 2000) at http://www.mondeca.com, working on KnowledgeRepresentations, SemanticWeb technologies and the like. Used to be involved in TopicMaps, but quite drifting off that technology now.
* Blogging (since 2004) at http://bvatant.blogspot.com on issues linked to identification of things and federation of data, musing on stuff like RealityHasNoCertainIdentity

Still trying to do something efficient towards SustainableKnowledge (have to clean this page of old stuff). Been editing on and off in both English and French WikiPedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Universimmedia

Currently involved in LinkingOpenData project
