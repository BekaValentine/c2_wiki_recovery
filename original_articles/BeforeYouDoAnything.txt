Before you do anything, ask yourself:

	1 Will it make the world a better place?
	1 Will it make me a better person?
	1 Will it make me richer?

If the answer to all three questions is no, then DON'T DO IT!

I would say if the answer to 
* the second of the three questions is yes
* or if the answer to at least two of the three questions is yes
then DO IT!

''What if the answer to only the first or only the third question is yes?''

Then you must decide WhatToDo. You will often have to deal with the rule ItDepends at a personal level. The default should be DoNt. 

Changing something in a stable situation can often be a BadThing. Particularly since it may be that YouArentGonnaNeedIt.

What if I ask these questions at every decision point? Like at Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner, or if I feel thirsty?
 ''Why not?''
