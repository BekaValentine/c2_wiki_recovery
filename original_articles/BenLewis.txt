I'm me... or am I?
I'm a student at CornellCollege (not to be confused with CornellUniversity), one of two colleges in the UnitedStatesOfAmerica to use the block plan. For info, go to http://www.cornellcollege.edu. Because this plan leaves me no free time, I'm GoodAtEverything and GreatAtNothing. I'm a Biology major and a ComputerScience minor, and I'm interested in BioInformatics as a possible career path. In the spare time I just told you was nonexistiant, I'm JustaProgrammer, a fan of TheMatrix, a student of KungFoo, and, in general, a GeekInTraining.

I'm about halfway through the new user documents, and I have two questions (this is a relative miracle): 

A) When viewing the RecentEdits and RecentChanges pages, some changes have names associated with them, while some have IP's. Naturally, my changes are represented by an IP, and I don't want them to be. Any suggestions?

''Try UserName.''

B) Can someone explain the different WikiModes? FaqMode and DialectMode (the easy ones) are clear to me, but DocumentMode and ThreadMode are apparently argued over more than they are defined for newbies.

''ThreadMode is essentially UseNet, and is not the preferred mode of interaction on Wiki; it often degenerates into ThreadMess. Many pages start out in ThreadMode and are eventually refactored into DocumentMode, which signals that a page has reached some sort of maturity. I.e., DocumentMode pages are to some extent static.''
