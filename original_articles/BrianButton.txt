Hi to anyone reading my page. For most of my professional career, I've been a traveling consultant, but I've recently accepted a position with AsynchronySolutions in St. Louis as VP of Engineering and Director of Agile Methods. This lets me stop traveling for the most part and focus on those things that I love doing, which are working with people, teaching them about the agile ways, coaching, mentoring, training, and generally making people happier in their workplace.

I've recently finished up work inside Microsofts PatternsAndPractices group, where I worked with people like WardCunningham, PeterProvost, ScottDensmore, BradWilson, and JimNewkirk. I had a great time there, learned a lot about .Net and C#, and contributed on two major project initiatives, EnterpriseLibrary and the WebServiceSoftwareFactory.

Previous to that, I was one of the roving consultants for ObjectMentor. Great job, great people, sorry to have left them.

I currently own and maintain a blog focused on agile development and .Net at http://oneagilecoder.asolutions.com .
