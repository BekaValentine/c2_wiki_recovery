The "Adventure Game Toolkit" (AGT) was adapted by David R. Malmberg from Mark J. Welch's "Generic Adventure Game System" (GAGS). AGT was written in Pascal, and is available in Classic, BIG, and Master's Editions (the last was written in Turbo Pascal and is available only for the DOS platform). The compiler and interpreter were released as freeware in 1993, and technical support was discontinued at that time.  

While not technically a programming ''language'', as is Inform (see InformLanguage), AGT can more accurately be described as an IF "implementation system", which allows individuals who have little or no experience programming in a "real" computer language, such as CeeLanguage, to write their own text adventures.  

You can download AGT from the Interactive Fiction Archive:

A comprehensive AGT Page is located at:

Pre-compiled AGT games can also be run with RobertMasenten's AGiliTy "Universal" runtime interpreter (see "AgiliTy" [sic]), which is presently available in DOS, Linux, Amiga, and UnixWare versions.  

A new "Universal" AGT source code compiler by Robert Masenten named "Magx" is also available in DOS and Linux versions (see MagxCompiler).


Both AGiliTy and Magx were written in ANSI C, and should be fairly easy to port to other platforms.  For details, please contact Mr. Masenten directly:
