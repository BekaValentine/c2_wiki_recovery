A project which began when one of the authors realised he was re-using a lot of code, so it would make better sense to create a library and distribute that.

From info:


	* The goal of the DynAPI Project is to develop an open source programming library for developing DHTML applications. This library is freely distributed under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License. 

	*The DynAPI is a spin-off of the Dynamic Duo DHTML Tutorial. As I progressed with the DynDuo, I eventually found myself building a core set of JavaScript files that were often needed when building DHTML applications. These files were almost always based around my Dynamic Layer Object (and where the DynAPI gets its name from). I extracted the most important JavaScript files out of the tutorial and have named it the DynAPI.

I stumbled across this a while ago. I haven't had much of a play yet - in fact I've just briefly glanced over it. Sounds like quite a good idea.

I'm wonder whether having such a library will encourage browsers to be more accurate in their implementations; since, if lots of people use this library it will become the 'de-facto' for browsers to be incompatible with at their peril. This is of course assuming that this is good code.

It would be a real shame, and a real opportunity missed if it isn't.
