	 :	Asces, provided by the German Software company Muenchhoff Janz GmbH, adds a new and fascinating wrinkle to buying books on the Internet. The concept is simple. Users can search for the book of interest to them by title, author, keyword or International Standard Book Number (ISBN). Once the book is located, click on it. Fill in a form with your geographic location and how you would like prices displayed (seven currencies are available at present). Then an Asces robot checks retail online bookstores (27 at present--under "retailers") and returns a list of prices from lowest to highest taking into account shipping rates, discounts, and how long it will take the book to arrive. An advanced search (ISBN only) allows comparisons of up to ten books at once.
