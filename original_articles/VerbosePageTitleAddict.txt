I notice a pattern when people create pages on this wiki.

Some people prefer to keep pages concise, short, and to the point. Others seem to be addicted to VeryLongOverlyNicePageTitles. 

'''For Example''' 

Consider the humorous notes in AhSimple and compare AhSimple to a long page that is supposed to be simple such as DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.

'''Verbosity to Hide BadWord''''''s'''''''''

Some try to avoid the NotNiceEnough pattern by adding verbosity to their page titles - replacing words such as ''damage'' with equally rude but more verbose phrases such as ''SomethingThatIsReallyPoor'' or ''VeryBerryBad'' or ''NotGoodNotGoodNotGreat''. 

Consider people renaming funny precise pages like BrainDamage (a well known pattern and coined term) to longer and not really nicer (but claimed nicer) pages which don't even act as direct replacements such as ToolsThatTeachPoorHabits (that's another page all together, specific to Tools). A VerbosePageTitleAddict might take it one step further and change it to ToolsThatMayOrMayNotDependingOnTheSituationCausePoorOrEvenGoodHabits.

Even the words ''verbose'',  ''bad'', ''addict'', or ''poor'' can be considered ''inflammatory'' - so a VerbosePageTitleAddict is in fact a hypocrite who usually uses inflammatory words in new pages that replace old elegant pages. A VerbosePageTitleAddict may hijack a page, delete it, and create a new title with long words (with some bad words thrown here and there) in place of the old terse page title. The verbosity acts like icing or ''with a cherry on top'', to hide the so called ''inflammatory'' old concise and precise elegant page title. 

But does prettying up this wiki with verbosity really solve a problem, and does ''reacting'' and creating verbose title flames actually ''cause'' more problems than the original terse page did? I.e is the one who is claiming a page is inflammatory actually being hypocritcally inflammatory themselves by creating verbose pages which will cause more flames? Should VerbosePageTitleAddict''''''s'''''' first check in with their own sense of humor before jumping to conclusions and assuming that a precise and concise page is meant to be inflammatory toward them specifically? 

How are we to have pages such as CodeSmell when a VerbosePageTitleAddict will just come in and claim that the page needs to be changed since the word ''smell'' is inflammatory and that the title should be more correctly CodeThatOffersCertainBadOrNiceOdors.

How are we to have pages such as UgLy when a VerbosePageTitleAddict will just storm in and declare that the UgLy page is far too terse and inflammatory? 

''I suggest SomethingThatIsNotAsNiceLooking instead of UgLy''

How are we to have pages such as GetOverIt when a VerbosePageTitleAddict will just storm in and declare:

''I suggest ItWouldBeNiceIfYouCouldPleaseGetOverTopOfIt instead of GetOverIt. The title '''GetOverIt''' is too inflammatory''

'''Theories'''

One theory is that a VerbosePageTitleAddict is trying to gain BrowniePoints by appearing to do something useful on this wiki (a fake WikiGnome possibly), when in fact VerbosePageTitleAddict''''''s'''''' are generally more destructive to a wiki than constructive - they stir up more trouble than existed in the first place.

Suggestions for VerbosePageTitleAddict
* Precision and concision is good. GetOverIt.
* Don't react and FlameRename pages by claiming that they are flames - your verbose flame may be an even worse flame. 
* Get a sense of humor. Terse page titles such as UgLy, BrainDamage, GetOverIt, CodeSmell, etc. are very humorous and well known patterns.

''I suggest ForSomeoneWhoMayBeUsedToUsingMoreVerboseTitles as a title for this page. The current VerbosePageTitleAddict is too inflammatory.''
