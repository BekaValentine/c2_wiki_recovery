I'm running AcadWiki and I'm a very old visitor and admirerer of the PPR (PortlandPatternRepository). 

I quoted RulesToLiveBy in the AutoLISP FAQ. See AutoLisp.

I'm one of the MostProgrammersDontGrokObjects, but because I see not advantage in adding complexity of an ''extreme'' OO-Design, when simple functional programming with generic methods (focusing on methods not objects!) is much easier to write and better to understand. But I do Lisp, so I'm from another world.
