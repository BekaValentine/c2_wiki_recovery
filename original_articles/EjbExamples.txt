/**
 * Demo -- this is the "remote" interface of our Enterprise Java Bean, it 
 *         defines only one simple method called demoSelect() which as this is 
 *         a stateless simplistic bean example it just returns a string, no 
 *         database lookup is even done.
 *
 *  Note: The implementation of this interface is provided by the container tools
 *        but the demoSelect() method and any other methods in this interface
 *        will need to have equivalent implementations in the Demo''''''Bean.java
 *        implementation which is supplied by the bean Writer ..i.e. you!
