A Microsoft project supporting animation, graphics, interaction, and sound. Offers some relatively advanced features, and has some nice properties - for example, text in MicrosoftSilverlight can be indexed. 

One feature of MicrosoftSilverlight: it offers alternatives to JavaScript for manipulating DocumentObjectModel. Both DLR and CLR languages are supported as of Silverlight 2.0. IronRuby, IronPython, JScript (Microsoft's JavaScript), and CeeSharp are named explicitly.

A related project, Mono's Moonlight, re-implements MicrosoftSilverlight with some token support from Microsoft, but faces distribution challenges: anyone may download it from Novell, but only Novell may package Moonlight with a Linux distribution.
