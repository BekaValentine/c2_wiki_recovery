What StarTrek has too much of these days.

From a RedDwarf episode:

 CAT:    Hey, what's the problem, man? There's one of him, and four of us, right?
 KRYTEN: But you would not profit by it. You would gamble your safety for a 
         mere android? Is this the human value you call "friendship?"
 LISTER: Don't give me the Star Trek crap. It's too early in the morning.
