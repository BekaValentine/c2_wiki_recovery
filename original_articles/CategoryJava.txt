Regarding: "Click the title to get a list of all pages in this category." and "...search for pages with "Java" in their title or body..."

''Doesn't that violate OnceAndOnlyOnce? If Java pages can already be found by Find, why have an unreliable, inconsistently-updated list of the same information done that way? Logical refactoring solutions would be:''
* ''provide support for union of searched pages and BackLink searches so that CategoryJava could search for both backlinks (for pages that discuss JavaLanguage but do not include it in the name)''
''or''
* ''create a bot that adds the CategoryJava note to the bottom of pages, rather than asking that it be done manually - ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate''
**[Well, get on it then and create that bot FixYourWiki...]
