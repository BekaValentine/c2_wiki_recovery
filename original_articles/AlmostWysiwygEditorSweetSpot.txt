Wiki contains an "almost" WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouGet editor.

MicrosoftWord is closer to a WYSIWYG editor.

As you go from non-WYSIWYG to WYSIWYG editor, you make trade-offs. The trade-offs are not linear. In other words, some points along the gradient are a lot better than others.

 [non - WYSIWYG editor]
 easy to code, hard to use
 \/
 [almost - WYSIWYG editor]
 ok to code, ok to use
 \/
 [WYSIWYG editor]
 hard to code, easy to use
----

It's even more complex than that, as some tasks are easier on an almost WYSIWYG editor than on a fully WYSIWYG editor. See WhyWhatYouSeeIsWhatYouGetWorksNot.

''And some tasks are easiest (and/or have superior output) when there is no WYSIWYG involved at all.''
