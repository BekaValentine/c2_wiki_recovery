A ComputerProgram that acts as a definite entity towards the ComputerUser. The user is aware of its existence, and starts the ApplicationProgram to do some work with it. This as opposed to DeviceDriver''s'', of which the user is mostly only aware when he installs them. After that, then tend to forget about their DeviceDriver''s''.

Some would argue that the concept of "application program"  has caused untold grief. (See EnterpriseApplicationProblems and DoItFramework.)

Contrast with DirectManipulation and NakedObjects.

See NoApplication.
