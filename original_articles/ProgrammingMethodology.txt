There are many forms of programming methodology. The purpose of making explicit awareness of programming methodology is so that program writers can be aware of the processes and procedures which they use when constructing programs.

Some program writers will be writing large software systems, working in teams, and may have to conform to standard practices within their teams, or across teams. Others may be writing small programs for themselves. The general idea of being aware of a programming methodology is to effect some improvement in the process, which might manifest itself as one of 

* better quality in the finished product

* quicker production of the final product

* better acceptance of the specification

etc.

Traditional methods of programming were often based on the WaterfallModel, but during the last decade many programmers have adopted RapidPrototyping. Other methods are to adopt ProgramReuse methods, such as modifying existing large programs, or to use ComponentBasedProgramming.

In recent years that has been growing interest in replacing full-lifecycle methodologies with AgileProcesses.  These processes typically aim to reduce the amount of non-programming related overhead while allowing increased accuracy in estimation and improved efficiency of code.  This has gone hand-in-hand with a shift away (for many types of systems) from BigDesignUpFront. --SeanMcNamara
