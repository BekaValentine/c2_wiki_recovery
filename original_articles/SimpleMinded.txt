 Simplicity and Clarity
  are usually related, since
   thinking and
   relationships that endure
  are usually based
   on simply understood and
   accepted building blocks.
 For this reason,
  people prefer order to chaos, and
 Since chaos usually exceeds order,
  we have much to learn.
-- Donald Noyes

If you build a system on simplicity, it will find its own way, regardless of the existence or degree of order and/or chaos.
