IDebug is an advanced debugging framework for Java. This framework provides the standard core debugging and specification constructs such as assertions, debug levels and categories, stack traces, and specialized exceptions. Debugging functionality can be fine-tuned to a per-thread and/or a per-class basis, debugging contexts can be stored and recovered from persistent store, and several aspects of the debugging run-time are configurable at the meta-level. The framework is designed for extensibility.
