I am interested in a softwares position that embraces my skill as a problem
solver and encourages group work, egalitarian coordination, close customer 
contact, and many values of Extreme Programming. 

I will also consult on the implementation of XP, collaborative methods and 
automated methods.

'''Experience'''
June 2000 - August 2002. '''Developer.''' ThoughtWorks, Inc., Chicago, IL
I was a founding member of the Collaborative Development Group. 

My consulting clients included BP Integrated Supply & Trading in London; 
Dana Commercial Credit; the financial markets industries; Input/Output, a 
manufacturer of oil exploration systems; a web portal company; and 
Seismiq, a leasing ASP.

I have been involved in the successful implementation of Extreme 
Programming in several environments. My experience during this time 
included Java: JSP, Servlets, ODBC, SQLj; C++: Cross-platform development 
using GNU Autotools and GCC simultaneously with Microsoft Visual Studio.

I am most proud of the work we did on the QuickFIX FIX engine 
(quickfix.thoughtworks.com). I also was instrumental in applying practical 
methods derived from XP to save a data conversion project that had poor 
software, waning morale, tense client relationships, and a dismal outlook.

I have experience in providing leadership after gaining respect for my 
pragmatic approaches and problem solving skills.
