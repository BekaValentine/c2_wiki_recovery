LeCorbusier's greatest creation - a chair that actually fits humans perfectly. I've owned one of these for 5 years, and would never voluntarily sit on anything else. No, you don't become sleepy. You become happy. 

Of course it wasn't until I got a new iMac that I had a computer to fit it. Trackball goes on the floor, keyboard in your lap, and the screen hovers in front of you. Complete disembodiment. -- PeterMerel

What's the cheapest anyone's been able to find this marvel for online?

http://www.steelform.com do them for under a thousand bucks. They also do a range of other "modern" furniture: Reitveld's red and blue chair, Eames lounger, Barcelona chair, etc.

Those with a smaller budget might consider the IkeaPoang.
