I am a long-time computer geek to such an absurd extreme that I went to graduate school primarily because I loved to play computer games on my TRS-80 (aka TrashEighty).

Years later, I have a Ph.D. in computer science, wrote a bunch of RealTime computer graphics, but have yet to find gainful employment playing games.
