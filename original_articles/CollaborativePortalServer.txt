CollaborativePortalServer (CPS) is an application built on the ZopeApplicationServer and PythonLanguage. They describe it as EnterpriseContentManagement which seems to be another name for ContentManagementSystem.  '''http://www.cps-project.org/'''

The interesting thing is that they explain there that they have changed to use JavaLanguage for a new release of their product. - see http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/about/java-switch/

The old CPS contains a module called CPSRelation which permits the use of data in the ResourceDescriptionFramework  (RDF) - see http://www.zope.org/Members/nuxeo/news/rdf-relations-in-cps

This is the only application I have found so far which uses Zope and allows access to the RedlandRdfLibraries for RDF. -- JohnFletcher
