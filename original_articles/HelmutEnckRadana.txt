Hi Helmut, nice to see another Erlang hacker around. What're you doing with it? -- LukeGorrie

I'm using Mnesia (MnesiaDatabase) and XMerl to write a content management system for technical documentation. I started to do XML processing with Refal (RefalLanguage). XML processing in functional languages with pattern matching is much more natural than manipulating a DOM in the traditional OO way. When I needed a database, I searched for a language which is as similar as possible to Refal, but for which a well-integrated database binding is available. Of all languages I came to know of, Erlang was the one which met these criteria best. Only the pattern matching capabilities of Refal go far beyond those of Erlang. -- her

Incorrect:
	 :	I'd be grateful, if anyone could correct any contributions I made and put some comments what was wrong with the original version onto this page.
Correct:
	 :	I'd be grateful, if anyone could correct any contributions I have made and put some comments what was wrong with the original version onto this page.

Explanation:
	 :	Most of this sentence is in a possible future tense.  (English teachers have a phrase that means "possible future tense".)
		* "I would be grateful"
		* "if anyone could correct"
		* "if anyone could put"

	 :	English authors try to make each paragraph have a single tense.  (They don't always succeed.)

	 :	In the 'incorrect' version of the sentence, you have a past tense clause that is acting as an adjective:  "I made" describes "contributions".  This tense can be changed to better match the rest of the sentence.  The 'correct' version of the sentence has "I have made" instead of "I made". 

	 :	Some people prefer not to make this change.

	 :	Modern English authors try to use shorter sentences.  Shorter sentences have fewer verbs, so it is easier to make all of the verbs in each sentence have the same tense.

Also, most English style-guides say that if a quotation is at the end of a sentence, the period should go inside of the quotation, "whether it is logical or not."

I prefer to put the period "where it is logical".  -- JasperPaulsen

''Thanks a lot for your explanations! -- her''

----

I also prefer to put the period "where is is logical".

And to add my two cents to the corrections:

	 :	I'd be grateful, if anyone could correct any contributions I have made and put some comments '''about''' what was wrong with the original version onto this page.

You're going to wish you never started this Helmut :-)
