"The '''Transformation Priority Premise''' (TPP) is a programming approach developed by RobertCecilMartin (UncleBob) as a refinement to make the process of test-driven development (TDD) easier and more effective for a computer programmer."

'''The Transformations:'''
	1. ({}â€“>nil) no code at all->code that employs nil
	1. (nil->constant)
	1. (constant->constant+) a simple constant to a more complex constant
	1. (constant->scalar) replacing a constant with a variable or an argument
	1. (statement->statements) adding more unconditional statements.
	1. (unconditional->if) splitting the execution path
	1. (scalar->array)
	1. (array->container)
	1. (statement->recursion)
	1. (if->while)
	1. (expression->function) replacing an expression with a function or algorithm
	1. (variable->assignment) replacing the value of a variable.
Uncle Bob also explicitly stated: "There are likely others".
