On coding standards:							  
										
	1. Let them evolve during the first few iterations.				
	1. Let them be team specific instead of company specific.			
	1. Don't write them down if you can avoid it.  Rather, let the code be the way the standards are captured.				
	1. Don't legislate good design.  (e.g. don't tell people not to use goto)								
	1. Make sure everyone knows that the standard is about communication, and nothing else.							  
	1. After the first few iterations, get the team together to decide.
