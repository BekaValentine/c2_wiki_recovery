Here is a theory of knowledge presented in the form of a pattern. It would be neat to explore the synergies of patterns as a knowledge representation and a process to capture knowledge. Any takers?

This website uses the words "pattern" and "theory", but presents no patterns in the Alexandrian sense - that of tried-and-true solutions to common problems within well-defined contexts - nor theories with any falsifiability. The content rambles in a liberal-arts kind of way, resembling Pirsig a little, and with a somewhat anti-scientific bent:

''"We determine rightness very rapidly. We do not initially rely on tests or on careful consideration - but on intuition, on a sense of beauty, on aesthetic qualities."''

Perhaps, but "rightness" usually comes from harmony with requirements, from DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork, if the XP'ers will forgive me. "Rightness" often appears anti-intuitive at first, which is why we need to remember YouArentGonnaNeedIt. "Rightness" seldom just hits you in the eye as this website suggests, but comes from a process of iteration and testing via the ScientificMethod. Much "wrongness" is initially beautiful - it just doesn't endure in the face of empirical test and practical experience. --PeterMerel
