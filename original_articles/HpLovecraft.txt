PulpFiction (horror) writer of the nineteen-twenties, his most famous stories revolve around a pantheon of ElderGods the most prominent of which is GreatCthulhu.

"The most merciful thing in the world is the inability of the human mind
to correlate all its contents." - H.P. Lovecraft in the short story "The Call of Cthulhu"

Also good in that genre are short stories by RobertBloch who once remarked, "actually, I have the heart of a small boy -- I keep it on my desk in a jar".

''I seem to recall that this quote was co-opted at one point by Stephen King - can anyone confirm this?''

He is really frightening altough ''nothing'' frightening happens. When I was ten or so I started reading a book of him, and after 20 pages I could only continue reading in the room where my mother was, and I was really high on adrenaline. He's really playing concerto grande with the human mind. -- ManuelSimoni

Had this habit of saving the kicker of the story until the very last sentence, and italicizing it. Although I enjoyed reading HpLovecraft, I always found this habit a little annoying; I would get to the last page and ''my eyes would jump to the last sentence, thereby revealing the eldritch horror prematurely!''


''Eldritch horror?! Aaaack!''
