The LowLevelVirtualMachine (LLVM) at http://llvm.org/ is a wide ranging project which includes low level tools to build better compilers for a range of languages. It includes Clang (CeeLanguageFamilyFrontEnd - http://clang.llvm.org/) which is a front end for a compiler of CeeLanguage, ObjectiveCee and CeePlusPlus.

There are built binaries for a number of systems. For others the source code is available and LLVM and Clang can be compiled. It is advisable not to have old versions in the installation path as this can cause problems. -- JohnFletcher

* I have spent a lot of time trying to build the LLDB debugger for the LLVM project using the SVN sources for 3.5.
* No binary is available.
* It did not build from its sources with '''gcc''' 4.6 because there had been a change in the standard for a <map> operation which had put an extra operation in.
** As far as I have found there is one use of this in one file.
** This is not supported by the libraries for gcc 4.6, so I need to change to a new library.
* I have a version of libc++ which I cannot use that because although I have been using it, I chose the wrong option ('''libcxxrt''') for the run time interface and the compiling of LLDB will not link without '''libc++abi'''.
* I am a user not a developer, so it takes a while for me to figure out that the code does not compile as I have the wrong version of the interface header, where both options provide a file of the same name.
* When I have sorted all that out the code cannot find the libraries.
* Each time I change the configuration it rebuilds the entire build. All I wanted to do was to add the debugger.
* I have now recompiled the whole thing several times.
* I very much like the clang compiler (CeeLanguageFamilyFrontEnd) as it gives me really helpful error messages for my CeePlusPlus code.
* It is now failing to build '''liblldb.so''' because it cannot find some things in '''lldb_private'''.
* I have now done some more work and rebuilt the '''libc++''' component with '''libc++abi''' in a consistent way.
* I still have the same problem when I try to build the debugger '''LLDB'''.
* I have found this reference which indicates to me that it is still attempting to use more than one standard library, as I see some '''std::__1''' in my error messages.
