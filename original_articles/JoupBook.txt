''The first half of the book focuses on the software process and how UML, Java technology, and object-oriented programming can be used effectively. The advantages of each technology are enumerated, highlighting common principles. Also included are in-depth discussions of design patterns, the Unified Process, and Extreme Programming.'' 

''The second half of the book describes how these complementary technologies can be used together as a system of checks and balances to ensure successful creation of high-quality software. You'll also find details on modeling strategies, a phased approach to adopting each of the technologies outlined, and the design of subsystems.''

Discusses RationalUnifiedProcess and ExtremeProgramming, and argues that the latter is a minimal case of the former (which claim I've seen somewhere here in c2, but where? - AnswerMe -- TomRossen).

''How about in ExtremeUnifiedProcess, Tom?''
