[a WikiStory]

Once upon a time there was a Wiki.

At first, it was was nothing more than the common meeting-ground for a bunch of like-minded web-addicts. It grew words and memes and fights and winners and losers. It brought together thinkers from different countries, different ways of life, different social circles.

Over the years, the Wiki was even responsible for the occasional love match. Skinny Sally Jones was too shy to ever have a date, until she got to know the mad professor at OrganicFoodConsideredHarmful.

And that was the most exciting thing to ever happen on the Wiki. Until the day the Kowmungers discovered it.
