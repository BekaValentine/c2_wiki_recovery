a.k.a.- asUnit, AppleScriptUnit

AsUnitForAppleScript is a TestingFramework developed for use with the AppleScript language. It is based primarily on JavaUnit and to some extent, SmalltalkUnit.

I let my .Mac subscription expire last year and have uploaded asUnit to a new location. 

It can now be downloaded here - http://www3.sympatico.ca/a.adachi/downloads/asUnit.img.sit.bin

It is currently being beta tested and feedback is welcome.
