Funny. But true. BorlandCorp, in a move to focus on ApplicationLifetimeManagement products and services, was looking for a party interested in it's developer tools: Delphi, JBuilder, InterBase, etc.
Apparently no candidate was agreed on and a new company within the Borland group is created to govern the effort into developer tools.
