UbikWiki (pronounced as close to "Ubiquity" as can be managed) is a new breed of WikiEngine, featuring:

	* TeX-like formatting syntax
	* Valid HTML 4.0 Transitional pages
	* Pseudonyms (one page with multiple names)
	* Extensible link syntax
	* Transclusions
	* Namespaces (well, something very similar)
	* Trails

The thing that Ubik is trying to showcase is not any of these (directly), it's a more fundamental design change called SetFacetWiki - a (fairly distant) variant of the scheme proposed in WikiMultipleDefinitions. SetFacetWiki is an alternative to SubPages and SectionedPage''''''s, and provides a nice foundation for most of the features listed above

UbikWiki is no longer up and has been deprecated by its owner ChrisPurcell (See Page on SisterSite)
