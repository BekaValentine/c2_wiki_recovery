MikeKrajnak has been been a RecentChanges addict for many months now, 
whenever there is breathing room on his current project.

I have recently been abusing my authority as Lead Architect on my current
project to introduce ExtremeProgramming practices (by stealth and gentle
persuasion) and other EnlightenedMethodologies.  The regulatory environment
that we work in sometimes makes this difficult.  We are having
a lot of success with CppUnit and JavaUnit and are just starting to see other
teams in our company pick it up as a "best practice".

I'm IntpType which is the only excuse I have for lurking so long before
I signed in.
