Now know as JakartaCactus (http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/).

J2EEUnit (a.k.a JtwoeeUnit for Wiki) is a server-side unit testing framework that extends JUnit (a.k.a JavaUnit for Wiki). Whereas JUnit focuses on testing client-side java code, J2EEUnit focuses on testing server-side java code (JSPs, Servlets, Taglibs, EJBs, ...).

J2EEUnit's user homepage is http://j2eeunit.sourceforge.net. J2EEUnit is hosted on SourceForge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/j2eeunit/.

This framework is not a functional test framework which views your server classes as a black box and only tests the returned results from externally calling your application (see HttpUnit for this). Both frameworks are complementary.

J2EEUnit provides JakartaAnt scripts to automate unit testing off server-side code. There are scripts for the following servlet engines : Tomcat, Resin, WebLogic and Orion.
