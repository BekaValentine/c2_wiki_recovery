'''MicrosoftUnix is a page on information sharing of ''Unix experience under the Influence'' :) '''

Here are some choices for WindowsXp (pro version) or WindowsTwoThousand:

	1. MicrosoftServicesForUnix (SFU) (No cost, but proprietary)
	1. CygWin (OpenSource)
	1. UWIN (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/) (OpenSource)
	1. The MKS Toolkit (http://www.datafocus.com/) ($$$, Proprietary)

There are of course other ways, using the likes of MsVirtualPc or VmWare. Or set up a multiboot system. I do not know of any good reason why this costly (at least in time) step is necessary.

Note it was reported MicrosoftServicesForUnix can be installed side-by-side with CygWin. But do you really want it done that way?

'''Reasons for using CygWin over MicrosoftServicesForUnix'''

* Non supported OS such as WindowsNinetyEight
* Concern about future Microsoft changes (or lack of) that would make this product not useful?
* CygWin provides better compatibility with Linux (GNU, really) systems, being based on the same source. Any real product examples?
* Need for tools more available on CygWin (e.g. X server, Vim instead of Vi)
* More ready made ports to CygWin

'''Reasons for using MicrosoftServicesForUnix over CygWin '''

* better interoperability with Microsoft solutions (NFS, NIS)
* better performance (e.g. support for Posix threading, server clusters)
