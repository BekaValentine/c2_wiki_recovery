Hello,

Most people call me Alex.

I am an employee of IBM in the AIM Services group. I work on the architecture and development of large scale systems based on Websphere technology.

I was introduced to Wiki's from WayneBeaton and found KyleBrown in the process. This is an interesting use of technology.

Up until Feb 2001, I have worked as an independent contractor (since 1986). My work has taken me around the world but you can read about that at http://www.alexandre.polozoff.com/ if you care to. I still have AspexInc because I run a couple of WAP sites (see OfficeServant and FootballServant).

I got my introduction to ObjectOrientedProgramming on a Digitalk/V PM project in 1989 at IBM Austin. To the uninitiated that is Smalltalk on OS/2. I loved Smalltalk and what became known as ExtremeProgramming (it was inevitable someone was going to label it, with, fortunately, NotAnotherAcronym). We even prototyped os-level hyperlink capabilities into OS/2 years before the http protocol came into existence. But the world wanted CeeLanguage and CeePlusPlus...

I then floated around primarily in network management and TelecommunicationsManagementNetwork. I got to do some interesting stuff here. And when the JavaLanguage started up it was neat to see the same set of code run on different platforms.  

I'll try and update this with more stuff... my testing below.
