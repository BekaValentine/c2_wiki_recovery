I am a creative writer, a Senior Manager at a computer company, and a casual programmer who spends a lot of time with the BYOND game development system (http://www.byond.com) making games.

For a couple of years I have been thinking about how to set up a collaborative environment for authoring patterns about creating web sites.  I came across the website of RobertOrenstein, who did a bit of work on web patterns a couple of years ago.  I emailed him, he pointed me to Wiki, and I am now creating PatternLanguageForTheWeb to see what happens.
