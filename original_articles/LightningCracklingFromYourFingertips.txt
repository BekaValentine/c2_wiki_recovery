I've had this feeling a few times. It's an extraordinary feeling. But, afterwards, I always feel a little bit guilty. To me, it's sorta like playing nine ball. When I call and make that double-bank-into-a-combo shot, I feel like '''strutting'''.

For people who like the pool metaphor, I highly recommend ''Playing off the Rail'' [ISBN 0679423745]. A fun look at a year in the life of a professional pool hustler (which is, thank you, ''nothing'' like the life of a professional software developer).
