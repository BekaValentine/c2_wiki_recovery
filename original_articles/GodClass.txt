''One Class to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them.''

The "God Class" problem is described on page 32 of Arthur Riel's excellent "ObjectOrientedDesignHeuristics". A "God Class" is an object that controls way too many other objects in the system and has grown beyond all logic to become The Class That Does Everything.

It is a form of the MediatorPattern, misapplied.
