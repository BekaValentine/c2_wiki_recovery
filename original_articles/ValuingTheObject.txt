'''''How we value objects''''' ''ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.200903071922.m05''

Principle: "ToDescribeIsPerhapsToValue"

Valuation of objects occurs in programming in more than one way:
* At the human or social level, we can value objects by regarding them as
** ImportantPertinentUseful or
** UnimportantIrrelevantUseless
* At the level of programmatic use, we can value objects by
** Defining Characteristics and Properties (Describing)
** Allowing Processes to CreateAssignModifyDelete Values held by the Objects

In programming, whatever the language, both of these valuations occur.
