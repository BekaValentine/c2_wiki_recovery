A community dedicated to bringing free wireless internet access to the Kansas City region. If you're interested in accessing a node, setting one up, or just curious about what's going on, we're here to help any way we can.
 
We're using 802.11b "WiFi?" network hardware, which operates in the 2.4GHz range. Most nodes have antennas offering coverage for a few blocks around a home or business, but with directional antennas and good line-of-sight, 802.11b can transmit many miles. 

None of our nodes are directly connected to one another now, but that's likely as the network grows. 

Our most recent meeting was on May 19th. The next meeting isn't scheduled yet.
