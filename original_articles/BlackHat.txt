When used in the context of being one of the SixThinkingHats, the BlackHat represents the down side, negative consequences, the worst things that could happen.

Or just used as a temporary name (local constant) to help distinguish between multiple semi-anonymous authors.

----
The term is more often used to describe villains, including computer crackers.  Often the term is used to refer to a hacker/cracker who seeks to a) commit espionage (discover confidential information), b) commit fraud , or c) engage in vandalism (or worse).

This negative usage has nothing to do with SixThinkingHats.

This has nothing to do with the SortingHat. -- EricJablow  ''(Does the term SortingHat have any meaning in comp sci, or is it just a reference to the HarryPotter novels???)''
