Stimulant.

Inhibitor of cell-cycle G2 arrest checkpoint.

What is "cell-cycle G2 arrest point"? Also, is everyone buying FairTrade coffee these days? I hope so. --C.P.

''The G2 arrest checkpoint is part of the cell cycle after DNA replication but before cell division. Before dividing, the cell is supposed to wait until the genome has finished replicating, and also repair errors that were introduced during replication. If these checks are suppressed and the cell divides with an incomplete or mutated genome, BadThing''''''s can happen.''

   Grown on mountainsides so high,
   Packed in bags on racks to dry,
   Flown from countries far away,
   Coffee, take our sins away.

The coffee of our love, we can no longer espresso. All we have left are the grounds for divorce.

Coffee is my only friend. That's sad.

''You know, some of us get our fix from non-coffee sorts.  Tea is popular.  I favor MountainDew.  There are always the gum, CaffeinatedWater, and pills.''

''...not to mention PenguinMints.''

Too bad you can't get caffeinated MountainDew in Canada :(
