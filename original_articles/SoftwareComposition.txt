''From a mailing by OscarNierstrasz...''

''Object-Oriented Software Composition'' is a new book [1] about
object-oriented technology and its application to the development of
flexible, composable systems. The book is edited by OscarNierstrasz
and DennisTsichritzis, and is published by PrenticeHall.

''Object-Oriented Software Composition'' adopts the viewpoint that
object-oriented technology is essentially about composing flexible
software applications from software components. Although object-oriented
languages, tools and methods have come a long way since the birth of
object-oriented programming, the technology is not yet mature. This
book presents the results of a series of research projects related to
object-oriented software composition that were carried out within the
Object Systems Group at the University of Geneva, or by partners in
collaborative research projects, during a period of about ten years. As
such, this book is an attempt to synthesize and juxtapose ideas that
were developed by a group of people working closely together over
several years.

This book should appeal to researchers and practitioners familiar with
object-oriented technology, who are interested in research trends
related to software composition.
