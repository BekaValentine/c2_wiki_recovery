In LispLanguage, the term dynamic means, essentially, "set up and torn down along with stack frames", at least when the discussion is about the immediate execution environment of a thread; of course there are other uses of the term dynamic. Of course the term has other meanings, like in DynamicTyping or DynamicLanguage.

Objects that disappear when scopes terminate have DynamicExtent, and there is a way to declare to the compiler that something may have such an extent.  The term DynamicContext refers to the contents of the entire activation chain of the thread under consideration, as a whole. Things that are in the DynamicContext are for instance catch handlers, restarts, error handlers, unwind protects, and bindings of SpecialVariable''''''s.
