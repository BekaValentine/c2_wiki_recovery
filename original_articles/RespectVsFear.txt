''Respect'', properly defined, is admiration given to another due to his/her accomplishments in some worthwhile endeavor (whether it be programming, humanitarianism, sports, music, whatever).  Respect in one endeavor may not imply respect as a whole--there are many professional athletes, for instance, that I respect for their on-the-field prowess, but I would ''not'' want to have as neighbors.

This definition of respect specifically excludes ''fealty''--admiration (or outward admiration, even if one's personal opinion is different) given to another due to his position of power, authority, or influence.  Note that true respect is almost always genuine; whereas fealty may be false.


'''Fealty is a duty to another from a power relationship - it does not have anything to do with ones feelings toward the other person - you owe them duty.'''

''Fear'' is self-explanatory.

Many people in positions of power confuse the two.  The schoolyard bully believes that the other kids ''respect'' him because he can beat them up; when in reality they ''fear'' him (and cannot stand him).  Sadly, much of pop culture confuses respect for fear.

I don't think the above is correct. You can certainly respect an enemy without either admiring or despising them. Respect means you take someone ''seriously''.

No, taking someone "seriously" simply means you apply weighted thought to their words and actions. Again, that is not respect. Respect is frequently misused as it is defined. Pop culture 
often confuses this term. You can take someone seriously at varying times and at times, you may not take them seriously. That is not true respect. Respect is consistent. it does not come and go. Of course if can go - ie I lost respect for you. But in its true definition it does not come and go, otherwise it really is not respect, its simply having an understanding of the person.
