An early 1980's sitcom dealing with the plight of a space alien (MorkFromOrk) who lands in Boulder, CO in order to study mankind.

The show starred RobinWilliamsTheActor as MorkFromOrk and PamDawber as Mindy.  Mork was an alien sent to earth from the planet Ork in order to study mankind and report back to Orson, his FearlessLeader.  Each show would end with a dialogue between Mork and Orson in which they whacked the moral of the episode against the viewer's head repeatedly.

The episode in which Mork's jumpsuit - actually a creature made of billions of tiny living cells - almost jumped Mindy has been revisited here: RatAndTuyen.

Got RobinWilliamsTheActor started, but really it's just a show about shacking up.

''Is this a joke? I probably watched the show twice, but I never saw any references. I thought that a late 1970s show about shacking up would whack you repeatedly against the head about it. --PhlIp''

A late 80's show yes, but you still had to talk around things a decade previous, shazbat.
