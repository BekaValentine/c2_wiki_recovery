Here is another page of http://www.GarnetChaney.com Garnet R. Chaney. 

I hope you'll check out http://www.TrulyOpenDirectory.com. It's a wiki'd version of DMOZ. Gets around all the waiting of "editors" that plagues DMOZ. And I've got some new Expert Guides to the Internet at http://www.siql.com.

Random thoughts:
* The idea of a frontpage hosted wiki is intriguing. 
* The spell checker on this system is nice. Probably it should be made to understand crunched page names, and common words like "Wiki". But then again, maybe not.

I have been playing with wikis since 2001. (And with MOO hosted virtual environments with Web interfaces since 1994). I have a wiki at [http://www.chat11.com Chat11]. I play over at http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Garnet and at [http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GarnetRChaney wikipedia].

Some FPWiki bugs (or nonexistent features) that I have found:

* Trying out the system.... GarnetRChaney
I wonder why the above didn't become a link?????

* Trying again with: GarnetChaney

* AHA! The system doesn't like multiple capital letters in a row squeezed together. It doesn't like something that ends in a capital like GarnetR either...

* This system doesn't accept pipe link syntax, such as [[http://www.garnetchaney.com|Garnet R. Chaney]].

[''Never mind all that - we need better pictures of that beautiful grey and white cat of yours!'']

I agree... I sure wish I could take some more pictures of her. Katya died a couple of years ago while I was in Bulgaria. And just the other day I had to let the vet put to sleep my oldest cat, Bobo... But I still have three cats, and they are getting lots of extra attention. My favorite cat I brought back to USA from Bulgaria, her name is Monkey. You can see her here with her favorite pet from last year, http://www.garnetchaney.com/mantis2003/ Ms. Feng Shui. We're now waiting to see if any of Ms. Shui's egg sacks will hatch.

OK... I've been bold and refactored these to their own pages:

You mention Bulgaria a lot. What takes you there?

I started going there in 2000, after they got things under control to the point where the mafia wasn't just grabbing people off the street. (I heard this was happening just a couple of years earlier.) I was taking a lot of computer projects there for programmers to work on. After I quit working for that employer, I went over on my own and spent a lot of time there in 2001. (That's when I first started playing with UseModWiki software.) I mainly spent time in Sofia, but I also went a lot to Bourgas, a couple of times to Varna, and also visited the Rhodope mountains in southern Bulgaria, near the town of Devlin, which is famous for it's bottled water. I also travelled to Istanbul, and put together a photo essay of shopping at the Grand Bazaar, http://webmill.com/grand_bazaar/. I also took a train from Sofia to the Ukraine, to visit the cities of Kiev and Kharkov.
