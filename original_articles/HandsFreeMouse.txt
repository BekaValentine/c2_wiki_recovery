NaturalPoint is selling a alternative handsfree input system for PCs and Notebooks - the TrackIR device. The system works by optical tracking of a reflective dot users can stick onto their forehead. By looking at the desired position on the screen, the system moves the mouse there. http://www.naturalpoint.com/smartnav/

As an arm amputee, one of the hardest things for me is any kind of key + click combination. I get around it using Microsoft's StickyKeys accessibility feature, but this looks like it could help (not to mention it would be a cool toy). -- EddieDeyo

Very Useful Device not only for amputees, but for those paralyzed.
