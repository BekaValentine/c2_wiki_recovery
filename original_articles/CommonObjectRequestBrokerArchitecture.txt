(CORBA) A MiddleWare standard specified by the ObjectManagementGroup.

Quoting from http://www.omg.org/corba/whatiscorba.html - ( BrokenLink ) try: http://www.omg.org/spec/
	 :	''"The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), is the Object Management Group's answer to the need for interoperability among the rapidly proliferating number of hardware and software products available today. Simply stated, CORBA allows applications to communicate with one another no matter where they are located or who has designed them. CORBA 1.1 was introduced in 1991 by Object Management Group and defined the InterfaceDefinitionLanguage and the ApplicationProgrammingInterface''''''s that enable client/server object interaction within a specific implementation of an Object Request Broker (ORB). CORBA 2.0, adopted in December of 1994, defines true interoperability by specifying how ORBs from different vendors can interoperate."''

I (EwanBirney) find that DesignInIdl is an interesting way to foster fast,
clean, precise design in an ExtremeProgramming sort of way.

''I (PhlIp) cannot learn something without TestFirst''''''ing it these days. So see http://wiki.orbzone.org/TestFirstCiao ''
