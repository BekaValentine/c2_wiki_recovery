If this were actually true, everyone would do it.

When my students complain that something (validation, error handling, whatever) is hard, I remind them that if anyone could do it, their employers wouldn't need them.

Then why have so many programmers just finished junior high?

''Depends on your definition of programming. Someone who just learned to hack out a VB script may call themselves a programmer. . . I wouldn't.''

An alternative explanation is that AdultsAreStupid. ;)
* Wait, I've heard that somewhere ... oh yes ... MTV and Nickelodeon!

Getting something to work based on clear specifications is relatively easy. Getting it to work and be maintanable with fuzzy specs is the hard part.

Almost anything can be done at different levels of skill. Heck I play guitar, woodworking etc. Am I good? Not really, but I qualify as an amateur player/woodworker. In this sense, programmers can also rate at the amateur level and why not? Just don't expect professional quality results. To be a professional takes quite a lot of skill and more importantly experience. So is it easy? Depends what you aim for. Just like playing simple songs is easy and playing intricate jazz solos is hard; making a notepad clone is easier than making Vim.

''not really. to make a notepad clone requires "copy notepad.exe notepad_clone.exe", but making vim is just "make vim" ;)''

Maybe it should be GettingItToWorkIsEasy but MakingTheBestDesignIsHard ?  Or GettingItToDoSomethingIsEasy , GettingItToDoEverythingIsHard ?
