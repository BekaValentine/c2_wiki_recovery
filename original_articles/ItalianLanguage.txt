I love the ItalianLanguage.  It sounds so lyrical.  And I especially love greeting people with Ciao bella (or bello if appropriate, but my American upbringing leads me to mainly only use this greeting form with women).  I wish I new more than just how to say hi.  Time to consider studying the LatinLanguage I guess.

Italian has a similar feel (actually, I always felt that Latin carried the grave liturgical overtones of Sanskrit), and is probably easier wrt grammar. And it's living as well. Interesting random fact: TeluguLanguage is speciously called the 'Italian of the East' because all the words end in a vowel! -- TheerasakPhotha
