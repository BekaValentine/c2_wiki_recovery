is a WikiBookmarklet that gives you a popup prompt and then searches for what you input:

javascript:var searchTerm = prompt("Search the c2 wiki:", ""); if (searchTerm) {location.href = "http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=" + searchTerm;}

The advantage of doing this over just having a normal bookmark to FindPage is that this way you can reach for the keyboard after just one click.  If you go to FindPage, you have to wait for the page to load so you can click on the input field, *then* you can go for the keyboard.  (If you're used to the field automatically being selected, a la Google, this behavior will drive you nuts).

(Use "fullSearch?" instead of "wiki?" for that type of search.)
