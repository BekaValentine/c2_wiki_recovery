I am currently a Software Engineer working for IDT Technology on prepaid telephony.

I like to hack (that's ''hack''
not ''crack''), and have a Linux box at home.

I also like to build telescopes in my spare time, and am web master for my local astronomy club. Come visit me at http://home.att.net/~mikel or my club at http://www.starastronomy.org if you want to learn more.

I can be reached at mailto:mikel@att.net

Mike is one of the fastest programmers I know.
PairProgramming came to my attention in large part
due to our need to keep up with his coding speed.
