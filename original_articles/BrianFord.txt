Brian Ford joined PLANET ARGON in May 2006. He currently labors under the title of Interaction Architect. His interests in interface design can be traced at least to what he considers his first "application": a tic-tac-toe game written in Apple IIe Basic when he was 16. He's currently working feverishly to learn everything in the universe about creating excellent applications with Ruby and Rails, as well as finishing his mathematics degree at Portland State University.
