I'm currently working at Velogic, which just got bought by
Key''''''Note, doing outsourced Web site load testing.

I've been building software for a few decades, starting at Tektronix
in Wilsonville, and venturing through the University Of Arizona, Sun Labs,
and Cybersource along the way.

I just dropped some pebbles in the bucket, to see what ripples they might
produce:
