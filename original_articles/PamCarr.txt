I am a member of the Marlboro College Internet Teaching Certificate program along with PamHarland, BruceHolloway and GregHaas. I have just started with Wiki and am finding it fascinating! I have so much to learn about it and am looking forward to it.

I am a teacher at Hampton Academy Junior High http://www.sau21.k12.nh.us/hajh
At HAJH, I am also the co-webmaster with PamHarland.
