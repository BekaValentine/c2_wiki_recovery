Impress the public by replacing a verb phrase that clearly expresses what you are doing by a MysteryNoun. A mainstay of cult leaders, politicians, IT consultants and other charlatans.

Maybe I'm just too skeptical, but I've often seen this in presentations by high priced consultants:
Saying "what's your B2B eCommerce strategy?" when all that really means is "do you plan to automate your interactions with other businesses?"

Seems like many consultants try to "prove their worth" by introducing meaningless new terminology, on the idea that you'll have to hire them to teach it to you.
