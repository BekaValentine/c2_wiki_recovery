20091110 Google introduced a new language named Go, also known as GoLang (http://golang.org/). Wikipedia talks about it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_language.

Best known for very fast compilations, fast non-blocking garbage collection, and something much more general than multi-threading support for concurrency.

RussCox shows its speed in this one minute video: http://youtu.be/wwoWei-GAPo

GoogleTechTalk by RobPike describes the language design in about an hour: http://youtu.be/jgVhBThJdXc

-- ChrisGarrod thinks this is going to be so cool. Nearly instantaneous compilations, who's going to have time for SlashDot?

'''Interfacing''' to CeeLanguage and CeePlusPlus is possible using SWIG(SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator).

My favorite part about Go is that it proves that one can have DuckTyping and StaticTyping at the same time. We need more languages to allow this...

My least favorite part is the lack of generics, and the high probability for method name collisions (granted, that's a problem with all DuckTyping, especially compared to TypeClasses).
