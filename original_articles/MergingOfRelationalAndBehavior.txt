A TopMind or RelationalWeenie view of the future of software design.

If ObjectsAreDictionaries, then why not apply similar patterns to relational tables instead of dictionaries. Dictionaries can be viewed as "crippled tables", limited to 2 columns and one key. If languages made it easier to embed and call code in tables, then we would essentially have a super-set of OO, but better tied to the (allegedly) cleaner rules of relational.

But, we may need a more dynamic approach to RDBMS, such as a MultiParadigmDatabase.
