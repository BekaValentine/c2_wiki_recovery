''You know, a lot of people here would be happy helping you find or set up a wiki for LigneRerUccle but those pages just aren't ''relevant'' here. Do you even know of any WikiZen here who shares your concern?''

Well well I am obviously lost ... in this new Wiki world. I thought that this "site" was a WikiFarm where anyone could create its site! So I will move somewhere else, of course. Do you have any advice on a wiki hosting site? 

But please make clear on the WikiWiki page that the site is ONLY to discuss Software development matters.

A sentence like "This is a web site written by its users, people like you and me. Anyone can change any page or create new pages!" is VERY misleading. It will avoid other people loosing time like I have done. Thanks.

This is the first time I've seen someone jump into this wiki and make a mistake like this. I find the combination of enthusiasm and fearlessness quite charming. -- RichardKulisz

In some areas I still have a child attitude to life: trusting and naive. It makes me enthusiasm and also fearless and that's why, after reading an article on Wikiwiki, I jumped to it because I found the concept so clever and powerful.  I do appreciate people who found my mistake charming. Anyway now I have to find another way to have my wiki pages hosted on a server. And it's not so easy. I went to several wikifarms but they all seemed much more complex: either too complex formatting commands or difficulty to create the wiki server. 
'''Does anyone could help me on that?'''  What I want is to have something similar to WikiWiki: which server do you recommand (fast) and where do I get the perl/php source of a Wiki server? Your help would be much appreciated.

Last edit 23 months ago. Seems Michel left WikiWiki after search for his own wiki. I would propose to delete this page. 2004-03-13.
