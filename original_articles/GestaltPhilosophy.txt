Ah, but a great deal more can be said about the implementation of Gestalt, vis-a-vis software development.  In a general sense, ManagingGestalt is about...

* Spanning the range of spatial scales
* Accounting for temporal inertia and urgency
* Dealing with functional complexity and multiple stresses
* Recognizing the wide range of outlooks
* Linking outside themes and issues
* Understanding and reflecting upon deep uncertainties
* Accounting for human choice and behavior
* Incorporating surprise, critical thresholds, and abrupt change
* Working toward combining effective qualitative and quantitative analyses
* Linking policy development and action through stakeholder participation
