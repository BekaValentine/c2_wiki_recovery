Very basic AntiPattern, not even SourcesOfBugs, although they are both.

* GoTo''''''s
* ObfuscatedCode
* SingleLetterNamedVariables
* FoolTrap

This approach is rather naive. Simply making a good/bad list will never really define bad programming practices; have you never seen terrible code that rigidly follows a coding convention?

While ObfuscatedCode is never a good thing, both GoTo''''''s and single letter variables have their place. The trick is to know when something is appropriate.
