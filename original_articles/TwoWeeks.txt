It seems that the rhythm to developing software in XP marches to a beat marking TwoWeeks.  What is magic about TwoWeeks?

	* Nobody can estimate anything with any accuracy of duration greater than TwoWeeks.

I tried OneWeek instead of TwoWeeks in a project recently, and I think OneWeek is just too short for useful stories to emerge. We ended up tacking simpler stories first since they fit the week boundary, instead of the riskier ones.
