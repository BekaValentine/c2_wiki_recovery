I appear to have accidently "fried" Manual As Specification -- don't know quite how.  The idea is that the Manual is a good way of specifying the User Interface and working in Manual-format gets the Manual up-front.

Some discussion criticized this as a limited approach, and it certainly doesn't cover the whole application but it does get the manual done early and gives one a vehicle to get the marketeers off your back and keep them busy reviewing the User Manual.  

RonJeffries had made many good points which I've somehow fried ... sorry Ron.  --RaySchneider
