I think it is a mistake to characterize these as "capture-replay" tools. While several of these tools include capture-replay facilities, they generally have scripting languages as well, and significant work is invested in writing testing frameworks for them. BretPettichord has a ton of material on this at his website. The goal of the testing framework is usually to preserve test maintainability in the face of UI change. Hans Buwalda's work on TestFrame (and a successor that I think is in development at Logigear, www.logigear.com) is an example of an approach that is UI level but definitely not capture-replay. I believe that Certify is another example.
