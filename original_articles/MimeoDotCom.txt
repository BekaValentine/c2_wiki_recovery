''I'm reminded of the story of the (70s?  80s?) company which acted as an email-to-snail-mail gateway.  An early version of their software charged by the kilobyte...  So if you sent a few k of linefeeds to yourself, you could get a ream of paper cheaply.  Ahh, exploits that were before my time. -- DanielKnapp''

The history of this page is that I originally intended to chronicle our development efforts, but that fell through. Then the page was dead for a while and I decided to prune away some of the content. Unfortunately that proved to be a bad idea because some AnonymousCoward read the updated content and bashed the company thinking it was using WardsWiki for marketing purposes. It wasn't and I apologize to those who may have thought that's what it was.
