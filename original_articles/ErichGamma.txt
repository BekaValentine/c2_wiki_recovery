He's author number 1 of the GangOfFour and feels more and more guilty that there isn't a 2nd edition...

When talking about ErichGamma, you have to mention AndreWeinand. He also worked on ET++ (EtPlusPlus) and has been working with ErichGamma on and off (Taligent, UBILAB, now OTI) since their days at the IFI at the University of Zurich (http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/IFIE.html).
