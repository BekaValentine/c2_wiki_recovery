BEA's EnterpriseServiceBus.   Differs from other ESBs in that it requires "no code" to do any-to-any data transformation, routing, security, and reliability -- other than their graphical "pipeline" language and XSLT or XQuery to do transformations.

Supports Binary, Text, RestArchitecturalStyle and SOAP WebServices over HTTP/S, File, FTP, SMTP, JMS today.  Will support JCA-style adapters by end of of the year.  WsReliableMessaging support by mid-2006.
