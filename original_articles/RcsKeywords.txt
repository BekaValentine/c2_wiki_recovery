The Revision''''''Control''''''System manages and keeps certain strings embedded in code up to date.  It can provide information about the current, path, latest developer, dates, and times.  To add your first keywords, put a dollar sign on each side of the word, as in  '''$Header$''' -- the table below shows the keyword and what it automatically expands to:

 keyword  result

My favorite is the '''$Header$''' since it embodies Source, Revision, Date, Locker, and other information.  Note that the time listed in Date is in GMT with the local offset.  If you want to see local times, set your environmental variable RCSINIT to -zLT
