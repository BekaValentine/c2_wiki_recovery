Computers are indeed dumb.

Imagine a computer with a file or table named Islands.  That file had its size in square furlongs or something and its name.  A query to this computer that wants to know the biggest island would be something like:
 sort -n Islands
The BottomLine is the answer to your question.  You asked this computer for an answer, and it gave you one.	Now you know what the biggest island is (Greenland) and wonder why Australia wasn't listed -- Its a continent.  You now know that Greenland is the biggest island.  The computer told you.  Does the computer know anything?  Conundrum
