SpamMotel creates dummy addresses for you that forward to a real address with a brief message saying which address the message was sent to. You give the dummy address out to a site such as SixDegrees and if you start receiving spam on that address you simply turn it off. It's also a good way to discover if signing up at various sites gets your name onto spam lists because you can always tell where the spammers got that particular address. -- BrianRobinson
