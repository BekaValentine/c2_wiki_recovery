In the spirit of EyeForAnEye or 'do unto others...', TitForTat is about ReplyingInKind. If bad (''or good'') things are said (or done) to you, you say (or do) bad (''or good'') things in return. PrisonersDilemma explores the GameTheory involved. This page is about the bad things to say, when such are needed.

KillerPhrases reduce resources (creativity, reputation, emotional wellbeing, social rank, etc.) of the attacked person. The attacker receives an adequate response.

KillerPhrases don't cost much time/intelligence to affect creative minds.

Also known as 'blocking' in the DramaticArt''''s.

Be aware, however, that searching for a cute answer could waste valuable emotional and cognitive resources of the attacked person.

Knowing appropriate AntiKillerPhrases can be handy, but appropriate responses are about revealing the state of mind of the attacked person, than convincing the audience. AintNothinGonnaBreakMyStride
