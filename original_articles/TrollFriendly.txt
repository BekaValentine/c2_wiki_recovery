A Troll Friendly forum is one where only damage to content, not annoying other contributors, counts as vandalism or is used as a grounds for exclusion.  It is essential to OpenPolitics and OpenWiki in particular, since trolls will gather in such forums, and rules must be designed to resist an almost infinite amount of provocation by them.  The extreme of Troll Friendly policy is the political OpenParty which invites even its opponents to join, cause trouble, and do whatever they can to disrupt operations, on grounds that when the party takes power it will need the capability to deal with these exact same efforts by its opponents, and so is best off learning it early.

Warning: This page, together with SocialPattern , IssuePositionArgument, OpenPolitics and OpenParty seems to form a WalledGarden.
