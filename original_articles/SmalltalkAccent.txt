Some examples I can think of:

	* Using closures as effortlessly as breathing, like

	 somecondition  ifTrue: [ trueblock ]  ifFalse: [ falseblock ].

	* Using (or thinking in terms of or ''wanting'' to use) sophisticated higher-order collection functions, such as ''collect:'' ''select:'' etc.

	* Using small, almost insignificant methods to maximize refactoring (even before we knew what to call it) and explanation.

I HaveThisPattern (have these patterns, even) and I don't even know Smalltalk.  Too much PerlLanguage and CommonLisp can spoil you for ever if you have to use Java afterwards.  Perhaps this page should be titled "FunctionalAccent"? -DanBarlow
