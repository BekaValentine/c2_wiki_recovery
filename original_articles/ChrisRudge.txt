I live in London, England. I'm very new to wiki.

If you want to know who I am, the best bet would be to read some of the comments I've written, or to contact me in some way; I don't think that introductions written by people about themselves are the best way of getting to know much about a person... :~)

My interests are in computers, mainly programming / scripting. I know TurboPascal, C, JavaScript, PhpLanguage, and a little Perl. I also do HTML and CSS reasonably well. I would like to help on code Wiki, maybe. I also enjoy reading.

I am also known in some other places as Continuity - the nickname is from a WilliamGibson novel called Mona Lisa Overdrive - ISBN 0553281747.
