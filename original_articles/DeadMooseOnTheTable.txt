A consultant is invited to a board meeting at a large company. The consultant walks in and is introduced to the board of directors. He finds it hard to ignore a large, dead moose in the middle of the meeting table. As the introductions continue, the consultant can no longer ignore the sight and the smell of the dead moose.

Finally, he says, "Why is there a dead moose on the table?"

One of the board members leans over and whispers, "You see it too?"

Another wonders why he doesn't mention the ElephantOnTheCoffeeTable.

Another form of ''The Emperor Has No Clothes''.

One of the good reasons for which a company will hire consultants.

''You have a typo in that line. Replace one 'h' with 'f'.''

Spoken like a true Luddite. Or do you have the same 35 years of experience that I and my fellow consultants bring to the party?

Another version...

A developer is called into his boss's office to talk about some incorrect code. When he enters he notices a dead chicken on the desk. The developer asks his boss "how did that get there?"

The boss says "well we both modified some code, then you remodified it and I remodified it - and now it doesn't work. So I'm not sure if the ChickenOrTheEgg came first - but now there is a dead chicken"
----
I liked my version better, where as soon as the consultant sits down he says, "What's with the dead moose?" Not a long time later. --PhlIp

Totally, completely '''concur'''. This is why I am brought in on this stuff in the first place.

Makes me think of the Ross Perot EDS/GM story on snakes: "WhenYouSeeaSnakeYouKillIt."
