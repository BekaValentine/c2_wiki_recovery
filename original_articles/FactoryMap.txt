FactoryMap is a simple DesignPattern where a large switch statement or if/elseif chain is replaced by a lookup table which maps the switch variable to some object.  For creation it's usually a function pointer.  For Prototype pattern it's a cloneable object.  I've seen this in lots of places, particularly in C++, but I haven't got round to writing it up yet (and neither has anyone else apparently!)
