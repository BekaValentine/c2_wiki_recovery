One of the difficulties in gathering information, ideas and knowledege from the web is that often the information is stored in structures which are not easily browsed and from which facts are only extracted using schemas which are not readily available or are not apparent. 

For that reason, it would be well to investigate this area of enquiry in which information is accessed and utilized by means of Semantic Maps.
