An UndirectedGraph is a DataStructure containing a vertex set ''V'' and an edge set ''E'', where each edge is an unordered pair of vertices.

Variants of this data structure:
	* Ordered pairs may be used to hold the vertices instead of unordered pairs, resulting in a DirectedGraph.
	* Weights may be associated with the edges, resulting in a WeightedUndirectedGraph.
