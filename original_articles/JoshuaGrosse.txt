Currently a grad student in PureMathematics at the UniversityOfWaterloo.  I've done far too much programming for work and not nearly enough for fun, so unfortunately I can't contribute much to the core topic of this wiki.  Instead I've worried about pages on math, science, and history, all of which I have considerable interest in.  If you think I'm doing something wrong, or don't understand what I'm doing, you can reach me at mailto:jcgrosse@math.uwaterloo.ca.
