Is it true that books have been written using wikis? If so is there usually a preexisting goal or aim such as "let's produce ExtremeProgrammingExplained"?

I believe that using a wiki to write one of the proposed XP books seemed to work well, for a short period while all the authors were in the same building and intensely focused on the task. After that I heard that it didn't work so well. Is that right? -- RichardDrake

Last edited October 2000.  Now that wikis have been around even longer, does anyone here have any comments to contribute on this question?

Currently this page is an orphan - is there anywhere that should link to it?
