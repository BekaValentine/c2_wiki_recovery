Patterns that capture forces and resolutions of forces in managing a project.  They will sometimes overlap with ProcessPatterns and OrgPatterns.
----
In my observations to date, project management often resembles keeping a body healthy, i.e., in balance.  There are all sorts of forces that try to pull it out of balance.  So the goal of very many project management patterns is to
''establish'' (preventative) or
''restore'' (remedial) a balance.  That means that the "problem" statement of the patterns is vacuous, in a sense.  So I have taken the problem statement out of the CockburnPmForm.  It is not that one is solving different problems with different patterns, but addressing different sets of out-of-balance forces on the same general problem.	-- AlistairCockburn
