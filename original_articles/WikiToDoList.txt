A WikiToDoList is a list of tasks that you have to complete, structured by your own PersonalWiki. 

''I HaveThisPattern. The ease of use of a wiki far outweighs any benefits offered to me by more structured software such as PersonalInformationManager''''''s. It's trivial for me to link ToDo items through to, say, people in my addressbook (another part of my PersonalWiki) or projects, web links or anything else.''

I HaveThisPattern too. My WikiToDoList is part of my PersonalWiki's HomePage. I also keep a list of unripe reminders/tasks on another page. When they ripen, a daily script moves them to the WikiToDoList. The task format is a poor man's cron; tasks can be one-shot, daily, monthly, yearly, day-of-week, etc. Quite handy.

We are using Wiki for a project-wide to do list.  We tag to-do items with a badge like ToDoJohn.  Then, John just searches for his to-do items.  You can find all undone items by searching for ToDo.  When it's done, he changes the badge to DoneJohn.
