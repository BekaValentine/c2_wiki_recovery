IIRC, Don was the author of several important HomeBrew hardware books in the late 70s and early 80s.  Was it op amps or terminals??  -ScottElliott

''Yes.  _Active Filter Cookbook_ and _TV Typewriter_.  He has a website at http://www.tinaja.com/ ''

Also The RTL Cookbook, the TTL Cookbook, and several others.

He's been a rabid Postscript enthusiast and expert almost from the day Postscript was released. It's a programming language, not just a document format, btw, so he's an enthusiast in the sense that it's his favorite programming language.
