Famous essay (more accurately, a collection of quotes) by EwDijkstra.  Rather controversial and inflammatory; more so when it was written.  The targets of Dijkstra's barbs -- popular industrial languages at the time such as FORTRAN, COBOL, and BASIC -- are far less widely used today, although BASIC is still widely used if you count VisualBasic.  

Also contains lots of flames for IbmCorporation, which in the 70s had a reputation and market position even greater than that of MicroSoft today.

Also contains lots of useful bits of advice.
