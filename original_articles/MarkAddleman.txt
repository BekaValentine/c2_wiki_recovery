Browsing through Wiki, I've decided that 
	* I'm JustaProgrammer,
	* I'm an ExtremeGrasshopper, but mostly
	* I'm an IdiotProgrammer and proud of it.

Dear WikiDiary,

Today, I performed my first WikiRefactoring moving particurlarly interesting discussion (at least to me) from RefactoringMercilesslyHidesTheForest to WhenIsRefactoringFinished (''now moved to WhenToStopRefactoring'').  Before I refactored, I browsed Wiki and found FixYourWiki and GoodWikiCitizen.  Although I broke the first rule ''Don't refactor live threads'', I thought the discussion was important enough to deserve a page of its own and was careful not to touch any of the content of the pages.  I made sure to MakeWikiPageBackups, so if anyone is terribly upset over my refactoring, I can put things back the way they were.

Dear WikiDiary,

I have begun thinking about refactoring the whole discussion of ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatch to remove the ThreadMode stuff.  It's a huge task, but, lately, I've had TooMuchTimeOnMyHands and I need to do something I feel is productive.

Along the same lines, I've been reading of the older pages and I FeelLikeWritingSomething, but I learned long ago that thinking you have something to say and actually having something to say are two different things.

Dear WikiDiary, 
I haven't visit in 10 years and so much has changed in my life.  I feel like revisiting an old friend or, more specifically, old friends.  While it violates the WikiNow, I want to reread pages that influenced me 10 years ago.  Some are here but others, I'm LookingForPages.
