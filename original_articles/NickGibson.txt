''Moved from NiCk''

Hey there kiddos! My name is Nick Gibson, from Bellevue, Wa, outside Seattle.

I'm in school right now doing begining training for my MCSE so I can get paid to be a nerd, and my major interests include:

PunkRock, DirectAction, love, life and justice, HowardZinn, computers, grindcore, thrashcore, sideways glaces and www.livejournal.com (I'm at http://www.livejournal.com/~xjaprufrockx .)

As time passes I'll find interesting thoughts and musings to make this worthwhile, until then, deal.

You can contact me at Nickgoldfish@yahoo.com, I love email.

--NiCk!

PS - For the Record - I was considering explaining this when I initially created this page, however, I felt it would be seen as trite and/or egotistical - but since others have brought it up... I have formatted my name this way for a long time.  As long as I can remember.  The fact the Wiki creates addresses by means of connecting capitalized words/letters together meshed perfectly with this quirk of mine; I can use both my real name *and* the spelling and format I am most comfortable with.  I am aware of RealNamesPlease ... I am using my real name... 'NiCk' is no fabrication.  I am not a formal person, I don't like using my last name, but it is provided for those who are curious for some reason.

Am I easier to bond with, commune with, understand or argue with, by providing an arbitrary second moniker to complicate the first?  I could have made a page for NickRawmanousski easily, but I chose not to, as that's not who I am.  NiCk is. ''I don't mean this to be snotty... I'm just explaining.  Not disrespecting those who have brought my name to my attention.'' -- NiCk

The reaction you see might also be explained by the principles underlying FixBrokenWindows and TheTippingPoint. I wouldn't have thought your explanation as trite or egotistical, but instead something that explains the validity of something unconventional. Without that explanation though it could be seen as setting a bad example .. along the lines of IfNiCkCanDoItYouCanDoIt ;-) -- EricScheid

''the FixBrokenWindows theory is intriguing... I can easily see how it applies to my chosen page... For the record, I think most can infer (but assume and you make an ass out of you and me, hah), but I don't see my name as a 'broken window', is all.  It's just who I am.  I don't intend for others to jump on my 'bandwagon' and start pages like '420NOFXPunk' or something horrendously awful like that...   On another note... maybe I as a whole am a broken window... that could be debated.... hmm... perhaps it *should* be debated... anyhow, off to bed.'' -- NiCk

Well, seeing as I didn't actually call you a broken window per se, but instead pointed at the underlying principles involved, namely that actions follow appearances, so be careful what example you set. A similar principle is with DontTryThisAtHomeKids ''(usually followed by "We are professionals ... professional idiots, that is")''. -- EricScheid

''Definitely RealNamesPlease. It's polite and respectful to the community to abide by the conventions of that community, and respect in one direction engenders respect in return. -- AnonymousDonor''

Yeah!!! --PhlIp

But doesn't first-name only make things confusing? -- NickBensema

And yet, I've seen many people highly annoyed at 'AnonymousDonor' .... it says *nothing* about identity, making community fostering difficult.... I've provided my full name... you won't give yours when commenting on my actions? ;)
