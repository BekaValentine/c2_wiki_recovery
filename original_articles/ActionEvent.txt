''ActionEvent''

This is a SemanticEvent which indicates that a component-defined action has occurred. 
* This high-level event is generated by a component (such as a Button) when a component-specific action occurs (such as being pressed). 

The event is passed to every every ActionListener object that registered to receive such events 
* using the component's addActionListener method. 

The object that implements the ActionListener interface gets this ActionEvent 
* when the event occurs. 

Hence the listener
* is spared the details of processing individual mouse movements and mouse clicks, 
* can instead process a "meaningful" SemanticEvent like "button pressed".
