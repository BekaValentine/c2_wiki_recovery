When people are first introduced to Patterns in a more
formal manner (such as a tutorial or lecture), I wonder
what preconceptions they arrive with and whether Patterns
turn out to be much different than what they expected.

When I have asked some PatternNovices what they think about
Patterns, I get answers like these:

	* Oh yeah, I saw the GoF book... It's just a way to catalog designs, right?
	* Isn't that a new way of doing Object Oriented Design?
	* Sounds like forcing structure on the way people document stuff.
	* I am thinking about writing a tool to generate code from Patterns...
	* Isn't that the stuff that makes it easier to design _______ ?

Are these people victims of (misleading) PatternHype ?   When will the
inevitable PatternBacklash (and I don't mean PatternSkepticism) begin?
