Hi, my name is Paul,

We use AgilePrinciples to build software that changes conversations.


We are a Chicago based team using MacromediaFlash on the front end, JavaServlets on the server side and MySql for the data base.

I used to call myself an extreme architect (I predicted I may change what I call myself and indeed I have).  I am now JustaProgrammer.

I quit my corporate job December 15th 2003 and have been woking for my Self since.  I hooked up with some Jungian folks and built some typology software which was a great learning experince ( http://www.thesoulpurpose.com/insights )

I now know there are many simple and valuable software solutions and I am allowing them to manifest through my coding.

some pages my architect persona (who called himself Cas) created:

Cas is an extreme architect - I may change what I call myself tomorrow.

I create (well discover really) structure to manage complexity of building distributed, organic, collaborative systems with a nameless quality.  

I keep things as simple as possible, communication is key to success.  

My methodology is extreme - and hard to describe in text, but here goes.
Consider 3 communities: Business, Management and Technical.
Imagine 3 balls of different colours - representing each community.  I juggle.  We take a journey, honest about what we know, humble about what we can do, courageous enough to embrace change, courageous enough to be successful.

As for modeling - I do it my way.  See CasMl, AnimatedArchitecture and ArchitecturePictures.  I even code - see XmlLite.

Cheers
