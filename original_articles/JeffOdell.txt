Hmmm.... hard to describe oneself.  Went to college, got out, played with computers.  Worked at Oracle for a number of years.  Discovered Smalltalk in 1991 and have been at it since.

Until recently, primary Smalltalk environment was Visual Smalltalk.  Being involved as a principal in a new startup, Esprit Health (www.esprithealth.com), we moved to Visual Age Smalltalk 4.0.  Fortunately, I was able to take my good friend WindowBuilder with me (thanks, Eric)
