I've been a software developer for many, many years.

Now that I've been reading about Extreme Programming, and attended XP Immersion IV, I'm ready to give it a try.

XP is a method that scorns methodology, a theory that rejects theorizing. I've been looking for something like it for a very long time.

A few favorite quotes come to mind:

''"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke, "There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke. But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate, So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."'' -- BobDylan

''Do! (then Reflect)'' -- KentBeck

''Theory is gray, my friend, but green the golden tree of life.'' -- Goethe

''I am not bound to swear allegiance to the words of any master; where the storm carries me, I go ashore and make myself at home.'' -- Horace

''And he to me, as one who comprehends: "Here one must leave behind all hesitation; here every cowardice must meet its death."'' -- Dante

''Thus, the task is not so much to see that which has never been seen, but to think that which has never been thought, about that which everyone sees.'' -- Schopenhauer

Why didn't I think of that? :)
