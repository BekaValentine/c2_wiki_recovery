GutFeelings are something to avoid or be ashamed of these days. good.  My personal campaign is to persuade classical Science to receive the Other Half of life, the Universe and everything - subjectivity.  Don't throw away all that classical science has gained for us.  sum to it,or incorporate gut feeling into your armoury of techniques for understanding the world.
