The very first entirely-CGI television series.  As a consequence, the graphics themselves are rather crude by modern standards.

Produced by MainframeInc, a Canadian company.

On the surface, it looks like a kiddie program, and certainly kids will enjoy it.  There are, however, a lot of jokes and plot elements that are intended for adults.  It's a must-see for anyone who loves computers.

You can also tell that its creators used LinuxOperatingSystem - there are many hidden references to it (such as TuxPenguin walking around).
