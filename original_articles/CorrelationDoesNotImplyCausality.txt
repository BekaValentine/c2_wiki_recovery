	Miller:	A lot of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things. They don't realize that there's this like lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything. I'll give you an example, show you what I mean. Suppose you are thinking about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp. Out of the blue, no explanation. No point in looking for one either. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness. 

	Otto:	You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in the hippie days?
