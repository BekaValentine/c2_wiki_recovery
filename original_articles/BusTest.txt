At our place, a project or implementation is said to "fail the bus test" if its BusNumber is one.

Having seen what the rest of the world calls the BusTest idea, I now see that we didn't get very far along with the ZeroOneInfinityRule ideology - and so you will see that many of our systems have a BusNumber of one.  It is not explicit that "BusNumber > 1" constitutes passing the BusTest, perhaps that makes it OK.

Endless hours of amusement available when talking about people "getting bussed", especially since many of us cycle to work. Confusion ensues when this is mis-heard as "getting bust".
