I've been programming professionally since 1992. I started with Clipper 5.1 and Turbo Pascal projects. I've been part of and/or led projects in Delphi, C++, Java and VB6 and lately VB & C#.Net.

I'm rather new to refactoring and other ExtremeProgramming practices, but I'm so hooked that now I'm always looking for new ways to apply them to the projects I'm working on. Specially, I've been very active looking for ways of using DesignPatterns (specially those they say can't be implemented in VB6) and Refactoring in VisualBasic since that's the language I'm using in my current project.

I'm currently working in a Digital Document Management System using Visual Basic, COM+, ASP and JavaScript against a SQLServer database. I'm using COMUnit for unit testing.

Since I first wrote this I've started trying to form a CodeCraftsmanship group in MexicoCity, without much luck. Maybe I'll join one of the already organized user groups (like JavaMexico.org) and start from there. Let's see what happens =)
