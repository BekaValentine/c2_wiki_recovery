Discussion of changes needed and/or done to VbUnit (now VbUnitThree):

Crashing the VisualBasic IDE is handled much more gracefully now.  ;->

'''''This is not vbUnit's fault, but it's useful to know this, to work around VisualBasic's problems:'''''

When the application under test crashes...
''(yes, there '''are''' ways to do this in VisualBasic  ;-)''

Symptoms:
	* When VisualBasic crashes...
	* vbUnit attempts to do its "Stop Debugger" command -- so you may see the "Run" menu pop up.
	* The VisualBasic IDE is shown on the screen, but does not refresh and the mouse pointer is stuck; it won't move.

Workaround:
	* Do the ThreeFingerSalute (Ctrl+Alt+Delete).  You'll typically get the VisualBasic error and be able to kill it without going through the Task Manager.
	* Stop writing bad VisualBasic code that makes the IDE crash.  ''(One of the VbClassicBugs relating to conditional compilation was causing me problems, in this case.)''

A really minor "nit":
If there's a syntax error that prevents the program under test from compiling, VisualBasic highlights the offending code, but this highlighting is not displayed because the vbUnit add-in window is still the focus.

Workaround:
To see VBs highlighting, scroll the code window up or down one line.

Some of  the things we could do for VbUnitTestDataManagement, need to be do differently in VbUnitThree.

----

Some things don't work quite right when one has several projects open at once (with a group), and the projects share files:

	* "Close all files" does *not* display VB's "do you want to save changes to this file?" nor the "do you want to share changes with other projects?" dialog boxes.  [Exit VB to get the save/discard dialog box.  'File -> Save All' may also do the trick (but I haven't tried it).]
		* ''I'm not sure about this, but this *may have* allowed me to make incompatible changes to the same file from two different projects -- a conflict VB detected and forced me to discard one of the two.  This was a minor annoyance.''

	* I'm pretty sure that this 'shared files' situation contributes to vbUnit being unable to find the test suite class.  (...even though the test suite class is *not* shared.)  Saving and/or closing files sometimes fixes the problem.  Closing and restarting VB always fixes the problem.
