'''Tips for selecting appropriate tools'''
	* Quickly analyze protocol and identify potential weak spots ''Examples needed''
	* Determine what tools can deal with these weak spots or what time you will need to deal with them yourself
	* Select the cheapest "good enough" tool

'''Tips for speeding-up the load testing process''' ''Two ways - 1) move final test to earlier date; 2) minimize work amount - these can conflict.''
	* Start configuring monitors as early as possible
	* Try to quickly create all scripts to see how much time it will take to implement them

'''What cannot give sophisticated results and takes more time to analyze results'''
	* Testing software with functional defects
	* Incomplete monitoring

'''Areas where problems usually appear when creating load test scripts''' ''(possibly break out tool-specific problems)''
	* Authentication
