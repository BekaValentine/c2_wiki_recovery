Project Galactic Guide (PGG) is a collaborative Internet attempt at creating an electronic reference meant to guide and misguide its readers in matters of life, death, and finding a parking space anywhere in the Universe. Ever since 1991, editors, field researchers and other contributors alike have been involved in building a database of articles ranging on all matters in and out of this world. They have built browsers, Web sites and written articles, all in order to create something as fun, helpful and brilliant as DouglasAdams' fictional HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy (HHGTTG) -- only for real.
