Use of your text editor--especially those with macro, regexp, or other programmable features--to assist with code generation.  An example of CopyAndPasteProgramming.  It can be as simple as cutting-and-pasting code from one area to another, or as complicated as writing (parameterized) macros that emit code.  (In the cruder cases of the latter, the code emitted is boilerplate which is then completed by hand).

There are 2 ways that CeeLanguage programmers can have the power of Lisp.  One is by GreenSpunning; the other is by using emacs and writing a whole bunch of Emacs macros (in Lisp) to automagically emit C code to do various things.

Of course, many consider EditorMetaProgramming to be an AntiPattern, as it must be done manually.  OTOH, it sure beats typing it all in by hand, especially in languages/environments which don't make true MetaProgramming easy....

An interesting question:  Is the RefactoringBrowser the ultimate case of EditorMetaProgramming?
