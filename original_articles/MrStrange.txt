My name is Simon Strange, but in written formats (online, press, whatnot) I've always gone by the oh-so-clever name of Mr. Strange.

I'm continuing this great tradition on Wiki.

I find it hard to search the pages here - maybe learning about the RoadMaps will help.

I'm a full-time video game designer, and I'm interested in discussing the design of VideoGames (or just general GameDesign) with folks here.  The subject often becomes philosophical, or transforms itself into a discussion about systems.  Both eventualities seem well-suited to the Wiki format.

I use a DvorakKeyboard, I design and fold OrigamiModels, play ComputerGames, and try to provide an IdealChildhood for my progeny.

Hey MrStrange,
you may miss Monde Au Frites, but I miss your coast. Are you near the water? I grew up in VancouverBritishColumbia and spent a lot of late Augusts on the Oregeon Coast. Very beautiful! -- BrianvandenBroek

'''Discussion about my name'''

''Hi Simon, we would '''really''' prefer, if you used your real name as a homepage name. You can sign your contributions with whatever handle you like as long, as it can be traced to your homepage, but your homepage should be named after your real name.''

I'm not quite sure what you are suggesting - could I sign contributions with MrStrange and have it link to a page entitled SimonStrange? That would be great, but I don't see how it would work. Other than that, I don't see how I would sign contributions with something that could be 'traced' back to my homepage. Please elucidate! -- MrStrange

Yes and No. I mean signing with say "-- Mr.Strange" or "-- Mr.S"; this will do in most conversations, esp. if you sign the first one with "-- SimonStrange". I for one sign often with the short "-- .gz".  '''(But be aware that ShortWikiSignaturesSmell.)'''
I didn't mean, that you use this page as a referer page, though this ''might'' be an option (though I fear it would be deleted quickly). -- .gz

''I think the suggestion was that you have a "proper" home page named as your real name, then have this page as a place-holder and pointer to that page. Here on WardsWiki, we generally abide by WardCunningham's express preference that we use our real name, or no name at all. Nicks, handles and pseudonyms are very strongly discouraged.''

Ah. I was going to take some immediate action on this (I know there is a SimonStrange out there besides myself!) but now I think I'll let this stew for a day before doing anything. After all, MrStrange is my real name, just not FirstnameLastname. Whatever. I'm not trying to be contrary. My desire is not to veil my first name, but rather to post with my standard version of my name and have it link to a homepage for folks to visit. -- MrStrange

''The point is that on wiki the standard version of your name ''is'' your FirstnameLastname, regardless of what it might be elsewhere.''

Well, fine, but what do people like me do then? I 'like' that my 'v' and 'd' are small. -- BrianvandenBroek
