I'm a senior production engineer at Novator systems (http://www.novator.com/ ), involved in the engineering of the web sites for FTD.com and FTD Florists Online.

We're experimenting with Extreme Programming, and it looks really promising.

The hard pard is, how to you write unit tests for a web page scripted with PHP or perl?

''Essentially, you write a test harness that feeds the web server a given request, captures the output, and compares against known good output. See HttpUnit for some pointers.''
