Well, I've been around here awhile, read alot more than I write, keep thinking I'll find some time to do some writing.

VisualBasic Programmer.  Part of me wants to say "currently", since VB certainly isn't the coolest language, but I like my job, so I can live with it.  Someday, in my CopiousSpareTime, I'll finish learning Lisp.

Some pages that have caught my interest (in no particular order):

OneMinuteWiki, TextFormattingRules, AnOutsidersReviewOfWiki, RoadMaps, LimitsOfHierarchies, WabiSabi, VotingPatterns, SociologyWiki, GaveUpOnTelevision, NoteWiki

In some cases "caught my interest" is short for "looks interesting but, gosh, that's a long page and, <sigh> it is getting late, so I'll read it later".

ShortBooks, including
*A Quantum Mechanics Primer, Daniel T. Gillespie. ISBN 0470299126 ...focuses on the formal development of the mathematics used for quantum mechanics - probabilities, Hilbert spaces, vector products, Hamiltonian mechanics. The quantum mechanical treatment is laid down very clearly and explicitly. Has no examples (hence the shortness), but gives a very clear, rigorous presentation. 

*Basic category theory for computer scientists, Benjamin C. Pierce ISBN 0262660717 . Good introduction to CategoryTheory, covering the normal definitions, functors, natural transformations, and applications to FunctionalProgramming.

An interesting Wiki (imo) -- http://www.disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml -- DisinfoPedia
* ''Now is SourceWatch]

By the way, is anyone else amused by the fact that the SpellChecker doesn't recognize the word "Wiki"?
* ''I add Wiki (capitalized as a proper noun) to all my personal SpellChecker''''''s.''

ThankYou for bringing my attention to SourceWatch, which I had not seen before. I share an interest in FunctionalProgramming. -- JohnFletcher
