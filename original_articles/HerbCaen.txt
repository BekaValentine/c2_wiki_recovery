HerbCaen was a gossip columnist for the SanFrancisco Chronicle.  

He coined many new words.

Most of his columns were collections of scraps of stories -- often just one sentence each.  Each column had scores of items.

Most of the rest of his columns were lengthy reminiscences about San Francisco's history.
