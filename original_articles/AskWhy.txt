Pointed to from SimplifyTheRequirements.

From any two-year-old's repetoire of annoying behavior:



Ask "Why?" To the response ask "Why?" Continue until smacked.

This technique is useful in:
* Simplifying requirements and dealing with LeadingRequest''''''s
* Turning attributes into real responsibilities on CrcCard''''''s

I used to get caught in the ''why-cycle'' with my children until I chose to interpret the question as "tell me more about that". For each "Why?" I would offer a different observation without straying too far from the original point. Each response would elicit another "Why?" until I finally hit on the desired information and got a simple "Oh" in place of why.

Asking "Why store that?" remains a great way to transform attributes into requirements. -- WardCunningham

But some times, the Customer doesn't believe you need to AskWhy (OnlySayThingsThatCanBeHeard) and in those cases, it can be really difficult to find a way to ask why without asking why.
