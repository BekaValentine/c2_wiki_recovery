This category is not about ''what'' is learned so much as ''how'' to learn, and how to be certain that what is learned will be applicable and useful.

One has a greater chance of continuing to be creative, innovative and productive in this time of explosive knowledge growth by insuring that the learning experience is widened, extended and made to include Global as well as Local concerns.
