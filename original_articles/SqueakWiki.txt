The "Squeak Swiki" is a large and active Wiki that documents SqueakSmalltalk. You will see many references to its old home at http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/squeak , but most page addresses can be translated to its later address at
http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak
where it moved in the mid 2000s.

SqueakWiki can also mean a squeak based wiki which can be used for a PersonalWiki.

Of the Squeak-based Wikis, the Comanche swiki was for a long time the most popular codebase: 
http://wiki.squeak.org/swiki/

Smallwiki was another, which was ported to SeasideFramework and its name was changed to PierCms.

Free SqueakWiki hosting is available at http://www.netunify.com (formerly SwikiDotNet)  

See http://seasidehosting.st for free hosting of PierCms wikis and websites.

''I have used an old version of SqueakWiki for years as a way of storing personal content. My main problem with this is how to convert the information into other formats which did not exist when I started.'' -- JohnFletcher
