Counterpoint to BugFreeDoesntSell. 

The assumption we, as software developers, are making is that it takes longer to write poor software. Doing it in some ways, this is certainly true.

But face it, there can be no doubt that if a package were delivered on the same day with fewer bugs, management and customers would prefer it. 

When we get over the idea that we can deliver crap faster, the world will be glad to have us deliver good stuff.

Good stuff on time will sell. Now let's quit blaming ''them'' and start doing good work.
