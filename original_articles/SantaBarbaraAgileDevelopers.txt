Open Questions:
* Is there enough interest in Santa Barbara to bring in some big names for workshops or courses? For example, would 10-20 people be interested in a course on Adv OOD w/ Patterns by RobertMartin of ObjectMentor? How about if it was hosted by UCLA extension? If so, contact KelleyHarris.
* Are there enough people to form an agile/XP users group in Santa Barbara? ''If you include Lompoc, Santa Maria, etc, then  yes.'' - Lompoc and Santa Maria, etc, are fine!
* What is the best way to complement XpSouthernCalifornia, and not compete? 
* UCSB may also be a very good resource to tap, can we leverage any resources there? 

The AgileJournal is a publication of CMC Media right here in SB. I think I might persuade our Editor in Chief Liz Barnett to come out for a day sometime in 2007. Brad Appleton might also be interested in participating he is the author of a book on Patterns and is one of our columnists.   -- PatrickEgan

Ideas for possible learning projects:
* Organize workshops and courses. (XP, TDD, Advanced OOD, Patterns, etc.)
* Work together on an open-source project. (ex Fit, FitNesse, CppUnit, etc.)
* Occasionally work on side projects together to improve agile skills.
