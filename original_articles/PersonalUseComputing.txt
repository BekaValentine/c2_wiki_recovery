''More and more of the usage of computing capacity is being constructed and utilized by individuals, for their own benefit, in their own homes or wherever they can connect to the internet - '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20141023

This is a trend which will continue through the next one to many generations of computer systems available.

 In an answer given to a person over 30 years ago, when interest was expressed as to what 
  I would need or use a computer for, I replied: "Any and everything I want". 
  I envisioned then, as I do now, that the personal computer is a tool which "extends" 
  personal capabilities and lends its strengths to the over-riding thoughts, ideas and
  interests of those who will be found using them.

 It is more than a means used by industry to accomplish industrial and commercial tasks 
  efficiently and rapidly. 

 It is, and perhaps always will be, in the toolbox of individual personalities to be 
  used where they may desire, for themselves, about themselves and significant others.

 Fortunately, that toolbox also includes means of personalized, custom applications 
  making what we do both better and easier than previously. This through applications 
  people use for their own benefit, unhindered by prohibitive costs or restrictions. 

 Included are such things as ways and means to communicate with others, including 
  friendships and associations not based on physical proximity but upon "connectivity"
  In addition, personal use includes the ability to record and maintain valuable artifacts
  through creation and retention of images, sounds and documents which are of interest 
  either to the individual, or his or her associations with family, friends, peers and groups

 The coming years will see increasing availability of computing artifacts aimed at furthering 
 PersonalUseComputing.

 Artifacts and their Artifactories which will make life better, more interesting, more 
 satisfying and complete for the individual.
