RayOzzie is now more famous in Nov05 for his leaked memo, a situation review for MicroSoft and its directions.

A copy of the purposefully leaked email can be found at http://www.scripting.com/disruption/ozzie/TheInternetServicesDisruptio.htm  It is clearly intended to be nothing but advertising -- i.e., its purpose as an objective "situation review" is questionable -- but it may be interesting as an insight into Microsoft's marketing strategy.

In late 05 Ray became the one of three people to hold the title of ChiefTechnicalOfficer at Microsoft. 

In 2006, he took on the role of Chief Software Architect, the position previously held by BillGates.

He was previously the head of GrooveNet before its acquisition in 05 by MS, and before that the architect of LotusNotes.

Ray is said to bring into MS expertise in internet and peer-to-peer collaboration.
