The Off By One Web Browser may be the world's smallest and fastest web browser with full HTML 3.2 support. It is a completely self-contained, stand-alone 1.1MB application with no dependencies on any other browser or browser component. For Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP. (Now with PNG image support)

Been using this one for many things, nearly since its beginning.

The .exe and the SSL .dll's can be quickly compacted using UPX (the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables). The current version after compacting comes in at around 393kb, and the combined SSL .dll's come in at around 345kb total. Note, that there is no need to download and install SSL, unless you have want or need.

This little browser, is extremely interesting, because of its size, speed, and also because of its ability to be used for private, track-less, Internet browsing. It becomes even more interesting when one uses frhed hex-editor to customize the program.

Save no record, no cookies or cookie record after program exit:

With a fresh un-compacted copy of "OB1.exe";

Open it with "Fr''''''Hed" (Hex''''''Editor) http://www.kibria.de/frhed.html[broken link] Use: http://frhed.sourceforge.net/en/

Find and carefully replace both occurrences of "Hpsw.cki" with"........". Make sure that you replace each occurrence with exactly 8 of the "."s (Or if you want to replace with 0's use <bh:00> for each.) It is important not to add or subtract from the total size of the .exe or it will become unstable, so simply highlight and then use replace function.

Save new customized version, then compact with UPX http://upx.sourceforge.net.

It is also interesting to edit the USER AGENT in the .exe in similar fashion.  For example, change the identifier from:
 "HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/4.7 (compatible; OffByOne; Windows X) Webster Pro V3.4"
to
 "HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/4.7"
or
 "HTTP_USER_AGENT=Internet Explorer"
or
 "HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mickey Mouse"
or anything that you wish.

There is a nice list of options included with this little browser that can be configured for very interesting and useful purposes.

It is a no-install program, so just put it in the directory you choose and run it. This little fellow can also be easily run from a little floppy or jump-drive (especially after compaction with UPX).

''It doesn't seem to allow saving of a Wiki page. Anyone know why?''

*Sure it does.  Just go to File, then "Save Current Page As", or "Save Page And Images".  Choose the directory where you want it, then choose the name you wish for the page and manually add the extension ".html" to the name of the page: ''i.e.'' Front''''''Page.html.  If you want the links to work, then you need to open the page in a text editor (notepad will do) and add the following line of code in the header someplace before the closing tag </head>: ''i.e.'' for our example above:
*<BASE href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FrontPage">
*Now save the changes, and the links will work.  I should point out that you will need to replace the BASE address with the address for the particular page that you save:
*<BASE href="(URL or address goes here)">
