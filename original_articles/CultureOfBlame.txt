Just curious: why is CultureOfBlame a better WikiName than BlameCulture?  Among other things, this reduces the usefulness of LikePages.

''Because "blame" is a noun and a verb.  BlameCulture can be read as a command to blame culture for something (a common practice among anthropologists, btw.)''

Well, "Culture of Blame" rolls off the tongue a little easier. Actually, there are a lot of Wiki pages with names that are more natural sounding than easy to index.
