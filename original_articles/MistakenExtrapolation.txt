Not all properties of an object can be extrapolated to an arbitrarily chosen superset. If something is extrapolated beyond its scope, it's a mistaken extrapolation.

''Don't you mean generalisation, rather than extrapolation?'' 
* ''Extrapolation is extending some series of measurements into an area not yet measured.'' 
* ''Generalisation is applying something from a specific area to a wider area - which fits your definition above)''

There are two sides to this coin:
* Fear of extrapolation (SlipperySlope)
* Demanding extrapolation (OneThingAllThings)
