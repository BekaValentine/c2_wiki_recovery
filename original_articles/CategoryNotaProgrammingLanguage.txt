Category for things which are not a programming language although seeming to be.

* C/C++ (CeeCeePlusPlus) is one example.
* CeePlusPlusMinusMinus or CeePlusPlusMinusMinusPlus as alternative names for JavaLanguage.
* SmalltalkMinusMinus as an alternative name for ObjectiveCee or JavaLanguage.
* DeeFlat as alternative for CeeSharp

Any others?
