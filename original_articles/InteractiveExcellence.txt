[ISBN 0345423712] In this essay length contribution to Ballantine's ''Library of Contemporary Thought'' Schlossberg describes how audiences define standards, and how this process varies between cultures and over time. Schlossberg's own work in museum design has paid attention to interactions between visitors as well as with the exhibits. He is clearly excited by the possibilities provided by the internet, so long as it doesn't follow too closely the example set by broadcasting.
