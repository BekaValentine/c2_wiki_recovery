What is the real BrainLanguage ? For instance an fMRI study in speech production identifies areas of brain activity but is there a simple way to encode these sequences? A formalism to describe sequences of firing in the different areas? Seems first one needs to understand the labelling of areas. The real BrainMapping. Not at the Neuronal level initially, since fMRI is currently only at a 100,000 neuron resolution per pixel, but for instance BA 19 and BA 22 in 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11192634&dopt=Abstract
Something like BA19(1 mSec)=>BA12(0.2 mSec)=>...
I am not saying that is the sequence implied in the paper, but I am trying to visualize something like it - I just fired BA20(0.3 mSec)=>BA21(0.5 mSec)=>... to see it in my mind's eye :-). Seems it is a dance of patterns, almost could use something like LabaNotation. Whatever.
