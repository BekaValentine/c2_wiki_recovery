[ISBN 0-932633-29-3] This is the book to reach for when you are in a hurry and need a sample data model as a starting point. There are dozens of cleanly drawn, well explained data models from a number of industries and problem domains, from asset management to theatrical production to contracts to revenue and receipts. Plus a discussion of recurring patterns (though not in the PatternLanguage sense) and structures in data modeling.

The book might well have saved me a week of work on my last big project. -- DaveSmith (12Feb97)

(The use of ''Patterns'' in the title is simply a coincidence, since the author was not aware of the pattern community until after the book came out.)
------
I don't think it is a coincidence.  "Patterns" is a great word to describe what is in the book.  Sure, he doesn't
clearly specify the problem that each pattern solves. But what is important to me is that these patterns clearly come from experience.  They describe real systems. The fact that he decided to use the word "patterns" even though he never came to PLoP just shows that the word is pretty natural. --RalphJohnson
