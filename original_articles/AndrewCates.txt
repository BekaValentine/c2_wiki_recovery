Andrew Cates is getting the hang of Wikis around the place.

My real homepage is here http://www.catesfamily.org.uk/ and I've written a book on the meaning of life here: http://www.catesfamily.org.uk/letter-to-peter/ there are some maths problems http://www.catesfamily.org.uk/maths-corner.html there too which I might bring here when I've got the time. My email is andrew at homepage without the www.

I live in Cambridge UK and work for this http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/children-charity.htm and am especially concerned about the Aids Africa orphans: http://aids-children.org

My best friend is DuncanHarris. But I note he only says in return that he knows me! However, he's a nice guy even if he disowns me.

* He says that after that infamous incident in the pub, even going this far was pretty big of him.

I think Wiki is very interesting and although I am most interested in the evolution of ideas and rules, and the principles of Wiki in general than in programming history (but I am a mathematician and kind of program badly). I think I'll stick a wiki up somewhere soon.

I started a brief discuss on the nature of belief systems and how they evolve but it is too difficult to know where to start so I've given up on that one. But I am still a studier of beliefs and cultures :o)

Also I own MazeWiki

I am looking into the wbl issues and forming a view.

Hello Andrew, you left a note on RolandKaufmann.  I do not recall meeting you, although we might have had some e-mail contact.
Would you like to discuss MathQuizOne Q3? Happy Easter, Roland.
