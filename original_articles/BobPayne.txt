I am a computer/methodology consultant working out of DC.  I have participated in XP as Coach, Coder and trainer.  

I have particular interests in Python, Zope and XP.

I'll be adding more bio later.
----
I would be glad to help coordinate XP meetings in DC.  I know of space for the meetings and would be happy to host the meetings.  If you are interested please let me know.
