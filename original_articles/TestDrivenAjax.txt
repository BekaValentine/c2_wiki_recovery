* "Test Driven Ajax (on Rails)"

The paper shows how to write an Ajax website using these new assertions:

* assert_xml  - check that HTML is XHTML and parsable
* assert_xpath - parse XHTML and extract specific details
* assert_js     - parse JavaScript (without Regexp!) for details
* assert_ajax - run assertions when an Ajax command completes

The paper shows how to grow a test runner in a web page. It tests a target 
website inside an IFRAME.
