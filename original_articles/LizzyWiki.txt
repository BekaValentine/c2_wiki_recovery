'''Lizzy Wiki''' (formerly known as YetAnotherWikiClone) is a wiki clone  based on the original WardCunningham implementation. It is co-developped by AlainDesilets, HakanErdogmus, MartaStojanovic and PatrickPaul of the NationalResearchCouncilOfCanada.

The goal of the project is twofold:

* produce a minimal wiki that is usable by non-technical people, and in particular, primary school children.
* produce a wiki that can facilitate the creation and maintenance of MultilingualWikis.

While both these goal are still a long ways, we have been able to use Lizzy Wiki in the context of  Grade 4-6 classes involved in CollaborativeWebBasedStoryTelling. We also have a prototype system for  multilingual wiki sites, which we are using internally and will soon test in external production settings.
