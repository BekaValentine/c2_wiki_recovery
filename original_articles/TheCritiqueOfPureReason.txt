Magnum Opus of ImmanuelKant. A work attempting to describe the limits of reason. Kant was an adherent of GottfriedWilhelmLeibniz until he read DavidHume, whose work, he said, "woke me from my dogmatic slumber."

BertrandRussell alleged that Kant, on being awoken from his dogmatic slumber by DavidHume, proceeded to produce clouds of philosophical fog until there was enough to allow him to sleep again. (I think he expressed it more elegantly.)
