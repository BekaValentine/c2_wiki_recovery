"Knock Corel all you want to, but they showed some of us just how good Linux could be for the end user. The installation could not have been any easier or clearer. There were simple choices to wipe out the hard drive and start fresh, use free disk space and install on a DOS and Windows partition without erasing any of the data. Advanced Linux users could edit their own partition tables if they chose. Right off the bat, Windows users could understand that Corel Linux would co-exist peacefully."

The installation did not work on my computer. Granted, it was an old machine(P100), but is that really an excuse, since I can get every other distro on?

In 2014, Linux installation difficulties are mostly a thing of the past. Dual-booting is also on the decline, VirtualBox or a similar solution seems to be more popular for people who need to run both Windows and Linux.
