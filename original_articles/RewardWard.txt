How can we reward WardCunningham, in a tangible way, for all his gifts to the development community? (CrcCard, DesignPatterns, ExtremeProgramming, WikiWeb, FrameworkForIntegratedTest, a role model for generosity and HumbleBrilliance, etc.)  While listening to WardsOopslaKeynote at OopslaOhFour, I wanted to hand him $100K or $1M, for his contributions to date.  Unfortunately, I don't have it.  But if enough people chip in, it's very possible.  He probably doesn't need the money, but I doubt it would hurt.  And, it may allow him to seed even more innovations.  It is an investment that we could make, based on a great track record. -- KelleyHarris

* An annual campaign to raise money to pay for the wiki connection. (PayForCtwoServer)
* A non-profit site for book purchases via Amazon.com's Associate program, yielding ~ 10.5% per purchase. Give the money to Ward.
* Set up an escrow account or non-profit and everybody chip in some money.
* Ask SocialText to give Ward a chunk of cash and stock because: it's right, it's good PR, it might inspire him to give them some suggestions that would make them even more money.
* Ask Jot to give Ward a chunk of cash and stock because: it's right, it's good PR, it might inspire him to give them some suggestions that would make them even more money.
* Solicit corporate gifts.
* Solicit non-profit contributions.

I would suppose that making meaningful contributions to the wiki would suffice to RewardWard.

Understood, but wishing Ward additional rewards, and a budget to do more good stuff.

'''Logistics:'''

What's the best way to do this to protect everyone legally and minimize Ward's taxes?  As minimal first step, direct checks to Ward seem OK. Then maybe a simple escrow account could accumlate them and send him one bigger check.  Any suggestions from someone that's done non-profit fund raising, etc.?
