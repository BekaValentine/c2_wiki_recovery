ThoughtsWeaver (q.v.) is an extension of the WikiWikiWeb,
which is used inside AT&T.
This page describes some of the differences between
ThoughtsWeaver and the WikiWikiWeb.

'''Line Escape''':  Sometimes, we want bullet lists
to continue through several lines of output. WikiWikiWeb
currently requires all of a bullet list item to be on a
single line.  That makes the source difficult to edit.
Therefore:  Allow escaped newlines in the UN*X tradition.
A backslash at the end of the line causes the next line
to be joined to the end of the current line, separated by
whitespace.

'''HTML Escape''':  Sometimes, you'd like to use an
HTML feature in WikiWiki ''just this once''.
You don't want to institutionalize every HTML facility
in a high-level WikiWiki equivalent.
On the other hand, you like to have an escape hatch
when you really, really need it.
One major addition to ThoughtsWeaver is an "expert user feature" that allows
the author to insert raw text--including HTML--that makes
it all the way to the renderer.  Therefore:
Individual text lines (lines as they appear in the EditText
form) can be designated as ''literal lines''.
An escape character (currently a vertical bar) must
appear at the beginning of a literal line.
I find that I use the feature rarely, but it's nice to have it.

'''Read-Only Flag''':  Inexpert users get in trouble when editing literal lines.
There are also some pages that contain information on which
all users depend, and many of these pages contain policy
information which users should not want or need to change.
However, some of these pages--like RecentChanges--are updated
by "magic tools" on a periodic basis.
These pages could be protected using UN*X file system modes,
but that would make the automatic updates clumsy.
Therefore:  the database contains flags for each page
that control whether the page can be edited.  The flag
is part of the page itself, whose rendering
is controlled by the Translator
(see MoreAboutTheTranslator).

What happens when there are errors on read-only pages?  How do users know who to contact to change them?  Also, who have permissions to set read-only flags?  -- ChuckSmith

'''Read-Only Info Link''':  Users shouldn't worry about the flags for a page unless
they want to do something to the page that relates to the
flags.  We could slap the user every time the user selected
EditText for a Readonly page, but that would rightly frustrate
the user.
We could add a "Readonly" annotation, but that would confuse
the semantics of the EditText button.
Therefore:  replace the EditText line with a ProtectedPage
line which, when selected, describes protected pages.
Users will find out about protected pages when they
take actions analogous to editing.

'''Cross-Instances References:''' We have several ThoughtsWeaver
instances running. One can cross-reference between these instances
(or between ThoughtsWeaver and WikiWiki) using a time-honored
notation:  this page might be WikiWiki!ThoughtsWeaverAdditions,
while I could as well refer to OrgPatterns!RecentChanges as
distinct from WikiWiki!RecentChanges or NatureOfOrder!RecentChanges.

'''PageChangeNotification:'''
Some users are particularly interested in following threads
that are anchored on TopicalStartingPoint pages within the
WikiWiki instance.  There are many such pages in a single
instance. RecentChanges flags modifications to these pages,
but it's sometimes awkward to rely on RecentChanges to
keep up-to-date.  You need to poll RecentChanges as often
as you want to keep up with the most pressing issues;
that can add up to a lot of RecentChanges page visits per
day.  Also, you may be interested in changes on several
different WikiWiki instances (we have about a half dozen
active instances here at Bell Labs), and that's a lot of
pages to search.  And it's hard to pick out your favorite
pages from the RecentChanges list.
Therefore:  provide for centralized and/or asynchronous
notification.  Each user can RegisterInterest in one or
more pages.  You can tell ThoughtsWeaver to post the change
at the bottom of another page, or you can tell it to send
mail to a specific recipient.  When the page changes,
ThoughtsWeaver honors the notification request, either appending
a notification message at the bottom of the indicated page,
or sending mail to the notifiant, or both, as requested.
As a result, you can set up topical RecentChanges pages
that mirror TopicalStartingPoint pages.
Both these pages are
owned by the community as a whole, but take on de facto
shepherds.

This sounds really cool. Is there someone that I could take a look at it in action, or pull down a copy to run?
