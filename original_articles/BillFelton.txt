A very good guy to work with.  Formerly of KSC, GemStone, and (briefly) JumpStart, Bill is now on his own at Gryfon Technologies. He's an excellent teacher and object designer. He's an accomplished musician (a single of his electronica once hit the top-40 in the Czech republic, believe it or not) and an avid RC modeler.

Thanks, Kyle!
I've updated the cv to include the stint at GemStone.
As to the emusic, it was actually an obscure Italian release...
My own home page is at http://www.gryfon.com
I'm now doing Systems Architecture at US West in Minneapolis.  This experience has confirmed my belief that everything is objects.  The same sort of levels of granularity that we find in object composition (going, say, from Integers to Points to Rectangles to Canvases to Window Specs to Windows) applies universally.  Learning to do object decomposition and recomposition provides a solid basis for design and architecture at any level of granularity or abstraction.
