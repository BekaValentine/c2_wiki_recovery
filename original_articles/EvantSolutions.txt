Evant <http://www.evant.com>, based in San Francisco, is developing a software product delivered over the Web through an ActiveServerPages model. Our development environment is server side Java, XML and Linux. Our development process is pure ExtremeProgramming.

In the past we have been coached by KentBeck and RobMee.  Some consultants who have helped out (i.e. programmed) on this project include EricEvans, JoshuaKerievsky and BennySadeh.
