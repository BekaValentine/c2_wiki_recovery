This patterns study group was founded in late 2001 by TimKemper in Boulder, Colorado. The initial focus is to meet to discuss DesignPatterns in ObjectOrientedProgramming. This WikiPage is the home for the group, so feel free to edit this page or link your own HomePage or other WikiPage''''''s.  

The meetings are currently organized by RobJudd and SarahSmith. I (Rob) hope to teach a class on DesignPatterns in ObjectOrientedProgramming in the near future at the University of Denver. If you would like more information on the course, then please see my Wiki page for contact information.

We started by studying ''DesignPatternsExplained'' by AlanShalloway and James Trott and then moved on to read through the GangOfFour and ''PatternOrientedSoftwareArchitectureOne'' by Buschmann et al. We are currently discussing MartinFowler's ''PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture.''

Please see http://www.boulderpatternsgroup.org/cgi/wiki?BoulderPatternsGroup for meeting information.

See BoulderPatternsGroupMeetings for directions to the meeting.
