I much prefer the open plains of XP than the cosy cubicle of earlier dilbert days.  I would never want to work without XP again, its that simple.


I recently did a Masters in Computing and became very involved using Neural Networks to solve problems.  I couldn't get them to solve all my problems but luckily I did have some success applying this to the task of Speaker Recognition.

I am now working for KnowledgeManagementSoftware on a large EJB project.

My main hobby is drumming and somewhere along the line I got sidetracked from being a popstar to a programmer.
