I'm into AnalyzingWiki. I just don't look a lot at the contents, but at the activities.

It seems the huge majority of the people who make an edit just make one edit.
Finally, I've got all into a block_graphics.
When I make both the x_axis and the y_axis use a logarithmic scale, I just see a straight line, going down, with a small hump at the end - something like this:
 |\ 
 | \ 
 |  \	  y-axis = log(number of people)
 |   \	  x-axis = log(number of pages)
 |    \ 
 |     \/\	

(see also end of page, if luck is on)
  
So the graphics show how many people edited how many pages.

I think this graphics show a general rule. For instance in all kind of sports.
 Most people aren't involved at all.
 A lot of people are involved a little.
 Some people are involved a lot. 
 Only very few people are involved a real lot
I figure when you study how many people are involved in a sport, and you measure the time they spent in this sport and put these two values in a loglog graphic, it will generate a straight line. 

This is contrary to a normal distribution, well maybe someone can explain this some day later. ''Why would you expect a normal distribution in the first place?''

About the lump: The most active people also do a lot of small edits. The people in this lump are the real community. The lump causes the self-repairing activity.

'''Q''' ''How do you know that "the lump causes the self-repairing activity"? How do you know that "the people in this lump are the real community"?''

'''A''' Well I do not "know" this, I think this, so this is my interpretation. If I look at the contents of the data it also seems this way. The data is all Changes''''''In<Months> and RecentEdits, so you can check it out yourself too. 


Another interpretation:  Still, this huge mass of people who just pass by and aren't involved are needed, to generate a small community. So this huge mass of people is the backbone. If you look around to other WikiWiki''''''s you will find a lot with just occasional edits, and those WikiWiki''''''s are mere guestbooks. Those WikiWiki''''''s are not really alive.

A straight line on a log-log plot means log ''y'' = ''A'' log ''x'' + ''B'', which means ''y'' = ''C'' ''x''^''k''. In this case, it looke as if ''k'' is close to -1, which would suggest an instance of ZipfsLaw.(http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ZipfsLaw.html )

Well, the line hits the X_axis at ''about'' log(400) and it hits the Y_axis at ''about'' log(2000). ''('' ''about'' = a citation from my  memory'')''.
