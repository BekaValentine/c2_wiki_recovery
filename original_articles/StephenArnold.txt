I am a self-acknowledged Linux evangelist (nut?).  I was surfing the web for info on PG-SQL, php3, and such like, and ran across this page.  Seems pretty weird if you ask me.  Maybe I'll figure out its purpose after I ponder it for a while.

For those who haven't experienced the true joy of personal computing (ie, deleting your windows partition and installing some flavor of GNU/Linux), here is a tip.

Computers are NOT supposed to crash a few times each day.  Applications and operating systems are NOT supposed to behave differently from one day to the next.  If you don't believe me, try Linux.  You'll be glad you did.
