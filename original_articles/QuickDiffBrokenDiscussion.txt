QuickDiff has now been broken for a number of weeks. There is a page PleaseMendQuickDiff which has been created to ask please for it to be restored. As far as can be sorted out by trial and error, the script which used to be QuickDiff is either broken or missing.

QuickDiff is a very useful tool for any WikiGnome attempting to sort out the difference between useful edits and ones which need to be reverted quickly to keep things here on an even keel. Only someone with access to the actual wiki system is able to find out what is wrong with QuickDiff and put it back in order.

The reason for this discussion is the lack of response there has been to PleaseMendQuickDiff. Usually things like this get fixed reasonably quickly. Is there some reason why this has not been fixed? 

''Have you asked WardCunningham?  These days, he appears not to monitor WardsWiki and very rarely posts on it.  It's possible he doesn't know QuickDiff is broken.''

An email to WardCunningham has done the trick and QuickDiffIsMendedNow - see WikiWikiSystemNotice
