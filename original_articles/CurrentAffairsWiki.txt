One of the WikisIdLikeToEdit.

A lot of the stuff that appears here and gets deleted concerns the affairs of the day. Yes, GeorgeBush and all those nutty things that just seem to happen to him. If you're thinking of setting up a SisterSite but don't know what kind of focus would gather content, I dare say that a CurrentAffairsWiki would grow quick and hot.

But it'd be a very good idea not to enable PageDeletion there ...

If you want to discuss current events wiki-style, as they seem OffTopic for C2, perhaps these sites would be more appropriate:

* http://grault.net/adjunct/
* http://wikinews.org/
* ... probably others I've forgotten.
