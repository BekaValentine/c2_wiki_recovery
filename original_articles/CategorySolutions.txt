* ''Guides that lead you tiny step by tiny step only give you someone else's solution. It is often better to have a discussion of the problem, understand the big ideas involved, and quickly learn some of the "gotchas" that aren't obvious from first principles.'' -- LearningByTryingSolutions
* ''The Context-Driven School of software testing (http://www.context-driven-testing.com) eschews the notion of BestSolutions or BestPractice''''''s; these terms are simply meaningless, an attempt by people with various axes to grind to pretend that they have the One True Way to do things.'' -- BestSolutions
* ''By allowing someone to seek their own solutions, you foster independent thinking and job satisfaction, and you treat people like thinking humans instead of a robots.'' -- AssignProblemsNotTasks

EditHint: I find this title a bit general and vague. Half of all topics at least are about (attempted) solutions. If it's in the context of a given methodology, then that methodology should be part of the title.

''That's what you do in naming pages within a category. A Category is meant to be general and shaped so as to become a grouping mechanism. Pages within the category can specify something of the context, methodology and results in their title.''  -- DonaldNoyes 20080123

Usually if a topic name covers 50% of all topics, it needs to be refined or split. I see no reason why this topic should be an exception to this useful rule of thumb.
