'''Notes to 2nd edition'''

An introduction to using the various standard libraries which come with the PythonLanguage. ''Not'' the Python equivalent of ProgrammingPerl. Whereas the CamelBook serves as a tutorial, reference, guide, and sourcebook for the PerlLanguage, ProgrammingPython assumes familiarity with Python and jumps straight into examples of library usage.

'''Notes to 3rd edition'''

There is a section on the use of the ZopeApplicationServer and PloNe. There is also a section on various ways of interfacing CeeLanguage and CeePlusPlus code to PythonLanguage, including the SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator (SWIG).
