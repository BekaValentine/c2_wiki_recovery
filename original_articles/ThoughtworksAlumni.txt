''Joshu asked Nansen: "What is the path?"''

''Nansen said: "Everyday life is the path."''

''Joshu asked: "Can it be studied?"''

''Nansen said: "If you try to study, you will be far away from it."''

''Joshu asked: "If I do not study, how can I know it is the path?"''

''Nansen said: "The path does not belong to the perception world, neither does it belong to the nonperception world. Cognition is a delusion and noncognition is senseless. If you want to reach the true path beyond doubt, place yourself in the same freedom as sky. You name it neither good nor not-good."''

''At these words Joshu was enlightened.''

Who knew that Fridtjof Nansen was a Zen master along with an Antarctic explorer?

Does anyone work there for more than a year?  ''Yes, almost everyone''

2004-5 was a watershed year for senior hands-on people leaving. London lost most of its senior technical people during that time frame.
