I'm a web developer working in the south of England (Brighton).

I originally found this site by chasing bits of the XP controversy, but I'm also in the process of evaluating systems like this for our "intranet", which is currently in the pre-embryonic vague-concept phase.

Maybe I'll add more stuff here later... anyone actually read these pages? [''Yes''!]

BLUNT, That's right, I said blunt.....
