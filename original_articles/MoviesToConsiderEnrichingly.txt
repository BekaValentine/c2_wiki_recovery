'''Inspirational:'''
	* '''A Million to Juan''' - BeliefsCreateReality couched in much more plebian scenarios.
	* '''AmelieMovie''' - As close to a perfect movie as I've seen in a long while. Manages wit and intelligence and avoids cheese.
		* ''Any similarity between this skillfully trite apologia (to America for boring mental European movies) and the TeeVee show Ally McBeal must be just a shocking coincidence...''
	* '''AmericanBeauty''' - like TheGraduate, this film captures the feel and the conflicts of its time
		* Also like TheGraduate, it ends without any real answer to the issues of its time.  Unlike TheGraduate, it seems to be in denial about its lack of answer.  -- DavidSaff's opinion
	* '''ApolloThirteen''' - we 21st century engineers have a hell of an act to follow

	* '''OctoberSky''' ( october 5, 1957 sputnik)
	* '''RunLolaRun''':  Not sure if that movie fits in this category.  But this movie does not really fit in any category, except maybe VideoClip.  A fast german movie about Lola running.  Unfortunately, the synchronization in the english DVD is awful.  Watch with subtitles!
	* '''SecondhandLions'''
