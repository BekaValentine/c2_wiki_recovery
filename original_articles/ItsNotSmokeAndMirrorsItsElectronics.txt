One of the things we can lose track of is the basis of our technologies. While some speak of programming as if it were "Magic", and the magicians as if they are "casting spells", what is really happening is made possible by "electronics". The ones and zeros we look at as basic building blocks are really voltages in elaborate electronic circuits. The "computerRevolution" is really an extension of the "electronicRevolution" which began, perhaps in earnest, in the early part of the last century. 

We might just stand back and take stock in how different things are today, from what they were oneHundredYearsAgo, in 1908. Or even from what they were just tenYearsAgo, in 1998.
