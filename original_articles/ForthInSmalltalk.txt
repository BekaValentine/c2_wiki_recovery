''Ahh, Forth.''  

It must have been ten years ago that I tried
to explain the essence of Smalltalk to my brother, a Forth            
programmer.  We found common ground by programming -- one day in   
Forth, another in Smalltalk.  In Forth we wrote the essential
Smalltalk: object identity and method dispatch; in Smalltalk
we wrote the essential Forth: dictionary, words and builds-does.
We both showed off our respective environments with great skill,
pride and confidence.  Oh, if only all programming could be
so educational. -- WardCunningham
