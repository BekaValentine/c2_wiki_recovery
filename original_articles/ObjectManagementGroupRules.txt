The ObjectManagementGroup has a rule about standards:

A document doesn't get issued as a standard unless at least one company bigwig will sign a Letter of Intent making a public commitment to implement the standard in a real product.  If no such product appears within one year, the standard is withdrawn.  ''No exceptions.''

Interesting. Was this rule in force when the first version of the CORBA standard came out? Could it be why the early ORBs were found wanting in quality and interoperability? -- StevenNewton
