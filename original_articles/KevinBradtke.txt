A devote believer in open systems and architectures.  Kevin has been 
working with object technologies since 1992, using Smalltalk and C++, 
and has experience in Object Analysis and Object Design ranging from 
application infrastructures, to business domain spaces.  

The VcapsProject has made Kevin a staunch supporter of 
ExtremeProgramming as the methodologies fit so nicely with his own 
personal beliefs for software development (LiterateProgramming, PairProgramming, DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork, RelentlessTesting, ModelFirst, 
RefactorMercilessly, EmbraceChange).
