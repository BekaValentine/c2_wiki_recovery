Bridging The Gap is a phrase which is used to note that getting from point A to point B requires some kind of shift in pick-one (or more): priority, perspective, location, focus ... language, knowledge model, requirements, representation 

Examples:
* The facade pattern 
* The WaterfallModel there is a tendency to find a gap between each phase.  
**This seems almost an indicator that there is something wrong with the process.  A good process shouldn't have 'gaps' of this kind.
* The topic of SoftwareArchitecture and DesignPatterns is part of the process of BridgingTheGap between Requirements and Design.

Would it be true to say that a really good process doesn't have gaps?
* Or are we simply looking at the philosophical problem that between any two states one can always make a distinction however fine until one gets to the level of the atomic -- is the universe of discourse quantized or a continuum? -- RaySchneider

The physical world is largely "quantized" yet we perceive much of it to be continuous because the quanta are at such a small scale. I would say that a really good process ''feels'' like it has no (maybe few?) gaps. That's why I like the really immediate feedback of fine-grained unit tests.
It ''feels'' like a flow. --KielHodges
