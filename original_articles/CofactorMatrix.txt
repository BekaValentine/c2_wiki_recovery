Suppose we have an n-by-n matrix M, where m(ij) is the value at the i'th row and j'th column. Then the cofactor matrix MC is found by calculating each of its values MC(ij) as MC(ij) = -1^(i+j) * det(M(ij)), where det() is the determinant function (see MatrixDeterminant) and M(ij) is the (n-1)-by-(n-1) matrix formed by deleting the i'th row and j'th column of M. I '''think''' I got all of that right. -- KarlKnechtel

Reminds me of a comment I made about TheMatrix... http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=66105&cid=6088811
