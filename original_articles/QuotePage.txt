'''QuotePage QuickQuestions'''

'''Q''' Anyone able to identify the quote similar to "the entirety of human wisdom lie in perseverance and hope'''? I think it is from "Count of MonteCristo", but where and what are the exact words?

'''A''' "Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget that until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope.'" -- Alexander Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo

'''Q''' Is this kind of organization really helping readers? Can't we find a more meaningful way to subdivide all the quotes we have here? (See also: DontMakePartTwo)

'''A''' Perhaps; sometimes, though, it's a joy just to browse through a collection of unsorted quotes.  I for one feel the practice encourages 'enlightenment by accident'. (serendipity?)

'''Q''' I'm looking for the author and correct text of "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers."  I'm thinking it might be either C. A. R. Hoare or John von Neumann. -- dfw-gate5.raytheon.com

'''A''' Dropping the phrase into Google immediately gives RichardWesleyHamming.  
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming
In fact, 11 of the first 20 results from Google actually give Hamming's name in the snippet quoted.
