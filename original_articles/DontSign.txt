Why are you signing your name here? It only makes you a target and gives nitwits a chance to vilify you and autodelete you. If you want to sign, go some place with security. There ain't none here and complaining about it just makes more noise.

I agree completely, using a name just makes you a target for rebuttals! -- LayneThomas (IronyOnPurpose)

On the other hand, nobody cares or believes what an anonymous person says. -- AnonymousOnPurpose

Nonsense. This page is redundant, the issues were already beaten to death and that's why we have WikiSignature. 

Inspite the wiki insecurity we still know each other by writing style (or lack thereof) and IP addresses. In particular I am thankful to people who collaborated with me on technical content and signed their name on their contributions, please continue to do it as it greatly helps our interaction. --CostinCozianu

True. . . it probably isn't hard to recognize me by my excessive use of trailing periods (and things in parenthesis). . . or my IP address. . . Or when I fix my typos from before. . .
