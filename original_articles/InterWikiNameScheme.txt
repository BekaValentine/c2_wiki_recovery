Since this original proposal was made (2001), the rest of the WorldWideWiki has standardized on the syntax "prefix:WikiWord".  Each wiki then defines an InterWikiMap which translates prefixes to a suitable URL (such as "c2 -> http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?")

'''Proposed Scheme:'''

	1. All InterWiki pages would take the form MyCategory.MyPageName. 
	2. RecentChanges would bee customized by using a URL of the form: http//interwikiserver?recentchanges=category1?category2?category3 ...
	3. Anyone could create a new category - Not a matter of voting. Not in the WikiNature ...

Does this imply that MyCategory=MyServer? My real question is how do we move toward supporting multiple Wikis or NameSpaces being run from a single server? 

Why do this? ''To serve separate audiences, create tighter RecentChanges and FindPages lists, etc.)... -- BillSeitz

''Running WikiClusters (as I call them) is a separate issue - Implemented in LeufNetWiki. The latest iteration of this design has most of the script in a shared wiki.lib script. Accessing a particular wiki with a specific name fires up a short script stub. This defines/creates the page folder location based on the name and other unique parameters, and then hands off to subs in the library code. I did this lib thing mainly to keep core updates and extensions to a single common file. -- BoLeuf''

Aren't there two separate issues here?
	* How to identify a wiki server?
	* How to identify a unique page within a wiki?
Shouldn't we use some kind of URI-based scheme for these issues?
