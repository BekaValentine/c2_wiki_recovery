Having met WardCunningham at the O'Reilly P2P Conference (see http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/conference/) in San Francisco, he encouraged me to drop over and create myself a page on the Wiki. 

I'm the editor of XML.com http://xml.com/ and XMLhack.com http://xmlhack.com/.
I have a keen interest in Web writing tools, and I also run WriteTheWeb http://writetheweb.com/.
