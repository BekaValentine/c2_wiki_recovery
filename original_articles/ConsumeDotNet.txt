Consume is "a collaborative strategy for the self provision of a broadband telecommunications infrastructure". Or, in other words, a community WLAN. The project is working together to build clusters of interconnecting 'nodes' using widely available networking products and optimising existing local services where possible to re-distribute network access and free the exchange of information further. Traditional wired and wireless techniques are being used to make links and a fresh and open attitude has been adopted toward sharing of information and resources. It's based in LondonTown, England.
