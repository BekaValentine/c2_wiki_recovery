TwoTouchVoting using the WikiBallotBox is proposed for all future Wiki ballots. Three types of ballot currently being considered are:

	* WikiSingleVote
	* WikiMultipleVote
	* WikiWeightedVote

In each case, the responsibility of the voter is simply to enter his or her vote as a single character in one or more boxes. At decent intervals, official WikiBallotBox emptiers will come along (or failing them any GoodWikiCitizen) and total/summarize the current votes cast in each box, writing the result to the right of each box, in whatever notation takes their fancy.

These instructions supersede the pioneering debate in WikiGreatFoobarLists, unless you ViolentlyDisagree - see WikiBulletOrBallot.

'''Example uses'''

	* HardCorePlatonists - experimental, somewhat tongue in cheek WikiWeightedVote
	* RavioliWiki - only slightly more serious WikiWeightedVote. Note that without explanation of TwoTouchVoting somebody assumed CumulativeVoting. Maybe they were right.
	* RefactoringWithoutBias - WikiSingleVote on a refactoring decision that didn't in fact lead to a clear decision for some weeks, until noticed again today ...
	* WikiProposals - most successful (in the sense of numbers of votes cast being in double figures) and controversial WikiWeightedVote so far. See WikiVotingDiscussion.
