LionWiki is a minimalist Wiki engine. It is extensible, templatable, file based (it doesn't need database like MySQL) and requires just one file to properly function. It is suitable for small sites, personal notebooks or journals. LionWiki is fork from french-only WiKiss (and therefore TigerWiki too).

Feature set is purposely limited to maintain the biggest advantages over other Wiki engines - small size and simplicity to install and use.

LionWiki provides essential Wiki functionality like Wiki syntax, page history, last changes, renaming pages, password protection (both read and write) and other functions.

Further functionality is provided by plugins, e.g. powerful table syntax, RSS feed with page changes or spam filtering Captcha. Complete set of features can be found in Installation and configuration.

On the other way, LionWiki doesn't (and probably never will) support users, namespaces, categories and other more advanced features.

Another derivative work is WiKissMe, of WiKiss this time, a modified version - that's why the Me in the end, also influenced a little by TigerWiki. It is written in PHP, requires version 5. It has flexible plugins and modules architecture featuring blog, comments, captcha and others. Supports themes with templates as well.
