Can anybody recommend a better file browser for Windows? Windows Explorer is annoying, and I'd like some customizing. Possible features:

* Separation of folders from content in the main panel: 3 total panels instead of 2, one vertical and two horizontal (at least for default layout).
* Scripting control in a "familiar-acting" language, like C, JavaScript, or heck even BASIC?
* Folder-specific settings (MS's seems to randomly forget them every gibbous moon or something)
* Tree inheritance of above folder settings
* Custom tool-bar buttons and short-cut key mapping (map to both built-in options and scripts)
* Knows how to "read" and use the Windows association lists
* Non-stupid text and content searching/filtering (MS not friendly to non MS products)
* Works on Linux also
