In one of the finest pieces of mind control and spin-doctoring I have ever seen, the governments leading the invasion of Iraq managed to turn a public overwhelmingly against the war into a passive consenters. How? By starting the war, and then saying "It's too late to object now."

'''Hey!''' Of ''course'' I support our troops! That's why I want them brought home now.
