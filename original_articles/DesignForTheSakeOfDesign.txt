An AntiPattern of design in general, where you make things in a way just for the design to be beautiful, but forgetting that they must be useful and doable in finite time. More than one project has suffered a SlowDeath from a beautiful design. DesignForTheSakeOfDesign can also contribute to JobSecurity.

This AntiPattern is very notable in GraphicalUserInterface''''''s. Take a look at the User Interface Hall of Shame (http://www.rha.com/ui_hall_of_shame.htm ''[BrokenLink 2006-07-12]'') and the InterfaceHallOfShame for some horrendous examples of this AntiPattern in action.

MacromediaFlash is also heavily involved with this AntiPattern - see WhatsWrongWithFlash.
