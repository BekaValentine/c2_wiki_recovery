The Symbolics Lisp Machine, from its introductory model (the LM-2, based on the MIT CADR), was a line of computers geared specifically toward running Lisp code efficiently. Like other Lisp machines, nearly all of the code was a dialect of Lisp, including all applications, operating system code, and even microcode at its most basic. Unlike other Lisp machines of its day, the Symbolics line was commercially available as a home computing workstation from Symbolics, Inc., which made it essentially the first of its kind. Likewise, all hardware was designed for high-performance computing by the Genera operating system, rather than being previous hardware to which a Lisp operating system had been ported.
