A terrific Java developer who works for Delphi Consultants in the Dallas area.
(Unless, of course, some other "Greg Vaughn" has coincidentally started 
contributing to the WikiWeb just two weeks after I first mentioned it to the
Greg Vaughn I know.)

No coincidence. However, I have run into quite a few other GregVaughn(s) on the Internet. I don't know how many emails I get from people who think I am the baseball player
