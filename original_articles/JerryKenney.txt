Jerry Kenney is a student of English who is fascinated by the idea of Pattern Language as it applies to human language, reading, and literature ... all forms of patterns.  In The Timeless Way of Building, Alexander talks about how children invent language by abstracting rules from the patterns of speech they hear (338-9).  I am curious where Alexander got this particular notion and if anyone is doing work in this field.  I'd appreciate a note mailto:gmkenney@mindspring.com from anyone who knows of research or work being done in patterns of human language.
