GoogleSearch can also be used as a calculator that can interpret some fairly free-form expressions. For example, search for:

* 2 + 2
* two plus nine 
* square root of eighty-one
* 3^27
* 30 metres in inches
* eight thousand square millimeters divided by 4 in hectares

Which is pretty handy; it's better than most physical calculators out there. - EssKay
