I've viewed Wiki a number of times, but have never posted until just today.

It is quite an interesting tool.  

I'm a Windows and web developer, looking to make the leap to non-MS programming.

I've got a bit of experience in C/C++, Java, VB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, DOM, and the usual accompanying suspects.

I've got a web site (http://dunck.us/) which isn't much yet, but I hope to do more with it.  

There are never enough hours in the day, and that particular ambition falls toward the bottom of my list.
