OEP -- Object Engineering Process.
 
A Methodology which borrows from XP and RUP, using TimeBoxing and TimePacing [a-la XP Iteration] and stories, i.e. an iterative and incremental development cycle. It makes a couple assumptions: architecture is assumed to be 3-Tier and tends to projects involving a database as the backend.
