Story of a pygmy who finds a coke bottle thrown from an airplane and decides to throw it off the edge of the world because he thinks it's evil. There is a sub-plot about some terrorists, a school marm, and a bumbling (and smitten) great white hunter type.
-----
Acting is terrible, plot barely discernible and looks like it was made for a couple of thousand dollars, tops. Legend is, they paid the pygmy in money and goats. He had no idea what to do with the money and threw it away somewhere in the desert. His goats were eaten by lions before he ever got back to his tribe.

Oh, and it should be noted that everyone in the theatre laughed their heads off!

Avoid the sequel, it attempted to recreate the mood and was abysmal.

Just a correction - he was a Southern African Khoisan (Bushman), not a Pygmy (that would be like confusing Indians and Chinese because they are from the same continent).  The Pygmies are central and Western African forest tribes.  Today only a few Khoisan groups lead a hunter-gatherer existence in the Kalahari desert in Southern Africa.

The KhoisanLanguages are famous for the click consonants.  It's really mind-blowing - here's a sample:

It is more a comical comparisons of values. It shows how one mans litter is another mans pandora's box. Well worth the time spent to view them. Which cannot be said of the usual fare which comes from Hollywood USA.
