Who, me? ;-)

I'm 29 years old (as of March 2002), living in Wales, and working atm for a major telecoms firm.  Spend most of my time these days hacking in PHP, but I've a few C and Korn Shell skeletons in the closet too.

If you want to know more about me, http://www.gnqs.org/people/stu/, when it's available, is my personal homepage.  And my own wiki classes for PHP will one day appear at http://php.gnqs.org/gpfr/

Best regards,
Stu
