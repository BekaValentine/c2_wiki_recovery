(jmh) What can I do to get rid of my ego? ;-)

(RobertCecilMartin) *Value* your ego.  There's nothing wrong with being proud of your work.  It is that pride that makes your work worth doing, and keeps you motivated.

However, *shift* your pride to how well you can work with others and help
them to produce good work.  A lone star will never do much.  A group of
effective team players can shake the world.

(jmh) What can I do to help people to understand there is a thing called ego and it is not good in our team? ;-)

(RobertCecilMartin) Don't try to tell them that their ego is bad; it is not.  Rather challenge them to improve their team skills.  Help them to become proud of how well
they play as a team.
