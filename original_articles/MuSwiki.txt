A MuSwiki is a Swiki-like system which uses Morphic objects instead of HTML. The key features of a MuSwiki are:

	* the use of Morphic objects (See MorphicInterface) instead of HTML code. 
	* Pages look the same on anyone's browser. 
	* Any user may update any page in the system. 
	* Users are prevented from updating a page at the same time. 
	* When one user updates a page, all other users viewing the same page are shown the new version. 
	* Content may contain arbitrary Smalltalk code behind the scenes!

"...arbitrary Smalltalk code behind the scenes" sounds like a major security hazard. I assume that MuSwiki should only be used among a small group of trusted peers? --PatrickParker

''...Pages look the same on anyone's browser''

Why is this a good thing? 


''I don't understand the use of the term Morphic (i.e. a ''shape'') in this context. Could someone please explain?''

Morphic is part of SqueakSmalltalk and seems to be for rapid GUI creation.
