In a couple of places on this wiki, there are links to geocities.com. These are slowly dying off, but a site called reocities.com ("r" instead of "g") has copied much but not all of the geocities content. '''If a geocities link dies''', try the reocities equivalent instead by changing the "g" to an "r".

However, the '''formatting''' at reocities.com is often unfaithful to the original such that the '''text may be scrambled''' at places or truncated. As of writing, this problem has not been fixed. 

Thus, "geocities" links are best IF they work. If not, then "reocities" equivalents are a consolation prize with formatting issues.
