An anti-pattern.
What happens when you don't write everything that should be said about the problem domain.

I kinda sorta maybe have this pattern. And I only fix it when I need to, because you know, YouArentGonnaNeedIt. If I ''need it'', I can add some more abstraction, add a few clarifying lines of code that makes it more flexible. But that's for another day.
