One of my children's favourite ArabicFolkTales is this short story from Iraq.
i
Bahlul is one of the well known 'fools' of Arabic folklore, the prototype of the 'learned idiot'.

'''Bahlul and the Sweetmeats'''

Once Bahlul was included among the guests at a sumptuous banquet in the house of a wealthy merchant. Among the delicacies that were offered was a dish of Damascene nougat. ''What is this?'' asked a fellow diner.
''I don't know'', said Bahlul, ''but I have heard people say that the most exquisite thing on earth is a bath. This, I think, must be a bath!''
