An I want the slice on a plate, on my own table, ready to consume (that means information stored locally)

There are several, if not many ways this may be done, some usable and available to everyone, and some you may devise for your own personal use. (EatYourOwnDogfood)

The main reason being that information is multiplying and becoming '''huge''', such that the needle thread and fabric may be lost in a mountain-size-haystack. 

So when discovering something useful or important, you might want to simply cut a piece out of the whole ( InformationSlice ) and save both it, and the presentation mechanism as in SinglePrintablePage of a SinglePageWebApp if you have your own site.
