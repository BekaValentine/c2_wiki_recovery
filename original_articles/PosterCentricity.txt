A MessagePostingSystem is PosterCentric if messages are primarily organized around the poster, and not according to some other criterion (such as topic). An OpenWiki, such as this one, is not PosterCentric. The classical non-PosterCentric system is UseNet. A PosterCentric system can be SpamProof, because users reading messages can use poster as their primary criterion for selecting messages to read. -- PhilipDorrell
