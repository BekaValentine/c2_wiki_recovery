The Grain Monitor project was in development from 1998 to 2002. The embedded software team used XP for the final 18 months of this project. We were building a mobile spectrometer, the first ever of its kind. The important thing (in my opinion at least) is that we solved all of the technical problems, and became a really smooth team. Our company stopped development due to business issues. The project might go forward again after being sold to another company.
