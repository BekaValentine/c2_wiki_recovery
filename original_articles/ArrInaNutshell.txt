Its an AnimalBook (in this case a bird).

This is a very worthwhile addition to the material supplied with the program itself and explains some things which are missing from other documentation.  For example on a linux installation

 R -g TK &

will run R in a separate window instead of on the command line.

It also gives details of how to connect R to Microsoft Excell (Windows).
