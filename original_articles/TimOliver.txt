I'm a programmer for e2-media in ChristchurchNewZealand. We mainly build things in P''''''H''''''P and MySql. 

I'm trying out various ExtremeProgramming practices - PairProgramming is out, but CodeTestsFirst is terribly useful. 

In my copious spare time, I play IndoorCricket, read everything I can get my hands on, and play games. Currently I'm playing various RolePlayingGame''''''s, vaguely working on LiveRoleplayingGames, and absently painting up WarGaming figs.
