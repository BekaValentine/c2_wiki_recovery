I am a Senior I/T Architect with IBM Global Services where I lead the Component-based Development and Integration competency for the National Center of Competency. I also enjoy teaching computer science; focusing on software engineering, framework development, components and patterns.

I have extended current object-oriented methods to handle component-based and recently, service-oriented software engineering.

I have developed VariationOrientedDesign, GrammarOrientedObjectDesign that help build reliable component-based software architectures.

Patterns and Pattern Languages I have been working on include:

RulePatternLanguage
Patterns for ComponentBasedDevelopmentAndIntegration
Patterns for SymmetryInSoftwareArchitecture
PatternsForGrammarOrientedObjectDesign

ServiceOrientedArchitecture is another area of interest.

Hi Ali. I hope you come back here often to give tutorials on WhatIsSoa. The more I read, the more I get confused (yes ZapThink and others have issued warnings about that confusion). -- DavidLiu Nov05
