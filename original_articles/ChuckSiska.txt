I've been programming for about 20 years doing too many
kinds of things: operating systems, tools (assemblers &
compilers & translators & debuggers & editors & version
control), performance analysis, various AI subfields
(mostly for aerospace), and games.  (But, I haven't done
all of them well.)

I'm interested in too many things, and I don't
devote enough time to any of them, I'm certain.

I was led to patterns by Gabriel's Critic-at-Large
articles, and while I may not buy into the realizability
of a "TimelessWayOfBuilding" here on Earth, I 
find that alexandrian patterns as discussed in GoF and elsewhere can
reduce the complexity involved in understanding program
designs.

I currently live in Costa Mesa, Orange County (a satellite
of L.A.), California.  Email, mailto:chuck.siska@nb.rockwell.com.
