Hi!

I work in the Department of Software Engineering of CWI, the Dutch national research institute for mathematics and computer science, located in Amsterdam.  Some of the topics I'm interested in include ReverseEngineering, class identification in legacy code, documentation generation, program understanding, and software processes supporting program
understanding -- which is XP.
More information on my research is available at http://www.cwi.nl/~arie/
(there are also some XP related papers on my site).

I'm also involved with the SoftwareImprovementGroup, which uses XP for
its development.


At XpTwoThousandAndOne I organized the WorkshopOnCustomerInvolvement.

Some of the pages I follow more or less:
	* CategoryCustomer 
	* ReverseEngineering
	* DomainSpecificLanguage
	* RefactoringTestCode

I once was RecentChangesJunkie, but I now check RecentChanges only incidentally.
