I am creating a ForthLanguage dialect called RQL.  It uses ReversePolishNotation, and is a cross between LISP and Forth. Parentheses only delimit stacks.  Arrays are another core datatype; they are very important.  We also have LISP-style macros.  Functions are first class entities.  There are 6 data types -- arrays, stacks, hashes, numbers, functions, macros

''First, RQL was a RelationalLanguage.  Then it was a LispLanguage.  Today it's a ForthLanguage.  Tomorrow, who knows?  Stay tuned and see!'' 

It will be a combo of all 3.  It will combine the best of all 3.

''And it cures headaches and walks the dog!  You wouldn't, by chance, be a student choosing a final year project, would you?''
