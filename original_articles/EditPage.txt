The "''edit page''" is the page used to edit a page's content.

To reach it, use the '''Edit''''''Text''' link at the bottom of the page.

If you find the text editing area too large or too small, you can specify desired dimensions on the url:

* htt''''''p://c2.com/cgi/wiki?rows=''x''&cols=''y''&edit=''Wiki''''''Page''''''Name''
