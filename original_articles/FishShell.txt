A very nice POSIX shell with its own simple programming language.  It emphasises:

(1) orthogonality ... one aspect of which is that the fish shell is configured using small programs written in itself, as much as possible

(2) making it easy to get help

(3) making good defaults and sticking to them unless specifically overwritten by a user's code ... hence its motto ConfigurabilityIsTheRootOfAllEvil.
