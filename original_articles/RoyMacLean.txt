I'm visiting from the UK (no distance at all).
I'm currently an OO Design consultant/trainer with 
Logica UK.
I've been interested in frameworks and patterns for quite a while now
(since before they were fashionable, I like to think).
I'm doing a session on patterns at the Object Technology 96
conference (Oxford UK) in March, so I'm checking out
some of the pattern-related websites.
