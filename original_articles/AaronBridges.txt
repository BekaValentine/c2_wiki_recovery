Hi, I'm Aaron Bridges. I'm the Product Manger for Blue''''''Tech's ExtremeProgramming team here in Portland.

Out of the kindness of my heart I am doing some administrivia for PortlandXpUsersGroup. Really it's 'cause I like free pizza. And 'cause ArloBelshee is too busy building software. If you want to come to PortlandXpUsersGroup, present at XPDX, or just buy us some pizza, you can get in touch with me at aaronDOTbridgesATbluetechllcDOTcom.
