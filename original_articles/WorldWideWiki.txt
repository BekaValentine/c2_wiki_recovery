The wild world of WikiPage''''''s linked with WikiLink''''''s

----

http://www.worldwidewiki.net is an open wiki which covers all different kinds of topics. 

It's completely open to anybody and anything with just a really basic set of rules.

Several of the projects on it are:

SwitchWiki - a public wiki for public wikis (through a list and categorization)

GeekMarks  - links to stuff for geeks on the net

JunitAddonsRunner - documentation for the JUnit-addons Runner 

CommRightsForum - planning and development of the campaign for Communication Rights

ForesightExchange - documentation for the "game" set up by Ken Kittlitz (FutureExchangeInvesting, ForesightExchangeClaimCreation) and discussion of Hanson's idea of "future exchanges" in general.

InternetSicherheit - Wie bewege ich mich sicher im Internet?

Now that Wiki is becoming very popular, I hope it is time to promote
more than ever a brand new WWW, not the WorldWideWeb, the WorldWideWiki.
How ? Simple. With ExternalWikiLink''''''s, to make InterWiki ubiquitous.
