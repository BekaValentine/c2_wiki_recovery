Q: 2005-11-14: There are currently just 10 pages turned up in a search for this category (CategoryCard), including this page. Is it worth having? Or is it categories gone mad? Answers on a postcard ...  Why bother with the category when they are all LikePages to each other? Delete away.

A: 2008-05-20: ''There apparently are more people who value the category system and who do not see the addition of just a dozen or so characters at the bottom of a page as useless.  Since some people use this system, as well as other classification systems devised by the appropriate use of WikiWords, One should not destroy their '''option''' of using it.''
