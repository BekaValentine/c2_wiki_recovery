Since 1986, I have worked in various software development roles within both large companies with established development processes and startups feeling their way forward. Companies that I have worked for include LogicaPLC, SeerTechnologies, IchatInc and NcrTeradata.

I first heard about ExtremeProgramming this year and I am eager to apply it to my team. So far we've adopted DelphiUnit tests and are looking at how we can implement ContinuousIntegration into our build process.

I can be reached at simon dot king at NCR dot com.
