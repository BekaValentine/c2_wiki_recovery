TemporaryHack''''''s are fixes that you only intend to be used for a short period of time. The intention is to replace the TemporaryHack with a more standard solution at a future time. A Temporary Hack is usually unconventional and rarely fully tested. It will often work if certain assumptions are true but may fail if other parts of the system or data change. 

Many TemporaryHack''''''s end up being PermanentHack''''''s as once a system is working again (with the TemporaryHack) the motivation to change it is offset by the risk of disrupting the system.

Another name for a SpikeSolution.
