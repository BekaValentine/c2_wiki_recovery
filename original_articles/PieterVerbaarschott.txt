I'm a guy from the Netherlands.

What led me here was my interest in web collaboration. Then I found out that once you're in (this Wiki thing), it is hard to get out :)

I started a page about the HailStormAlternative.

My interests at this moment are PeerToPeer (and other distributed) systems and identity-centric systems.
I tend to follow the WebServicesDiscussion.
