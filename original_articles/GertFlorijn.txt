I've been following the patterns idea for quite some
time now, basically since BruceAnderson started his
work on the "architecture handbook".

I use patterns in a course on software architecture
at the university of Utrecht [1], and try to apply them in
practice via the Software Engineering Research Centre [2].

I've run some (small) workshops to learn more about how to
model/design with patterns. Together with a student I'm
going to look at a pattern-centered design environment.

Any tips, suggestions and comments are welcome. Just drop
me a line.
