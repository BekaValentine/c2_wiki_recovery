----

	'''AcceptanceTest''':	a test written by the customer, (or QC on the customer's behalf) that tests the entire system to ensure that a specific piece of functionality is present and functions correctly.

	'''AT''':	acronym for '''Acceptance Test'''

	'''BDUF''':	"BigDesignUpFront"; part of WaterFall.

	'''BUFD''':	Big, Up-Front Design.  Variation on BDUF.

	'''Business''':	???

	'''Customer''':	(The literature is thin on this one) The primary stakeholder (on-site, in-the-lab) of the system undergoing the XP methodology. Provides the final acceptance criteria for any behavior in the system. Sometimes a team instead of one person. Less optimally, but often likely, this is a Business Analyst who, while they may be a Domain Expert, does not have the final say, but acts as the advocate of the real Customer who is not on-site. (Beware the Customer who knows the Business but does not have the Final Say).

	'''DBC''':	acronym for DesignByContract.

	'''DTSTTCPW''':	"DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork"  A general XP heuristic on how complicated a design should be.

	'''DRY''':	"Don'tRepeatYourself"  From ThePragmaticProgrammer, a more general version of OAOO.

	'''EngineeringTask''':	UserStory gets broken down into these smaller fragments by the developers.

	'''GangOfFour''':	ErichGamma, RichardHelm, RalphJohnson, and JohnVlissides.  Authors of the classic book "Design Patterns".  See DesignPatternsBook.

	'''GoF''':	Abbreviation for "Gang of Four".

	'''GreenBar''':	What JavaUnit displays when all UnitTest''''''s run successfully.  ''The bar is green, the code is clean.''

	'''Green Book''':	PlanningExtremeProgramming by KentBeck and MartinFowler.

	'''OAOO''':	"OnceAndOnlyOnce"  The state of a well designed program -- it says everything that currently needs to be said precisely once.  Compare with DRY.

	'''PEP''':	acronym for PlanningExtremeProgramming (the green book).

	'''Pink Book''':	ExtremeProgrammingInstalled by RonJeffries, AnnAnderson, and ChetHendrickson.

	'''PP''':	acronym for PairProgramming.

	'''RUP''':	acronym for RationalUnifiedProcess.

	'''Spike''':	a quick (typically minutes or hours) exploration by coding of an area the development team lacks confidence in.  The spike is concluded when you learn what you needed to learn.  So-called because a spike is "end to end, but very thin", like driving a spike all the way through a log. ''See SpikeSolution, ArchitecturalSpike, SpikeDescribed.''

	'''TDD''':	"TestDrivenDevelopment"

	'''TestInfected''':	When you can't even go pee unless you have a GreenBar.

	'''TETCPB''':	"TestEverythingThatCouldPossiblyBreak"  ''I haven't seen the acronym in common usage.  Reference?''

        '''UAT''':	"User Acceptance Testing", see Acceptance Testing.  These are test done by the client every end of Iteration and/or every Release

	'''UnitTest''':	a test that tests a single class, or a small cluster of classes in isolation.

	'''UserStory''':	Broad description of a feature, created by the customer, estimated by developers, fits on a note card.

	'''UT''':	acronym for UnitTest.

	'''White Book''':	ExtremeProgrammingExplained by KentBeck.

	'''XPE''':	ExtremeProgrammingExplained by KentBeck (the white book).

	'''XpValues''':	Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, and Courage.

	'''YAGNI''':	"YouArentGonnaNeedIt", said by XP coaches when developers get into overly baroque design territory.
