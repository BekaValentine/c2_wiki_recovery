So far, my main contributions to wiki have been:

	* MigrationToXp
	* BugFreeDoesntSell
	* UnitTestFrameworkInCpp
	* ObjectState
	* DesignFromTheInsideOut

It is gratifying to see that the first two have spawned some discussions, though unfortunately I've been too busy to follow up on them.
