A magazine (http://computer.org/software/) published every other month by the Computer Society (http://computer.org/) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (http://www.ieee.org/), focused on the practice of software development. Slogan - 'building the community of leading software practitioners'. Not too academic - I find this is one of the few magazines I try to read every time a new issue arrives. -- SteveCline
