''Smalltalk/X (ST/X) is a complete implementation of the Smalltalk programming language and development environment, providing: 

*Object Oriented Programming Language
*Integrated Graphical Development Environment with Editors, Browsers, Debugger, etc.
*Incremental Compiler and byte code interpreter + dynamic translator (jitter).
*Static compiler, generating true binary class libraries (dlls) and executables.
*Can generate very small footprint standalone executables which run w.o. image (hello world)
*Extensive Class Library (>4500 classes) with many ready-to-use building blocks for Applications.
*Provides Classes for many popular protocols (XML, SOAP, FTP, NFS...)
*Builtin WebServer, Wiki, HTML with embedded Smalltalk etc.

The implementation of the language and the class library is consistent with the draft ANSI standard as well as the industry standard.''
