There is no pure solution or pure model that fits every problem.

Make TheCompromise. Figure out ThePlan.

Sometimes JustDoIt because HumansDoNotHaveTime and LifeIsShort.

----
The compromise:
* Dont Be An Island Unto Your Self 
* Share Don't Hoard 
* Work Together 
* Work Hard 
* Name Your Work 
* Name Your Plan 
* Use The Now 
* Choose Your Emphasis
* Many Can Get Almost Anything Done
