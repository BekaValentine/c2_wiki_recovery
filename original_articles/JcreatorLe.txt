Xinox's JCreator LE (freeware) and JCreator Pro (pay) are both available from http://www.jcreator.com/

JCreator provides a VisualStudio 6.0-like interface without too many unexpected features. The main draws are that it is a native MicroSoft Windows application written in CeePlusPlus, i.e., it's fast (compared to other JavaIde solutions that tend to be written in Java) and familiar.
