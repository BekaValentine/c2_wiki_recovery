JBoss Seam is a powerful new application framework for building next generation Web 2.0 applications by unifying and integrating technologies such as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), Java Server Faces (JSF), Enterprise Java Beans (EJB3), Java Portlets and Business Process Management (BPM).

For me, the more interesting part of Seam, is that, lazy loading works in Hibernate, and acts as a new kind of glue-framework, that makes ModelViewController easier to user, by changing the way applications are programmed... they are stil layered... but it is IMHO a much more flexible layering

Are we finally reaching WebObjects?
