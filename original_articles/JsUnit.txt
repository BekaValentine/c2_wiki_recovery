A unit testing framework for JavaScript inside the browser.  The advantage of testing JavaScript inside the browser is that you can run your tests in all your targeted browsers.  This goes a long way to addressing the old problem of inconsistency in JavaScript implementations across browsers.

This version concentrates on the command-line and the server-side JavaScript usage. The framework is tested with a lot of environments and the port is very close to the Java implementation. The implementation uses the JavaScript object model for representing the original Java classes and the user has to write his test cases in a very similar way.
