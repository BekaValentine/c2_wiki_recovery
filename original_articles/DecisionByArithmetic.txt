Although the technique is imperfect, '''what is the alternative'''? "My nebulous undocumented guesses can beat up your nebulous undocumented guesses"? At least numbers allow one to see the mental proportions others are putting on various factors. One can look at the numbers and say, "Why is server box cost being given such a high weight compared to software maintenance cost?" If somebody thinks so but doesn't tell anybody and says "just trust my judgement", then poor decisions are made without scrutiny.
