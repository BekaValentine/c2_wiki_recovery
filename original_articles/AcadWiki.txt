''Unfortunately one of our RAID 0 discs crashed, so we had to take of ''[sic]'' the /home partition with all the user homepages and most projects. We try to fully reconstruct the content of /home ''[sic]'' so this may need some time. This is just a replacement server, with only marginal content. (2005 07 30)''
