When most of the code in a "for" loop uses an offset to the loop index, rather than the loop index itself,
then maybe the for loop should be adjusted to loop over the range of values that the code needs,
rather than computing some other value at each point of usage.

'''Example:'''

''Starting here:''
   For i = 1 to max
      array[i-1] = otherarray[i-1] + factor * (i-1)
      ' other stuff using "i-1" a lot...
   Next i

''ExtractLocalVariable Refactoring:''
   For i = 1 to max
      j = i - 1
      array[j] = otherarray[j] + factor * (j)
      ' other stuff using "j" a lot...
   Next i

''Then ajust the loop range to eliminate the computation:''
   For j = 0 to max-1
      array[j] = otherarray[j] + factor * (j)
      ' other stuff using "j" a lot...
   Next j
