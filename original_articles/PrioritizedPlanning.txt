Here are some suggestions:
* Keep a list of '''realistic''' things to do here: ( WardsWiki ) 
** perhaps using something like DonaldNoyesReminders
* Keep the list to a relatively short length, representing what you might intend in the short-term (some fixed time-scope, like in the next 3 to 30 days)
* If it is a page you are creating, you could or might build it within something like DonaldNoyesSandbox, 
** others can there see it, and if having anything to say about it, put the comment or suggestion or question in your TalkPage
* If it is a page you are ReFactor''''''ing, particularly if it is NotBuiltInOneDay, make a note of your intentions on the page like DonaldNoyesReminders page.
** making sure you set a suspense date for completion'
