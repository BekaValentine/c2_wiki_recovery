''SOA is about loosely coupled systems, message based communication and business process orchestration'' - Statement taken from MicrosoftWay camp

Would like a summary quotation from JavaPlatform and EnterpriseServiceBus vendors besides BigBlue. --DavidLiu request 

See ServiceOrientedArchitecture for now.

'''A worthwhile undertaking due to prevalence of SOA related matters impacting all IT application areas'''

''Current ServiceOrientedArchitecture and related pages are too congested.'' -- dl

I do not have energy to tackle this single handedly. But I suggest these aspects to start:

* SoaBasics - description and related terminology. See WhatIsSoa and WhyUseServiceOrientedArchitecture for now
* SoaBusinssValue - ROI and implementation strategies
* SoaMessagingAspects - technical nuts and bolts
* SoaAndXml - Soa without XML, and XML messaging that is not SOA compliant
* SoaImplementationsAndWebServices - how they are related, Soa without web services, web services that are not SOA compliant, etc
* SoaAndLegacyApplications - considerations for developers
* SoaSecurity - See XmlSecurityAspects for now

'''SoaIsPeace. Iff JavaAndDotNet work together then there will be less WebServicesInteroperabilityConcerns'''

''Most critical technological problem identified in late 2005 lies with the domain of SoaSystemsManagement.''

BigBlue and MicroSoft both participates at WebServicesInteroperabilityOrganization where there have been significant progress in areas like WebServicesSecurity. However at the product level even the venerable WebServicesDescriptionLanguage level interoperability between vendors is said to be broken (note WS-I Basic Profile was adopted two years ago in mid 03 that aimed to resolve ambiguities in the WSDL). -- Source: industry report on J''''''avaOne meeting in mid 2005.

''One WikiReader of SOA material at C2 speculates in late 2005''
* Interoperability can become a casualty of the emerging big battle for MiddleWare between the giants
* We need ExtremeOrchestration between major players, and possibly an industry wide solution cannot exclude  interoperability with JavaBusinessIntegration based solutions.
