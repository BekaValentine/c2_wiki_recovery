This is a question which can be answered when connected via a browser to the internet by using the link below:

It is a perl program which displays the time for several time zones in the US plus UTC. It shows the time as of the link. It does not update automatically. Though one may update it by hitting the refresh. It might be useful as a time checker in a program to approximate the real time. 

I use it so I can reset my computer clock from time to time to Universal Time. Does anyone know of a program to do this automatically on a regular basis?
A source for such a program useful in windows and Linux would be helpful to the community.

An NTP client is built into Windows 2000 and newer, but like many such things, Microsoft doesn't make it easy to configure it.

WindowsXp has an automatic synchronization option

When you enable synchronization, your computer clock will be synchronized with an Internet time server once a week. However, you must have a continuous Internet connection or be connected at the scheduled synchronization time. You can cause immediate synchronization by clicking the Update Now button on the Internet Time tab. If this tab does not appear it is probably because your computer is a member of a domain, and your computer clock is probably synchronized automatically by a network time server. -- DonaldNoyes
