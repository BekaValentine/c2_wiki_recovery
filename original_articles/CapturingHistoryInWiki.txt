This is meant as an example of how wiki could be used to capture news and photos in a wiki. Additional editing can be performed, as in the removal of the space between the first and last name to make a Wanted Page, and the removal of a comma and a space between the city locale and the country locale. This is to make the strengths of BackLink''''''ing and search available. In a wiki which allows the mixture of letters and numbers, (as does the SmallestFederatedWiki), additional links might be made of the capsule as SoyuzTma20 and the mission Expedition27 could also be done.

I am not proposing the use of such on WardsWiki, since such would be OffTopic. It is OnTopic however to illustrate how something like this can be done using wiki framework, and keyboard-less, mouse enabled drag and drop.
