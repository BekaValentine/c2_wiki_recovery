The Wiki Subway runs through the SandBox''''''es! Can we keep it repaired? :)

This stop is different, so that I can make a map...

'''Wiki Subway Stop'''

Last stop: http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sandbox

Next stop: http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/WikiSandBox

'''Wiki Subway Map'''

It will be impossible to keep repaired as designed, however if you make something like:

'''Wiki Subway Stop'''
'''''Last Stop:''''' http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SubwayStop
   Up the stairs 
    To sandbox                   : WikiWikiSandbox
    To the Front Page and Intro  : FrontPage
    To the Welcome Center        : WelcomeVisitors
    Bus Station and Tours        : TourBusStop
    (when done with one's business and ready to move on, come back here to catch subway to next or previous station)
    (Future Extension to '''''International Airport''''' -- a possibility)
'''''Next Stop:''''' http://wikfeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/Sandbox

Then create all the necessary SubwayStop pages which will persist, with pointers upstairs to sandbox or to other pages as well if desired - content in sandboxes disappears periodically. This scheme could be made to work.
