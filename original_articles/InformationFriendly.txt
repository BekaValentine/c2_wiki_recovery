Information friendly technologies have these two properties

* they contain data in a way that means something to people.
* they contain data with lower precision than data that is none-the-less still useful.
* more that I haven't thought of yet.

Three examples of InformationFriendly technologies are FuzzyLogic, jpg, and Endemes based on an EndemeSet. --JonGrover
