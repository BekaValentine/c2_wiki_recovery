'' the first example demonstrates what is meant by the use of two separate and distinct clicks, not DoubleClick ''

'''TwoClicks and you do it'''
* When on a page like UgLyUses, and seeing FindPage''''''s.UgLy, clicking on the page name following FindPage (UgLy) followed by a click on the title UgLy when the page comes up, accomplishes the purpose.
** This is aa WikiWord action (verb), followed by a WikiWord page name (noun) excercised in reverse:
*** click one - UgLy (noun) followed by 
*** click two - title of page (an action looking up BackLinks) (verb)
** This can be particularly useful in the creating on OneThumb actions where one thumb is used on a pad computer or smart phone or using the index finger on a mouse with a LapTop or DeskTop computer
*** This is particularly true if one wishes to navigate without keystrokes. Click on FindPage on the bottom of a page and you will see what it usually takes.

'' the second example is meant to mean a DoubleClick of a mouse on a word in WardsWiki which is not a WikiWord''
  
'''A Wanted Feature for TwoClicks'''
* When on a WikiPage and DoubleClick''''''ing on a word which hilites it, though not being a WikiWord (meaning existing as a page), it would be nice:
** if such action would cause the WikiEngine to perform the same kind of search as if the word had been typed in the second search text box on FindPage (FullSearch)
** thus displaying a list of clickable links to pages which contain the DoubleClick'''ed word.

'''Note to WardCunningham: I think this is something that wiki''' 
* ''Wants to Be''
** In WantedPages, the question mark when clicked, takes you to a page which you then can create.
** The thing wiki wants here:  a double click on a significant word takes you to the list such a word typed into the text search box as a FullSearch presently produces.
* In your SmallestFederatedWiki, might it be possible that double clicking on a Significant Word in a frame, might do the same as typing it in the search box at the bottom? 
** it makes it possibile to save time and effort to type, often very awkwardly, on a phone or pad without a keyboard, the searched for word.
* Even without such implementation the following is possible if you have a search box in your menubar of the browser in use:
** DoubleClick the word, or hilite the words of interest in the page you are looking at. Drag and Drop the word (words or phrase) you have hilited into the search text box. 
*** the browser will now provide you via the search engine results pages and sites where the item of interest may be found.
