Don't you just love Portmanteau words? 

Portmanteau words are those made up words you get when you SmashWordsTogetherLikeS''''''o so damn hard that some letters fall off the start of one and off the end of the other.

Note - these are also called Frankenwords. What an excellent frankenword the word 'frankenword' is.

Here are more examples:

* chocoholic (chocolate + alcoholic)
* infotainment (information + entertainment)
* edutainment (education + entertainment)
* dancercize  (dance + exercise)
* infomercial 
* advertainment
* advertorial
* advermercial - (my favourite, LeonBambrick)
* evailable - electronically available, as in, "I'm taking a vacation, but I'll be evailable."
* NetiZen - an internet citizen
* WikiZen (can be Wiki + Citizen or Wiki + Zen, where the latter is not a frankenword)
* GiNormous (this is one we used to use as kids)
* Netiquette - Internet + etiquette
* Imagineering (see DisneyImagineering)
* Fungineering 
* sacrilicious - thanks homer

** And the related guesstimate
* frankenword - coined on http://dailybeacon.utk.edu/issues/v73/n8/gratz.8v.html

* viewser (view + browser) see http://www.afc.gov.au/resources/online/afc_loi/presentations/nic_b.html
* WorkAholic/workoholic - in NewSpeak the suffix 'holic' means 'addict'. quite nonsensical.
* FreeWare, SpyWare, NagWare, ShareWare, and literally dozens more ''-ware'' words:  http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Miscellaneous/everyware.html

Three portmanteau words used to describe TV and film:

	* dramedy - from "drama" and "comedy"
	* mockumentary - from "mock" and "documentary"
	* rockumentary - from ThisIsSpinalTap
	* docudrama - from "documentary" and "drama"

One portmanteau word made from three portmanteau words (a new Olympic record?):

	* mockudramedy - from "mockumentary", "docudrama" and "dramedy"

----

Challenged:

	* sheriff - from SHire and Reeve

These words were put together a long time ago, in the usual way.  The whole and parts were modernized separately, which is why it's ''sheriff'' instead of ''shirereeve'', but I doubt that makes it a portmanteau word.  These, like acronyms, seem to be a very recent way to make new words, absent from most historical development of languages.  It would be interesting to know what contributed to their creation and adoption.

According to 'THE DICTIONARY OF PHRASE AND FABLE BY E. COBHAM BREWER FROM THE NEW AND ENLARGED EDITION OF 1894', this definition of Portmanteau word is given: 
'''Portmanteau Word (A). A word, like post, which contains several meanings packed together; as, post (a stake), post for letters, post paper, slow as a post, fast as a post, post-horses, and so on.''' (see http://www.bootlegbooks.com/Reference/PhraseAndFable/data/999.html)

This doesn't seem to be the current meaning of PortmanteauWord at all! I wonder if what Mr Brewer wrote was true at the time - maybe it was used in that sense at the time.

''In 1872 LewisCarroll used the term in its current sense in ''ThroughTheLookingGlass'' to describe his poem "Jabberwocky" (see: http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html).''

My friends in college were always amused by my ability to accidentally create Portmanteau words when speaking passionately about a (usually trivial) subject.  I'm most proud of:
	* Hovitate (hover + levitate)
	* Valify (validate + verify)
	* Condoom (condemn and doom)
