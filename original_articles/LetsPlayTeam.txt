'''Problem: '''
Schedule pressure overpowers a team.

'''Context: '''
A tight schedule, uncertainty of design, uneven distribution
of skills among developers, and new technologies put a project into
jeopardy.TK

'''Forces: '''
	*Schedule is paramount; the veins in management's forehead are pulsing
	*Tension and fear are high among team members
	*Project is impossibly behind or wrapped around the axle
	*Performance reviews are due prior to project completion
	*Milestones are primarily paper exercises

'''Solution: '''
Pretend to be a team. Present a unified face through a team lead or
spokesperson, but otherwise do not collaborate. Ensure every member has
something to do, but that knowledge is vertical, with little communication
among members. Assume everyone knows what's going on.

'''Resulting Context: '''
To management, the team is progressing according to schedule. Members 
appear to be very busy, and milestones like requirements and design
reviews are being met. Well, at least some mighty large documents have
been produced!

'''Rationale: '''
Management is not able to compromise on schedule, afford training, or 
resolve team conflict. The team is on the hot seat to meet the schedule
and must preserve that illusion at all costs. Perhaps individual reviews
will fall within the project life cycle and no one wants to be identified
with failure or delay. Perhaps management's review or bonus is dependent
on meeting milestones in a timely manner. The team members may not be
on civil speaking terms and interaction is painful and non-productive.
There may be hope that either the project will get canceled in nick of time,
or that some other effort on which the project depends will be the first
to admit delay or failure, thus permitting the team to avoid blame for
delay (See ScheduleChicken and LongPoleInTheTent). Any and all of these may justify use of this pattern, and indeed
have.
