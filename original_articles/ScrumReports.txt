A short status, usually given orally, in a StandUpMeeting (or by e-mail ''email is hard.  DailyScrum should always be in person or conference call''), containing three sections (short!):

	* Things I Did Today, 
	* Things I Have Planned for Tomorrow, and
	* Things That Got In My Way.

I've never heard these described as reports.  Usually they are answers to the three questions in the DailyScrum.  Of course, as time goes on and people get used to the rythym of the meeting, eventually the ScrumMaster may stop asking the questions and just look for answers.  I still view these as answers to unasked questions, not reports.  Probably a pretty picky nit to pick.  -- MichaelIvey
