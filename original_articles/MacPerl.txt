MacPerl is a perl port that runs on the Macintosh under MPW and as a standalone and can be found here: http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~neeri/macintosh/perl.html

MacPerl is different from the MacOsx PerlLanguage. MacPerl (which operated on MacOsClassic) had to make do with a operating system that didn't have a CommandLineInterface. It made simple things (like redirecting the standard output to a file) more difficult. MacPython had the same problem.

BbEdit overcame much of the shortcomings of MacPerl. It integrated tightly with MacPerl and allowed for the standard output to be directed to a new BbEdit document window.

MacOsx comes with PerlLanguage ready installed. This is not MacPerl, but the regular Unix-y Perl you know and love.
