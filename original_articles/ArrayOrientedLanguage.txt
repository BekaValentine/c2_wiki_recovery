CollectionOrientedProgramming languages that specializes in arrays.

--------

J [JayLanguage], and before that APL [AplLanguage], are the best examples.

Fortran 90, a sadly neglected dialect.
* Did Fortran 90 add some new features? Or more likely, does this just refer to the well-known relative ease of vectorising Fortran? The latter does '''not''' make Fortran an ArrayOrientedLanguage. 
** Fortran 90 benefit from HPF (High Performance Fortran), it Include FORALL construction is optimization for vector.
* ''I think missing here is a distinction between language syntax/notation and implementation optimization.''

The language K [KayLanguage] is another member of this family.

Other examples are IDL (InteractiveDataLanguage) and MatLab - GeoffSobering

An MatLab example: A(abs(A - 5) <= eps) = 3; replaces all elements of value 5 with 3. This example makes use of LogicalIndexing", which is a language novelty.
