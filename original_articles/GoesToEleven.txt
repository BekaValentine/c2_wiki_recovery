A scene in the film ''ThisIsSpinalTap'', where the rock band member Nigel is showing Marty the band's equipment:

* NIGEL: This is a top to a, you know, what we use on stage, but it's very...very special because if you can see... 
** MARTY: Yeah... 
* NIGEL: ...the numbers all go to eleven. Look...right across the board. 
** MARTY: Ahh...oh, I see.... 
* NIGEL: Eleven...eleven...eleven.... 
** MARTY: ...and most of these amps go up to ten.... 
* NIGEL: Exactly. 
** MARTY: Does that mean it's...louder? Is it any louder? 
* NIGEL: Well, it's one louder, isn't it? It's not ten. You see, most...most blokes, you know, will be playing at ten. You're on ten here...all the way up...all the way up.... 
** MARTY: Yeah.... 
* NIGEL: ...all the way up. You're on ten on your guitar...where can you go from there? Where? 
** MARTY: I don't know.... 
* NIGEL: Nowhere. Exactly. What we do is if we need that extra...push over the cliff...you know what we do? 
** MARTY: Put it up to eleven. 
* NIGEL: Eleven. Exactly. One louder. 
** MARTY: Why don't you just make ten louder and make ten be the top... number...and make that a little louder? 
* NIGEL: ''<looking somewhat befuddled>'' ...these go to eleven.

See?  ExtremeProgramming is the model of sanity and reserve -- it only turns the knobs up to ten.  No sense in being pushed over a cliff.

''There is an obscure reference to this in '''Toy Story II'''.  Anyone else see it?  My wife and I laughed ourselves silly.''
