This Wiki construction lets each author work like a farrier (one who shoes horses). They can concentrate on their work, having an integrated marketing mechanism that doesn't distract them from their work. 

Farriers, repairing horse-shoes, have an excellent exposure of their work, because ''it's easy as Wiki'': 
	*  from a great distance they {i.e. their smoke} can be seen
	*  coming nearer, they can be heard {from their noise} and
	*  even nearer they {i.e. burned horn} can be smelled  
	*  at their POP {=point of presence} they offer their [service|product]s
