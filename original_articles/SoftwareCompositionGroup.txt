The Software Composition Group is a research lab [http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/] at the
University of Bern interested in all aspects of building
flexible software systems using object-oriented techniques,
software components, and other technologies.

We are especially interested in ReengineeringPatterns,
and have been working on a handbook of such patterns
in the context of the FAMOOS [http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/] project.
