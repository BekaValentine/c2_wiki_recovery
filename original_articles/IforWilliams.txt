Have been doing XP with a team of 10 developers at http://www.securetrading.com for almost 2 years now. 

We mostly use Python with some Java for client side apps.

In previous lives I've been involved in medical diagnostic software (http://www.dpcweb.com/) 
and a machine for running Smalltalk effectively (http://www.wolczko.com/mushroom/).

I'm particularly interested Agile Methodologies and their application 
to other business processes. 

Im actually WestOfEngland, but Warrington is closer than London.
