This computer thing is just a fad.  In five years, nobody will be using computers, and nobody will be programming.  Either that, or there will be reorgs and I'll get swept into the Project from Hell and I'll burn out.  That's why I'm working on my grocery-bagging skills now.  Or maybe I'll be a stand-up comic.  I don't know if I'd be able to face the other programmers if I HadToUseCobol again.  --NickBensema (<Nov 2004)
