Like any suburb this site has sprawled a little bit. New visitors will need a road map to find their way around. See RoadMaps for good examples. Here are some tips for making more good maps ...

* Group pages in a way that will make sense to a new reader. Include a few words to explain what will be found in each group.

* If you find some search particularly useful, include it at the end of the map. For example, http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=roadmap should help keep this page up to date.

* Make your map for a specific reader or interest. Choose those that are already well represented among these pages. In particular, don't make a map for something that you want to appear. That's a plan, not a map. It's better to write one seed page and tend it as it grows. When it's big and healthy, make the map.

* There are empty Categories once created and never used on the one hand and a merely alphabetical list of pages given by the search engine on the other. Well, I am missing the possibility of an indented TreeStructure in the FindPage results. These could be generated easily automatically by simply counting links beginning with the FrontPage. Only in the (rare?) case that a page has an equal number of links from more than one other page, there would have to be found a more elaborate solution. I think it would be best to subordinate this kind of a page to the MotherPage with the higher level. If there once will be the same number of links from more than one MotherPage one should count the links from/to the neighbouring pages to determine where the page should be best subordinated. This would be better than counting the clicks on any given link, because this is too much dependent on the location of the link on the MotherPage. This way we would get rid of the manual categorization beforehand, and we could generate categories only after a while when clusters of pages would have been formed.

TrailPage is a similar idea but much less used.
