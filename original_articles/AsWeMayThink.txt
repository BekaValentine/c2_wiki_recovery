** The page was last modified in 1995, and is beginning to show its age.  One feature of this page was particularly interesting: it contains 11 links to various items and topics mentioned in the paper. Today (late 1999), one could imagine a version where nearly every phrase was hyperlinked to a different appropriate Web site. The article also mentions the possibility of printing the EncyclopaediaBritannica in improved microfilm pages the size of a matchbox. Now the EB is available over the Web.

There is also a plain-text version at:

In 1995, to mark the 50th anniversary of the publication of AsWeMayThink, MIT hosted an invitation-only symposium. The symposium's web site is still online (http://www.eecs.mit.edu/AY95-96/events/bush/index.html). Though there are little more than abstracts of the various presentations available, there is inspiration to be found there. 

TimBernersLee delivered a talk entitled "Hypertext and Our Collective Destiny". For information about this talk, including an approximation of the text, see:
