Simple statement of the Goal of a ScrumSprint. Should be stated terms of value recognisable to the ProductOwner (usually: working software). The goal helps team members focus: to recognise what is important when weighing options during the ScrumSprint.

It usually represents the ''minimum'' functionality to be delivered. If the ScrumSprint is unable to deliver the SprintGoal, ScrumSprintAbnormalTermination is recommended.
