SmallReleases are a core practice of Xp. Each cycle is very short and you only provide the code for a very small set of functionality (e.g. you only implement a few UserStories each cycle).

Could the XP Experts expand on this XpXtude? Elsewhere there is mention of integration cycles (which seems closely related.)  
	* Are these released on time, or when N stories are done?
	* Do they contain half-implemented UserStories. ("We're releasing tomorrow, so don't start another feature today.")
	* Do the cycles need to be the same length? ("These N stories work well together and add a lot of value. We'll release when they're done, even though this cycle will be half as long as the last one.")
