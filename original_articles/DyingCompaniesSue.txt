A pattern some have noticed is that companies who realize they got behind the curve and are not likely to catch up start firing off bunches of lawsuits, often over intellectual property, in an attempt to milk their past for some pocket change on the way out. Getting along with competitors and customers becomes secondary because the companies won't be around long enough to benefit from goodwill.

Example companies (alleged):

* Kodak
* Novel
* SCO
* Oracle
* ComputerAssociates
