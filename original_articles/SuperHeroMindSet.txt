The SuperHeroMindSet s embodied by UnderDog : 
"Here I am to save the day"!
or "Have no Fear, UnderDog is here !"

In other words, the desire to solve other people's problems,
whether it is because you are capable of doing it but they aren't,
or because you see a problem that they don't see (and hence haven't
solved).

Related to this is the idea of WithFreedomComesResponsibility,
which is a common motivation for those with the SuperHeroMindSet.

Some people feel this view is in contrast with the view of FreedomOfChoiceConsideredHarmful because it focuses on individuals
resolving problems rather than BigGovernmentConsideredHarmful,
which focuses on developing an institution or group that solves problems.

Is a SuperHeroMindSet driving most entrepreneurs?
