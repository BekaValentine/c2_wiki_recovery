TheBerlinProject (a.k.a. TheBerlinConsortium) is/was a group of people setting out to develop a new GUI system. Somewhere in this process, they discovered Fresco, an older OO GUI framework (a decendant of InterViews). They abandoned thier own basic design and used FrescoFramework instead. Somewhere in 2002 they decided to rename themselves to Fresco with the blessing of the original developers, because their design is ''fresco'' (fresh?).
