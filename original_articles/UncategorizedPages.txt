This is a page which if adopted would contain the names of all UncategorizedPages -- pages without the word Category.

Gnomes et al. can step in and add useful categories to pages in this list thus including them with other categorized pages. 
----
Since there are 15695 uncategorized pages, the lists might be grouped in some manner, perhaps alphabetically A to Z. The lists will still be quite long.
* Examples (Number of pages)
** A -  786 
** B -  627
** C - 1231
** D -  855
** E -  814 
** F -  609
** G -  535
** H -  440
** I -  623
** J -  457
** K -  159
** L -  590
** M - 1062 
** N -  408
** O -  546
** P - 1241  
** Q -   95
** R -  701
** S - 1485
** T - 1269
** U -  296
** V -  234
** W -  996
** X -  221
** Y -   73
** Z -   13

The advantage of such lists is the effect on RecentChanges - it will be minimized to one entry for each page when a category is added to it. 

The value of the lists may be marginal because of the limited number of gnomes, and those within this group who are interested in categorizing pages (perhaps less than a dozen).

* So far there is no '''Consensus''' that such an endeavor is desired, or that it would be utilized if so prepared - ''(monitoring for changes)''

* I think the best way to add categories is when working on a set of pages on a topic, when the grouping emerges from the thinking.
* Another way is when coming across a page which belongs in a category but is not in it, e.g. a page about Java programming can go in C''''''ategoryJava. Often such pages arise in the discussion of programming and the original author did not think to use a category.
