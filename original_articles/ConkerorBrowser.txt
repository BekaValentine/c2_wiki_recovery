Conkeror is a keyboard-oriented variant of MozillaBrowser with Emacs keybindings. Started out as a Mozilla extension but developed into a standalone XulRunner app.

This is '''not''' KonquerorBrowser the KDE browser.

Instead of tabs, it has buffers. You can list and switch buffers using familiar Emacs keystrokes.

Extensible using JavaScript in place of EmacsLisp. It has per-site major modes, to customize keybindings and display. I don't know if there is a wiki-mode.
