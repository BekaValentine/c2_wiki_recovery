Quake is considered by many to be the definitive true three-dimensional FirstPersonShooter.  It was among the first games to use a true three-dimensional engine for a FPS, as both Wolf3D and Doom had both used raycasting and other tricks to quickly render a 2-dimensional space as if it were 3D.

In the earliest boom days of SiliconValley, when there were thousands of startup companies and not enough workers to go around, workers could often get away with three-hour Quake breaks over the company LAN, and in some cases they even left a company if they couldn't.  And there was at least one company that specialized in Quakeproofing your LAN.

Quake was also one of the forces behind creating the LanParty.
