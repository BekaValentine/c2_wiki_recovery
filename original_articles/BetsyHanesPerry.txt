I'm a software technical writer.  I usually work as a MercenaryAnalyst, helping the design team capture design and implementation in text form.  I am especially interested in software-process patterns.

I work for Google.   Before that, I worked for Oracle, which bought PeopleSoft; RogueWave, bought by QuoVadX; Robertson, Stephens, & Company, an investment bank bought by Bank of America the week I joined them; ParcPlaceDigitalk, which bought (and later became) ObjectShare; RothWell, Incorporated, which was bought by Perot Systems; Apollo Computer, which was bought by HewlettPackard; and Prime Computer, which bought (and later vanished into) ComputerVision.  Terrifying, isn't it?
