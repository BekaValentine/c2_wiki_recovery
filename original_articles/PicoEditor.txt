Pico is a simple WysiWyg TextEditor that is distributed with the PineEmail system for Unix-like systems. Due to its simplicity (on par with NotePad on MicrosoftWindows), it is popular with new users.

Since pine and pico are developed and owned by the UniversityOfWashington, the GnuProject has developed a FreeSoftware clone, the NanoEditor.
