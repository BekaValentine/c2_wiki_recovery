Scale of reaction when confronted with a new artifact. Especially relevant in SchoolsOfArchitecture relating to new drawings, models & similar presentations when seen for the first time.

LargeModels have a big wowfactor! Great perspectives ditto.

However, after the initial impressions have subsided a little, the more discerning critic will start to ask what can often be sharp and revealing questions. On several occasions, I have witnessed and taken part in 'Crits' where a design with a large WowFactor turns out to be not so well worked out after all. Weak planning and a narrow grasp of important concepts quickly becomes evident, resulting in a rather disappointing situation where a scheme that promised much turns out to require rather deeper investigation.
