'''Bernhard Treutwein'''

I am a fan of WirthLanguages since the very beginning, although I never got to use AlgolW. 

My first language was Algol-60 in the mid of the 1970ies, I later learned hating Fortran, moved over to Pascal in the late 1970ies, and started to program in Modula-2 in the early 1980ies on a DEC LSI-11. In the mid 1990ies I got in touch with Oberon-L, which later mutated to ComponentPascal, which is still my favourite language.
