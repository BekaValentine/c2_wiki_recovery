Win32 Fibers are mentioned on several WikiPage''''''s (ThreadsConsideredHarmful, MessagingAsAlternativeToMultiThreading, MultiThreadedGuiWouldBeGreat, WriteYourOwnThreadingPackage) where they are described as non-preemptive threads, i.e. they have to be manually scheduled by the application.

Are fibers the same as coroutines (see ContinuationsAndCoroutines)?
