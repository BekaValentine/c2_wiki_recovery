A tool used to "build platforms" for embedded devices (Win Ce and Win Ce Dot Net)
----
''Microsoft® Platform Builder is an integrated development environment (IDE) for building customized embedded platforms based on the Microsoft Windows® CE .NET operating system (OS). Platform Builder comes with all the development tools necessary for you to design, create, build, test, and debug a Windows CE–based platform. The IDE provides a single integrated workspace in which you can work on both platforms and projects..''

''Not easy to use (following from StackOverflow a Programmer's QuickQuestions site - http://stackoverflow.com/)''
* Books are pretty rare. SamPhung has the only one that is current.
* MSDN has loads of walk throughs.
** Be forewarned, it is probably the most complex tool you're ever used (unless you've done embedded OS development before) and it takes a long time to get proficient in it. I'd highly recommend gettting actual in-person training.

The basic idea is okay, but the execution is horribly wanting.

Daily agony. BondageAndDiscipline.

But I'm sure, once I understand it better, there will be SweetnessAndLight.

Did I mention that WinCe is an RTOS (RealTime OS)?
