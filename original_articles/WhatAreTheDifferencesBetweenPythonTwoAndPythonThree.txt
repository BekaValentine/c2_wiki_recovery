WhatAreTheDifferencesBetweenPythonTwoAndPythonThree?

I have come across this in the context of the RaspberryPi which has both versions of the PythonLanguage in the installation.

I want to install some packages which use PythonLanguage and need to understand any compatibility issues.

It seems that the two versions can coexist on the same computer, but are there any issues to watch out for there?

Thanks for any replies.

That looks like the starting point I need, thanks. -- JohnFletcher
