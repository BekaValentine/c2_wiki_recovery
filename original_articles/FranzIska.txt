The recent symposium entitled  TWO THOUSAND + SIX took place at the Sonic Arts Research Centre in Belfast.

For the first time, the Sonorities Festival of Contemporary Music hosted this international symposium, which brought together performance practitioners from music, dance, theatre and new media, composers, and theorists in order to discuss a wide variety of topics on performances that are informed by new technologies. 
This one-day symposium was initiated by performer and theorist Franziska Schroeder and featured keynote speakers Susan Broadhurst (Brunel University) and Ben Watson (Wire contributor, Trotskyist and Zappaphile).
