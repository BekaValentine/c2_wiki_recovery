This is in some sense the stupid canonical ProblemFrame, since both the ProblemFrame and JacksonStructuredProgramming originated with MichaelJackson. This frame is a particularly well defined one.

For JSP to be good approach to solving your problem, the problem must be a close fit to this frame. 

The frame fits problems where the required system will map an ''input stream'' to an ''output stream'' according to an ''input-output condition''.

The '''principal parts''' are: 
	*the input and output streams, they must each:
		*be a sequence of elements
		*that sequence must be described by some RegularExpression
		*the elements must correspond to individuals the input and output domains
	*the input-output condition, it must
		*relate subexpressions in the description of the input and output streams
		*be ''approximately'' one-one between subexpressions (the more many-many or asymmetric it becomes, the worse the fit)

The '''problem task''' is to construct a software system to transform the ''input stream'' into the ''output stream'' in accordance with the ''input-output condition''
