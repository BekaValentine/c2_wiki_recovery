In contrast to the WalledGarden is the WildGarden, an unenclosed but sheltered pocket of vibrant growth.  The ideal WildGarden is a place of beauty that gives visitors the sense of stumbling from a wilderness into a natural work of art.  Like a WalledGarden, a WildGarden is probably tended by a small group of people; however, it is claimed by none, timeless, and enduring.

WildGarden''''''s are rare and more easily left than found.  Due to their impression on visitors and their caretakers' attention, even if often visited they are rarely disturbed and never trampled.  Ideally, they appear to have never been visited at all.
