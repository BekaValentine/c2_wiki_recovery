delete badly-named-for-its-narrow-scope page. try moving to a page about unix or open source advocacy.

''You wrote "delete" but then checked minor edits, so I wouldn't even see you didn't like the page. Unfriendly.''

''You recommended moving the page, but went ahead and erased the previous text. Unfriendly.''

''You wrote "delete" but in a way that failed to delete the page. Clueless.''

''You didn't notice that the page was created for one (pointless) reason, and then someone else added different content that moved it in a different direction that made it merely borderline. Clueless.''

''The most antisocial part of that is attempting a hidden delete of a fairly harmless new page.''

I am very pleased to have one of these, from the old days. The thing people don't understand about us UnixWeenies is summed up, from our point of view, in this borrowed phrase. Unix isn't perfect, but it is freedom. All other operating systems before and since are fascist bondage and discipline "you can't get there from here" systems, no matter what individual nice features they have, or (these days) how flashy their GUI.

We value freedom, thus "Live free or die!"
