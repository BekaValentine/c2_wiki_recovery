Howdy. The name is Harry Robinson and I'm new to this.  I live in the beautiful city of Burlington, Vermont on the banks of Lake Champlain.  New-York State is on the other side of the lake. I am currently retired and I am learning how to program in C. Come one come all to visit Burlington. It's a beautiful city!
