Steven John Metsker explains how to use CsharpLanguage as an object-oriented language, using design patterns to create clean code while taking advantage of the extensive Microsoft(R) .NET Framework Class Libraries.

For all 23 classic "Gang of Four" design patterns, Metsker offers detailed code examples utilizing C# and the .NET Framework--as well as programming exercises crafted to help you rapidly build expertise. His exercises and explanations make extensive use of the Unified Modeling Language, helping you build your skills in this standard notation.
