Simple code has almost always good performance. If the code is simple enough, fixing all the performance problems with just one tweak should be easy.

Sometimes this is true, sometimes not.

I've seen code where this was true - adding a CachingVariable to keep the results of an expensive function call.

I've also seen code where it wasn't - the simple code was making naiive assumptions that were only justifiable in the small case. Getting there from here with ReFactoring just wasn't possible, it needed a rewrite of the core object, plus updating every client call.
