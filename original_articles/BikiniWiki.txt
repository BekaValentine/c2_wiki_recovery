Bikini is a minimalist, standalone wiki application written in the PythonLanguage 2.5+. It is designed to require a minimal setup procedure. Since version 2 it is SqLite based and supports FastCGI too. Bikini includes several typical wiki features like: 

* Multiple page revisions
* Recent changes listing (including an Atom feed version)
* Needed pages
* Unlinked pages

Bikini uses Creole syntax to edit contents and includes a SmartyPants processor to beautify content typography.
