A layering of increasingly specialized application frameworks on top of a generic foundation framework.

Initially demonstrated by JohnVlissides with the UnidrawFramework, where a generic SourceBasedComponent foundation was specialized into a second layer of foundations for vector-graphic editors, GUI-builders, and schematic editors.

Examples: IvTools (graphics), JwamFramework (business -- tools and materials), AtgDynamo (enterprise application server)
