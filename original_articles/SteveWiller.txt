A GUI programmer, web developer, Linux hack (not hacker, really), and burgeoning EvilManager. Home page sitting unfinished at http://www.willer.ca/steve/ . It seems like such a chore to update a web page when your job is all about the web... so it never gets done.

Anyway, interestingly, this is the first link you see if you search for "steve willer" on Google. So I'll put primary info here:

	* personal email: steve@willer.ca
	* work email: willer@klickit.com (I work at Klick Communications in Toronto, http://www.klickit.com)
