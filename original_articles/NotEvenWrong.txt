To assert a proposition is "wrong" means it was well formed enough to falsify based on predictions and empirical evidence. Statements and propositions that cannot be falsified are NotEvenWrong. 

cf. WrongerThanWrong

I believe the phrase originated with Wolfgang Pauli, who, when reading a graduate student's work, said, "Ach -- this isn't right.  This isn't even wrong!"
