''A new kind of wiki allowing Individual creation of information indexed and linked via Reachable Connectable and Maintainable WikiSpaces'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20110908.20141113
----
To be extensible and connectable, and making the WikiExperience one allowing IndividualCollections to become within IndividualLocales which are always ReachableConnectableAndMaintainable.

They will range from IndividualOpinion and IndividualNotions to Discoverable Fact. In the middle, between the two extremes will reside text which incudes  something more than notion and yet not classifiable as DiscoverableFact.

This could be a WikiWithMoreThanPages as well as a WikiWithMoreThanUsers, and would include ReachableArtifacts including images of ScannedStuff.

I have maintained a notion that such a WikiExperience is a GoodThing. I also have a notion that it is AboutTime to GetItDone.
