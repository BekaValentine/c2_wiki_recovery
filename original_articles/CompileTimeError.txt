An error that shows up in the "Compile" stage in the "Edit, Compile, [Link,] Run cycle".

The TheoryOfLanguageEnvironmentSuckage states that it's better to have a mistake shown to you as soon as possible, hence making CompileTimeError''''''s better than RunTimeError''''''s.

'''However,''' Though UnitTest''''''s technically happen at Run-time, they always happen in conjunction with compilation.  This means they have the same quick feedback of CompileTimeError''''''s.  Think of UnitTest''''''s as CompileTimeError''''''s that the programmer can define.

''That is an excellent point - and possibly the key to convincing people of the value of unit tests (and the antidote to certain criticisms of dynamic typing)'' -- JimArnold
