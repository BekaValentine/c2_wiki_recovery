A methodology to retain customer loyalty.

By giving the impression to the customer that you actually value what they want, it is hoped that they would remain a customer. The Customer Service label was ousted in favour of the new name of Customer Care.

Our company adopted this mode of operation (actually only part of it --just the part visable to the client). We joked about getting distress calls: "Help my software isn't working!" - "(start crying into phone)Ohhh, I feel for you! I know the pain your going through. We care you know... We can't help you with it, but our hearts are breaking."
