This site does not require registration or fees for participation. However, it may, depending on need, require the entry of a code word to enable saving edited pages.

We created the code words to discourage robotic attacks. Both the code words and the code word mechanism are subject to sudden change. Our code word policy is to not have a policy. Should the site become subject to systematic abuse, the code word mechanisms will become more stringent. Announcements appear on WikiWikiSystemNotice.

When a code word is presented, you may use it to save edits. This serves the role of a very simple CaptchaTest which probably only works because the rewards for breaking it are so small. There is a MozillaFirefox plug-in that will type the code word for you.
When no code word is given, you may use an alternative code word that floats along among trusted users. There is no way to apply for this code. Try your friends-of-friends network. Remember that this code and the mechanism itself will change if abused.

This server employs a number of self-protection mechanisms which are summarized in MoreAboutWikiAccess. -- WardCunningham.

If the reader is confused about the code words, here is a little story.  One day the mechanism presented me with its random number which by chance coincided with a numeric user ID I sometimes use on websites.  It must have been soon after I first encountered the code words.  I read the request as ''Type the code word, '''<my user ID number>''' here''.  I then got the totally wrong end of the stick about what the code word might be;  I had no idea I simply had to repeat the number.  

I found that confusing at the time, but perhaps not very harmful;  i figured out what was happening after 5-10 minutes.  --DavidVincent

Here is a GreaseMonkey user script (browser plug-in) that automatically types the code word for you: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/485696. I couldn’t find the Firefox plug-in that types the code word for you that Ward mentioned above, so I created one. Since it’s a GreaseMonkey plugin, it is supported by Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, but you need to install another plugin first (e.g. GreaseMonkey for Firefox). It is the user script titled “C2 Wiki – Fill In Code Word When Editing” on userscripts.org. – RoryOkane
