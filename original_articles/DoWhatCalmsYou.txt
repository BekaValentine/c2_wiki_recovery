The Prime Directive of OptimisticProgramming.

Definition in progress: '''When facing a decision, attempt to minimize your long-term stress.'''  This does not mean to minimize your future ''work'' -- just to do the thing that will make you feel most calm in the long run.

If you can BeMindful, you can find out what needs to be done first by following your feelings.  This is the human-centered (as opposed to heavyweight-methodology-centered) approach to deciding what's right for DoTheRightThing or what's worst for WorstThingsFirst.

At the risk of duplicating the metaphysics of the WorstThingsFirst thread, I'd suggest that DoWhatCalmsYou represents the long-term perspective and GoWhereYouAreAfraid represents the short-term perspective. Specifically, in order to conquer your fears and restore calm, you GoWhereYouAreAfraid. 

MakeTheGameMoreInteresting (the WikiName, if not the actual page) presupposes some kind of stasis/boredom/equilibrium. Create tension artificially, then resolve it. in OptimisticProgramming, the assumption is that if you are bored, if you think you and/or the project are in stasis or equilibrium, you aren't BeMindful''''''ing. -- TomRossen ''et al.''
