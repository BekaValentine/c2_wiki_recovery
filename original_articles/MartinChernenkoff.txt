I have been in the IT industry for 20 years, starting with dBase and Lotus 123 on 8 Mhz IBM PCs.  In the '90s, I was an early adopter of Object Orientation.  Using BorlandDelphi, I have developed vertical applications for a number of clients in a variety of industries.  I  started studying Java in 1995.  I taught software development, OO, Java and Project Management in both post-secondary programs and Fortune 100 boardrooms.  I am currently advocating TestDrivenDevelopment as a tool for creating high-quality software with emphasis on maintainability and enhanceability. 

I am using ExtremeProgrammingForOne in my personal software development.

I have ported the FIT FrameworkForIntegratedTest to BorlandDelphi.

I gave a talk at the EdmontonJavaUsersGroup about TestDrivenDevelopment.
