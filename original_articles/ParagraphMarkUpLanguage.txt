''Some examples would be helpful.''

Right, WeNeedExamples 
* Simple Example here:

''What's it for? Making colored boxes?''

Yes it can be as simple as that, but it can be far more:
* instead of treating textual paragraphs within a page all the same, a variety of predetermined styles can be applied, can be modified, shifted, enclosed, have different colors, have different font-sizes, be positioned in desired ways, include animation such as scrolling and more, and do so using a simple, flexible and extensible mark-up phrasing.
** ''Sounds like a PowerPoint competitor. Not sure we need more of those :-)''
** It's not, it works as a means of creation of html files displayable using a standard internet browser.
*** PowerPoint is a stand-alone MicrosoftOffice presentation application which displays .ppt files, ''but on the other hand, that give me an idea ....''
* The example demonstrates that a simple paragraph markup prefix can introduce in a simple page, a named-style paragraph within a colored, line-typed, sized border as colored, font-type-sized text.
** it includes margins and padding as well.
