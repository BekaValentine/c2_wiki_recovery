JamesAndCharles is CharlesAndJames the other way around.

CharlesWeir and JamesNoble have been jointly irresponsible for:
	* Finding the WiKiWeg
	* The Proceedings of the MemoryPreservationSociety
	* Gof Pursuit (aka GofTrivialPursuit)
	* GofMorningtonCresent
	* The EuroPLOP song, which started the EuroPlop filking tradition.
	* Comments on SoftwareArchitecture

JamesAndCharles are also known as CharlesAndJames (and are apparently confused for one another). I mean, by other people: plainly, we're regularly confused. You can find out what CharlesAndJames (or is that JamesAndCharles) are working on now, on the CharlesAndJames page.

These days, CharlesAndJames are working on:

	* A book of patterns for OO in memory constrained systems
	* Tutorials about OO in memory constrained systems

Actually, both of these are finished now.
