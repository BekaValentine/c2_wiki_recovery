The ideal integration tool:
	* Lets me load the "current" version of the system. If my changes conflict, it shows which changes are mine and which are "yours".
	* Prevents me from releasing over someone else's changes
	* Is transactional. If I release a set of changes, all the changes go in or none.
	* Shows me diffs in terms of methods, classes, code (not only text diff).
