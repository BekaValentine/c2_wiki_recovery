This exhibition, the result of a collaboration between book and installation artist KarenHanmer, digital media artist AndreaPolli, and software systems architect BobHanmer asks and attempts to find answers to the question: What are aesthetic values in contemporary computer programming and how they are similar to (or different from) aesthetic values in art?

The exhibition is the result of two years of research including: the study of the most influential authors on the art of computer programming (DonKnuth, ChristopherAlexander,  BrianKernighan and JonBentley, for example), group interviews at computer programming conferences, and written questionnaires completed by computer professionals. KarenHanmer instigated this project out of a desire to find a point of entry into her husband BobHanmer'''''''s world of programming, and to find a way to convey the aesthetic nature of coding to other non-technical people. BobHanmer'''''''s interest in the project came not only from a desire to communicate the beauty of programming, but also to illustrate 'good' coding practice and structures versus 'bad' coding to programmers, on-programmers, and programmers of the future. AndreaPolli was naturally drawn to this project because at a young age, her computer scientist father conveyed to her the beauty and elegance of mathematical proofs, a kind of conceptual beauty she strives for in her own work.

The exhibition includes quotes from the interviews, representations of artifacts from the history of programming, and illustrations of programming structures and processes in print and interactive format.
