''Hi Brad, I recently wrote an anecdote about ChoosingaWiki - see WikiChoosingStories. Good Luck. -- RandyStafford''

P.S. Amazing community here. I got three emails from old friends today based solely on the edits to this page.

And just wait 'til you hear from the friends you didn't know you had! I picked up my first edition copy of ObjectOrientedProgrammingAnEvolutionaryApproach just after it was published. My first reading of it (in one sitting) still rests among my top ten programming AhHa experiences. -- StephenHumphrey

Brad, LTNS. I took your Objective-C course at the same time as Gerry Weinberg and - oh, what's his name - the former NSA guy. It'll come to me. Anyway, welcome. -- RonJeffries

Indeed! Drop me a line and bring me up to date. Great to hear from you again! I think you mean Kurt Schmucker, now at Apple last I heard. ''(From an eavesdropper via recent changes - Kurt Schmucker! I've been trying to remember that name for years, so I could reference the first time I was introduced to OOP - his writings from early Apple Mac publications - and a later book, I think.)''

ObjectOrientedProgrammingAnEvolutionaryApproach: the most fun I ever had from such a thin book! I had a Tektronix smalltalk machine (4317), (68020 based). I wrote an obj-c preprocessor and implemented much of the Smalltalk class hierarchy in obj-c. I also added a non-stop garbage collector. I still think it was the most efficient development environment I ever used.  mailto:eparker@zyvex.com.

Planning the Software Industrial Revolution,
by Brad J. Cox Ph.D,
November 1990,
IEEE Software magazine

http://www.virtualschool.edu/cox/pub/PSIR/

"The possibility of a software industrial revolution, in which programmers stop coding everything from scratch and begin assembling applications from well-stocked catalogs of reusable software components, is an enduring dream that continues to elude our grasp..."

Hi, Brad, LTNS.. What happened to the SoftwareIndustrialRevolution? I share your belief that it is definitely on its way, but, ten years later, it still hasn't put in an appearance!  --PaulMorrison

My second book, "Superdistribution; Objects as Property on the Electronic Frontier" addresses this. In short, there is no scalable way to get paid for small-granuarity objects 
made of bits. Without that, no markets, no components, no change.

Hey Brad ... I was just doing some stuff with Lakoff and "framing"; coincidentally here, rereading pages related to threading and such, found your link to "Social Construction of Reality". Coincidental for another reason: I just recovered working notes for a paper on "Postmodernist Challenges to Historiography" (the title was supposed to be satirical); I just uploaded them to use as an experiment in use of WikiThink, see http://bentrem.sycks.net/wiki/index.php?title=History:PoMoHistoriography --BenTremblay
