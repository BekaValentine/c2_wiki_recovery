It occurs to me that all text search functions I've ever dealt with are extremely crapulent ... except for Google. It's such a simple function but it's fairly crucial and routinely screwed up.

I want a search function that is:

* whitespace insensitive
* punctuation insensitive
* case insensensitive always, unless I ask to search for something mixed-case
* searches through object titles firs, automatically
* has no backwards option
* has no useless options or modes

* supports complex logical operations
* supports the "nearby" predicate
* supports the "misspelling" predicate

* can search through a subset of objects
* can save searches and their results
* outputs results in the same format as what it operates on

by these I mean that if the tool operates on a directory of files then it will produce a directory of files as its results so that the results can be fed back into another search.

I also want a system where .song objects come with their lyrics, or can have their lyrics appended, and the search tool knows to search through the lyrics for song objects.

What I REALLY REALLY want is an AI, but I'll settle for the above.
