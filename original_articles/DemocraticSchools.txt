The first school of this kind was Summerhill, founded by A S Neill in 1921. (Sudbury Valley was founded in 1968.) See http://www.first-ask.de/summerhill2000/index.html.

SummerHill and SudburyValleySchool are related but somewhat different:

''"There is no question that Summerhill was a book which greatly influenced and inspired the founding staff at Sudbury Valley.''

''There are several differences, that I can see. The most significant is that Summerhill is organized around Freudian psychology, and the premise that children need parental figures taking charge of them.''

''This has led to several things in Summerhill that one would not see at Sudbury Valley, and vice versa. ..."'' continued at: http://www.sudval.org/~sdg/archives/dsm2/0003.html
