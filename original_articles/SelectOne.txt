SelectOne is a command line pattern of '''ksh''', '''bash''', and perhaps the other conforming PosixShell''''''s

  select name in $list ; do ComethingTo $name ; done
Here's a real example, but I haven't ReFactored the SomethingTo part -- it's hard coded on my CommandLine -- AnySuggestions?  ''We can't offer suggestions unless we know what you're even trying to do or communicate here.  Can you elucidate more on what your example is supposed to convey?  So far, it looks identical to the BashShell '''for''' command.  E.g., '''for x in `ls | grep Ward`; do (cat $x | WikiWord); done'''''

 # 01:23:39 garrod@humu 3.34 $ cd ~/wiki && select name in `ls |grep Ward`;do '''cat''' $name|WikiWord ;done
