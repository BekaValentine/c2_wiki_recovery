I've just opened http://www.XProgramming.com for preview.

It has most of the old Armaties content, and some new XP-related content as well. Armaties will be trimmed down and links placed to XProgramming as time passes.

XProgramming.com aims to be a resource for the entire community of individuals interested in LightweightMethodologies.  Accordingly, it will be my pleasure to include any of your writings relating to XP or LightweightMethodologies, or to place links in XProgramming to material you may recommend.

Please check out the site and let me know how it's shaping up. I've been working hard on it and hope I haven't messed it up too much.

Thanks!  --RonJeffries
