HighTech LowTech is a term I use to describe things like windup radios where High Tech Design or Engineering is used to create durrable items with low tech operation or costs in mind.

An example is a project in rual India where exacting clay, cobb, or adobe cooking stove making is taught to young people.  These stoves use less fuel because of their design which burns the fuel more effeciently and uses natural draft and venturi.
