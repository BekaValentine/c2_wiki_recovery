Probably the earliest extant text on architecture; written by Vitruvius in the first century BC. It runs the gamut from private homes and decorating materials to theatres, fora and shipyards.

"Nobody, therefore, attempts to practise any other art in his own home - as, for instance, the shoemaker's, or the fuller's, or any other of the easier kinds - but only architecture, and this is because the professionals do not possess the genuine art but term themselves architects falsely." -- Vitruvius, TheTenBooksOnArchitecture (Bk VI, Introduction, Para 7)

"The ancestors of the Greeks held the celebrated wrestlers who were victors in the Olympic, Pythian, Isthmian and Nemean games in such esteem, that, decorated with the palm and crown, they were not only publicly thanked, but were also, in their triumphant return to their respective homes, borne to their cities and countries in four horse chariots, and were allowed pensions for life from the public revenue. When I consider these circumstances, I cannot help thinking it strange that similar honours, or even greater, are not decreed to those authors who are of lasting service to mankind. Such certainly ought to be the case; for the wrestler, by training, merely hardens his own body for the conflict; a writer, however, not only cultivates his own mind, but affords every one else the same opportunity, by laying down precepts for acquiring knowledge, and exciting the talents of his reader."

"What does it signify to mankind, that Milo of Crotona, and others of this class, should have been invincible, except that whilst living they were ennobled by their fellow countrymen? On the other hand the doctrines of Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato, Aristotle [MrAristotle], and other sages, the result of their daily application, and undeviating industry, still continue to yield, not only to their own country, but to all nations, fresh and luscious fruit, and they, who from an early age are satiated therewith, acquire the knowledge of true science, civilize mankind, and introduce laws and justice, without which no state can long exist."
