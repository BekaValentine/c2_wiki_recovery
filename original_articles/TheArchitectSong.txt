I never wanted to be just a programmer. I always wanted to be ... an
architect! Flying from meeting to meeting in the magnificent Pacific
Northwest. Felling vendors with a single chop of my hand. EDS! EMS!
EJB! UML! With my significant other(s) by my side! And we'd sing ... ''sing''
... SING!

 Solo:
  I'm an architect and I'm okay,
  I sleep all night and I work all day.

 Choir:
   He's an architect and he's okay.
   He sleeps all night and he works all day.

 Solo:
  I disappear for martini lunch's
  and cell-phone from the lavat'ry.
  On Wednesdays I don't show up
  and assistants work for me.

 Choir:
   He disappears for martini lunch's
   and cell-phones from the lavat'ry.
   On Wednesdays he don't show up
   and assistants work for free.

 Chorus:
   He's an architect and he's okay.
   He sleeps all night and he works all day.

 Solo:
  I make the big decisions,
  'bout where and what and when.
  And I model the real wo-orld
  In ever-y di-a-gram!

 Choir:
   He makes the big decisions,
   'bout where and what and when.
   He models the RealWorld
   In ever-y di-a-gram?

 Chorus:
   He's an architect and he's okay.
   He sleeps all night and he works all day.

 Solo:
  I tell your boss that I'm the best
  Super-i-or to all'a you.
  He gives me all the raises
  While giving you the screw.

 Choir:
   He tells our boss that he's the best,
   Superior to all of us..?

[''general dissent breaks out, with complaints about the metrics for the source code the architect formerly worked on, the velocity boost during his vacations, the total cost of ownership for his purchases, etc.'']

 Solo:
  I'm an architect and I'm okay,
  I sleep all night and I work all day!
