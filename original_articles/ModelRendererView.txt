The Model Render View Pattern is a variation on the ModelViewController (MVC) pattern intended to increase the separation of responsibilities between domain objects and display objects. In this pattern the domain objects only hold domain information (e.g. dates) and display objects only know about display properties (i.e. a piece of text, or a line of given length). A separate set of classes provides the mapping.
