DeferredExecution is the act of packaging executable code and its context for execution at a later time. This includes variable binding, preservation or creation of stack frame(s), a (usually reentrant) reference to the code to be executed, and so on.

In Smalltalk, look at Block and Block''''''Context. In the Lisp family, closures and continuations. In Perl, closures. In Java, anonymous inner classes.

''Could DynamicScoping be said to utilize something like PartiallyDeferredExecution?''
