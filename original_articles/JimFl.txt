JimFl is (trunc (caten "Jim Flanagan") 5).

I am a UNIX consultant with Collective Technologies. [1]

As with ObjectOrientedProgramming, the concept of PatternLanguages immediately clicked with me, as I had been going to a lot of trouble to describe the same to myself (and with less success to others), and had been experimenting with the rudimentary ideas in various ProgrammingLanguage''''''s.

I am interested in Patterns [2] of all types.
