It must be true because I can't believe any alternative is true.

Also known as the divine argument - I can't think of any other explanation, so God did it.

If this were the person's only reason for saying God did it, I would have to agree with you.  Some people, though, say God did it because they've analyzed (sp?) the alternatives and found them lacking, but that would be a discussion suitable for a different page!  BrucePennington
