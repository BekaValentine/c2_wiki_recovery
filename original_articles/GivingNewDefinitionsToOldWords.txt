JimCoplien suggested we move this discussion from patterns-discussion to this more suitable forum.
So here we are. 
I must have dropped some pieces on the way here. 
And it started way back with PurposeOfPatterns, wandering PrinciplesObjectivesAndGoals to arrive at DoWeHaveToStickToDictionaries.

When one constructs a WikiWord which serves as a page title, it is often true that the title alone is not sufficient to define the page purpose. Therefore, early on in the page, one should construct a statement which will clarify just what the title and topic of the page is. In this way, one may be found GivingNewDefinitionsToOldWords.
