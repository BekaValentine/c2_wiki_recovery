Now scrapped TV series, written by JhonenVasquez of JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac fame, formerly on Nicklodeon, but now available on any good P2P program.   

Phenomenally good, because the humour is dark, twisted and surreal, and the characters are far above the standard laid by the average kids television show, it would probably have fared better if it was marketed instead to lazy university students, as we watch it :)

Main Characters:

Invader Zim - short, megalomaniac, hopeless failure but with infinite amounts of persistence, hates humans and wishes to destroy them all, however, his evil plans are always thwarted by Dib/GIR/his own stupidity, typically might say something like "now to unleash screaming temporal doom!".

GIR - Zim's robotic assistant, meant to be a strategic information retrieval unit, but GIR was made from spare parts, and has a hard time retrieving anything except thoughts about tacos. GIR is extremely cool, and enjoys singing to cows. Has a good grasp of temporal paradoxes though...

The Almighty Tallest - all powerful leaders of the heightocracy which is the Irkens. The Irkens obey tallness, like lasers, have big powerful spaceships and destroy all other forms of alien life.

Dib - saviour of the human race, repeatedly, conspiracy theorist, obsessed with the paranormal, and always referred to by his father as "my poor insane son"....

Gaz - Dib's sister, goth, plays consoles obsessively - a skill which comes in handy when her stupid brother is trying to save the earth.

Professor Membrane - infinitely cooler version of Johnny Ball.

I came to Wiki to get rid of my VideoAddiction and replace it with another obsession. They are gonna get me! :-)

Please write every difference between InvaderZim and ChuckJones's Marvin the Martian character here:

''What, just because two characters are both megalomaniac aliens bent on destroying the earth, they are identical?''

	* Zim's voice is much higher pitched.
	* Zim has more "out there" ideas.
	* Their physical appearance is completely different.
	* Zim is more articulate than Marvin.
	* Marvin is a dimwit, bless him.  Zim ain't no genius, but he's arguably not as dim as Marvin.
