'''A (not so) brief history of Nailhead.org.'''

The website was created in 1995 by EricFullerton as a VideoGames site that featured codes and cheats for ConsoleGames. There were no commercial video game sites at that time so if someone was willing to update their website with useful game codes, people would keep coming, so in turn it became a popular site. The name of the site was "Nailhead Presents".

Eric went on to host the world's first "DukeNukem3D" site which was wildly popular. This was a subsection of the website. He created game maps for Duke3D and hosted other people's maps and even reviewed them and wrote tips on level design.

Other popular subsections of the website followed. One was a site for the video game "Blood" followed by the game "Shadow Warrior". Both sites featured map downloads, reviews, detailed info on creatures, items, and levels.

All of Eric's sites kept him busy with updates but also taught him HTML which led to his first job as a web designer at al.com. Shortly after, Eric was offered a job at "The Adrenaline Vault", which now is a hugely successful, commercial, video game website with reviews and downloads.

The years passed as video game websites popped up all over the place making "Nailhead Presents" less demanding for gamers. The competition for video game websites had ballooned leaving Eric with no other choice but to turn his website in an entirely new direction. Eric admits that the website's change in content was a breathe of fresh air.

The website's URL in 1996 was "Nailhead.com", then changed to "nailhead.ml.org" in 1998 after losing "Nailhead.com" as a result of domain name non-payment. In 1999, "Nailhead.org" was established, and it remains the current home for this website.

In the year 1999, Nailhead.org started on its way to become a more personal website and dropped all of the video game sections.

Including Eric's friends into the website seemed to be the priority as Nailhead.org continued to evolve into a community website by integrating features that allow members to contribute ideas and discussions to the site. One of the first features was the "Weekly Poll" which would mildly entertain users, then came the photographs of parties and events around Huntsville Alabama.

The year 2000 was the birth of the message board. The message board would be the biggest milestone of Nailhead.org. The message board clearly established who the website's regular visitors were. In the years to come the message board picked up regulars outside of the Huntsville group and they became the faceless "Nailheaders". The regulars could post comments on the daily news articles which appeared on the front page. In Eric's neverending journey to add more useful features to the site, he added an event calendar to schedule Huntsville events as well as  the member's birthdays. There have been numerous things added and removed to the site, too many to mention.

'''In Conclusion'''

Nailhead.org is a centralized place for EricFullerton and his friends to keep in touch, organize events and entertain each other while otherwise they should be working or at school.
