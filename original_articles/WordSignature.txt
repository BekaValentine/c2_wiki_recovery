The WordSignature is the complete information about the word of a LopLanguage (e.g. ThelopLanguage).

It contains:
	* word (e.g. File)
	* class	(e.g. object)
	* meaning (e.g. represents a file)
	* parameters (e.g. 1)
	* effects (e.g. none)
There may be
	* examples
	* comments

LOP says that a function signature (ThelopNameSignature, NameSignature) should be identical to the combined signatures of the words from which the function name is built. This is called consistency (LopConsistency, ThelopConsistency).

This means that
	* Any parameter of a function (or method) must have some kind of representation in the function name.
	* There must be no activity of a function that can't be derived from the meaning of the constructing words (the meaning of its name).
