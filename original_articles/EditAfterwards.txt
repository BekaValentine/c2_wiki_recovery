Some authors do that. Some authors, IrisMurdoch was one, "just go for it" and then don't need to do any editing. Others agonize over each word of each sentence before going on to the next, but when they get to the end they're done.

Too many wiki authors (myself included) just go for it. But that's ok, if wiki is working properly, since someone else will come along and edit it later.
