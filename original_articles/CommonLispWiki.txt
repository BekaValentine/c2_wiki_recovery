Wikis in CommonLisp.

	* CLiki (unfortunately not a WikiName, but nevertheless too good a naming opportunity to pass up ''What, was CeeLiki taken?'') is a Wiki-like application written in CommonLisp.  You can find it at http://www.cliki.net/ ,  where it's hosting a bunch of pointers to free CL resources around the net. 
	* CLiki is freely available (MIT-style licence) from your nearest vn-cclan node: see http://ww.telent.net/cclan/

Someone asks ``BTW, any free CL for MacOsx?'': Yes: choose from GNU CLISP (http://clisp.sf.net/) or OpenMCL (http://openmcl.clozure.com), or (after August 2003) SBCL.  OpenMCL is probably the preferred choice for most people.
