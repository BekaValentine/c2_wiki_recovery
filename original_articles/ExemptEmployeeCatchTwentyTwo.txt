They expect you to come in at 9am, and stay until 5pm, regardless of the fact that you may have finished all your work earlier (TyrannyOfTheMorningPeople)

In theory it's supposed to be more pay and more prestige and more "power" over things. However, practice may sometimes differ and "exempt" is just a way to squeeze more work out of fewer employees.
