Their text is unviewable with my default browser settings. I feel like slapping them and sending them to http://www.anybrowser.org. [''You could email your feelings to webmaster@reed.edu.

	* From which I assume you have dark text as your default. I use a dark background with pale text as my default, and the text is unviewable on their background image.
Perhaps there is a bug in your browser?
	* No doubt several, but this isn't one of them.
