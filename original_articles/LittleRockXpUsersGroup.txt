Just moved to Arkansas and am wondering if anyone's doing XP here?

Welcome! Little Rock is as nice as we make it.  I am considering using this as a means for residents to work together. 
So I found this page by referring to Little Rock rather than XP which is strange to me.

XP refers to //c2.com/cgi/wiki?AdoptingXpPatternLanguage or extreme programming.
