It turns out that you can put JavaScript in bookmarks just by making the "protocol" part of the URL "javascript".
These bookmarks can consequently be used as a kind of macro to extend the surf and search capabilities of WebBrowser''''''s. Things that bookmarklets can do include:

* Modifying the way you see someone else's webpage
* Extracting data from a webpage 
* Searching more quickly, and in ways not possible with a search engine 
* Navigating in new ways

Examples:
* UserName - for setting a WikiWikiWeb UserName cookie
* WikiBookMarkletExamples - Misc examples
* WikiBookmarklet - for enhancing the use of this wiki
* TheAsdfBookmarklet - for the lazy HTML form user
* DictionaryBookmarklet
* NextNumberBookmarklet
* WaybackMachine

* http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/ - A range of utility bookmarklets, grouped into categories such as Text and Data, Validation, Search, LogAnalysis, WebDevelopment and so on.
* http://www.bookmarklets.com/ has a large number of bookmarklets, though not all are useful.

Instructions:
* Copy the text of the link, say: javascript:alert("foo")
* Create a new bookmark, probably somewhere on your "Personal Toolbar"
* Set the URL to the whole thing -- javascript:alert("foo")
* Enjoy (although that ''particular'' one is not very enjoyable).
