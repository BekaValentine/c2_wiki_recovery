A phrase which first appeared in LifeTheUniverseAndEverything. Chapter One: "[...] and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long dark tea-time of the soul."

[ISBN 0671742515] A good book.  Deranged eagles, exploding desks, coke machines in unexpected places, and the usual logical absurdities.  Like, what do you do with retired immortals?  And hateful yuppie lawyers?  And that refrigerator you don't even want to look in because you feel so guilty about not cleaning it?  Surprisingly, it all comes together into one answer, because everything is interconnected.  Really, I'm not just saying that to get a free vacation to the tropics.
