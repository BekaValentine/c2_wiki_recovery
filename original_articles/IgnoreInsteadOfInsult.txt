If you encounter somebody who is annoying or you believe to have sinister motives, it is best to stay away from them rather than confront them with your grievances. Rarely is somebody "fixed" by insults or what can be perceived as insults. Ignore your urge to "put somebody in their place". It is futile. There are ways to change people, but takes patience and is beyond the scope of this wiki.

(This is assuming you have to choice to ignore them.)
