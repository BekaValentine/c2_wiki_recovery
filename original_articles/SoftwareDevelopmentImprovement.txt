''What is SoftwareDevelopmentImprovement?''

Many people equate software development to a process, implying ''SDI = process improvement''. 

Software development uses many tools, so of course ''SDI = tool improvement''.

You couldn't tell from a lot of my code, but software development is part skill, therefore to some extent ''SDI = skill improvement''.

Computer scientists get their name from the fact that, partly, ''SDI = science''.

But many speak of software engineering, implying ''SDI = professional discipline''.

Some point out that software development is a team activity, implying ''SDI = social skill improvement''.

Kuhn would probably claim that for big advances ''SDI = paradigm shift''.

And of course post modernists and perl programmers would probably argue that '''''SDI = all of the above'''''.
