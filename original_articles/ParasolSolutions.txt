Sadly Parasol is no more. A brave experiment torpedoed by extreme short-sightedness in the modern business world.

The original idea was to see if customers really would pay for software excellence from a small company composed entirely of people-who-knew-what-they-were-doing. Sadly, the answer was that in 01-02, customers weren't willing to pay for any software at all...
