When you want to get a consensus based on the collective Wiki experience you post a question and have WikiGuests post their experiences. For example, you may ask "How many of you have actually used CMM on 6-10 member team projects that were more successful that your non-CMM projects?" in order to TakeaWikiReading on actual CMM success stories.
