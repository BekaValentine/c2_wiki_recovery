One of the greatest hard ScienceFiction writers ever. A SWFA Grandmaster (highest honor), he has had a career that spans the last 50 years or so. Author of the early hard SF classics like "Mission of Gravity", "Iceworld", "Needle", and "Cycle of Fire." A personal friend of mine, he and I are members of NEFSA. Hal was also a Science and Chemistry teacher for over 40 years.
