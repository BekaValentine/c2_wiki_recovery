	 :	"Is object orientation an imperfect paradigm for reliable coding? Worse, does it focus on the wrong part of the life cycle? The author thinks so and explains why."

The paper just says that C++ is a shitty language. A lot of people on this wiki agree with that. I really don't see any evidence that programming in SmallTalk or RubyLanguage or PythonLanguage is worse. Also, the projects that it compares are significantly different. (AurelianoCalvo)
