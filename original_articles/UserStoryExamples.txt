Some UserStory''''''s from the ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation project:

	 :	''(Real example)'' When creating a new WorkPlan for biweekly DAP, provide ability to use a template of commonly used steps. (A button to select a template is displayed on the GUI, but the functionality does not exist.)

	 :	''(Made up example)'' Employees who are sick for more than 3 days go on DAP (Disability Absence Plan). They are paid their full pay for 190 working days, and then 70% pay up through 270 days. DAP dollars paid must be kept separate from regular pay dollars (for accounting purposes). Entry to DAP is indicated by the JL30 transaction. These are often sent to us late, after the employee has already been paid. The system must retroactively make it look as if the transaction was received on time.

We try to have stories be detailed enough to estimate, and we like them to be estimated at 1, 2, or 3 weeks. More than 3 weeks means we have to break them down; less than 1 suggests they should be aggregated into some larger topic.

''I sure would like to see about a half-dozen more of these, perhaps describing a coherent chunk of the program. I've been having lots of good times using XP, but the planning angle is the hardest to get my head around. Anybody from C3 willing to put in the keyboard time on this one?''

I've created a ton of examples AtsUserStories. I don't know if I'm doing them the way TheThreeExtremos would, but they're working well for me so far. -- JimLittle
