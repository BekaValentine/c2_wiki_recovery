Would this be the same as DeleteWhenCooked? I don't quite get that page; it's not very clear. (DeleteIfNecessary)

''I don't think so. DeleteWhenCooked implies that some action is required ("cooking") above and beyond simply receiving the message.''

ok, so this would be something like :

	  :	  "A message to the ''intended reader'' to remove the comment once it has been read. Often indicating that ChatMode of the page was intended as temporary and not meant as a permanent contribution to WikiWikiWeb. Mostly found in WikiMailBox''''''es, on HomePage''''''s and wiki discussion pages"

** I use this when I have a temporary message, responding to a post by a specific individual - hoping my post would only be deleted by the targeted person after reading.
