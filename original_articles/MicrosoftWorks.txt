A program written by Microsoft. Combines in one executable functions of spreadsheet, database and word processing. Similar in architecture to OpenOffice, which also uses one single executable for Writer, Calc, Impress, Base, Draw and Math, but generally deprecated in favor of MicrosoftOffice, where the functions are refined into Excel, Access, and Word.
