	The Importance Of Correct Punctuation
		by  Jerry D. Mason

 Dear John:

	I want a man who knows what love is all about. You are
 generous,  kind,  thoughtful.  People who are not like you
 admit to being useless and inferior. You have ruined me for
 other men. I yearn for you. I have no feelings whatsoever
 when we're apart. I can be forever happy - will you let me
 be yours?
		Gloria
