1984 movie by James Cameron. In the future, computers virtually wipe out mankind; the last resistance is led by one John Connor. To eliminate him, the computers send back a humanoid robot assassin (the terminator, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) to the present to kill John's mother Sarah (played by Linda Hamilton) before he is born. However, the resistance manage to send back one of their own (Kyle Reese, played by Michael Biehn) to stop the terminator. Cue a couple of hours of the man-machine interface at its least user-friendly.

Quotes:

	* "I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle."
	* "Listen! And understand. That terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with! It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!"
	* "I'll be back."

It's one of the seminal films of the millennial age.

There are two sequels:

	* TerminatorTwoJudgementDay (1991), which some say was better
	* TerminatorThreeRiseOfTheMachines (2003), which nobody has yet said is better (I thought this was more like a B movie).
