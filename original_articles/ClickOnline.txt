A BritishBroadcastingCorporation TV programme. Linked to Wiki on March 18, 2004, from a report by KateRussell at http://www.bbcworld.com/content/template_clickonline.asp?pageid=666&co_pageid=6.

Note that the technology is "wiki", not "wikiwiki" as her report claims. And don't forget that WikiHasManyMeanings.

Thanks
