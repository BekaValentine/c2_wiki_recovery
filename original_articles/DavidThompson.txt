Ward and I met at Sprint in Kansas City.  Jawad (my partner)
and I were quandering over an implementation of a complex 
object model. Ward came over and introduced himself and
asked us how it was going. We muttered that there were brighter days. Ward pulled up a chair and started helping us with our problem. Before long we had a working model! 
Ward is now my boss and we have a great time trying new and cool ideas :)
I have since left Sprint to venture back to Tampa and TRC. Ward and I still keep in contact. He is trying to help me get Squeak working and promote the language. I am now working as a Designer/Modeler/Developer using C++ and all of the WayCool object technology.
