An AntiPattern methinks! 

We've seen BuzzWords in marketing literature, brochures,  websites, advertisements... but what is worse?

When we see the buzzwords in the actual source code! Not just in the comments, but the actual source code itself.

''Crap'' like the above buzzword infested code. Unnecessary verbosity that could be made more elegant and more to the point. 

Usually dominant in the type system and declarations when someone has over engineered the program.

I've seen buzzwords dominant especially in heavily object oriented languages and frameworks such as Delphi, Java, object persistence frameworks (relational mappers), UML (if this can be considered a language), XML (again, if this can be considered a language). ''Oh, gee, yet another five-times-abstracted interface. What the hell are we gonna call '''this'''?''

''Now that you mention it, I've never seen UML that ''wasn't'' a litany of buzzwords.''
