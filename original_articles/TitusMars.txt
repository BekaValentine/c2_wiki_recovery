Wow, I learned HTML in 1993 (I think), fascinated with the idea that anyone would be able to shout at the world. Now in 2001, much sadder and wiser (?), I am learning WikiWiki, fascinated with the idea of really UserFriendly collaboration in text. 

Finally (2003) I proposed a group of people to get and use a WikiWiki server. 

I am a one-man-consultancy now: http://www.titusmars.net/.
