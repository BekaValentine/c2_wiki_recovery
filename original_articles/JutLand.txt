JUTLAND: Java Unit Testing - Light, Adaptable 'n' Discreet - by KevlinHenney

''"Test-Driven Development is a buzzword that it appears no modern developer can be without. It is more about attitude and practice than it is about specific tools, but in the Java world JUnit has become ubiquitous as the unit-testing tool of choice and for some developers is almost synonymous with TDD.''

''"However, there is more (and less) to unit testing and test frameworks than JUnit. The talk visits some of the design ideas and deficiencies found in JUNit, NUnit and other frameworks, and outlines the anatomy and features of a minimal testing kernel that is less intrusive than JUnit and more idiomatic in its Java style."''

''"Kevlin presented an alternative testing framework, called JUTLAND, which offered better solutions for some of the shortcomings of JUnit:''
* Providing pluggable assertions.
* Better exception (i.e. negative) testing.
* Facilitating test-object reuse.
* Being less intrusive.
''Although I doubt we will ever be using JUTLAND as an alternative to JUnit the presentation was nevertheless interesting â€¦ in pointing out the legacy the JUnit in its current version actually carries. Having modified JUnit myself, and having seen JUnit under the hood, I really see a point in getting this discussion going. There must be better and more modern ways to do unit testing."'' -- TobiasHill at http://www.tobiashill.se/?p=12
