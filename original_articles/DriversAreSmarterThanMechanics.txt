''A parody of "UsersAreSmarterThanProgrammers", if it isn't obvious.  Interpret this how you will.''

''Who isn't?''

Proposed reasons why:

* Drivers know that cars are infinitely malleable and so it should serve the needs of drivers instead of vice versa (this is the point of InteractionDesign).  ''So do truly good mechanics.''
* Drivers know that you shouldn't live your entire life inside of a garage.
* Drivers know that '''all''' current drivetrain suck, without exception.  ''In my experience, many drivers think GM is the exception.'' Hmmm. perhaps they are disproving this page :)
* Drivers know that time spent getting your car running, maintained, and repaired is all a giant waste of time.  ''Cars should change their own damn oil.''
* Drivers know that mechanics are not their best friends so they need to take steps (ie, have an, as yet hypothetical, system with real reliability) to protect themselves from mechanics.   (The part about drivers knowing this is probably in the realm of wishful thinking.) In contrast, mechanics are dumb because they think that they '''''are''''' the driver's best friend. (Probably closer to parents who become upset when the children seek independence from them. After all, what do the drivers ''really'' know?)

Consider also:
'to kill' is to reduce someone's lifespan. By forcing drivers to waste time on changing their fluids, an engine mechanic is killing millions of drivers a little at a time. Maybe if drivers weren't so much at the mercy of mechanics, they'd think mechanics were evil ... I certainly don't know why they put up with the inferior quality and horrible service that characterizes the automobile industry.

''Drivers put up with inferior quality because even bad automobiles can be easier than walking.  Usually.''

But, mechanics are drivers too: you want your garage tools to get the job done with a minimum of fiddling. Time spent configuring your throttle, your timing, your fuel/air mixture, your tire pressure, your fluid levels system or your transmission is time wasted - time you could have spent cruising. Every frustration you've ever felt with a particular tool or language is similar to what motorists have to put up with when they drive your stuff. You are a driver too, if you but knew it.

without the 'Especially Ford....' sillyness (now snipped), the above list is pretty good :)

Gee, I thought the ''point'' of AutomobileDesign is that automobile designers are smarter than motorists, mechanics, police officers, and... well pretty much everyone.  Too harsh?

Nahhh, that's pretty accurate. Just outside the scope of this page.

''So, why people buy automobiles and related services ? masochism ?''

That theory also explains the popularity of GM over Toyota.

''Remember that for a certain generation, the first use of an automobile happens at work, meaning it's likely to be a GM boat. Then when they buy a car for home, they're likely to buy what they're familiar with. Then their kids do their homework on it, so that's what they learn, too.''
