An outsourcing company focused on distributed, mobile, and PervasiveComputing. WirelessNetworking excites us, as does DistributedObjects. 

We like to worth with BlueTooth, JINI, Python, Java, and other technologies. We work in a highly iterative way, striving towards ExtremeProgramming. We like to have our clients commit initially only to small units of work on our part. This helps to build a business relationship in a manner which limits the amount of risk for each side while each of us gets to better understand the other. This works well with the ExtremeProgramming principles of OnsiteCustomer, FrequentReleases, and RefactorMercilessly. 

We wholeheartedly believe in the FortyHourWeek, as we believe that we are far more efficient when not burned out, and actually produce more per unit of calendar time than pressing much OverTime work. This is a bold and somewhat unique step for a company in SiliconValley.
