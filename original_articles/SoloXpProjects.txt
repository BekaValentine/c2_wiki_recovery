If you are working on a solo or small XP project, and you want to exchange ideas with other solo XP programmers, add your name here.

Solo programming can be nice, because of the infinite flexibility, but you miss the feedback loop, particularly if you're working on a program that does not yet have customers.  My idea in creating this page is to match up solo programmers, so that they can give mutual feedback on independent projects.
