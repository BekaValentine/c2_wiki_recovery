Knuckles (or "Knux", for friends) is a fictional character in the SonicTheHedgehog universe. He's the guardian of the Master Emerald, a very powerful jewel. In one of the videogames, he was fooled by EggMan, who made him believe SonicTheHedgehog and MilesTailsPrower were going to steal the Emerald.
