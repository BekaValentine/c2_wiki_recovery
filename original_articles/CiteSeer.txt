CiteSeer is a repository of papers in ComputerScience.  In addition to the full text of most papers (in PDF, PS, etc.), it also has a fancy citation SearchEngine.

The uniquely most useful repository of wisdom on the web. If on Wiki you find little pieces of wisdom here and there, among rants, rumors, social chattering, you should quickly go to CiteSeer to get the full picture.

''Probably the best thing to happen to academic publishing in years.  (Unless, of course, you are a publishing house accustomed to having the knowledge of man locked up under copyright, and charging researchers exorbitant fees to access it.)''

Wiki should be your appetizer, while CiteSeer should be the main course. For dessert come back on wiki and share what you found.

Another valuable (although subscription-based) service is the AcmDigitalLibrary.
