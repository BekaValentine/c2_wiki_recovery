This is my first Wiki attempt.
My idea is to collect JavaLanguage tips and tricks while I am learning how to program in Java. I have used student-websites before as a personal memo-technique, and of course for exchanging ideas with fellow students. However, working with Frontpage is quite laborious, so I have decided to test the WikiWikiWeb. I will try to produce short and concise articles about Java issues. Feel free to comment or make changes.

'''Just starting'''
* LearningJava
* JavaHelloWorld - Build and run a "Hello world!" program in Java
* JavaVisibility - About the visibility of class members (public, private, etc.).

----
'''Java basics'''
	* JavaIdioms - A large collection of Java patterns and solutions
	* JavaArrays - Arrays and strings in Java
	* JavaMethods - About passing arguments to methods in Java, which is very different from C++
	* JavaInterface - This language construction does not exist in C++, in return we have to do without multiple inheritance
	* Java InnerClass''''''es - Class declarations are very flexible in Java. Smart, once you get the hang of it
	* JavaUnit - For building automated tests, instead of demos.
	* JavaDoc - About the JavaDoc tool for generating documentation from inline code comments
	* JavaExceptionHandling - Overview of Java techniques for robust error handling
	* JavaCollections - Java collection classes, that is abstract data structures such as Array, Stack, List, Set, etc.
	* JavaMultithreading - Concurrency is well supported in Java, but as always with multithreading you need to know exactly what you are doing
	* JavaIo - File handling and input/output streams in Java
	* JavaNio - Non-blocking IO for Java since 1.4 (some documents, from Sun and others, suggest it stands for New IO)
	* JavaSecurity - Security and access rights 
	* FasterJava - Tips and techniques for performance measurement and tuning
	* JavaNativeInterface - How to call native non-Java programs from Java programs using JNI  
	* JavaInternationalisation - Multi-language support in Java

'''Java GUI'''
	* JavaAwtToolkit - Demonstrates a few JavaPatterns
	* JavaAwtComponents - Overview of graphical components in Java AWT. Simple examples of a GUI application and an Applet
	* JavaSwing - The successor of JavaAwtToolkit
	* JavaEventHandling - Managing graphical components (buttons, text fields, etc.) and handling events from these components is smart in Java compared to MS Windows API
	* DebuggingApplets - Demonstrates how to show debugging information from an Applet
	* JavaLayoutManagement - GUI design in Java is a piece of cake once you get the hang of it. In fact it seems so easy that GUI design tools and wizards may be unnecessary!?

'''Distributed Systems'''

	* JavaSockets - A two way communication protocol which allows two Java programs (that may run on different machines) to communicate
	* JavaDataBaseConnectivity (JDBC)
	* JavaNamingAndDirectoryInterface
	* JavaRemoteMethodInvocation
	* JavaServlets - Building web services in java 
	* JavaServerPages - Launching inline Java code from a HTML page
	* JavaXml - Introduction to the XML standard and description of the SAX XML parser 
	* EnterpriseJavaBeans - Description of Enterprise Java Beans for distributed, component-based systems. This issue will probably be subdivided into: 
		* EjbArchitecture: RMI (Remote Method Invocation), IIOP, CORBA, J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition) standard 
		* EjbHierarchy: Entity Beans (Component Managed Persistence / Bean Managed Persistence ), Session Beans (Stateful / Stateless ) 
		* EjbInterfaces : Bean class: business logic, Remote interface: called by the client, Home interface: manages bean life cycle; create(), find(), remove(), Key class: entity beans only, contains primary key
		* EjbExecutionEnvironments - Description of different EJB execution environments; EJB container: EJBs, Web container: Servlets og Java Server Pages (JSP), Application-client container: J2SE ???, Applet container: web browser 
		* EjbAlternatives - When and where should EJBs be used?
		* EjbTools - Tips on tools for generating beans from a database schema and vice versa
