 Yes, Spamer really is my RealName; 
 Yes, mis-using my name really does irritate me;
 Yes, it does cause me no end of grief;
 Yes, I've heard all the wise cracks before;
 No, I don't find them funny;
 No, I refuse to be bullied into using an alias.

Read my brother's thoughts on the Spamer name issue here: http://web.archive.org/web/20070629054403/http://www.spamer.net/About/home.htm 

''Long, long ago, I had a girlfriend named "Faith", and a surprising number of people found it irresistible to pun on her name or otherwise call attention to its meaning as an English word. Her response varied, but my favorite was "What? Oh! I get it! My name is also a word! I never noticed. How clever of you." :-)''
