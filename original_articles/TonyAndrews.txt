Based in the UK, I have been working with Oracle databases since 1990, including a couple of years working as a consultant for Oracle UK Ltd. Now I work as an independent consultant specialising in analysis and design of Oracle databases and applications.  Somehow, I only became trully aware of Wiki in 2005!

In my spare time I play lead guitar in a great band called The Love Handles.

I have a very infrequently maintained blog here: http://tonyandrews.blogspot.com/

My email address is andrewst-fish@onetel-fish.com, but without the -fishes
