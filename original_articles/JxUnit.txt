Data-Centric Testing: Advantage of Separating Test Data from Test Code 
Test data plays a central role in testing. From the lowest level (method tests) to the highest (acceptance tests), a test involves input data, expected output data, and a comparison between the expected and actual output data. 

There are several advantages to separating test data from test code: 

	Test data can be edited, making it easy to add additional test cases; 
	Test data can be validated, as a means of reducing "false failures"; and 
	Test data can be externally generated or captured from a production process. 

	Test data can be more easily removed and replaced with real data when the time comes.

JXUnit builds on JxQuick, JUnit, and the Jakarta REGEXP.
