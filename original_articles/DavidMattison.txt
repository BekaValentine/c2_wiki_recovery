''Welcome.''

Thank you Ward (or your amicus) for the welcome and for making wiki such a friendly technology.

My own first meager efforts at wiki explorations can be found in my 2003 article for ''Searcher'' magazine article "Quickiwiki, Swiki, Twiki, Zwiki and the Plone Wars Wiki as a PIM and Collaborative Content Tool," available online at http://www.infotoday.com/Searcher/apr03/mattison.shtml

Since then I've installed and played around with many different wiki engines, chiefly those written in PHP. I currently used PBWorks.com for my personal wiki.
