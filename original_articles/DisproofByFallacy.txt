	Disproof By Fallacy:	If a conclusion can be reached in an obviously fallacious way, then the conclusion is incorrectly declared wrong. For example, 
	 :	"Take the division 64/16. Now, canceling a 6 on top and a six on the bottom, we get that 64/16 = 4/1 = 4." 
	 :	"Wait a second! You can't just cancel the six!" 
	 :	"Oh, so you're telling us 64/16 is not equal to 4, are you?" 

In this case, an absurd argument leads to a normal conclusion.  Note that this is different from ReductioAdAbsurdum, where your opponent's argument can lead to an absurd conclusion:  60/66 = 0/6 = 0 (after cancelling those pesky 6's).
