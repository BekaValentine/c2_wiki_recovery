Kind of like YouCantGetThereFromHere
----
Possible meanings:
	* Physically impossible situation. (I can only imagine this in the RealWorld, as in YouCantGetThereFromHere)
	* Should not happen. (Do I test for these variables being defined, or listen to the ''DarkPattern side?'')
	* It might happen, but chances are good that it won't. (e.g., changing how the WikiWikiWeb works)
