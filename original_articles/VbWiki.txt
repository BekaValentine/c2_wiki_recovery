Implemented a WikiWikiClone in Visual Basic 5.0 by KeithDerrick to run on Win95 under Microsoft's PersonalWebServer. The pages are stored in an Access database.

I wanted to use Wiki on our intranet to provide a communal logbook to our design team.

Unfortunately, we're a Microsoft shop, and the implementations of Perl I could find for Win95 didn't handle DBM at all well. Add the fact that I'm Perl-illiterate and couldn't make head nor tail of the RegularExpression''''''s, and you can see why I went my own way.

Sadly, this place also has a mistrust of freeware and shareware. I'm not sure they'll let me put it into the public domain either 8(

I've now implemented a version of Wiki in VisualBasic. It works much the same with some enhancements:
	* No tabs are needed - I only support bullet lists and these are indicated by a * as the first character of the line - ** for level 2 etc.
	* You can happily mix bold and italics within a line, as often as you need.
	* I added an "Append" text box to the normal View page so that you don't need to go to the edit page to just add a comment.
	* Wiki links are more flexible, and you can force a link by "quoting" it with @ characters.
	* I added links to Recent Changes and a list of all pages to every page.
	* The Recent Changes list is non-editable and generated dynamically to show all pages edited in the last week.
	* You can get away with entering most HTML constructs directly into the raw page.

I think the text parsing was the greatest challenge in the absence of a regular expression engine for VB.

BTW: There is a RegularExpression engine for VisualBasic! Check out "Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions"! -- DarenThomas

My thanks go out to Stephan Schmid, of EazyWare in Switzerland for his excellent VB5-CGI ActiveX Objects package which let me do it in VB5. This package is available at his home page http://www.eazyware.com/vb5-cgi/
