4/30/2002 - in light of the recent purge of 'unused' home pages, I'm marking my territory here today.  Don't delete this page this year.

''Pete, considering that you have signed contributions on more than 100 pages, you probably wouldn't get deleted by anybody. The deletions have been largely against recently unedited ''orphaned'' homepages.''

''At any rate, glad you're still around. -- FrancisHwang''

No problemo.... BetterSafeThanSorry.  I'd hate to lose the stellar content of this page :->

Ping - Aug 14, 2003, I'm still here....

... PONG? ''No, SpaceInvaders"

Not much point without mentioning the date! That was 2005-Mar-24. -- Doug

''Facist!'' :->

I'm not sure I follow the humor. You mean because you think there was an implied page deletion in the absence of a date?

Hey, thanks. -- EarleMartin
(Mar 28, 2006) - You're welcome, but I'm not sure what you're referring to? --Pete

Call it surgery to remove parasitic growths. -- EarleMartin

''Ah, I see.  Again, quite welcome.  I tried to limit my work to the dross that was totally unnecessary to the debate, and not to delete things that were reasoned arguments, however much I might disagree with them.''
