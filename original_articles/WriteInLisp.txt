This is meant to be "for fun only", and it does not represent an attack on any language.  I have actually written in all the languages below and a few more: Smalltalk, Haskell, Prolog, Erlang, Scheme, etc.  I do think Lisp is the most powerful development language,

 When I find my code in tons of trouble, 
 Friends and colleagues come to me, 
 Speaking words of wisdom: "Write in Lisp." 

 As the deadline fast approaches, 
 And bugs are all that I can see, 
 Somewhere, someone whispers 
 "Write in Lisp." 

 Write in Lisp, write in Lisp, 
 Write in Lisp, write in Lisp. 
 Java is underpowered, 
 Write in Lisp. 

 I used to write a lot of C++, 
 for science it worked flawlessly, 
 But don't try to debug it, 
 Write in Lisp. 

 If you've just spent nearly 30 hours 
 Debugging some C program,
 Soon you will be glad to 
 Write in Lisp. 

 Write in Lisp, write in Lisp, 
 Write in Lisp, yeah, write in Lisp. 
 Only wimps use C#,
 Write in Lisp. 

 Write in Lisp, write in Lisp, 
 Write in Lisp, oh, write in Lisp. 
 C++ won't quite cut it, 
 Write in Lisp. 

 Guitar Solo 

 Write in Lisp, write in Lisp, 
 Write in Lisp, yeah, write in Lisp. 
 Don't try Visual Basic, 
 Write in Lisp. 

 And when the IDEs are crappy, 
 And the compilers are bugging me, 
 I'm sick of pretty GUIs,
 Write in Lisp. 

 A thousand people swear that XML
 And its SOAP friend are the ones for me. 
 avoid their costly blunders,
 Write in Lisp. 

 Write in Lisp, write in Lisp, 
 Write in Lisp, yeah, write in Lisp. 
 Java was the 90's, 
 Write in Lisp. 

 The government loves ADA, 
 Write in Lisp.

''the classic version of this song is WriteInCee''

(and it's IMO much better that way because it actually rhymes.)
