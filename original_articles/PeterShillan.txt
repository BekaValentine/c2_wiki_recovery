I am a software developer working at Scotland's only Sun Authorized Java Centre, Spektra Systems. See http://www.spektra.co.uk.

I develop e-commerce solutions using Java technology, including the J2EE family. I have experience of EJBs, Servlets, JSPs, XML. I started off in OO using C++ and got pretty good, before making the switch.

I am actively interested in patterns, mainly of design, extreme programming and the open-source software movement. I have recently become a member of the jBoss Open Source Application Server developer community (http://www.ejboss.org).
