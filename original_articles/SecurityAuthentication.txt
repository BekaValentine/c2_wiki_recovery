The three authentication factors:

* Something you know, such as a password or PIN.
* Something you have, such as a credit card or hardware token.
* Something you are, such as a fingerprint, a retinal pattern, or other biometrics.

Authentication strength:
* One authentication factor is considered as weak authentication.
* More than one authentication factor is considered strong authentication.
