CÏ‰ is an extended CeeSharp variant supporting SemanticSubtyping with XML and relational datatypes, and concurrency abstractions based on the JoinCalculus - the mutant offspring of MicrosoftXen and PolyphonicCeeSharp. The language name is capital C, lowercase Greek omega.

There's a downloadable preview (requires VisualStudio .Net 2003), available at http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/, and some documentation, at http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/doc/comega_startpage.htm

Originally at MicrosoftXen, about the typing features:

''I believe it is a research lab creation to demonstrate OoAndXml can co-exist, and that OoVsRelational is a nonissue [ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatchDoesNotExist].''
