''Note, the following is best read as a metaphorical expression of a feeling rather than an assertion that Java is an addictive disorder.'' (unless the pain is really bad today)

I am a Java Programmer
	* I admit I program in Java
	* I can be restored to sanity
	* I will take fearless inventory of my Java programming
	* I am ready to remove Java programming from my character
	* I apologize to everyone I harmed with Java
	* I will make amends for my Java
	* If I slip back into Java I will admit it and improve
	* I will carry this message to other Java programmers

SoftwareEngineering is an activity deep-rooted in economics. Current economic conditions where I choose to live and work favour Java as the target language. This was not so once, it will not be so again. ToEverythingThereIsaSeason... -- KeithBraithwaite

When I finish the last refactoring on an algorithm in Smalltalk (and recently the first time I used Python), I often gain an insight into the essential nature of the computation. I love the feeling when this happens and spend a good deal of effort to make sure it happens. When I finish with an algorithm in Java, the best feeling I've ever gotten is relief that the language didn't totally prevent me from saying what I wanted to say. However, as you say Keith, economics are currently on the side of Java. The list above is a reminder to myself that I'm in this for more than money. I could as well have quoted DarthVader, "Don't be too proud of this technological terror you have created. The power to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force." -- KentBeck
