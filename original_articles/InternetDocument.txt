''Somehow to say Internet Page isn't quite what I mean'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20110607

This is a term I am beginning to use to use as a DocumentRepresentative name for a series of differently formatted, InternetBrowser displayable documents, whether a simple html page contained in a WebSite, or a WikiPage from a Wiki, a BlogEntry from a Blog, or even Multimedia events accessible via the browser and its plug-ins.

One might even throw in messages and texts from mobile devices, Emails and Videos which become displayable via an InternetBrowser and its selective click event and other automated event notification processes.

In any case, if one is to base personally useful information on just one schema and scenario, a more flexible and useful program and platform than the InternetBrowser and TheInternet, is hard to beat.
