'''StartPages'''

StartPages are the first WikiPage''''''s vistors see. With the Edit''''''Text command (on the bottom of every page) being the first level, and ConvertSpacesToTabs, RecentEdits, and GoodStyle being on the second level. Since we only have control over the second level and beyond, care should be used to ensure these pages provide a valuable RoadMap for visitors.
