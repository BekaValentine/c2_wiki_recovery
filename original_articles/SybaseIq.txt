Sybase Adaptive Server IQ is an implementation of a relational database particularly well suited for a low maintenance, high scalability DataWarehouse. High performance for StarSchema is achieved without table space partitioning or clumsy indexing. Data is stored in ColumnOrder rather than RowOrder and so the amount of space per row is dramatically reduced.

''It sounds awfully similar to Kdb (see KayLanguage), though much cheaper for commercial use.''
