These are starts of ideas.  They are not fully developed ideas, but they should be developed more in the future.  IdeaSeeds tend to have a risky start in life and have a high probability of being refactored out.  Like this entry might.  -- BenThomasson

I like to use the term of "notions" for starts of ideas. I like seeds as a figurative notion that out of "IdeaSeeds" (notions) grows ideas, and then to take it beyond, out of the ideas grows the implementations or applications. -- DonaldNoyes
