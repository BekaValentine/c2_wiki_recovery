Ultra-wideband (aka UWB, ultra-wide band, ultraband, etc.) is a radio technology that can be used at very low energy levels for short-range high-bandwidth communications by using a large portion of the radio spectrum. UWB has traditional applications in non-cooperative radar imaging. Most recent applications target sensor data collection, precision locating and tracking applications.[citations needed]

UWB communications transmit in a way that doesn't interfere largely with other more traditional narrowband and continuous carrier wave uses in the same frequency band
