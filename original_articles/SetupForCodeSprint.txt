Hi Folks,

Can one of the Mac programmers from the Python XpCodeSprint remind me how 
to run the package manager on Mac OS 10.3 ?

Thanks

If I understand your confusion correctly, you need something like this:

   cvs -z3 -d:ext:riksmoody@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/remorse help
   cvs -z3 -d:ext:riksmoody@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/remorse update
   cvs -z3 -d:ext:riksmoody@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/remorse commit
 
Getting stuff setup  is another issue

Several things:
* CVS: this is installed when you install the OS X Development Tools.  This CD probably came with your OS X CDs.  You can also get this from the Apple developer web site.
* SourceForge Remorse project:  instructions for the initial checkout are at http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=112231
** If you wish to contribute, you'll need to email one of the project admins (For example, regahj - Jonathan Hager) to add you to the project as a developer.
* PythonCard: installation directions for Jaguar are on http://pythoncard.sourceforge.net/macosx_installation.html
** This entails installing wxPython and Mac''''''Python

Also, there is a MacOsx port of the DebianProject's package manager called Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net/).

After taking considerable care to collect these cards in order I managed to drop the lot of them and get them all scrambled. I've marked what I thought was done from memory. Sorry. -- WardCunningham

''Thanks!''

* Ghost Pieces -- memory aid
* Configurable Visibility
* Save & Reload Game -- save is done
* Computer Opponent (random moves to start with)
* Recognize Checkmate
* Network Server -- finding games, firewall?
* Move Helper
* Undo
* Logging
* Sharing Board
* Capture Pieces
* Spectator View
* Fog Protocol 

'''Completed (mostly)'''
* Turn Control (model done post-sprint)
* En passant Capture -- done (bug: doesn't remove the captured pawn)
* Check serializaton of last-move (required by en passant)
* Move Restriction -- done
* Visibility Restriction -- line of sight done
* Board -- done
* Move with Drag -- done
* Is King in Check -- check done, todo: move into check, other move king into check
** This is typically done by trying the move, and retracting if the king is in check (so it is predicated on Logging and Undo)
* Black's View -- done (without reorientation)
* Model King Moves -- done (but not castling)
* Model Knight Moves -- done
* Model remaining moves -- done
* Piece Graphics -- done
* Display Board -- done

* Board Model -- done
