A WikiEngine that is completely self-contained - it includes its own HTTP server, and so does not require CGI support, Perl, or even a separate Web server such as Apache or IIS. Also, apropos of recent discussions, it does not use a database to store the Wiki pages, but instead uses a separate file for each page (which is simply a text file containing the content of the page). Another unique feature of EddiesWiki is that it is not a script like most wikis - it is an actual application coded in Visual C++.

* The first WikiServer (Eddie's WikiServer) was developed by EddieEdwards around 1997

EddiesWiki (a.k.a WikiServer) won hands down in the EasiestInstallableWikiContest.

''But slower in doing things, what happens in EddiesWiki in fractional seconds takes from 5 to 20 seconds in EasyWiki! Try listing All pages in both. This will demonstrate what I mean. Ease of installation (questionable) is trumped by performance measures in my book.''

There's a semi-official site at http://www.wikiserver.org - which runs the improved (based on the original) version by RyanNorton.

[Note to the owner of wikiserver - thanks, and keep an eye on this page.]

*Similar software (a wiki engine self contained in an executable) now seems to be emerging.

'''The 6 versions of Wiki Server'''

Six versions of EddiesWiki are available, listed here by date of creation, starting with the earliest.

''Note that all EddiesWiki versions except ElreysWikiServer are public domain with source available (Eddie's is postcardware - he asks new users of it to e-mail him). Click on the name of the distribution for a location to download.''

* EddiesWiki V0.95, V1.00 -- Maybe more for historical interest than practical use. Available at http://www.tinyted.net/eddie/wiki/. Eddie has not changed these since March 2000.

* ElreysWikiServer - A version based on EddiesWiki 1.0 that added a ton of features, some only partially implemented. Is not in active development (last changed July 7 2004).

* EddiesWiki V1.1 beta -- Lots of ambitious and partially-implemented ideas and some implemented ones too. Available also at http://www.tinyted.net/eddie/wiki/. Eddie has not changed this since May 2003.  Development seems to have ended for all practical purposes (as of July 3 2004). 

* MichelVanDeWeteringsWikiServer - Otherwise known as Michel's mods to EddiesWiki. Many good mods to EddiesWiki 1.1 beta. Not in active development (last changed August 8th 2004).

* WxWikiServer - Includes all features of all EddiesWiki versions except ElreysWikiServer, and even supports some features of ElreysWikiServer. In addition, supports all the features that UseMod does. As of version 1.5.8 supports Mac OSX and *nix varieties also (although it requires building it on non-windows platforms). Is in active development (last version April 23 2005). Available also at http://www.wikiserver.org.

From Eddie Edwards' original introduction (of historical relevance only):

* EddiesWiki is a C++ program implementing the bare bones of HTTP/1.0 and providing a WikiWikiWeb for WIN32 environments. I have run it at two jobs (including this one) and it has been reasonably popular for note sharing, although I try to send people to this site to try and "get" the WikiNature.

* The parser is an ugly clump of char* dealings, which means the STL isn't needed. As WinSock is used, however, my attempts at PlatformIndependence are rather shallow, and I just look like a hacker. I can assure you, I am not. ;)

* I am currently working on Wiki2, an uberWiki which tries to both (a) keep the WikiNature and (b) enable average users to update their websites from any web browser in the world. Work is going slowly, however.
