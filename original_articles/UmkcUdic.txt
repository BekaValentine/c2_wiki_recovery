Share and Learn -- Group Purpose -- The UDIC group is aimed at fostering the spirit of research and inquiry in the area of DistributedComputing and ArtificialIntelligence. The group gives opportunities for research-oriented discussion and activities to undergraduate and graduate students from the SCE Computer Science department and related studies (such as SoftwareArchitecture, Bioinformatics, and ComputerNetworking).

Core foundations for the UDIC group are sharing and learning, thereby encouraging students at UMKC-SCE to become leading players in their respective research community. Participating in such activities makes one aware of the state-of-art in the current fields and stay abreast in the ever-changing field of computer science. The motive is to share and nurture ideas in young minds, thereby exposing the hidden talent and leading them to their full potential.
