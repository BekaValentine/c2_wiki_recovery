Turnaround time is the time from the entry of a defect into code to when it is discovered.

It is not influenced by the same independent variables as defects per KLOC, and can be estimated by anytime algorithms (that progressively grow more accurate as more defects are discovered).

It seems to be an interesting way of keeping track of the effectiveness of testing because:

	1 It does not seem to blame developers as defects per KLOC does
	2 It takes into account how much time it took to find a defect
	3 It is not time-dependent
