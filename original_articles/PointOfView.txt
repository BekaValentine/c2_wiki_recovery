There's another definition/use/role for PointOfView when it comes to project planning.  Methodologies, including but not limited to BigDesignUpFront, look at projects from the start, as though (metaphorically speaking) one were standing on the timeline with one's feet at the start point, looking out at the project stretching into the distance.

I've found it useful to do the opposite; not as an alternative approach, but as an additional way to consider the totality of that which has to be developed.  Stand at the end, and consider all that needs to be done to bring the development to a close.  Tasks like helptext, packaging, fileformats, delivery to sales channels, manuals - all that "stuff at the end", so often forgotten because of the perspective of time, is most important when the project is viewed from the end.  Point of view.
