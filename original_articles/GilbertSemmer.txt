I'm highly involved in thinking simple (not easy ;-) since studying mathematics in the 1970s, and in growing creative teams since playing music.

Most encouraging in professional respect were working with BrunoSchrade,
reading TomDeMarco ( -> PeopleWare ) and getting numerous influences from KentBeck (***hhmmm*** ;-).

Since 1987 I'm raising children... and myself ;-)

In 1994 I've co-founded http://www.SPIQ.com . 
Since 1997 I'm pursuing XP.
