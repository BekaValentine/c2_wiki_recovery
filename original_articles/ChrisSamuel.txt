Aha!

Hi my name is Chris and I'm a geek..

I spend my life playing with Linux and working with supercomputers at VPAC - http://www.vpac.org/

Got a website and blog over at http://www.csamuel.org/ and I'm happily married to the most wonderful woman
in the world who, coincidentally, also has a website, this time here - http://wwww.donnawilliams.net/

S'about it really, never enough time to say more!
