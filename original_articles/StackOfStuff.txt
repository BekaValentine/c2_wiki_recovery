They become a stack because we think of them when about to discard or pick them up: ButUnless - I throw them away or leave them where they are, I may ... 

So we collect them, usually in a confusing collection of type stack, in a pile, stuffed in a box, placed on a shelf, or one of TheOtherThings or places for such

Then we DoSomethingElse
