I am ''very'' interested in meetings, wherever they may occur.  I travel quite a bit while teaching, so I am all over the country half the time.  My home base is in central Virginia, so I'm especially interested in meetings in the DC area.  --MichaelHill

I remember sitting in the cafe outside the IBM building in Darling Harbour one sunset back in the summer of 97 where JamesNoble, RichardHelm and a few other distinguished folk mentioned these XP, Big Ball of Mud and Refactoring concepts.

The terms drifted by but they kind of swept me with them.  I haven't looked back.

Anyone interested in shootin' the XP in Sydney?
