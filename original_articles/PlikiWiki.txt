This is a PerlLanguage WikiEngine that was forked from WikiWikiWeb a while ago by JohnMorden. Pages have MetaData embedded in them which is used for tracking like page creation dates across database moves. Its default StyleSheet setup is reminiscent of the Web as it was in the NCSA Mosaic era (if that can be called a feature, it's a little one).
