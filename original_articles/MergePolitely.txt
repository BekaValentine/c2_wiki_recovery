Some call this Wiki a jungle, others call it a community. Both seem to agree they like the mental competition, but not social competition.

Fortunately, the Wiki jungle lets good concepts compete for dominance and emerge refined!

Unfortunately those good concepts often emerge in several places.

Fortunately the Wiki is conducive to merging!

Unfortunately many are nervous about merging other's pages. Even those who wish to try and help also don't want to do the wrong thing.

What is the way to MergePolitely?
----
'''Example of the problution:'''

Let's politely merge "jungle" and "community" into "communglty".

''why not junmunity?''

OK, let's politely merge "junmunity" and "communglty" into "juncomungunilty".  I'm sure if we keep politely merging everything then everyone will eventually be happy.

''I'm offended, you completely ignored comjunmunity!''

OK, just one more time and I'm sure we'll all be happy.  Let's politely merge "juncomungunilty" and "comjunmunity" into "juncomunjungunitility".  That's it.  This wiki is now one big happy juncomunjungunitility.

''As a Freudian, I take issue with your obviously pro-Jungian bias''

We can avoid that disgreement by politely merging "Freud" and "Jung" to produce "Freung", and updating "juncomunjungunitility" to "juncomunfreungunitility".

''Why does jun come before freung?''

I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to politely merge your ass out of here now.

''Maybe we should just tag this whole section as "example of the problem"''

Or an example of the solution.

The takeaway thought here is to JfDi, because they won't be happy if you don't, and won't be happy if you do.
