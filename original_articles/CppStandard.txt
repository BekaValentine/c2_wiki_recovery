A copy of the 1996 draft ANSI/ISO standard for CeePlusPlus is at
http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp/dec96pub/contents.html. It is quite close to the version ratified in 1998, but less close to the 2003 update.

Or for US$18, you can get the real standard.  For information go to
http://www.jamesd.demon.co.uk/csc/faq.html#B1 or direct to the
ANSI website at http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/default.asp

Note that the original 1998 CeePlusPlus standard has been replaced by a version which incorporates a
"technical corrigendum" (fixes for a set of defects in the original), with the new standard
known as ISO/IEC 14882:2003.  A PDF version of the updated standard is available at
http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=INCITS%2FISO%2FIEC+14882%2D2003;
you can also buy it as a book at http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470846747 (USA) or
http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470846747 (UK).
