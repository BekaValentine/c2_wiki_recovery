PeterMerel described the StoneSociety as a "scalable syncracy" without defining "syncracy."

As of January 1, 2000, Google (http://google.com/) finds no web pages with the word (although AltaVista does have a few hits).

In April 2002, Google finds two pages worth of results, although none appear to define the word itself and most use it either incorrectly (instead of synchronicity) or as a hyphenated suffix (as in the pun "idiot-syncracy").

Syncracy is a social psych term that describes families who make decisions by consensus. Wiki itself seems a very syncratic mechanism, don't you think? I meant government by mutually ConstructiveInterference. Now don't go asking me to define constructive interference ... --PM
