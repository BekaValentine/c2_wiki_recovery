Moving an Oracle database from one Windows 2000 server machine to another when the ''other'' machine uses drive E:\ instead of C:\

This is the way that someone did it.  There is probably a better way.

	1 export from source machine with GRANTS, INDEXES, ROWS, CONSTRAINTS, FULL, TRIGGERS all set to Y
	1 create new database with same instance name on target machine
		1 You can use Database Configuration Assistant to create the database
	1 move the export file over to the target machine if there is room
	1 create the users
	1 create the tablespaces 
		1 if you open the export file up using something like UltraEdit and look at the beginning 2 pages, you will see what the tablespaces were on the source machine.
		1 Some Table spaces are there by default.  Perhaps you just want to change the size of the tablespaces which are there by default using "DBA Studio"
		1 CREATE TABLESPACE "whatever the name is" DATAFILE  'E:\whatever the file was on source machine' SIZE 2000M REUSE DEFAULT  STORAGE(INITIAL 40960 NEXT 40960 MINEXTENTS 1 MAXEXTENTS 505 PCTINCREASE 50) ONLINE PERMANENT; 
	1 import the file via two phases:
		1 E:\>imp system/manager file=E:\export_import\export_files\dba.dmp buffer=2048000 commit=y full=y rows=y indexes=n constraints=n grants=n log=e:\export_import\imp.log
			1 or in a generic sense: imp user/pwd file=filename buffer=2048000 commit=y full=y rows=y indexes=n constraints=n grants=n 
		1 imp system/manager file=E:\export_import\export_files\dba.dmp buffer=2048000 commit=y full=y ignore=y rows=n indexes=y constraints=y log=e:\export_import\2ndimp.log
			1 or in a generic sense: imp user/pwd file=filename buffer=2048000 commit=y full=y ignore=y rows=n indexes=y constraints=y

'''another way to do this'''

All of this is assuming no database instance is on the target machine which bears the name of that which you want to install.  Oracle 8.1.7 Windows

	1 On the source database get into svrmgrl
	1 Backup the control file
		* connect SYSTEM AS SYSDBA
		* do at "SQL>" prompt: alter database backup controlfile to trace; ' 
	1 shutdown normal  or  shutdown immediate (choose one or the other)
	1 Copy the database files to the target server
		* example: Copy from C:\oracle\oradata\MyDBInstance to E:\oracle\oradata\MyDBInstance 
		* or run on the source machine to find out which files need to be copied for sure:
			1 SELECT name FROM v$datafile;
			1 SELECT member FROM v$logfile;
			1 SELECT name FROM v$controlfile;
	1 Copy the trace file to the target machine.  The file may be something like ORA00336.TRC.  It would be stored in something like C:\oracle\admin\MyDBInstance\udump
	1 Edit the trace file:
		1 remove the lines until you get to the 'CREATE CONTROLFILE ..' statement. 
		1 Edit the CREATE CONTROLFILE statement to read CREATE CONTROLFILE SET DATABASE "new_db_name" RESETLOGS ARCHIVELOG 
	1 save the modified trace file
	1 (NOT SURE ABOUT THIS STEP) If you already installed the Oracle on the target machine, copy the whole ORACLE_ADMIN directory from the source db to the target db. Rename init<ORACLE_SID>.ora file to the <new_db_sid> value.
	1 Create Oracle service on the target db via: oradim -new -sid <new_sid> -intpwd <internal_password> -startup a -pfile "location_to_new_pfile"
		* Example: oradim -new -sid Titan2 -intpwd change_on_install -startmode a -pfile E:\oracle\admin\Titan2\pfile\init.ora 

	1 Check in the Services (located in Administrative Tools) that the new Oracle service was created.
	1 Using the modified trace file, create the new control file via these steps:
		1 svrmgrl
		1 connect internal (or / as sysdba) 
		1 startup nomount 
		1 @theTraceFileWhateverItsNameIs; 
		1 alter database mount; 
		1 alter database open resetlogs;

It might be good idea to switch the add user and the create tablespace
tasks. Often the Users a associated with Tablespaces and it ends up
erroring since they are not yet there. I do not believe that there is ever
tablespaces tied to usrs. -- DaveMiller
