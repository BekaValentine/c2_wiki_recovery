Collection of short works by JohannSebastianBach performed on the original Moog synthesizer. For some of us, it was our first introduction to the Master.

Performed (if that's the best word) by Walter Carlos (as he was then); Wendy Carlos (as she is now). See also ClockworkOrange, whose score was made up of other Moog performances by Carlos.
