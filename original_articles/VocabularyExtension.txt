Computer Artifacts utilized in a H''''''yperLanguage might include:
* Opposites/antonyms 
* Compound Words  
* Gender Words 
* Months of the Year (sequencing)
* Proverbs 

Arrived at via:
* a natural language processing system that 
** parses input text into a clear meaning representation containing syntactic and semantic information 
*** at all levels of structure
*** from word to scenario
** also accounts for elided elements and ill-formed input
** requests user verification of inferences to aid in proper interpretation

To produce the meaning representation
* The parser uses ConceptualGrammar
** which consists of rules derived from information contained in the knowledge base on 
*** semantic hierarchies
*** idioms
*** events
*** frames
*** syntactic rules extended by user interaction with an ExtensibilitySystem
*** TruthApproximation
