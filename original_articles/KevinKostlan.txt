I have never found an unlimited precision macintosh fractal program. But I have
found two high precision (128 bit) macintosh fractal programs: http://members.optusnet.com.au/~peterstone/ and:
http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/mac/amug/files/art/mandelbrowser-3.0.sit.hqx gone
If you find any macintosh fractal programs that have unlimited precision, or higher than 128 bit precision, or any others that have 128 bit precision,
please put the url in the space between here,


and here.

''Why apple?''

Windows is easy to run, but it crashes way to much.
Linux or unix are super stable, but they are hard to use. Later versions should be easier.
Macintosh is fairly stable and is just as easy to use as windows.
Also, (for mac and linux or unix) 3rd party programs are easier on the poket book.

Who would want to pay to a huge company that has done so many bad things.
I hope that everybody will use mac and/or unix, and there will be a lot of (stable) programs for those platforms.

The windoze computer is so stupid, it spat out '''TheDreadedShutdownBox'''
