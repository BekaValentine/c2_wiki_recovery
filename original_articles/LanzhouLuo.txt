     This will be my home page for wiki experiment. I will try to find out what wiki can do and what it cannot.
Lanzhou, my beloved home city, Capital city of Gansu Province of China. China used to be much larger more than one century ago. That's why my city was and is still so called a Northwest city. But when you see the famous Yellow River going through the city, you have just acrossed half of the Chinese land becasue it is located almost in the center of the modern Chinese map.

     Luo is my family name, which was said to mean "fishing net" by my most respected high school language teacher 
who happened to share with me the same family name. My teacher already passed away on the second day of this year in 
my home city but my life still continues on the other side of the globe, Canada.
     Lanzhou and Luo, homeland and family name, the net still connects me to my land and my home, my present and my 
past.  Isn't the internet also a kind of net? LanzhouLuo is just good enough as my homepage. 
     This is my home page, but not my first wiki page, let alone my first wiki creation. But welcome here, welcome to my net. 
     Interested in my first creation? On one of the wiki pages I wrote:
     Try, try, why not try? Let my fingers fly. Low to the key board, High to the sky. 
     Interested in my first page, it is called MyCreatePage.
