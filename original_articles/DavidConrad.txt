David Conrad is a programmer from the Motor City in Michigan, in the United States. He has read the
DesignPatternsBook, ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange, and RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode books, among others.

He is often found writing JavaLanguage or JavaScript and studying DesignPatterns, AgileProgramming, and CleanCode. He has used a variety of other languages, including SmalltalkLanguage, RubyLanguage, PythonLanguage, PerlLanguage, CeeLanguage, CeePlusPlus, CsharpLanguage, SchemeLanguage, and LispLanguage (after reading a lot of PaulGraham). He got his start programming in BasicLanguage and AssemblyLanguage on a TRS-80 in 1978.  He thinks VisualBasic is a horror show.

''I have been learning a bit of ScalaLanguage and ClojureLanguage lately. I may be learning GroovyLanguage next. I'd like to learn ErlangLanguage.''
