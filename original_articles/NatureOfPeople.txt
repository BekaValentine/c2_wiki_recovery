As for the NatureOfPeople, there is one rule that governs all other rules: '''People are more important than things.'''

I received this bit of wisdom from a cool lady (BethMarx), while living in Utah.  She was divorced there, and endured much of life's persecutions at the hands of those who felt this Rule should work the other way around.  -- GraemeMartin
