Northern Ireland is, depending on your viewpoint, either:

	* Part of the UnitedKingdom. This is obvious because a (significant) majority of people in Northern Ireland want to be part of Britain.
	* Part of Ireland, annexed by force by Britain ''(or rather, the bit of Ireland that chose to remain part of Britain when the rest of it became independent again, Britain having annexed the whole of it by force previously)''. This is obvious, because a (significant) majority of people in Ireland as a whole (North & South) want it to be part of the RepublicOfIreland (EireEurope).
