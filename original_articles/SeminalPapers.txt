I've had what I believe to be a pretty standard university ComputerScience education. I've got 12 years of industry practice behind me. I've read constantly, and tried to apply what I've read. But I know I haven't read the seminal papers in the field. I'm not even sure which papers would be considered "seminal". What are your opinions? Links would be appreciated, if available. -- Richard Rapp
