People can be made to believe any lie because they want to believe it is true, or because they are afraid that it is true.

Conversely:

"...die beste und sicherste Tarnung ist immer noch die blanke und nackte Wahrheit. Komischerweise. Die glaubt niemand."

-- ?? in Biedermann und die Brandstifter by Max Frisch

(In translation, "The best and most effective lie [camouflage] is still the plain, naked truth. Strangely enough. No-one believes '''that'''." I think this is stated in another page as well.)

Can this be related to the ''First rule of magic''? - '''Never use a spell when a bat will work'''
