An incredibly useful item.  The round ones are particularly rare. 

Now that they are available everyone who was unable to start some task without one need wait no more. --AlanFrancis

''My wife keeps a supply handy at all times, to make sure things on the 'honey-do' list get done.''

Can somebody please explain the background of this extraordinary item.

''Phonetically, the following are very close:''
* ''When I get around to it.''
* ''When I get a round tuit.''
''Thus it's a pun referencing the list of tasks that most people know they'll have to do sometime but keep putting off. The idea is that a supply of tuits (round ones) will be required before the task can be done. Since tuits don't exist, this may take some time.''
