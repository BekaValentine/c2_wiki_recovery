The GoogleSearch engine assigns PageRank values to indexed Web pages based on their "popularity" using a proprietary weighting and ranking algorithm. Web pages assigned PR10 will show up on the first page of GoogleSearch results, while PR1 content will be several pages back.

Content referenced from WikiPage''''''s appear to be given a high PageRank using the current algorithm (March 2003), leading me to wonder if someone could exploit this fact, similar to what SearchKing did with their private network of interlinking Web sites (http://www.pandia.com/sw-2002/40-google.html).

Not that I would condone such an experiment, but I wonder if the most frequently visited pages on various Wikis could effectively be used for GoogleBombing?

To see for yourself, check out via Google "OneYearA''''''go" (159 Occurrences). You will see the WardsWiki page at the top of the list, page one. It has more to do with the infrequency of the use of WikiWord''''''s in generally appearing pages on the Web, In contrast try the same search with "One Year Ago" (308000 Occurrences) This represents a ratio of 1 to 1937.

	 :	''Note: the OneYearA''''''go page, cited above as an example, ceased to be maintained by its original author.  Eventually someone replaced it with a content-free message, whereupon it was deleted. So you cannot perform the experiment as suggested. However, the reference remains here because the point it illustrates is still valid.''

For another observation, Trying "RecentChanges" vs "Recent Changes" will give a ratio of 317000 to 4418000. This represents a ratio of 1 to 14. 

The more unique and restrictive a search parameter is, the more likely will the page appear high on a relatively low number of pages listed by Google.
