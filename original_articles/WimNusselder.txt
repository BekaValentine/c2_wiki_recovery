''Hervormd of Gereformeerd? :-)''
'Hervormd' (better: 'Nederlands Hervormde Kerk') would translate as 'Reformed Church'. 'Reformed Churches' is my translation of 'Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland' ('Synodaal' for those who know more of the jungle the Reformation has created in the Netherlands). WimNusselder
