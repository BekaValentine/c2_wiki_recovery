Wiki URL's have two parts - the server part, and the topic name part. These parts could be split up into two separate UrlScheme's - WikiUrlScheme and WikiServerUrlScheme.

These schemes would support navigation in each dimension separately. For example a user reading wiki could navigate in the topic dimension by clicking on URL's that have the "wiki:" prefix before the topic name. The user's browser would then translate this into an appropriate http URL.
