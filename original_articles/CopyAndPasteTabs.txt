'''How to copy and paste tabs'''

If the page already contains a tab somewhere,
(There is a tab between these angle brackets: >	< )
you can make copies of it:

	1. Select the tab with your mouse (highlight it).
	1. Copy it using Edit->Copy on the browser's menu, or by typing ''control-c''.
	1. Move the cursor to where you want to insert a tab.
	1. Paste it using Edit->Paste on the browser's menu, or by typing ''control-v''.
	1. I've tried it and it has worked.

You can also, of course, copy-and-paste a tab from another application.

In some internet cafes, where the above is locked out, try ''ctrl-insert'' and ''shift-insert'' to achieve the copy and paste functions.
