Hi, I'm a twenty-three year old Norwegian student. I'm currently in the middle of a computer engineering study, with focus on network management and security. 

I've been programming since I was about twelve, when I borrowed a TRS-80 from my aunt (which she had received free with her new TV). I remember it did not come with any storage devices (and there were no computer shops where I lived) so I had to retype my programs every time I turned it on. That's one way of learning touch typing... I bought my first PC in 1996, and soon became interested in programming. I remember messing around with CeeLanguage, but it was not until PCPlus Magazine (Future Publishing) supplied the full version of Delphi 1 on their cover CD (early 1997, I think) that it all started to make sense. Later on I migrated to LinuxOperatingSystem (and then to FreeBsd), so I had to give up DelphiLanguage. Nowadays I use JavaLanguage and RubyLanguage mainly, but I try to experiment with other languages in my spare time (most recently IoLanguage). 

As to real life programming (i.e., programming for a company) I've had some slight experience: Being part of a group of four who wrote a TopicMaps navigation system prototype for a local company. (It also marked my first visit to this Wiki two years ago: I stumbled across BlocksInJava while doing research for the project, and I've been lurking here since). 

Well, mostly lurking. I try to contribute where and when I can, mostly by correcting spelling mistakes, fixing links, and such things.
