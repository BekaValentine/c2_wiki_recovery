Based on Windows Embedded CE
----
''Windows Embedded CE is a popular commercial real-time operating system used in many embedded devices. CE is not just a modified version of the Windows desktop operating systems, it is a totally different OS. It was originally developed from scratch starting in the mid 1990s to provide a real-time OS for embedded devices with less memory and processor power than a desktop PC. CE is also the core technology behind Windows Mobile devices including the Smart Phone and Pocket PC.''
