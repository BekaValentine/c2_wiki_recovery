[Hard to believe that this is still here!! 07-04-13]

(A particle of the past... I wrote this a very long time ago- 
in my youth, so to speak, and it persists. I think I'll
just leave it as it is. [03-22-10])

Basically, what I'm about is Freedom- not freedom as only
liberty, but freedom as in the Unbounded Domain. Freedom 
like life is just a big place to explore. The process is
to challenge thought; to confront limiting behaviour and
patterns; to pose impossible juxtopositions. And to participate
with life as we are already free and all else is a lie.
