Michael McHenry is a programmer interested in learning more about XP and Patterns.  Professionally, he spends most of his time as a contractor making web applications in C#.  He also spends a great deal of time pondering topics like economic justice, liberty, free trade, unemployment, and poverty.  He lives in Buffalo, NY with his wife, daughter, and is expecting a baby in May.

He is new to using wiki as of 1/30/2004 and appologizes for any misunderstandings he might have of wiki community standards.  He is practicing writing in the third person, even though that is unconventional on a home page, and has found that he's pretty bad at it.

* pop culture

'''Wiki'''

Being new to wiki, what I am most puzzled about is how you can allow anyone to edit and create content without paid moderation and end up with a positive result.  It seems that it requires a large amount of active community members for a wiki to take on a life of it's own.

I love the openness of wiki.  I'd like to adopt it for my own purposes, but I'm skeptical that a few antisocial individuals could easily ruin a small community and would appreciate the direct attention.  

Someone said:
''This Wiki is treated like a jungle(extreme bio-diversity), but it still works quite well. There are WikiTroublemakers, but there are good reasons WhyWikiWorks''

But I don't know if that kind of openness can work for me.

I created a wiki of my own in C# and called it MikiWiki and have started using it for a blog/family&friends website.  It requires you to log in and has a few security features, but I have some misgivings about how fast it can get out of my control...  When I get new hosting in January, I'll post a link here.  It's definitely too beta right now.
