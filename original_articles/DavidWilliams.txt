I currently work for SPSS Ltd in Kilburn, London.

Presently, I am working on various Visual C++ and internet based projects. My areas of interest are C++, Object-Oriented programming.

When I have time, I'll try to add more to this.

In the meantime, I can be contacted at mailto:avewil@globalnet.co.uk
