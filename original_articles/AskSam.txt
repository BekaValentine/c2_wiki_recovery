AskSam is not a wiki and IMHO doesn't belong here. It is a commercial database product. This entry is Wikispam. ''It relates to software and has eight backlinks, but the content is not very useful.''

askSam is a WikiLikeThing, especially in its network versions, and thus, imho, does belong here. (another country heard from)

[''There are plenty of commercial products that gain mention here, so I don't think that qualifies as a reason to delete.  On the other hand, if nothing beside the meta discussion and the brochure quotes appear, and we only get a handful of back links, it's safe to say the community isn't interested, and that would be a reason to delete'']

A database from http://www.asksam.com
http://www.asksam.com/brochure.asp

Holds both structured and free-form data, and supports very flexible searching. Is designed to be easily used and modified by end users.

This is something from their mouth:

"AskSam 4.0 makes keeping track of useful information straightforward, and in the age of the Internet, when 
the amount of interesting data is often overwhelming, that's saying something... "

Can we have a little description of how this thing runs? Thanks. 

I'm not sure what you are asking for, but here are some words from their brochure (link above):

"askSam is the ideal application to organize your information. askSam is a different kind of database - a free-form database designed for users rather than programmers. askSam makes it easy to turn anything into a searchable database: email messages, word processing documents, text files, spreadsheets, addresses, Web pages, and more.

"askSam gives you the power of a database without the complexity. No need to program or learn a complicated query language. With askSam, you simply import or enter information, and you're ready to search. askSam users range from individuals organizing email, addresses, and research notes to corporations and government organizations managing meeting minutes, regulations, policy manuals, and corporate databases."
