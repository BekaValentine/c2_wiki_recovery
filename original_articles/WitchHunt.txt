1. The accused is guilty, and must be interrogated.

2. If they plead innocent, then that shows they are unrepentant.  Punish them.

3. To show they are repentant they must plead guilty to something and they must name their co-conspirators.  GOTO 1. ''(GotoConsideredHarmful)''

OK, since someone objected to goto....

Note that in its proper formulation the WitchHunt is not tail recursive.  Since a witch confessing but claiming to be acting alone is not an acceptable outcome, the number of witches increases monotonically; in order to prevent an endless loop (and to modify reality), the algorithm terminates when the crowd gets bored (or management is satisfied).
