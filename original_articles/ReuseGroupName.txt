'''PROBLEM:'''

The community needs a name for a group of people.

'''CONTEXT:'''

The group has distinct ideas associated with it.

'''FORCES:'''

	* It's hard to remember the names of even 2 members of a group.
	* It's cumbersome to say all of the names of a group's members.
	* Using just one member's name seems to attribute all of the group's accomplishments to just that one person.
	* You need a label for the group's ideas.

'''SOLUTION:'''

Select a name for the group that is memorable and which already 
exists in another context.

'''RESULTING CONTEXT:'''

If people like the new name, they start using it.  This confirms the importance of the group in the eyes of the community which uses the name -- people don't usually give names to insignificant groups.

'''RATIONALE:'''

	* It's funny!
	* Your brain is already used to the name.
	* Hearing the old name in a new context causes you to pay more attention to it -- you want to know who is important enough to joke about in that way.
