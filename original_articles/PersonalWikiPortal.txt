There is plenty of discussion about a WikiPortal as a way to "join" views across multiple Wiki's. My thought is that the value of a WikiPortal is as a personalisable view into a single Wiki.

I would like to set up a MyWiki view into '''this''' wiki. It would allow me several panes:
* Customised recent changes (how old, what fields to show)
* Content filters (what pages have content related to which subjects)
* Category filters (what pages have which categories)
* Author filters (what pages have significant contribution/were started by which authors)
* What else?

I suppose this wouldn't even have to be implemented on the "base" c2.com servers. I would think that it could be cobbled together from a commercial portal package fairly easily.

Would this be useful to anyone else? What other "views" would be valuable? How easy would this be to actually implement? -- BillBarnett

What if you were able to register your interest in specific pages so that Wiki would notify you when they changed? Forward you either a link to the page, or a diff showing what changed?

That would be wonderful!  Let me choose link, diff, or ''copy'' of the page!

This would feel nice as a redirect service, i.e: I can create a service that I point at c2.com that filters the recent_changes, or looks for changes on topics. -- PaulSimmons

See http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?UnifiedRecentChanges to see how this is already possible. See how DaveJacoby already has a "personal wiki portal" to MeatballWiki at least at http://csociety.ecn.purdue.edu/~jacoby/Portal. Not difficult. Use http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RichSiteSummary. Also see http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CategorySyndication for ideas on copying content, and http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?DailyMe for another similar idea.

Also sounds like great features for a WikiBrowser.
