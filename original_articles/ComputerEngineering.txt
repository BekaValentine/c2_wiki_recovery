'''Computer Engineering''' is a cross between electrical engineering and ComputerScience. It typically focuses on computational hardware, with required knowledge in DigitalLogic and BinaryArithmetic, and is often combined with study in SoftwareEngineering, including OperatingSystem''''''s and ProgrammingLanguage''''''s.

''It should be noted that, in theory, electrical engineering isn't the only path to construct a digital computer.''

As a study of engineering computers, it has been recognized as a field for which Graduate Degree programs have been formed in many leading Universities and Colleges.
