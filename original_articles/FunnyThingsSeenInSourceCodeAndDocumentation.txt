  foreach (keys %some_hash) {
 if ($_ eq $search_key) {
 do_something($_);

  .

For non-Perlites, this code can be written as 

  do_something($something_else) if exists $some_hash{$something_else};

which makes it one line instead of lots, and takes O(logn) instead of O(n).

I worked on a system many years ago that would put up codes instead of error messages. You would then have to look the code up in the book.

Reminiscent the Amiga, with its system errors called Guru Meditations: you could look the number up for an "explanation", but should be prepared to encounter the occasional description like, "Weird echo causing incomprehension."

----
Continuing in a musical vein... I wrote some marshalling/demarshalling code for a C++ middleware platform. Data sent between machines of different endianness needs to be byteswapped by the receiver. The sender needs to set a flag in the header to indicate its endianness. Some systems (CORBA for example) compile the middleware libraries to know their endianness, and send a boolean flag indicating big-endian (true) or little-endian (false). As we were planning to port the system to different architectures, I didn't want to have to maintain a list of endian flags by platform as #ifdef's in the code. Instead, I used a 2-byte field in the header of each message. The sender would set the field to a well-known numeric value, each byte of which was different. The receiver would check the field in received against the well-known value. If they were different, the receiver would have to byte-swap values in the message.

The well-known numeric value was 57005. I called the header field 'elvis'. Why? Because the code that checked the value then looked like:

 Message msg = ...;
 uint16 elvis;

 msg >> elvis;
 if( elvis != 0xDEAD ) {
 ... must byteswap data in the message ...
 }

It's surprising how many puns you can make with the letters A..F, and whatever letters you can represent with the digits 0..9. E.g.

Once upon a time, my workplace used a common comment convention: "$" meant "Note", "$$" meant "Warning: This code could be done better", and "$$$" meant "This must be fixed before we ship".

In REALbasic you can't save a breakpoint in your project between edit sessions, tomorrow when you open your project the breakpoints will be gone. So I came up with this little trick instead:

The compiler halts and complains with an "Unhandled typemisMatch exception" error, but immediately scrolls the window to bring your attention to the exact spot in the code you were last working on. I suppose any other non-boolean vartype would have worked for "here" as well, but "variant" almost implies the location of the breakpoint could change. -- CarstenKlapp

Once I had a junior programmer writing VB code that needed to know the day of the week. He decided to write his own code, and read something like:
 if (day = 1) or (day = 8) or (day = 15) or (day = 22) or (day = 29) then
 weekday = "Monday"
 elseif (day = 2) or (day = 9) or (day = 16) or (day = 23) or (day = 30) then
 weekday = "Tuesday"

"For working with the system, it is recommended to use a multi-button mouse with two buttons".

"The visible state should be understood as the state when an element is shown (displayed) on the screen and is not hidden (invisible)".

You know, that can actually be hard to avoid, thanks to the way Java implements callbacks. For example, if I want to make my class implement the ''Runnable'' interface, I have to expose a public run() method, even if I don't really want just any passer-by to call it. Of course, the right thing to do is to use inner classes. Unfortunately, the way these are handled in Java is IMHO bloody inconvenient, particularly if one is writing something simple like an Applet. -- IlmariKaronen

I was deep in the innards of a system application, I think it was Smalltalk (at least that's what I'll use in this telling). The module was attempting to do massive cleanup and finalization, and multiple paths lead to a routine that managed instances of a HUGE object that was the root of an enormous directed graph. The routine itself was long, and at the critical point I found something very much like this:

  theFinalInstance := nil. "I love code with power: rmc"

In Java, we had class A with private member variable aIndex. In the derived class B the programmer had private member aIndex. B's programmer was too lazy to type in the names of the accessors for A.index and instead thought that redeclaring would cause the two variables of the same name to refer to the same entity. He was even thoughtful enough to mark his obfuscation with a comment, "/* redeclared here for clarity */". We all had a good laugh, except for the person that had spent a week trying to track down the bug caused by this stupid programmer mistake.

Working with FTX on Stratus, one day I decided to play around with the various implementations of FTP I had available to me, (AIX, HPUX, FTX, VOS).

I used to work with a programmer who seemed to name variables by whatever was on his mind -- or the radio. His code was littered with function, array, and variable names like: Jocko, Bunny, Coffee and Gilligan. 

So it was not uncommon when reading his handiwork to encounter code that used Jocko to index into Coffee after passing Bunny to Gilligan. ''Oh, now that's just '''wrong'''!''

He also preferred to copy code rather than to type it, and would grab a chunk that did something like he wanted to accomplish (comments and all), paste it where he was adding functionality, and then hack it until it worked (based on his definition of worked). I found this out when trying to understand what some Gilligan-like function was doing when I realized that a comment I was looking at, not only didn't refer to the program I was working on, but was from code in a program for another client altogether -- I know that because the other client's name was in still in the code of the client whose code I was looking at.

I recently ran across the following C function in production code:
 int xilinx_prog(softc_t *sc)
 {
	if ((sc->status & (XILINX_PROG | XILINX2_PROG)) !=
	(XILINX_PROG | XILINX2_PROG))
	return 0;
	return 1;
 }
After much staring and some refactoring, I finally came up with:
 int is_xilinx_programmed(softc_t *sc)
 {
	return (sc->status & XILINX_PROG) && (sc->status & XILINX2_PROG);
 }
This was in the same system that had undocumented utilities with argument checking code like:
 if (q == 1) {
	printf("Silly user, you must enter the correct syntax "
	"-i1 through 5 or\n -s1 through 5 and -d1 through 5\n");
	exit(0);
 }
''Neither of these examples is "ha-ha funny", and the first example isn't "peculiar funny", either; it's standard bit flag stuff. Woe unto any C programmer doing XILINX work who has trouble understanding the code as it was first written; you'd better brush up on your bit manipulations if you expect to understand XILINX devices, let alone C. Those who hate bit manipulation shouldn't be in that line of work.'' Look again. The author's problem was not with the use of bit masks (indeed, his solution shows that he understood them better than the original coder did), but with the facts that a) the comparison was poorly written (if nothing else, the original coder should have factored out the repeated bitwise OR term to a temp variable), and b) the if clause and the returns were '''completely unnecessary''', as the function was effectively returning a boolean based off of a single extended comparison. I agree that it wasn't funny, though, so much as sad. - JayOsako
* What? No. If you mean for efficiency, there's no need to factor out the repeated part, because the OR of the two flags is performed at compile time (or if the flags were variables -- they're not -- an optimizing compiler would easily factor out the repeated subexpression itself).
* Or if you meant that should be done for stylistic reasons, yes, it's generally not desirable to repeat things unnecessarily, but in this particular case it seems a matter of taste, because typically there would be similar code nearby that did things like
** (flag & (X | Y)) == (X) and
** (flag & (X | Y)) == (Y) and then finally as above,
** (flag & (X | Y)) == (X | Y)
** ...so that what looks like unnecessary repetition out of context, is often just part of an overall consistent coding pattern.
** There is then a second argument for hiding the pattern in a macro, but in this case again that would be a judgement call, not just automatically right or wrong.
* Using a conditional to return 0/1 rather than returning a boolean expression used to be '''necessary''' if the caller really needed 0 or 1, because long ago it wasn't guaranteed that TRUE would equal 1 -- this code may date back to that era.
* So I see no clear evidence that the code should necessarily be called badly written, nor evidence that the second author clearly understood bit masks better than the original coder.
* I do prefer returning a boolean expression directly, so I do like the rewrite, it just seems like a pretty minor thing to bring up as an example...was that really the worst piece of code that was run across on that project? If so then I am very impressed; usually there's lots and lots of code much worse than that.

''Suppose sc were volatile and reading the status cleared it.  Then the original code should remain.''

''The second example is somewhat lacking in context, but it looks like the point is that some hardware engineer chose somewhat opaque syntax - as they usually do.''

''The original code was perfectly reasonable for its context, and the replacement code isn't even sure to be functionally identical! The original test did a single read of a status register, an operation which can often have side effects in embedded systems, and then a single mask and comparison. The replacement does two separate read, mask, and compare operations...the second of which may end up testing a flag automatically cleared by the first. And as mentioned, explicitly returning 1 or 0 avoids problems with strange definitions of boolean values. True and false values weren't always standardized, and development environments for embedded systems are particularly prone to odd deviations from standards. The flags should be given a separate define to make things a bit clearer, but that's all.''

''So anyway, not funny, not peculiar; should be moved to a different page.''

From the JargonFile:

''The PDP-10 Reference Handbook (1969) contained a footnote on the first page of the documentation for DDT that illuminates the origin of the term:''

: ''Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1 computer in 1961. At that time DDT stood for "DEC Debugging Tape". Since then, the idea of an on-line debugging program has propagated throughout the computer industry. DDT programs are now available for all DEC computers. Since media other than tape are now frequently used, the more descriptive name "Dynamic Debugging Technique" has been adopted, retaining the DDT abbreviation. Confusion between DDT-10 and another well known pesticide, dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane C14H9Cl5 should be minimal since each attacks a different, and apparently mutually exclusive, class of bugs.''

: ''(The tape referred to was, incidentally, not magnetic but paper.) Sadly, this quotation was removed from later editions of the handbook after the suits took over and DEC became much more businesslike.''

[Obviously the name DDT originally came from the bug-killing pesticide, and "DEC Debugging Tape" was a BackroNym.]

One of my first programming projects was a POS (in either expansion of that acronym) in MsDos FoxPro for a local computer store I was working for in 1996. I was a bit more whimsical than I should have been; for example, the customer table was named 'suckers', while the employees table was 'slaves'; the main error handling function, 'oops', popped up a window named 'S_O_L'; and so forth. The project was never finished, but I held on to the code for ir's humor value; it can be seen at

  Ode to ARM040

  Yesterday I had a scare,
  I ran some code that wasn't there,
  It wasn't there again today;
  Oh, how I wish that it would stay.
----
Found in (my own) comments in a program, after an unusually detailed explanatory comment -

 * (I never trust internal program documentation)

And in another one.

 * I do not think this should happen -
 * (Looks like a desperation sledge-hammer catch-all redundant
 *	un-refactored solution implemented rabidly during testing)

The documentation was right this time.  -- PeterLynch

We sent the firmware of our device to the manufacturer in Japan who modified it to create the manufacturing tests. When we got it back I looked over it and had a surprise. They abbreviated their variables, but any variable that had the word "count" in it was abbreviated not by dropping the "ou" but just the "o". It was really hard to read that code with a straight face.

I once wrote a routine to kill all the child windows in a dialog and called it Commit_Infanticide. Unfortunately, since our code could be audited by clients, our QA manager made me change it to something less frivolous like Terminate_All_Children.

Which is followed shortly thereafter by:

I wrote in a nice StarTrek reference in a Python unit test module:

Code that puts multi threading to good use:
Thread.Sleep(700); // give the illusion that something significant happened
----
So we had this class, among the instance properties of which was a reference to an output stream that it would ultimately send - effectively - itself down.

The recipient then typically reset that stream to point to a new destination. However, it was typical for the old stream to need cleaning up (exactly how, needless to say, woud vary from stream type to stream type), so setting a new stream would begin by telling the old stream to do this.

So before the stream for the object to go down could be set, it had to be made ready. ReinitialiseOutputStream()? Nah...:

  public void Ready''''''SetGo()

A junior programmer (but with a Master's degree in a Venezuelan university) once wrote:

for(k=1;k<10;k++)
{
	if(k==1) { .... }
	else if (k==2){....}
	else if (k==3) {....}
...

}

-- it is very rude how you've approached this case.. and I don't see where is the problem. He should use switch instead of if(){} else if(){} but the logic is correct in my opinion.
and I don't have a Master's degree in a Venezuelan university

''The logic is correct; it's also pointless, unless there's something like a break statement somewhere in the ...'s.''

I don't know about the '''logic''', but I see often enough similar code written (or copy-pasted) by colleagues from India:

 for(coln = FIRSTCOLUMN; coln <= LASTCOLUMN; coln++)
 {
  switch(coln)
  {
	case FIRSTCOLUMN: <some stuff...> break;
	case SECONDCOLUMN: <some stuff...> break;
	<....>
	case LASTCOLUMN: <some stuff...> break;
	default: <error handling code> break;
  }
 }

Using the defined names you can reorder columns just by changing defines, but I still don't see the point.
Naturally, I remove all this alien code and write a strafe forward <stuff> (without for and switch), which is more readable, easier to debug and maintain.... and - not surprisingly enough - works just fine.

And believe it or not, I have seen a lot of similar examples on MSDN.

I saw an unfamiliar process hogging CPU, so I googled it:

* quote: "lSASS.EXE" is the Local Security Authentication Server. It verifies the validity of user logons to your PC or server...

Does this mean it verifies if somebody "'''is''' an '''ass'''"? (It's an "L", not an "I", but it can look like an I in certain fonts.)

''LSASS.EXE = "Local Security Authority Subsystem Service".  It should be noted that there are versions out in the wild that certainly behave as '''asses''' i.e.: isass.exe Trojan/virus/whatever, and lsass.exe running in the wrong place = Trojan.  I like your analogy of it deciding whether a person who attempts to logon is and ass or not! :)''
