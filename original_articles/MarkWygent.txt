Mark Wygent, who began marketing his reeds for the Great Highland Bagpipe in April, 1981, commenced piping instruction at the age of nine, in Detroit, Michigan. He introduced SYNTHE-DRONE(TM) drone reeds to the world's piping community in April, 1995, now widely acknowledged as the standard drone reed pattern of the modern era. Domestic and foreign patents were acquired for his latest drone reeds, SYNTHE-DRONE 2(TM) and DUATONE(TM), in September and August, 1998. A reedmaker for more than 25 years, Mark is the first U.S. citizen to hold both domestic and foreign patents for his innovative drone reed designs.
