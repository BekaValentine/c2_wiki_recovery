Paul Graham's web site at http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html includes code samples.

Broad description of the CommonLisp language.  Some overlap with (but newer than) the author's earlier and more advanced book, OnLisp.  Many examples.  Unusually well-written and enjoyable. The first two chapters are available at http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html in plain text form.  Chris Riesbeck of Northwestern University has excellent annotations to the text on his Intro to AI Programming course site:    http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/325/readings/graham/graham-notes.html
