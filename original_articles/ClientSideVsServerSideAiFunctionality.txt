Client-side (i.e. HTML/Javascript) bots require the knowledge and purchase of fewer computer languages but will not have access to certain functionalities - say RSS reading, ping commands, unless the developer replicates them or replaces them using simpler language.

Server-side (i.e. Java, C, Shell) bots have high functionality, but tend to be unsimplified equations, and require developer familiarity with multiple computer languages.  The developer is beholden to a server or a server emulator.


I'm confused with the focus/intent of this page. The title clearly has AiFunctionality in it, but says nothing on that topic.  It then makes he absurd position that client side requires fewer languages known than server side.  Server side you can get by with just one language, often called C.  HTML is just markup, but you need that to realistically use Javascript; that's already double.
