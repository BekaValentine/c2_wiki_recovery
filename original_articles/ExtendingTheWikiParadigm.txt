''This Wiki can be thought of, not just as the first wiki site, but also as the introduction of a whole new paradigm of personally communicated and organized information.
In its introductory form, ''this wiki'' has spawned '''all''' the subsequent wikis, and introduced a brand new way for people to interact with each other and with the information they may use collectively or personally within TheInternet.''  Also called the WikiWay.

We can share how the wiki paradigm can be extended, personalized, interconnected and interrelated with counterparts and with other paradigms extending the idea of linkages including Notions such as Extended Words, PaperPorting, OneNote, WikiWithMoreThanPages, WikiWithMoreThanUsers, and other potentially useful schemes. User interaction might expose simple ways this might facilitate each of us in making this happen during this first year of the second decade of the twentieth first century.

I'd like a more powerful filing system with some kind of user-defined categories and key-words. It's sort of a half-wiki-half-filing-system.

I'd also like relational-database-like (query) access to this filing system, including the categories and keywords. 

Maybe if we put our heads together, we can come up with the "FlikiBase": a swiss-army-dumping-ground for documents, notes, and attributes. If we could somehow mush together DynamicRelational, wiki's, and ideas from FileSystemAlternatives, maybe we can have it. Oh oh, ghost of Xanadu????
