A wiki-like site is a web site that has some or many of the characteristics of a wiki, but in fact is not a wiki. For example, it may use BumpyCase Words to create links, and it may have very limited formatting capabilities.

Such a site is most likely created by a wiki enthusiast who has realized that it makes content management a snap, but who doesn't want to open up the site to random edits by passers-by.
