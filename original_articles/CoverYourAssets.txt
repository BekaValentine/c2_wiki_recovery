Cover Your Assets AntiPattern:

Problem:  This AntiPattern is very similar to the AmbiguousViewpoint Anti-Pattern except that both the design team and management are now in armed camps ready to sue each other over issues that could have been resolved by a strong manager.

Solution:  Dump the design and management team members who won't let go of the issues and start over!  Sacred Cows make the Best Hamburgers! - Mike Addison

Trivia:

Actually Sacred Cows are usually near starvation. It is assumed that god provides for them, so humans don't. Sacred Cows are lean and sinewy.

Sacred Cows are sacred so they can not be eaten, so you can plow the fields when the weather improves; in context: be careful what you throw away, some customs are there for a reason, which you will only discover months later when you need to plow by hand.

Actually, in urban India cows have an important secondary function as part of the garbage removal system.
