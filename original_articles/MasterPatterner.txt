The school of wizards on the island of Roke has seven masters - two of them are the MasterNamer and the MasterPatterner. I've often wondered whether WardCunningham has read UrsulaLeGuin's EarthSea, because many of the ideas about systems of names, balances, and patterns are reflected there.

OK, I'll admit it: I've also wanted to be a MasterPatterner for far too long. -- JamesNoble

I would also nominate the DesignPatterns GangOfFour, naturally.
