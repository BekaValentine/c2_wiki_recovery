A triphop outfit based in Bristol. 

Songs of Note:
	* "Unfinished Sympathy" from the Blue Lines ablum
	* "Protection" from the equally-named album (get the Brian Eno remix if you can find it, from "The Protection Remixes", a semi-rare EP).
	* "Teardrop" from the Mezzanine album.
	* "Dissolved Girl" from Mezzanine.  (Also on TheMatrix Soundtrack)
	* "Inertia Creeps" from Mezzanine. Also on the Stigmata soundtrack.

Some members of the crew have come and gone.  Tricky left and went solo after the Protection album.  Despite their apparent turnover rate, they have retained a certain element of their sound.

They are a great show to see live.
