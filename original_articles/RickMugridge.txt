I'm reachable at: r.mugridge@cs.auckland.ac.nz

I have developed acceptance test frameworks for Web systems (IsisWebTester) and for socket-based servers (Sat, developed in Fit).  I was instrumental in introducing XP and TDD into project and lecture courses in Software Engineering at the UniversityOfAuckland, starting in 2001.  My medium-term aim is to bring TDD into the introductory programming course.

I consult in XP and TDD with local software companies.

Some recent papers on XP and TDD are at http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~rick/xpPapersResources.htm

I am attending XP2003, AgileDevelopment and XP/Agile Universe this year.
