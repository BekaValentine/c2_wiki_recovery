A GraphicalUserInterface wiki for MacOsx. WikiWord''''''s become links as soon as they're typed, and clicking on one opens that page in a new window. It can also act as a front-end for wikis which support their vpwikispec (such as vpwiki), and can export to HTML and other formats.

From the VoodooPad website:

"VoodooPad is a new kind of notepad. It's like having your own personal hypertext library, where you can jot down notes, web addresses, to-do lists... Anything on your mind. VoodooPad automatically links each page together, to form a miniature world wide web, on your desktop! Anybody familiar with the WikiWikiWeb will feel right at home with VoodooPad."
