I am JustaProgrammer at heart, obsessed with instilling sanity into the software development process.  To that end, I work as a senior technologist and agile practices coach, now independently (http://www.sanityinc.com/), and previously at companies such as ThoughtWorks.

I've helped clients in most corners of the industry, have dealt with more technologies, languages and politics than is typical, and have done so in Luxembourg, Munich, Sydney, London and elsewhere.  I am currently available for consulting and coaching work in Munich and elsewhere in Europe.

Learning new and productive languages keeps me interested in programming, and I wrote the PythonUnit testing framework (http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/) that is now found in the python standard library.  A long time advocate of open source projects, I tinker with various projects in languages including C, Ruby, Erlang and Common Lisp.

You can mail me with questions and unusual offers: stephen_purcell at yahoo dot com.

My non-consulting work is varied in nature:
* As an entrepreneur I run a popular online baby log service (http://sproglogs.com/) and a site that publishes news about celebrities and charities (http://www.looktothestars.org/)
* As professional black and white photographer I sell prints: http://www.purcellimages.com/
