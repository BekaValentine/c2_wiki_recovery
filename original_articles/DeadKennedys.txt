[WikiIsNotaDictionary - JelloBiafra grandfathered this one in.]

DKs was the quintessential (and most commercially successful) political punk band of the late 1970s. They speciallized in painfully overdriven hardware, screaming lyrics clearly and graphically aimed at professional hypocracy in all forms.

Hits included...

	* MTV Get off the Air
	* Nazi Punks Fuck Off
	* Holiday in Cambodia
	* Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables <-- an album
	* Kill the Poor (with a Neutron Bomb)
	* Police Squad

JelloBiafra seems to have run out of the manic energy required to front one of these 2-minute chestnuts. Nowadays he just sits at a mic and runs at the mouth regarding politics.
