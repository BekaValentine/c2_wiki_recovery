Started off at small developer-centric organisations where creative development, heroic programming and swift adaptation to changing requirements was the rule and formalities were at a minimum. A decade or so later, I'm now in the Large Corporation Dilbert-esque scheme of things where adherence to process dominates all other aspects of development. Progress? Hmmm.... 

Currently I'm technical lead on various projects related to aero-engine monitoring and management systems, which is a zillion times more interesting that any commercial stuff I've ever done. The downside is that I'm very much a Mapper working in a Packer controlled environment. (see MappersVsPackers) Also stuck with VisualBasic as language of corporate 'choice'. Not my choice, though, I'm currently getting to grips with Python, to supplement my C++ and C.

I first heard about XP on this site a few years ago and would love to work in a more agile environment but there seems a real lack of CompaniesDoingXp in my locality. There seems to be a lack of Agile Awareness in the UK in general.

BTW I'm based in Bristol, England. Anyone heard of a SW England Agile Development Group? If not, is there anybody else interested in getting one started?
