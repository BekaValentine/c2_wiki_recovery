Hi. You've probably come here from a page you authored that you just checked up on only to find that all the text was replaced with "DeletedAndRefactored to Page''''''Name". Don't panic! This is just some VolunteerHousekeeper's way of telling you that the content you added belongs on Page''''''Name.

If you think they made a mistake, just press EditText and then EditCopy to get back the original text of your page.
''(But please look at the other page first, because probably everything you typed was moved to the other page.)''

If you are happy with the change they made (or ''you'' made a spelling mistake or something), replace the current text of the page with the word "deleted".

If you are not the original creator of the page please wait a while before seconding the deletion to give the original author a chance to see this page.
