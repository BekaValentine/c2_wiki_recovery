What is Darwin? 

Darwin is the core of Mac OS X. The Darwin kernel is based on FreeBSD and Mach 3.0 technologies and provides protected memory and pre-emptive multitasking. Darwin runs on PowerPC-based Macintosh computers and a version is also available for x86-compatible computers.

''But is there any connection to CharlesDarwin?''  Not really.  Just another CodeName with connotations of improvement.
