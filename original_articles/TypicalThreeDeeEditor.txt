The typical 3d editors share much in common. 

The basic units of a 3d editor are:
* A ThreeDeeGraphics display (usually OpenGl, sometimes DirectDraw)
* A database of materials, models, and textures
* A set of scenes, where each scene contains a set of elements, which stores the material,model,texture, and transforms
* A GUI with element selection/modification
* A file format for the 3d documents

Additional units may be:
* Importing/Exporting of 3rd party formats, i.e. ModelLoading
* Various rendering modes - point,wireframe,flat,shaded,textured
* Clipboard with cut/copy/paste
* Select All/Invert/None
* Right button usually activates a context menu
* UnitTest''''''s for the display - HowToUnitTestOpenGlCalls

Standard tools usually include:
* Select and Rectangle select
* Transform/Rotate/Scale, and may include mirror/bend/twist/shear
* Paint

Element selection must be consistent:
* Left button usually selects an element
* Shift+Left = Add to selection
* Ctrl+Left - Remove from selection

Solved:
* Selection occurs on b1(down) as the choice between selecting and showing the relevant context menu would occur then
* If selection happens over a currently selected element - what is the behaviour? Simply select the new element
* If selection happens over multiple currently selected element - what is the behaviour? Select the singular

Unresolved:
* If the context menu activates differently when over an element, should the selection change? (I don't think so. . . )
* Should the selection be emptied if b1_down happens when not over an element? (have to see what others do. . . )
** Yes - Clears selection
** No - Retains selection, more user-friendly, allows better use of toolbars
