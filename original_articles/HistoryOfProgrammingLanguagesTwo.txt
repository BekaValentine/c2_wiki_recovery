I only bought it because of Wiki, to improve my own InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas and to counteract the tendency towards SoftwareAgeism.  Thanks for pointing to AlanKay's wonderful EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk here, whoever it was.

Plus there's FredBrooks' key-note. The guy has the cheek to use two of my favorite NewAnalogiesForSoftware in talking, as a self-confessed outsider, of the whys and wherefores of language design: JrrTolkien and JohannSebastianBach. LanceWalton has much the same take as FredBrooks on Bach's humility being key to his greatness as a 'designer', a viewpoint that really inspired me back in 1999. (Since then I got proud and failed again.) -- RichardDrake

The material on ChuckMoore and ForthLanguage is wonderful too.  Interesting how his approach resonates with XP.  The history of Algol is a fun read also. Great book. -- MichaelFeathers

	 :	The Forth material (from the HOPL II conference) is also available on the Forth, Inc. website: http://www.forth.com/Content/History/History1.htm (some quotes are copied in ForthValues).
