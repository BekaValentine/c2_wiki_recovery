'''Users' comments'''
''I managed to get a configuration working under Tomcat 4.0.1 on Windows NT in 10 minutes. This was a very simple configuration without version control and using plain text files but I was very impressed. I managed to install a test version on http://www.mycgiserver.com/~yorks, though this required some modification because of my cgiserver's restrictions (no user libraries, fixed package names etc.)'' 

''I've just downloaded and installed this in about 10 minutes using BEA Weblogic running on Solaris. As with the above, I'm only using the default configuration, but I'm really pleased with how easy it was.'' -- [LeighDodds]

''This is really good Wiki, simple and nice.'' -- beetles

''How do you install on http://www.mycgiserver.com?'' -- paulista777@bol.com.br
''http://www.oxxus.net We offer wiki Jsp hosting'' 

''I also downloaded this, my first wiki software, and had it running in 10 minutes on W2K. I was impressed. I was also happy to find that it used JSP. That allowed me to go in and tinker with it when I had time. Also changed to VersioningFileSystem so that it can keep track of changes. Within one day I had a functioning wiki site for managing a current IT project.'' -- kenjanuski

''http://www.prokmu.com We began our campaign to offer 1 month free for wiki Jsp hosting''

I just installed and configured on Solaris 10 and it took little time to setup and works well. I started with the roller/jspwiki demo that the Sun jroller people put out, this led me to jspWiki. Simple elegant and works well. We are going to go live after a few more days testing for our inhouse use. http://rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20050420#try_roller_1_1_it

* ''Review Quality:'' Reasonable. I have installed used and written extensions for this Wiki.

* ''Standard Features Missing:'' None (written before standard list finalized)

----
'''Software'''

* ''Standard Features Missing:'' None

----
'''WikiFarms'''

* ''Name / cost / limits / URL / backup schedule / comments:'' None Known, though with slight modification can run on mycgiserver free JSP hosting site. Changes were necessary as mycgiserver does not allow user libraries, runs all JSPs in a single context and has restrictions on package names. It also uses its own logging api. These mods took about 2 hours, email me if you want a copy of the changed code.

----
'''Content'''

* ''Display WardsWiki text?'' No - the markup is based on SenseisLibrary see http://www.ecyrd.com/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=TextFormattingRules

* ''Text formatting rules:'' See http://www.ecyrd.com/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=TextFormattingRules

* ''Tables?'' yes, using | between fields.

* ''Images?'' yes (configurable to allow images of different types or from different sites.

* ''Diffs:'' yes - uses diff format.

----
'''Security'''

* ''Rollback:'' Not within Wiki, the administrator could use the native rcs rollback.

* ''Delete Snapshots?'' Not within Wiki, the administrator could use the native rcs 

----
'''Extendability'''

Very modular, you can write plug-in page providers. An RCS provider and a flat file provider are available. Pages are stored as the Wiki Markup by these providers. I wrote an experimental J2EE container manages entity bean provider, and a caching provider and extending the code is easy. Janne has written a well structured program and his code is easy to follow.

* ''Pages can be added / deleted from directory and wiki will recognize automatically?'' Yes (File system provider)

* ''Import / Export Features:'' No special features.

* ''Translators to/from other Wikis?'' None

----
'''Miscellaneous'''

* ''Extra Features:'' Unicode support. With a browser that supports UTF-8 could hold text in non-latin alphabets. Ability to edit menus (I have disabled this on my version - it gives too much power to the user!)

* ''References:'' http://www.jspwiki.org/

* ''Browsers Used: (See WikiEngineReviewBrowsersUsed for abbreviations)'' 
	 :	IE5.5, http://www.jspwiki.org/wiki/JSPWikiBrowserCompatibility contains comments on many more browsers

* ''Comments by Users:''

* I have used jspWiki over the years for the main wiki of various projects.  It works very well.  I have also made up a product which is a fully functional jspwiki on a memory stick, which will start up on pc and mac.  If you would like one of these memory stick project wikis which you just plug-in and go, let me know at noelbbyrne@gmail.com.
