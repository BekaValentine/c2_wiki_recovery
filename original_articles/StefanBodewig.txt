I'm working for a company that describes itself as focussed on
multimedia applications of all kinds. My main job is Java development (mostly web based applications) and trying to bring some ExtremeProgramming practices into the company.

In one of my other lifes I'm involved in a couple of OpenSource software projects, currently you can find me working on the JDBC driver of the FreeTds project (http://www.freetds.org/) and the JakartaProject. I've been told that one can still find some traces of my work in GnuPlot (http://www.gnuplot.org/) which I left around 1995. I'm a member of the
ApacheSoftwareFoundation.

Most of my current programming time in the OpenSource world is devoted to ApacheAnt - I'm the one who committed the first JavaUnit testcases for Ant and one of the original authors of Ant's optional <junit> task.

I ''knew'' that whoever was working on the Ant/JUnit integration had to be on the Wiki (and would reply to Kent's concerns in JakartaProject).

'' '''to be on Wiki''' would be too strong, I come here every now and then.''

Interestingly, Stefan, I have used all of the software you mention above in the past month ! I'm quite impressed with FreeTds, which manages to be much more efficient in terms of memory management than Sybase's own JDBC driver.

''To be honest, you can't really compare FreeTDS and Sybase's own driver, FreeTDS is still in its infancy and maybe it doesn't use as much memory because of missing features or strange limitations.''
