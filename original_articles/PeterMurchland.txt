I am a strategic consultant, assisting clients to align business and information strategies.  My fields of interest include StrategicPlanning, EnterpriseArchitecture, BusinessProcessManagement, InformationSociety planning, ElectronicCommerce and KnowledgeManagement.

In 1998/1999, I was working with a group of people to design the necessary conditions for the emergence of a KnowledgeEcologyNetwork.  It was during these discussions that DenhamGrey drew my attention to this site, and suggested that it should be considered for pursuing KnowledgeAnnealing and as a tool for developing a DisTinctionary.

My family and I live in Adelaide (pop 1.1m) in South Australia - see http://www.sacentral.sa.gov.au for more information about SA
