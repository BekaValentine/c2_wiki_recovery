Sometimes it is useful [in RiskManagement] to make a RiskTree, decomposing risks you encounter down to a level where they are easier to manage. This can help target RiskReduction resources. We found too that some very different risks had similar or identical reduction strategies. That was sweet since doing one set of risk reduction helped in reducing multiple risks. --DaveVanBuren.....
