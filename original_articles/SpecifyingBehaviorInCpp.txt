The FRP code discussed in the paper is available as part of a project called XVision2 - see http://www.cs.jhu.edu/CIRL/XVision2/ .

A further report gives more detail of the operation of the FRP code : http://www.cs.jhu.edu/CIRL/publications/pdf/DaHaPeTR2010frp.pdf

This is concerned with the implementation of FunctionalReactiveProgramming using CeePlusPlus. The paper references the work of M''''''cNamara and Smaragdakis known here as FunctoidsInCpp.

I am now getting the FRP going and want to compare it with the FC++ approach.
