A list compiled by WorldBlu of companies that work based on democratic principles (even if they do not follow the same democratic principles).


In order for an organization to be on the WorldBlu List of Most Democratic Workplaces™, employees throughout the organization are surveyed using the online WorldBlu Democratic Workplace Scorecard™. The WorldBlu Scorecard evaluates an organization from these two angles:

*  WIDE - 10 PRINCIPLES. The WorldBlu Scorecard evaluates an organization based on ten principles of organizational democracy such as the level of transparency, accountability, decentralization, and choice practiced throughout the organization.
* DEEP - 3 LEVELS. The WorldBlu Scorecard evaluates how well an organization practices these ten principles of organizational democracy on an individual level, leadership level, and systems and processes level.

The study to detemine if a place is democratic has a cost, and provides benefits suchs as inclusion in the list of most democratic places.... I wonder.... shouldn't a company it only make it in to that list IF it is actually democratic? But I does not not seem like so based on what appears on their page...
