The first edition of this book (ISBN 0596001673) is a delightful read. It teaches PythonIdioms and what's "Pythonic" by its examples. It greatly increased my love of the Python language itself. Now that I'm learning PerlLanguage, I appreciate Python's "batteries included" philosophy, as exemplified in this book, even more. -- ElizabethWiethoff
