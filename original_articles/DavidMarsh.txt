I live in Sydney, Australia (Came here for Job, blah blah).  At the moment my favorite OperatingSystem''''''s are SlackwareLinux and OpenBsd, but I really should give DebianGnuLinux, FreeBsd and GnuHurd a try too (curse this lack of spare machines :)

Now for some WikiOnWiki... I found this wiki while looking for some way to store documentation at my workplace.  Took some time, but after trying several complex alternatives, the simplicity of WikiWiki grew on me, I guess I have become infected by WikiZen and WabiSabi.

update 20020402: Currently helping to build a Sydney wide wireless network.  See http://sydneywireless.com

update 20070306: Stll trying to get a wiki into my place of work, It's slow going but I'm getting a few converts.  I can't believe I've been trying for over 5 years! Most of the personal stuff above no longer applies.  I've found a real affecton for AppleComputer hardware and MacOsx, but I do have a soft spot for UbuntuLinux.

update 20110504: I'm not dead yet!
