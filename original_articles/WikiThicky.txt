''(Was deleted, now restored. I think this page is of non-zero value)''

Someone relatively new to WardsWiki who has yet to develop an understanding and sophistication equal to more experienced wiki'ites. A term first used by DaveSteffe to describe himself. Dave was suggesting that a WikiThicky could benefit from WikiPairing to grow in Wiki know how.

Hmm...not too polite methinks, perhaps WikiNewbie, WikiLearner, WikiGrasshopper, etc might be good. -- ChanningWalton

''Best applied to oneself rather than others, I'd agree. Unless you know them especially well.''

Everybody on Wiki is a WikiThicky.  It's just that some of us are thicker than others.  Some have thick craniums; some have thick skin; some have thick waists.

last edit on September 20, 2002 -> does this page still has non-zero merit? It has not yet become linked more.

''Someone has now started signing a lot of trivial contributions with this, I suppose, to support keeping this page.  I vote to delete.''
