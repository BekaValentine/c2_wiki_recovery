Cuss words are words that have some sort of negative connotation in a particular setting or amongst a particular group.

They also generally have multiple definitions and uses as different parts of speech.

''Or, simply, within a particular language?''

Is 'cuss' a word used in all cultures? Or is this an AmericanCulturalAssumption? I would say maybe SwearWord or maybe 'to curse' is close.

''"Cuss" is an alteration of "curse".  Maybe based upon US Southern pronunciation.''
