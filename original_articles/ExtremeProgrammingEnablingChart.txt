How are metaphors necessary for release planning???

''Not being the originator, so not speaking definitively, the white hexagons are the business side. Without metaphors the business people are unlikely to understand the proposals made by the programmers concerning release planning. Metaphors may be necessary to help the business people plan which parts of the system are worked on, and therefore release, first.''
