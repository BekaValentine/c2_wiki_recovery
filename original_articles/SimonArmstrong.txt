I'm a curious cat.

I've just released a public beta of my new PC racing game called Skidmarks Construction Kit.

There is a demo at http://www.acid.co.nz/skidmarks/skidbeta1.zip, if you like the game please consider joining the beta testing group at http://www.acid.co.nz/skidmarks/signup.html.

I'd like to setup my own Wiki for writing a book about programming in BlitzBasic.

I'm going to try installing the perl script tomorrow, i don't care what my sysadmin says!

Yes, that did it, including not too painful tab handling java script, now back to work!

I have also written my own JavaVirtualMachine that runs on a SonyPlaystation.

I'm currently coding a game in Blitz3D a BASIC variant for developing DirectX applications.

My sporadic development diary is here: http://acid.co.nz/cgi-acid/wizzy.pl?AcidDevelopmentDiary

''Wow, I'd love to learn more about that!  There are great articles about PS2 type devices as a wonderful stepping stone to the post-PC world on ArsTechnica and in Cringeley's archives.  I've been going round in circles searching for any information about homebrew Linux on PS2 without success.  Your JVM is something I'd really really enjoy using and possibly collaborating to enhance!''

I've got a browser running in it but it can't jump from page to page cos I'm so anal I have to write javascript engine to handle page redirects rather than kludging them in. PS2 is too firstworld for me, I would prefer to focus on PS1 R3000 2Meg as an avenue to provide lowcost friendly computing solutions in the sub $150 area.---SimonArmstrong

Now I have managed to implement a Wiki derived from WikiBase, learned some perl and added some features that my company requires I am interesting in researching the design of a RealtimeWiki solution that would allow multiple users to edit the same page with realtime update of all edits on all views. 

''Check out the ArsDigitaCommunitySystem, free from http://www.arsdigita.com.  (Ignore everything before the version 4 rewrite in Java, before that is ingenious ideas implemented in tangled spaghetti.)  I think it would be possible to modify ACS to do Wiki style edits and that may more robust than trying to extend Wiki.''

''Si, I have been talking with Darren (Roboforge) and he gave me your name, but no email :((. I want to talk about some PPC games that we are looking for developers to help us build (if you are interested). Leave a message here, and I'll check back. -- ScottJudson''
