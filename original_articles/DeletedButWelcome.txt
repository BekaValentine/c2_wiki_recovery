Greetings!

You probably came here from a recently created page marked with the '''D''''''eletedButWelcome''' notification.

If you created the page, welcome to Wiki! Please understand we meant no harm in deleting your page. In fact, we're delighted to have you join our community. However, the page you created seemed to be just a test page or a placeholder for future content, rather than a new piece of permanent content. 

If it was a test, congratulations - you succeeded in creating a page. In future, please use the WikiWikiSandbox for testing.

Did we understand your intentions correctly?

''Yes, it was meant to be a test.''

	 :	If we guessed correctly, you can help us to complete the deletion. Go back to the test page and replace "''D''''''eletedButWelcome''" with "''delete''". Once you press the ''Save'' button, the test page will disappear permanently. You have helped us to complete the cleanup of an unwanted page.

''No, we moved too quickly.''

	 :	We misread your intentions. Don't panic about lost data; it can still be reclaimed. Feel free to go back to the page and fill in your old content (it should be in the EditCopy), perhaps accompanied by a bit more explanation so nobody else will mistake it for a test page.

If you're new to the wiki concept, please have a look at the StartingPoints for more information on what this is all about. (You can ask questions at WikiHelpDesk.) If you think you're going to stick around, why not create a WikiHomePage with your RealName and add a little info about yourself.

'''Notes for WikiGnome''''''s'''

If you're not the person who created the page, please wait a day or two before seconding this deletion, so that the original poster will have time to see this message. Also consider using DeletedButWelcome yourself when deleting test pages; it keeps Wiki a welcoming environment for newcomers, while still taking care of sandbox cruft. 

You might also see that the person who created the page needs a little personal help, so you might give it instead of placing an impersonal and somewhat intimidating message. Something like: ''Welcome to Wiki! You seem interested in this technology - if you have some questions or if I can be of any help, please feel free to leave me a message on my HomePage. -- Your''''''Name'' This is a way which will encourage new potential writers, since a welcoming and interactive approach might just be what it takes to change an inquisitive tester who has shown interest in this place into an individual who will eventually contribute ReallyValuablePages.

If the page seems to be a HomePage, but is lacking in content, apply the tag FlyingVisitor, as in: ''Welcome to Wiki. Are you a FlyingVisitor?''
