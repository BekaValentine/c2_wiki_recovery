A little about myself: Well, where should I begin.  I am a 35 year old mother of three teenage boys, Shane,Shaun and Justin.  A friend and myself are trying to start a small business.  The business being interior decorating and eventually design as well. The business will be called Tranquil Elegance.  What we would like to one day specialize in is the Feng Shui concept.  

Anyone knowing any good schools that specialize in this please email Tranquilelegance@hotmail.com
