Computers are a fad.  Nobody will be using them anymore in five years.  --NickBensema

Who needs the bloody stress?  Time to become a forest ranger in the middle of nowhere.  ''I'm sure forest rangers use computers these days, too.''

We're only going to sell five of them anyway. -- Thomas Watson

''Don't forget that SoftwareIsReallyPointless.''

Invest heavily in filing-cabinet, slide-rule, and shipping technologies.  Those are the best alternatives to computers.

"I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I'd used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime. ... if you want to write to me about any topic, please use good ol' snail mail and send a letter to the following address: Prof. Donald E. Knuth ..."

Knuth hasn't given up on computers, just email. ( GiveUpOnEmail ).

It makes me wonder how some one who has given up on computers can post on this wiki - did someone else type the message in?

''I would come up with a real snappy retort to that but I can't read what you said without a monitor or computer.''

''I whistle into the phone line.''

I place my hand on the cord and ''feel'' the bits...

''I have the pages sent to me in prison.''

I have a funnel on the end of a coax cable and I yell into it "ONE" "ONE" "ZERO" "ONE".  After each bit I need to wait for an ACK.

I can't GiveUpOnComputers really, because, I suffer from WikiAddiction..
