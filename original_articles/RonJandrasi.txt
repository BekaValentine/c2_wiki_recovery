Hi, Ron. Nice to see your brief reappearance here. I've been reading KimStanleyRobinson's climate change trilogy (''Forty Signs of Rain'', ''Fifty Degrees Below'', ''Sixty Days and Counting''), and it occurs to me you might enjoy his Frank Vanderwal character. Hope all is well. -- ElizabethWiethoff
