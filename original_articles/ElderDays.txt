The period from roughly from 1960 to 1974, during which the vast majority of the standard algorithms, protocols, paradigms and methodologies now in use were first developed, if only in nascent form. Such basic innovations as  StructuredProgramming, FunctionalProgramming (both statically and dynamically typed), ObjectOrientedProgramming, LogicProgramming, RelationalDatabases, pointing devices such as the mouse, the joystick, the trackball and the GraphicsTablet, early forms of the GraphicalUserInterface, OsVirtualization, the PersonalComputer, HyperText (or at least the use of a computer to implement it), visual text editors,  networking, TimeSharing, microprocessors, and ComputerGame''''''s (especially SpaceWar and AdventureGame), were first developed. 

The end of the ElderDays was marked by two sets of unrelated events: changes in the funding policies of ARPA and several other government projects in the US and elsewhere; and the introduction of the earliest MicroComputer and WorkStation systems.
