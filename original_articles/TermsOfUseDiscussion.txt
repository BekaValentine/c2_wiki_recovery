Let's cut this down to the essentials. Anon says he's not banned; he is. It was announced in January, and he acknowledged it. Here's an example:

	 :	"As I'm sure you are all aware, the person who used to post as 82-44-94-98.cable.ubr04.croy.blueyonder.co.uk... is now using OpenProxy addresses to continue to post here, despite the announced HardBan." January 20th, 2006.
	 :	"Quite right too - as long as proxies are available, I will continue..." -- Anonymous vandal, the same day.

Anon's ISP has advised me to take this matter to the police. I am going to.

No further conversation with the vandal will be undertaken. Further comments by the vandal will be deleted on sight. I invite all users to help in doing so. -- EarleMartin
