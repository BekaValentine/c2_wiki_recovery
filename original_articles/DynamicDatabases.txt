I am interested in the idea of dynamic databases. These are databases that tend to be free-form, have dynamically expandable "cells", dynamic schemas, and can represent complex graphs well if need be.

Examples may include:

* Zog database (see WikiWikiOrigin)

* MultiParadigmDatabase ("dynamic relational" or "predicate database")

* Hierarchical file systems with optional cross-links

I don't know if text indexing systems fully count. A database generally has well-defined "cells" or containers. Text indexing generally focuses on content and proximity rather than deal with well-defined contains outside of "document".

Perhaps a better name for this topic would be DynamicDbms. But, I don't really like it because it is harder to read in wiki form. Vote?
