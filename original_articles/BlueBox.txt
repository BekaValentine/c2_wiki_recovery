	 :	BlueBox is a browser that makes scalable language creation a reality.	With BlueBox, programmers write language structures known as words and post them on the Internet. As more and more words are posted in domains like mathematics, art, and finance, the language grows in richness and power. BlueBox compiles documents written in these words into the technology of a user's choice -- be it Perl, Python, C++, a COM component, etc.

There's this: http://web.archive.org/web/20060116164248/http://bluebox.sourceforge.net/BlueBox-0.2.tgz ...I can't try it out right now, though.

With the advent of 5ESS, blue-boxing became extremely easy to detect, and therefore has fallen out of favor in the phreaking community.
