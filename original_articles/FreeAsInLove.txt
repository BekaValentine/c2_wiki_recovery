The FreeSoftwareFoundation talks about its charges as FreeAsInSpeech instead of FreeAsInBeer. But in fact free software is FreeAsInLove. My software cares about all your software, wants to play with all your media, and can't be happy unless your software works happily too. OpenSource is about FreeAsInLove!

Also note that FreeAsInLove abbreviates to FAIL. This may be considered either seriously or humorous, depending of your sense of humor (or sense of seriousness).
