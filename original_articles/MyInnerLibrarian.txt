MyInnerLibrarian is one of the cacaphonic, nagging, internal voices. Its message is that similar things belong together and, once the groups are made, items ''should'' be alphabetized or listed in time series. Perhaps it's genetic; two of my sibs and sibs-in-law are professional librarians. (I wonder what the genetic link between sibs-in-law and me might be? --GeorgeBrower

The usage pattern of document storage systems such as WinFs and GnomeStorage is to keep everything in a bag, and then view/find things as queries (a.k.a search results).

What this helps, once you've got that, MyInnerLibrarian must become MyInnerGraffitiArtist, because the task is no longer to file things, but to tag them with appropriate metadata so you can find them again. Every iTunes fan knows the smart playlists become really useful if (a) you've got correct ID3 tags, and (b) you've added at least some metadata (especially ratings) to your songs.
