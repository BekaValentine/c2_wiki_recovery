A traveling wave tube (TWT) is a high-tech vacuum tube. TWTs are used as high-power microwave amplifiers in:

	* Satellites (DirecTV, DirecPC, pagers, telephones, XMradio, etc.)
	* Military radar systems (missile guidance, aircraft / missile tracking, jamming systems)
	* Civilian radar systems
	* Civilian microwave radios (e.g. British "Marconi" system)

Two excellent off-line texts on TWTs are:

	* Jim Hansen's ''TWT / TWTA Handbook'', published in 1992 by what is now L-3 Electron Technologies (EDD). The handbook is written (and illustrated) for non-physicists, such as potential customers and new technicians fresh out of high school. Excerpts are on-line at http://www.twtas.com/abouttwt.htm. [Broken link, but available via the WaybackMachine]
	* Scott Gilmour. ''Principles of Traveling Wave Tubes.'' [ISBN 0-89006-720-1] Written at the level of an upper-division college physics course. Prerequisite: Electromagnetism.

EDD also makes the Xenon Ion Propulsion System (XIPS). NASA used these IonThruster''''''s to propel the Deep Space 1 probe. Boeing uses them to keep its new satellites in orbit.  http://www.twtas.com/pictures/factorywalk/xips/xipspage.html  [Broken link, but available via the WaybackMachine]

When I worked on Marconi microwave radios (late 60s, early 70s) I had to go to a special tech school (High Wycombe) to learn how that stuff worked as opposed to the Lenkurt klystrons I was used to.  Bloody science fiction.  Very cool stuff.  Helical coil of thin wire running down the inside of a finger-sized glass (vaccuum) tube with a large metal head.  Sleeved in a jacket of silicone grease.  Tuned by rotating the tube along its axis for max gain.

I'd like to say I fully understood how it worked, but that's more hubris than I can muster just now.  I could keep it alive and keep working levels and do the maintenance and repair on the racks, but actually grasping the electro-math that ran it was something else.  Hats off to whoever figured out how to make a useful RF amplifier/modulator with it.

We pronounced it "twot" in our organization.
