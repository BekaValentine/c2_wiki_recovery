A feature of WordPerfect wherein at the stroke of the Alt-F3 key combination, the document is displayed in a panel as a text document with visible markup, markup which is ''editable''. Turning on "Reveal Codes" makes finding and correcting tricky formatting problems in WordPerfect a breeze (at least for those who know how to use the feature).

WordPerfect's editor makes sure that the markup remains well-formed: if you insert a "start underline" tag it also inserts an "end underline" tag. Deleting one deletes the other as well.
