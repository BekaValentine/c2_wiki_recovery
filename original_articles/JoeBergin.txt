I am an educator teaching at PaceUniversity in New York City. I have been interested in ObjectOrientation since 1985 and in patterns since I was nearly trampled when the GangOfFour book was released at OOPSLA.

My interest in patterns covers PedagogicalPattern''''''s, ElementaryPattern''''''s, ethical dimensions of patterns, getting to pattern languages, and how ChristopherAlexander's work can be made more relevant to our own. 

I have an extensive web site, of use mostly to educators, at http://csis.pace.edu/~bergin/, and can be reached by email at mailto:jbergin@pace.edu
