Python on PalmOs (PalmPilot, Visor, etc.). Very complete. Easy to enter using graffiti.

PipPy is a very limited implementation of Python: 
	* there is no user input (you can only output text)
	* you can store your defs in memopad records and load them from there

From OoEnvironmentForPalm:
''I've been giving PipPy a go. It's pretty nice. I'm still trying to figure out how to use the forms features, and I trying to find a way to repackage programs written in PipPy for distribution to non technical users.''

''The project seems to be frozen. Although there is a live forum 
( http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=168448 )
at sourceforge project page and sources are available.'' -- MaxBelugin

With a little bit of work, you can make PipPy a semi-reasonable development environment for python
	* Set up a new category in Memo Pad called "Python" (case sensitive)
	* Add a new shortcut, the content should be "import memoimp; memoimp.install();".  I call mine "pip"
	* make a memo called #startup.py with a function that performs imports that are necessary for your project
	* update the "pip" shortcut to import the startup.py module and execute the function

Now it should be easy to bounce back and forth between memo pad and PipPy, for rapid palm development.  This is great when you are on the bus/train/plane and want to hack some code.   Combine this with a custom AvantGo channel that grabs the content of your favorite python documentation, and you are really getting somewhere.  You could even go so far as to install PalmWiki and make all of your comments WikiWord''''''s for deeper documentation.
