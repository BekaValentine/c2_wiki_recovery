Technical note:  The final document was actually adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 2, and published on the 4th.
But perhaps only the president, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, signed that day.  The final signature, Thomas M''''''cKean, was not affixed until several years later.

''Indeed, as in this wonderful quote from news.com. "some tech workers in other countries will not use Independence Day as an excuse to liberate themselves from their desks. ". Really, how inconsiderate. Perhaps it's because it's not their Independence Day? http://news.com.com/2100-1017-940653.html''
