from "The Four Freedoms of an Empowering Software Development Environment" by Norman L. Kerth (available at http://c2.com/doc/ppm.pdf):

	* freedom to recognize and observe what is rather than what others want you to see,
	* freedom to ask about puzzles,
	* freedom to acknowledge and talk about what's coming up for you,
	* freedom to talk about not having any of the above freedoms.
