A ScienceFiction novel by JohnBrunner, set in a dystopian future; generally accepted as a classic, and a foundation stone of CyberPunk.

In it, Brunner coins the idea of the computer worm, and the laser printer! See SuccessfulScienceFictionProphecies.

The book has impressive intellectual pedigree: the nature of the future society, and some of the key currents of the plot, are drawn from AlvinToffler's 'FutureShock', and the utopian town of Precipice is based on the theories of ChristopherAlexander.
