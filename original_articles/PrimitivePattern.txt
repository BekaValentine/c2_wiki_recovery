PrimitivePattern, in my world view, participates in a Composite structure, with AbstractPattern as a parent and ComposedPattern and PrimitivePattern as descendents.

Can someone help me out with the wiki links here? I'd like to show the connection to the Composite pattern described in the Object Structural section of the Gang-of-four book, starting on page 163. In this case, its a pattern of patterns...

I view a "Pattern" as a generator of one or more related classes, methods, and so on.

Yes. I've certainly come across patterns that fit into
this structure --- although I'd prefer to call them ClientServerPatterns
or CollaboratingPatterns than CompositePattern.
