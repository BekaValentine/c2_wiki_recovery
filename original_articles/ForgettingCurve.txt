''ForgettingCurve'', a term coined by OliBye to describe the experience of getting used to VisualAge, and later SmallTalk, and so forgetting about source files. -- SteveFreeman

I'm glad to see I'm not the only one. I can't re-adjust properly to the JavaLanguage source code / subdirectory game.

The term ForgettingCurve immediately made sense to me, but in a different way: some things are hard to learn (steep learning curve), but once you gain a deeper understanding, easy to remember (e.g. some aspects of CeePlusPlus); others are just as hard to learn, but more easily forgotten, because they are more arbitrary (AccidentalComplexity). -- FalkBruegmann
