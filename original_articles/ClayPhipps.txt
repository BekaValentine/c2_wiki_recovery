ClayPhipps is the webmaster for Upwelling (dot) org (''indeed he was, but other priorities intervened, and the domain got squatted in the interim.  Sigh'').

His formal academic background is in the design and implementation of programming languages. He has developed, maintained - or participated in the development team - for
* 3 Pascal compilers (PascalLanguage), including 2 heavily extended to support system programming on superminicomputers;
* 1 C compiler (CeeLanguage);
* 1 FORTRAN-77 compiler optimizer (FortranLanguage) for a CDC (ControlData) vector-processing mainframe;
* 1 set of assembler macros to allow PL/I programs to transparently call InternationalBusinessMachines S/360 (IbmSystemThreeSixty) Assembler H code;
* 1 heavily used subset of C low-level library routines to schedule them for pipelining by a high-performance microprocessor;
* 1 object-code optimizer (i.e.: an optimizer whose ''input'' is object-code), to circumvent the high-overhead procedure-call instruction on the CDC Cyber 180 (CdcCyber); and
* 1 ''awk'' emulator (AwkLanguage) in C, to dramatically speed up a simulator for a high-performance microprocessor.

He was an official ''observer'' for the Joint X3J9/IEEE P770 Pascal Standards Committee (PascalLanguage) and the X3J2 BASIC Standards Committee (BasicLanguage).

Here on the WikiWikiWeb, he was initially focused on elaborating pages on a few programming languages.  But shortly, there seemed a need to create (new) pages related to various computer manufacturers.  Although that effort evoked at least 1 (anonymous) inquiry, he focused for a while on them because their identity seemed ''relevant'', e.g.: for hardware features that compilers were designed to showcase, or for programming languages unique to them, or for the popularity of particular programming languages within various manufacturers' user communities. --C.P.
