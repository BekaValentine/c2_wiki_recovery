IntermediaFromIris was created at Brown University by the Institute for Research, Information, and Scholarship (IRIS). Contributors to Intermedia included NormMeyrowitz, BernHaan, CharlieEvett, MattEvett, KenUtting, TomStambaugh, PaulKahn, NicoleYankelovich, and others.

Intended for use by scholars, it supported a variety of media, including text, graphics, images, and video. Users could add links, annotate links, add documents, and so on.

Intermedia kept link information in a database separate from the information being linked. This had several advantages, including:

	* Easy to link to read-only media
	* Links can be remote from targets
	* Link access can be faster than media access

Unfortunately, the Intermedia links are disappearing from the Web. Intermedia was described in the literature, including the 1986 and 1987 OOPSLA proceedings.
