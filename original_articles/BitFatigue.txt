BitFatigue is a temporary affliction that occurs after a developers has been reverse engineering the bits of too many hex dumps. Symptoms include mental flashes of "okay . . . wait. . . now is bit 3 a value of 4, do I mask it or check to see if it's equal. . . <aaaarrggghg>"

The only cure for BitFatigue is to StepAwayFromTheKeyboard for a while.

Been there, done that.  What the above doesn't mention is that the "okay . . . now is bit 3 a value . . ." bit occurs during things which normally have nothing to do with hex dumps.  Writing out a time sheet, for instance, or deciding which road to take home.
