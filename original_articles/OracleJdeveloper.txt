Oracle JDeveloper is a Java and XML development environment from Oracle. It has a good level of support for database development (not just Oracle), web services, J2EE development (including JavaServerFaces), and UML modeling. For Java developers, the built in profiling, codecoach (runtime analysis) and debugging tools are particularly useful. Since the 9.0.5 release, JDeveloper has combined a bunch of useful frameworks (OracleBusinessComponentsForJava, UIX) for building J2EE applications into the Application Development Framework (ADF).

Older versions of JDeveloper (3.2.3 and earlier) were based on licensed BorlandJbuilder code. It's a common misconception that JDeveloper is still just "JBuilder with knobs on". The IDE was completely rewritten by Oracle in JavaLanguage from scratch in 1999. Another common misconception is that JDeveloper is only useful for Oracle coding.
