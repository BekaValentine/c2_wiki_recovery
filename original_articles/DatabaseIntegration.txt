Database Integration is the process of integrating systems at the database level.  


It is one of the three techniques of EnterpriseApplicationIntegration. The good news is that most modern applications have ways you can get directly at the database (via StructuredQueryLanguage).  

The bad news is that you can't share BusinessProcess''''''es when you use Database Integration.

This is great when you have systems which use a common database and can all use SQL.  Some systems aren't set up in this manner (notably, the systems which require lots of COBOL hacking just to dig up the data you need).

WhatHappened since page last updated in July 2000? I have heard of an IbmCorporation led Xperanto initiative from an Infoworld article in 2003, but have not heard anything since. Flash in the pan? --dl

Maybe in 2004 DatabaseIntegration should be renamed as '''Data''''''Integration''' instead? I am thinking of nontraditional data sources such as security services, Rss feeds, etc.
