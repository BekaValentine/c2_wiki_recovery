This is a place for folk who would like to receive critiques of their writing. If you have a piece that you're uncertain about, and you'd like people to comment on, or if you're masochistic enough to just read and comment without asking for criticism, please leave a note here.

Please don't be hurtful. People here know their writing has problems, they just don't know what or how to fix 'em. Please try to be specific. Just saying "that was good" or "that sucks" is not sufficiently precise. Please try to be constructive. Sometimes that's not possible, but it's always worth trying. Please accept diversity of opinion. If someone won't accept your criticism, let it go, don't insist on it. In other words, please treat the poor writer gently, so she can learn from you easily.

	* I'd really like to hear criticism of an old poem of mine, ThePlightOfBreakfast. Anyone who manages to struggle through that certainly deserves to have the favour returned. -- PeterMerel
