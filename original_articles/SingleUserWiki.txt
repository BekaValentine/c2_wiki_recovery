While the obvious win of WikiWikiWeb is the smooth group collaboration
it encourages, even inspires, the instant editing and linking of
the ideas one comes up with oneself (when one comment leads to a
handful of new terms) could be useful if extracted out as an
application of its own, perhaps with the ability to tie back in to an
existing Wiki (upload pages? merge?) -- MarkEichin

JimCoplien built a WikiWikiWeb "clone" that I have used in just that way.
There are some tricky parts in getting HTML and WikiWikiWeb syntax
working together that lead to some frustration, but it can be done.

If you're not insistent on HTML and in-line hypertext links,  emacs' info system supports the networked text, and, given editing privileges, yields a fairly nice implementation.  HyperCard and  Smalltalk systems also make such systems rather easy to construct. I've made such browsers with all three systems -- unfortunately none of them is currently available to me at work!  I'm using a clone of JimCoplien's system. -- JoeDavison

I feel the instant-hotlinks are an important feature. What I've done
so far is to implement a clone of Wiki based on what I remembered of
it's behaviour (Hmm, the idea of ForgetfulnessAsFilter...) in about
400 lines of perl, which I run as a local http server, and talk to
from emacs w3-mode. The database load and unload hooks let me move the
database between platforms with rdist. Yes, I'll be releasing it soon.

emacs texinfo isn't too bad but it doesn't self-organize very well,
there's too much syntax that the user needs to handle. (Hmm, perhaps I
could generate texinfo from a wiki database?)

There's a hp/lx palmtop html viewer, "HV", that might be a good start
for a hp/lx based wiki engine (it doesn't handle forms or anything,
but can handle page editing explicitly, which might be enough, if the
editor was a program that gave you the wikipage and generated the html
when you quit...)

I'm toying with the idea of building a TwentyDollarWikiDevice using a cheap Microcontroller plus some external memory. The problem is how to talk to it.
