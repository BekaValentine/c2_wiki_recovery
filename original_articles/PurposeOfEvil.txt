The PurposeOfEvil is the same as the PurposeOfParasites, it is a evolutionary successful strategy. Attaching the attribute "evil" is done by the ones being parasitized. Most of us would prefer not to call our own parasiting actions "evil", though they are of the same kind (e.g. humans are usually parasitizing on everything we eat). -- GunnarZarncke

* There was a man who kept warthogs because, he said, they made the flowers more beautiful.
I don't remember the source.
