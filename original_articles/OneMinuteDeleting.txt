''DeletionConventions:''
	* To permanently delete a page, replace its text with the word "delete". 
	* If you create an experimental page, please delete it. 
	* Any other page exists until someone else seconds the deletion. 
	* Unseconded deletions can be undone by using the EditCopy. 
	* Seconded deletions can usually be undone by using the HistoryPages (http://c2.com/wiki/history). 

'''Discussion'''

It should be sufficient to say that deletion is possible, and link to DeletionConventions and another page describing the method. Mentioning EditCopy and HistoryPages should be good to alleviate most newcomers' fears.
