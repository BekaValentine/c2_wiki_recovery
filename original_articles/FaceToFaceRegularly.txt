
One of the DistributedTeamPatterns.  

It's frequently useful to have selected team members (''not'' just managers) fly to each other's site to meet FaceToFaceRegularly.  This has the following advantages:

* Team members can get to know their colleauges better; rather than just being a voice on the phone or a face on the videoconference.  Neither can replace true FaceTime.

* Team members can learn about the environmental and work conditions at the other site.  Many "satellite" offices aren't as well equipped as the main office.


If you practice this pattern, a few recommendations.

* Travel should be bi-directional; not just the satellite offices visiting the home office (if such an arrangement exists).  

* Visiting workers should be provided with (workplace) accomodations similar to what other workers (of equal rank or station) at that site enjoy.  If the locals get a cubicle with their own phone line and desk, so should the visitors.  If, OTOH, all developers work at a common bench loaded with computers, so should the visitors.

* Respect the wishes of employees who prefer not to travel, especially to foreign countries.  Some folks are better dealing with CultureShock than others.
