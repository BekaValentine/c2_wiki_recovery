If you use your own design techniques (as opposed to standard techniques such as BoochMethod or ObjectModelNotation) then you probably improve that technique with every new project that you attempt.  Hence, your technique evolves. Documenting this evolution provides a PatternLanguage for deriving design techniques.  Documenting the actual design technique provides a PatternLanguage for itself. -- ToddCoram

EvolutionaryArchitecture can also refer to less ReflectiveTechniques, such as EvoFusion.
