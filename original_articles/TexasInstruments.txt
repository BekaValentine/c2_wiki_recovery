Texas Instruments is more colloquially known for it's calculators.  Middle-aged folk may remember TI for the TI/99-4A personal computer, which looked like a cross between an Apple IIe and an Atari game console.  It even used cartridges!

Texas Instruments also manufactured the TexasInstrumentsExplorer, a Lisp machine (http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/artificial.shtml).   There is a project (http://www.unlambda.com/lispm/) to build a software emulator for the Explorer.

First introduction to programming was on a brand-new TI-99!  What a rush, and what a blast...  They were so new at the time that I was able to talk-down the price at a major retail department-store chain (hard to do nowadays).
