I'm a Software Engineer, after some mid-career re-engineering, at AG Communication Systems. AGCS is a joint venture of Lucent and GTE. My team's product is a Unix based store and forward system for Central Office billing data.  It's been an OO-C++ development and gives a practical necessity to the various patterns and academic pursuits described on the wiki site.
