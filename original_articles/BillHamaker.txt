Describe BillHamaker here.

Bill Hamaker is the End User Computing manager at Marvin F. Poer & Company.   In practice that means I wear lots of hats including doing a lot of programming of custom in-house applications in Microsoft Access and Visual Basic.

I wrote an article on a customized data base query tool for the May 2004 Dr. Dobbs Journal.  If there are readers of that magazine here I would be interested on any comments about that article.

I can be reached at BillHamaker@mfpoer.com
