There seems to be two broad categories of serious Web users: those who save tons of bookmarks and those who don't. At one point in the early days of the Web I was in the former category, now I am in the latter. There are about five sites I go to regularly. Saving all those other links to sites that may have slightly interested me at some point that I will probably never go back to seems silly, possibly obsessive/compulsive. There are search engines for finding things again, and doing it that way will probably get you a more up-to-date selection of pages on the topic you are revisiting.

'''Other places to store bookmarks'''

* blogs
* browser history
* a PersonalWiki
* a Wiki HomePage
* a group bookmark site (e.g., DelIcioUs http://del.icio.us/)
* don't store 'em at all -- use a search engine

I (not the original poster) typically "blog" the links that I want to be able to track down again (usually reference links).  Apparently, most people think of blogging as an online diary, but it's never had that connotation for me.

The other nice thing about this method (aside from being able to get to the links from any browser) is that I am indirectly "voting" for these pages when Google spiders my site.
