The Boston Area Patterns Group hasn't met for a while. If there is enough interest we can start meeting again. 

'''Mailing List:'''
To keep posted on current plans, and to help in organizing the meetings, we set up a list. To subscribe send 
mailto:majordomo@world.std.com 
with a message body of
''subscribe boston-patterns''.

If you are interesting in meeting and/or helping organize a meeting, send a note to the list.

also, there is another group of people meeting to talk more about patterns in general than software patterns. See http://www.patternstudy.com/ for more info.
