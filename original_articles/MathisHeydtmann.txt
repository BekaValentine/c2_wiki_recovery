I am a physician working at the Birmingham Liver Unit (UK) and currently work on a project WickiLiver.

I am keen to share ideas on using Wicki in education (see wiki?WikiInEducation), contact me at mailto:m.heydtmann@bham.ac.uk.

The spelling Wiki is usual. If you have specific questions, we can help you more easily. If you are merely seeking to help others, further detail of your use of your wiki might well be interesting.
