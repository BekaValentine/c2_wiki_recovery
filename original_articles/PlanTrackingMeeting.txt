Project planning is relatively useless without periodic review of the progress against plan.  The plan tracking meeting characteristics will vary with the scale of the plan.

Small projects can meet frequently with the entire development team present.  Larger projects must send designated representatives to a tracking meeting that becomes then a meeting of managers.

At a larger scale the meeting may become a meeting of program managers from multiple companies or organizations.  When I was involved with the development of the LAMPS avionics system the MIC (Management Information Center) meetings held at the Naval Air Systems Command were attended by senior program managers from the airframe, avionics integration, Naval Laboratories, ... and on and on -- the meetings were weekly and structured around an Issue and Action list.  I found it to be very effective. --RaySchneider
