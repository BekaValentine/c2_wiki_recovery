"Agile development continues to gain traction in enterprise IT organizations, but myths and misconceptions slow the pace of acceptance and preclude the use of Agile methods in situations where they could otherwise add significant value. Part of the issue is the simplicity of its philosophy as stated in the AgileManifesto, which leaves plenty of room for (mis)interpretation and leads to myths such as Agile is anti-documentation. Other myths arise from misunderstandings of common AgilePractices."

"Executives, managers and practitioners familiar with traditional waterfall and RAD approaches are shocked to discover that cherished metrics and practices don't apply on Agile projects, leading to mistaken assumptions about the lack or inadequacy of project management, requirement management, quality assurance and other key project controls. Agile purists complete the picture through dogmatic pronouncements of what is and isn't truly Agile."

"The following article uses experiences from a highly successful large development project to debunk four common myths:
* Agile projects don't control scope
* Agile projects are difficult to manage
* Agile approaches don't scale
* Agile methods are just for programmers.
