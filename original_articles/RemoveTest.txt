Tests are only useful for catching bugs; once a bug is fixed, the test to catch it is no longer necessary (and thus can be removed).  This crucial ObfusificationIng step provides a development team with the following advantages:

''This is dumb, those tests are needed to prevent the bug from coming back. You don't remove them.'' [Uh, we know that. This page is intended as a joke.]
''The scary part is that it's all so realistic.''

* Reduces the overall test time needed to test the product, as superfluous tests are not run.
* Reduces the chance that a last-minute defect will be discovered, causing an unacceptable slip in the schedule.
* The CustomerQa department will happily inform you of any defects not uncovered by testing.

Some object to this KeyPracticeArea, stating that old test cases are still needed to catch regressions. Of course, it should be pointed out that competent engineers should never introduce regressions - keeping superfluous tests around encourages sloppy development practice while adding no real value.
