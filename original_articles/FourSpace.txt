FourSpace is a timeless mathematical void with four perpendicular spatial dimensions. Time is not an inherent consideration in FourSpace. To a first approximation, we live in ThreeSpace plus time, which is completely different. If an object moves around in FourSpace, then all the sudden you're implying FourSpace plus time. A slice of FourSpace has a three-dimensional boundary. Two such slices may intersect at a plane, or be parallel, or you have NonEuclideanGeometry.

Another conceptualization of 4-space (N-space) is GeneralizedBalancedTernary.
