Hey hey, you guys wrote the PythonRefactoringBrowser for PythonWorks, awesome! I'm dying to see how you did it, since I'm the guy who started and sometimes still works on the mostly defunct http://bicyclerepair.sourceforge.net/

I'd love to get into a discussion about AutomatedRefactoring with you guys. Would that be ok? --ShaeErisson
