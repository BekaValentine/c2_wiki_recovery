Web services company founded by LarryPage and SergeyBrin.

Google provides some nice services beyond basic GoogleSearch:

* GoogleNews - automatic gathered news service
* GoogleGroups - huge UseNet archive (former )
* GoogleDirectory - OpenDirectoryProject
* GoogleImage - image search. Unlike 3 nice features above, this is not so useful.
* GoogleAnswers - A pay research service where questions are answered by paid researchers
* GoogleSearchBox - search box in your IE toolbar
* GoogleLabs - http://labs.google.com/, several new Google technologies which are in the testing phase.
* GoogleCalculator - Do math or convert units. Just search for "2+3", "square root of pi" or "4 hectares in square fathoms"

One of their mottos is "Don't Be Evil", although many still think GoogleIsEvil.
