Andrew Hunt is a PragmaticProgrammer who enjoys trying to unravel the mysteries of writing good software.

DavidThomas and I wrote the book ''ThePragmaticProgrammer'' ISBN 0-201-61622-X, which contains some of the development patterns that we have found useful over the years. We've put some of these here on the Wiki (see PragmaticProgrammer for an index).

Current pet projects: adding DesignByContract to RubyLanguage to produce a quick and easy design prototyping tool.

Kudos on your two excellent books with DavidThomas! -- RobHarwood

See his latest, well received title: PracticesOfAnAgileDeveloper : Working in the Real World 

We've been real busy here at the Pragmatic Bookshelf getting new titles out the door, but I'm pleased to see the most recent book I co-authored, PracticesOfAnAgileDeveloper, is getting great reviews around the web, including a 9-horseshoe (out of 10) rating at Java Ranch.

It's especially great to see that programmers are enthusiastic about something other than the latest, greatest API or IDE.  Languages and frameworks come and go, but your habits--your practices--stay with you for your whole career.

I hope to announce my next book this summer: it's about the DreyfusModel, fine-tuning your thinking, and managing your ideas and insights. Stay tuned here for details, or check our my blog at http://toolshed.com/blog for my upcoming appearances, forthcoming books, and the occasional rant.

thanks!  /\ndy
