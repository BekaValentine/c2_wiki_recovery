''from his site ...''

"My day job used to be mozilla.org, but on April 1, 1999, I resigned from both mozilla.org and from (what is now known as) the Netscape division of America Online. I mention this so that you will understand that if you send me mail about Mozilla, Netscape, or anything even tangentially related to them, the chance that I will ignore you is high. Sorry, but it's time to move on. Try checking on the mozilla.org site for others who can help you."

Look to Jamie for original and/or strong opinions.

jwz's old "Java sucks" screed at http://www.jwz.org/doc/java.html illustrates a couple of things worth noticing:

* He is (or was) much more preoccupied with MicroOptimization than you might expect for an ex-LispLanguage programmer who hates CeeLanguage and CeePlusPlus
* He hated JavaLanguage before hating Java became popular :)

Some notable career events:

* In the early '90s, worked for LucidInc on GnuEmacs. Lucid soon forked off what is now XEmacs after a famous spat with the FreeSoftwareFoundation.
* Did the Unix version of NetscapeNavigator v. 1. Invented the word "Mozilla". Got rich.
* Publicized the WorseIsBetter section of RichardGabriel'''''s ''Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big'' talk. This took both the talk and the WorseIsBetter slogan from obscurity to fame.
** (It also created a misleading impression that the talk is simply anti-Unix, pro-Lisp polemic. In fact, it was received with stony silence and hostility by its original audience of Lispers.)
* Responsible for much of XScreenSaver.
* No longer does software for a living, now runs a San Francisco nightclub, DNA Lounge.
