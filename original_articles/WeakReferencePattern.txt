A WeakReferencePattern is a structural pattern used when decoupling of an observer (a view) from an observable (a container) is necessary. A WeakReferencePattern encapsulates a reference to an object. Acquiring the reference is done through a message to the WeakReference (or WeakPointer) object. If the referenced object still exists, a real reference to it is returned. This reference is, of course, a temporary one.

For a more detailed description read WeakPointer.
