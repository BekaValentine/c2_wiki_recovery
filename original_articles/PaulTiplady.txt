I'm a Principal Software Design Engineer with TRW Automotive in the UK.

I don't actually do software at the moment, cos I spend all my time looking for new (better) ways of doing it.  My problem, as I see it, is that most of the software guys out there are writing stuff to run on big computers with databases and GUIs and customers who have a reasonable idea of what they want.  In automotive, we have maybe 10k RAM (yes that's a k, not an M) and 256k ROM, and 5ms cycle times.  We have all the safety pressure of aerospace (but none of the time and money) and all the time-to-market and cost pressures of communications (without the ability to shrug off code failures as 'one of those things').
